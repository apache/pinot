Its kind of a Cannes tradition ; a celebrity attentionfest- that makes the Golden Globes look like an investiture ceremony at Buckingham palace yet somehow manages to keep- an air of superiority and a reputation as a curator of high cinema art . <p> Anyway , here 's Miss Marion , doing her duty as a Frenchwoman : <p> What with the sand and the sun , the paparazzi and the French movie star , the posing and the swanning about , youd almost think she was n't wearing something completely nutty .

On the latter point , there comes the realization that the plot will progress only in fits and starts ( and may even loop back on itself , to the point of forcing the viewer to sit through the second life-and-death checkers game in a row ) . Also , the show is an entity far more interested in presenting visual excitement than it is in progressing events . To sum up the plot of this episode is to talk in broad- generalities . A woman dies and goes to heaven . A goddess- gets her first kiss . A checker game is won and lost . Old lovers reconnect at the end of their lives . Fleeting , temporary- lovers pass each other , trading a bit of themselves along the way . A heist is planned and executed .

There 's a form to it and a sense of where it wants to go and what it wants to say . This episode gave us the sense that the full breadth of interactions with the gods was starting to form , allowing the viewer a sense of wonder and beauty to co-exist alongside the ominous , deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story . For every Bilquis there is a djinn ; for every Czernobog there is an Anubis ; for every unlucky Good Samaritan that crosses Mad Sweeneys path when he s without his good luck charm , there 's a doomed man getting a kiss from a pretty goddess , willing to pluck the very moon out of the sky to protect him . Doom and beauty coexist with the gods and they make every interaction with one tense and awe-inspiring . All of Shadows interactions with the gods have felt this way . Mr. Wednesday scares the hell out of him , but weaves such pretty sentences and does such fun tricks that he s irresistible . Zorya Vechernyaya reads his fortune . Mad Sweeney challenges him to a fight . The Technical Boy tries to kill him and Media tries to seduce him with promises of power .

Zorya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we winced when she kissed him . Beauty and doom , hand in hand . <p> This duality of doom and beauty was found in the story of Mrs. Fadil , who faces death and uncertainty , but still saw beauty in her journey . Anubis came to her as a solemn , but not at all unfriendly figure ; capable even of a genuine warmth and affection we had yet to see from any of the other god characters . The sequence offered little in the way of answers after all , you do n't  know where her path led or whether it was the right choice for her . But it was all so beautiful and peaceful ; such a relief to her that you could feel it yourself , in the " I hope this is what its really like when you die " sense .

" But if there 's an arc or progression to be found in this tale , its clearly Shadows journey from total lack of faith to total wonderment at the idea that he may have made a snowstorm just by thinking really hard about it . Wednesday has been slowly and methodically making his case to Shadow all along , and while all the interesting beings they met along the way certainly helped push Shadow along , in the end , what truly made him a believer was watching Wednesday pull off a brilliantly simple bank heist without even working up a sweat . For a former wannabe con man , it was like seeing the face of God for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sense of wonder I can make it snow and he can magically rob banks ! came crashing down to earth , as all interactions with the gods must .

Beauty and doom , hand in hand . <p> And finally , there was the scene that provoked the strongest feelings of all , even if the beauty vastly outweighed the doom , assuming you 're the type that thinks watching a man ejaculate into another one can be beautiful , of course . <p> As gay male TV reviewers whove been known to have sex with each other , we had a reaction to the Salim/Iffrit scene that were still trying to work our way through . It was shocking in its explicitness but it was beautiful in its intimacy and power . And at the- heart of our reactions to it , if were being honest with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of male-on-male sex , coupled with a completely unsubtle but nonetheless fantastical way of depicting male orgasm , would be met with jeers and revulsion . When the dominant culture rarely depicts your love life in anything approaching an emotionally , let alone physically realistic way , you find that fantastical depictions of it tend to raise your blood pressure and stress levels . Admittedly , part of this fear came from the shows depiction of heterosexual sex , which ended with poor Freddy Rumson getting eaten by a giant vagina . Since we were already treated to a scene of giant genitalia before the sex even started , we could n't even begin to fathom what horrors might be unleashed in the sex to come . These feelings were partially of the shows design ( which did treat the sex with an underlying sense of ominousness that eventually gave way to wonder ) and partially arose out of our own experiences and fears about how people view two men fucking .

@@40422245 @422245/ <p> Well come on , you guys . The way we 've been gushing about this show ? And the way we have a tendency to get obsessed with the costume design of the shows were gushing over ? This post was inevitable . <p> Were only two episodes into this series , so we could n't possibly engage in deep semiotic analysis of every thread and button at this stage . Then again , looking over what these characters have been clothed in so far , we may never have to . There 's a simplicity to the costume design of many of the gods , to the point of bordering on cliche . Costume designer- Suttirat Anne Larlarb has sketched the visual design of these characters in the broadest possible manner , which is fitting for beings who are primal and practically wish-based . There 's no need for gods to be complex . By their nature , they 're simple , basic and direct. - <p> Mr. Wednesday is always in tones of beige and white . The coat and occasional vest that he wears give him a sense of fading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found . He s smooth and unruffled , a dingy , fading traveler , but always rendered with an underlying sense of former greatness . <p> Bilquis is easily as direct and simplified in her clothing . Like Wednesday , she stays away from pattern and sticks to shades of red and brown-red consistently . Not only does it tie her to the room in which she 's worshipped , but also to the display case in which her former raiment is displayed . But more than either of those connections is the one to her own skin , which is often lit to have red undertones to it . Especially in the museum , she gives a sense of her own nakedness under the dress . The way she looks at her former costume tells you shed much rather be wearing jewels and receiving worshippers than wandering around in a dress , which is why its so plain and unadorned . Basically , its the equivalent of a t-shirt that reads " I 'd RATHER BE NAKED . " <p> Mad Sweeney has a similar sort of directness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from top to bottom . Compare him to the bar patrons in the background . He literally looks costume-y in comparison , with his cowboy shirt and suspenders . Again , there 's that sense of broad strokes . <p> The Zorya sisters are dressed in a total stereotype of how old Slavic or Polish- women dress- and we 'd wager you 'd be hard-pressed to find any of them dressed like this in 2017 . They look like illustrations in a fairy tale , which is as it should be . Note that Zorya Vechernyaya ( Cloris Leachman ) is dressed in lace to underline her aged appearance while Zorya Utrennyaya is dressed in a slightly more romantic floral . <p> Mr. Nancy is another of the old gods who closely adheres to the cultural dress of the people who worship him except in his case its a total anachronism and represents the culture of the descendants of the people who worship him . This is entirely appropriate given that his whole speech in this scene is about his vision of the future and the fate of the great-great grandchildren of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saxophone that underscores this scene , he s dressed like he stepped out of a Harlem nightclub circa 1947 . Note how , unlike the simple garments of Wednesday and Bilquis , or the basic cliches of Mad Sweeney and the Zoryas , Anansi is a wild clash of patterns and colors . That 's because , unlike the others , he s at the height of his power and full of rage , answering the desperate pleas of his enraptured followers . There 's no sense of fading grandeur here . <p> And of course , the colors of his ensemble are all picked up in the colors of his fur when he s in spider form . <p> Media , in her own way , is also very basic . If you 're a television god , you cant get more primal than the original queen of the form herself . And you cant get more basic in your depiction of Lucy Ricardo than to put her in a polka dot shirt dress . It does n't  matter whether Lucille Ball was known to wear this exact look on the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to note is how the polka dot motif ( picked up in her earrings ) mimics the millions of dots that make up pre-digital television broadcasts , which is the exact topic she uses to open the conversation . <p> Rewatch the scene and note how her eyes follow Shadow no matter which screen shes manifesting in . Its disconcerting , especially when you see two versions of her opposite each other looking in opposite directions but otherwise in perfect synch . Note also that when she starts speaking , all the other people in the other sets stop speaking . <p> And finally , there 's the Technical Boy , who 's a walking cliche of every snot-nosed hypebeast tech impresario who stumbled into billionaire-hood on an app and a lot of backstabbing . Like Media , he manifests with a complicated hairstyle , a lightly patterned costume ( plus-signs instead of dots ) , and a smoking apparatus in one hand . There 's nothing to draw from that , we think , except a broad similarity in their goals . Everything about his costume reads " obnoxious , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's exactly as it should be .

@@40422253 @422253/ <p> The gods of American Gods , old and new , have one thing in common with each other : they speak in vague generalities . Mr. Wednesday never answers a question with a direct answer . The Technical Boy spews anger and vitriol , but little of it makes sense outside his own head . Media is direct and straightforward , but its fairly clear she 's weaving a bit of a word spell when she speaks , hypnotizing and anesthetizing with her voice and image , in the manner of a television god . - Zorya Vechernyaya speaks in the foggy tones of a fortune teller. - Czernobog , in the bitter , rambling tones of a washed-up drunk . Bilquis barely speaks- and Zorya Utrennyaya does n't  speak at all . We half-wonder if deities , being composed of stories and allegories themselves , find it impossible to be specific in what they 're saying . Gods , it would seem , are indirect by their very nature . <p> Except for Anansi . What separates the West African/Caribbean trickster spider god from his cohorts at least in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is at least partially due to the nature of Anansi himself , a folk tale taken flesh through the power of the African oral storytelling tradition . That which is created solely through words becomes a wordsmith himself . But the real reason Anansi is so precise in his descriptions of three centuries of the African American historical experience is because that 's exactly what his power needed to be for his introduction to the audience . There is no drama- in a trickster god appearing to captured slaves , shrugging , and saying " That sucks . " But a trickster god bringing the full weight of a half-millennium- of subjugation down on- a ship of enslaved men by delineating not only what will happen to them , but what will happen to their descendants , for centuries to come ? That 's not just powerful , that 's devastating to watch . <p> " You all do n't  know you black yet . You think you just people . " <p> Attention must be paid to Orlando Jones , who was given a spectacularly written piece- and then did everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words , spitting out a vicious monologue of 300 years of African-American history set to a jazz beat . It was scene that took- your emotions and stomped on them repeatedly , with no thought of nuance or delicacy . You will sit there and you will be ravaged by the facts of history . This is why American Gods has the potential to be so much more than merely a tale of warring superhero teams dressed up in mythical finery . As we noted in last weeks review , like all myths , American Gods is- more about the people telling the story and the people hearing the story than it is about the people inside the story . And when the show cut directly from Anansis devastating truth-telling to the sight of a black man hanging from a tree while a literal river of blood flowed underneath him well . Let 's just say the point was not remotely subtle nor did it need to be . American Gods is about America first , gods second . In fact , the gods of the shows title basically serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a conduit to deeper truths . <p> Which brings us to our second sensory overload this episode , the introduction of Media , the god of screens and monitors . Gillian Anderson , like Orlando Jones , was given one hell of monologue about the nature of media and how the mindless worship of it has become " more powerful than lambs blood . " Like Jones , Anderson spun the words given to her like a web , mesmerizing- Shadow ( and , in turn , the audience ) by making him deeply uncomfortable . <p> " You ever want to see Lucys tits ? " <p> This was one of our favorite scenes of the series so far . Anderson looks and sounds amazing in it , but its the words that really make it powerful . Just as Anansi vilified centuries of colonialism and enslavement in a 5-minute speech , Media lays bare the mindlessness and submission of the modern American media audience .

" <p> Peter Stormare as Czernobog was not nearly as hypnotic , but that was probably by design . He s meant to be a repulsive boor of a character , so if his scenes and monologues tended to drag a bit or to bring the room down , they were probably working as intended .

Apparently , they float in space , orgasming forever . Its not what wed have picked for ourselves , but we suppose its a nice consolation prize for being vagina-eaten . Bilquis later visits a museum in a scene that indicates that she is a goddess of the Aksumite empire of Ethiopia and shows the kind of sadness a goddess feels when there is no one left to worship her . <p> Anyway , these are very rambling thoughts on our parts , but we think there 's no other way to talk about an episode like this one , which had very little plot and was almost entirely about scene-stealing introductions of seemingly major characters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given how its first couple of episodes have played out .

Whether its an extreme closeup of a pot of coffee boiling , or dandelion seeds turning into lightning bolts , or even Bob Dylan singing about a hard rain just as the scene shifts to show a mans hardon in all its glory , this is a show made by people who love the art of filmmaking and are doing their best to be witty in their words and jaw-dropping in their visuals . <p> American Gods is a show about American history , about what Americans find important in their lives , about the immigrant experience , and about the magic of stories and so far , its hitting all those beats flawlessly in its first two episodes .

Tom gave up halfway through the second season because he found the storylines tepid and he found the characterization of Frank and Claire Underwood to be so rooted in fantasy that it became difficult for him to buy into it . The fact of the matter is , most politicians and political operatives are NOT budding little supervillains but merely people who are highly focused on a few pet issues and agendas .

@@40422289 @422289/ <p> Let 's kick off the final Mad Style of Season six with a short , punchy , visual comparison loaded with meaning , shall we ? <p> The Persistence of Whitmanism : <p> Sallys story this season has been in large part about suffering under the weight of her family history and how she and Dick Whitman ( because it gets harder and harder to refer to him as Don Draper and have it feel truthful ) are more alike than either of them want to be true . Across decades and vast class differences , Janie Bryant found a way to signal that in their clothing . She is n't Sally Draper . She is n't even Sally Francis , or " Beth Francis , " the Betty-esque name on her fake I 'd . She can try on any persona or name she wants ( like someone else we know ) , but in the end , there 's no escaping who she really is . <p> Sally Whitman . <p> Onward : <p> Ever since the new D-less company logo was unveiled , orange and yellow have been exploding all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and that does tend to make a certain amount of real-world sense . But when they were pitching Fleischmanns margarine everyone was wearing yellow and when they were debating the merits of Sunkist vs . Ocean Spray , we saw an awful lot of reds vs. oranges . Janie does like to take whatever colors are important to the story at the moment and have them play out in the costumes . <p> So here 's sudden Company Man Stan , decked out in his finest , with a touch of SC&amp;P orange in his tie . Stans outfit is the first outfit this season that wed wear ourselves today . Its one of those rare moments where 1968-stylish and 2013-stylish mean the same thing . Its hard for a costume designer to do that . <p> On second thought , we do n't  think we could pull off a brown shirt paired with matching brown pants . <p> Margaret and Rogers outfits are heavy with black . You can tell who 's related to whom in these pictures . Also notable is that the only real colors in the exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been used as a color combination all season to signal a lack of connection among characters . If you 're new to Mad Style , we encourage you to scroll through the rest of the entries for this season in order to see examples of this color-combo motif playing out . They 're far too numerous to mention . <p> Bob and Joan are sporting the SC&amp;P logo colors of orange and yellow , while Roger remains a colorless figure , on the outside of this relationship , just as he s on the outside of any relationship with his daughter and her family . <p> That 's pure Mary Tyler Moore , circa 1970 , which makes it extremely of-the-moment . Once Megan learned not to be so timid ( for an actress ) in her style , her career took off . Shes by far the trendiest person who ever appeared in the story . She was dressing like Sharon Tate in 1968 and shell be dressing like Mary Tyler Moore in 1969 . She picks the very best , most iconic representations of the period , and tailors her style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all being decided upon by Janie Bryant , who costumed Betty like Grace Kelly at one time and Joan like Marilyn ( and then later , like Liz Taylor ) . <p> Company Man Bob was sporting orange in all his ties last week and yellow in all his ties this week . Roger is working a red , white and blue theme , which came up a couple times this episode . It tends to signal establishment power , as it does here , but its also historically accurate . Red , white , and blue became a persistent motif in fashion and design starting right around this time and lasting all the way through the seventies , fueled in no small part by a feeling that the country was falling apart , by the election of Nixon , who positioned himself as the man who was going to take back the country from the filthy people who stole it , and by the upcoming bicentennial celebrations in 1976 . <p> Ted is also in red , white and blue . Jim Cutlers grey suits and silver ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floats through the office like a ghost . <p> Just to answer the question of how deliberate color choices are , this scene is loaded with the same autumnal tones seen in the " present " day , even though Janie had no seasonal or story reasons to do so . Its not Thanksgiving in the Whershey Whorehouse . <p> All she needs is a pair of wings and a halo . To Don , Megan is eternally the angelic figure who 's going to save him from himself . <p> When shes not a whore , that is . <p> Clara demonstrates her company pride . Pete , notably , does not . <p> BAM . Miss Olsons not fooling around anymore . Shes never worn a skirt that short before and never shown that much ( if any ) cleavage before . Were reminded that Peggy is now the same age Joan was when the series started . <p> It should be noted that these are grownup clothes , for the most part . This is not youthful like something a 20-year-old would wear . In fact , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexy , of course ; and more youthful than anything , say , Joan would wear . But compare this to Megans mini-dresses of the past season . She and Peggy are about the same age , but Megan stepped right off a magazine cover in the trendiest clothes imaginable . The Zou Bisou dress , which is somewhat similar to this , was something Megan wore over two years ago . <p> Peggy wore this on a date with some guy who worked in finance , which should give you some idea of where a dress like this falls on the youth/trend scale . Picture what a 30-year-old female executive would wear today on a date to look sexy . <p> Harry is wearing an SC&amp;P company tie . Jim is in establishment red , white and blue a surprise , given his penchant for pale , ghostly looks . And Ted is wearing blue and green , which is another color combination motif this season ; one very persistently applied to people cheating or people dealing with the fallout of cheating . Again , if you 're new to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous entries for dozens of examples . <p> Look at that bright yellow car . Look at Bob , in his bright blue suit and yellow shirt . Look at all the Chevy execs , wearing either blue or yellow . Look at Pete , wearing neither of these colors . Bob is tied both to the product in the picture and to the executives of the company . Pete is quite clearly not tied to or connecting with anything here . <p> Women wearing pink nightgowns or bathrobes was yet another persistent motif this season ( again ; feel free to cycle through the Mad Styles and see the examples ) , and were fairly confident it was meant to call back to the woman who took Dons virginity while wearing a pink teddy . Betty looks pampered and mature and even a little silly here , while Megan serves as contrast in something boldly graphic , relatively simple in shape , and much more modern . <p> Animal prints are an extreme rarity for Joan . She prefers sticking with florals or solids . The most notable example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pete about the terms of her prostitution . Since that act ( and his apparent assent to it ) pretty much ended her relationship with Roger completely , we think the use of animal print here , in a scene where her resolve is thawing , is deliberate ; especially since a similar costuming move was made with Peggy this episode . <p> Caroline once again stands as an example of how some people simply do n't  keep up with the latest styles . Or even the semi-latest . Shell ditch the hat soon , but she could be wearing that coat for another ten years . <p> Dawn is in SC&amp;P yellow and orange . Even she 's a company girl now . <p> Shes definitely getting more stylish . Everything about this look is current , unlike many of her other outfits , which looked several years out of style . She keeps getting visually tied with Peggy , who wore a lot of plaids and a lot of yellow over the years , so much so that they both became her signature . We do n't  think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're both trailblazers in their own way , and they did it by sitting outside Dons office and doing their job to the best of their abilities . <p> We were very proud of our Mad Style minions for picking up almost immediately on the fact that this was the dress Peggy wore for her interview with Ted , which lends its use here some meaning and irony . In other words , like Joans animal print , this was Peggys " negotiating the terms " dress . Joans animal print ended her relationship with Roger and her re-use of it signaled her decision to let him back in her life . Here , Peggys dress is doing the opposite : putting an end to the relationship that started the first time she wore it . Both this dress and Joans animal print negotiating happened in the same episode last season , " The Other Woman . " <p> Interesting to note how much more cleavage shes showing in this dress than she was a couple years ago . Since we doubt Peggy has a sudden growth spurt in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately dressing more provocatively . You could say that all comes down to her affair with Ted , but we think it has more to do with her self-confidence and maturity . Shes just not that little Catholic schoolgirl anymore . <p> It should also be noted that clothes generally got a lot sexier post-Summer of Love . Not immediately , of course ; but the sexual revolution changed the way people thought about appropriate dressing ( See : the entirety of 1970s fashion ) . <p> We do n't  know if this indicates they have a future together , but its extremely notable that they match exactly , in shades of navy blue , grey , and white . Taken even further , her collar mimics his and her plaid pants mimic mens suiting . Does this mean these two crazy kids might make it ? Well only say this : we predicted right from the beginning of this season that not only would Peggy and Abe break up , but that they would break up over philosophical differences . And we did that solely by looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the pictures and tuning out the story , we see a couple here with a future together , more in tune with each other than they realize . <p> For comparison : <p> This is not a couple going in the same direction . Note that he s wearing blue and yellow here ; not connecting with anyone anymore . Completely free of all ties . <p> We think Ken Cosgrove and Bert Cooper are the only characters to not wear a turtleneck yet . It was the 1968 version of a pair of jeans ; something that any man of any age and shape could wear in a casual setting . <p> As we noted in our initial review , this scene calls back directly to the scene in the pilot , when Don came home to Betty and the kids . Trudys looking pretty 1968-stylish , in that married-lady kind of way . Shes always been a bright , good-girl in her style ; perkier than Betty ever was . Betty was the sorority girl who looked like a princess and waited for boys to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheered at football games and everyone wanted to know because she was so much fun . <p> This look , with her hair pulled back and softly curled , the pussy bow , the heavier eye-liner , its all very much of the period for the stylish , upper-middle class housewife . A sunnier , 1968 version of the dolled-up housewife drag Betty wore in Ossining . Once again , as in almost all her domestic scenes with Pete , she is in a print that fights with the prints and patterns around her ; an illustration of how Pete sees this irritating suburban-married world for which he was never suited . <p> Jim Cutlers groovy Thanksgiving day turtleneck is a thing to behold . Interesting to note that Roger and Bert look more like father and son here ; they 're dressed to match each other . Joan is wearing her " executive realness " suit , which we first saw her wear after the debacle with Scarlet and Harry , when she realized she had to put her secretarial mindset behind her and move forward . What makes this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office-specific Thanksgiving brooch . <p> Note that she does n't  wear it later : <p> Because she has a different Thanksgiving brooch for home . In fact , she changes her whole outfit , unlike Roger . Shes been working in product advertising for 15 years , which means shes probably worked every Thanksgiving day in that period ( because the following day is one of the biggest advertising and shopping days of the year ) . It makes perfect sense that she has a special " office brooch " for the holiday . That 's just so Joan . <p> Just as Peggys Polyester Pantsuit of POWER signaled a new day dawning for her , we tend to look at Joans dress here the same way . Granted , this is a hostess dress or a holiday dress , which she would consider to be something entirely different from a work dress . But everythings so much more relaxed here , from her hair to her breasts to her entire body , freed from the restricting foundation garments she still tends to wear in the office , signaling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside by entire generations of women in just a few years . Shes come fully into her own , both as an executive and in her relationship with Roger . Remember : Roger once gave her a caged bird to tell her just what he thought of her , back in the days when they only met in hotel rooms . The power has shifted completely , and now she 's the one setting the terms of when and how they meet . <p> But what about Bob ? <p> Ah , Bob . What would this season have been without you ? Matthew Weiner is still quite coyly claiming that he " does n't  know " if Bob is gay ( which is pure horseshit ; as if were supposed to believe he does n't  have all the characters completely mapped out ) , but they sure keep signaling it in various ways in the story . <p> There 's this ; a man in a frilly apron . Does that make him gay ? Of course not . Then there are the famous tiny little shorts . Do they make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore much smaller shorts back then . Then there 's the time he rescued Joan and took her to the emergency room . In that episode , there was a repeating motif of women trapped in rooms ( Dorothy in Petes apartment , Sylvia in the kinky hotel room ; Joan in her office , too embarrassed to let anyone know she was in pain ) . The women were all dressed in shades of yellow , except Joan . In her story , it was BOB who was dressed in yellow . Does that make him gay ? Again ; of course not . But there 's some very subtle costuming choices made with him that upend gender expectations or tend to make a modern audience think " gay " subconsciously ( as with the shorts ) . <p> Additionally , there 's Rogers open disbelief that Joan would ever be " buddies " with a man in the office , which is honestly a quite reasonable thing for Roger to question . The fact is , she does n't  have platonic friendships with men that involve spending holidays together or taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to believe that shed invite Roger to Thanksgiving dinner with a man from the office that she 's sleeping with . No , she and Bob are purely platonic , which serves as its own example that he s not straight . She cant allay Rogers jealousy by telling him that Bob is gay ( because Roger would probably fire him on the spot ) , which explains why she 's so evasive when she talks about him . <p> Further , there 's some subtle signalling in the dialogue that sounds like purely " culturally gay " conversation , from mentioning that Gail got her hair done to the good-natured teasing between him and Joan about how he s so skinny and she cant believe he s complaining that he gained weight ; pure " Gay and his " Fruit Fly ; " so much so , that Matthew Weiners either full of shit or there 's a deliberate attempt to throw the audience off and get us to believe he s gay when he s not . <p> We find that latter possibility extremely hard to swallow . Anythings possible with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretended to be attracted to Pete for some hidden reason , were going to call foul on that in a loud , obnoxious way . Its so NOT 1968 for a man to pretend to be gay . Its not even 2013 , for that matter . <p> Of course Bobs tie is SC&amp;P yellow and orange . <p> The Polyester Pantsuit of Power . A couple years ago , we were doing some hardcore research into the styles of the late 60s , because we knew big changes were coming on the Mad Men front once they passed 1966 and we needed to refresh our memories . Early 60s clothing is easier for us to discuss , but late 60s clothing requires some fairly precise knowledge of the time and the culture in order to understand how revolutionary it was and to place the sometimes difficult-to-look-at ( in the modern day ) styles in context . Our point is , we stumbled across a page filled with pictures of this suit and its many variants and immediately thought , " Thats how Peggy will dress in the 70s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress this way in the office , in the 60s . <p> As hard as this is to accept or believe , this is the trendiest thing Peggys ever worn . Not only that , its the most declarative , important thing she 's ever worn . We can not stress just how seismic it is for a woman to come into an office in 1968 wearing pants . Its only slightly less seismic than a man walking into his office job wearing a dress in 2013 . Shes actually a little ahead of her time here , and anyone who went through grade school in the 1970s has countless class pictures with smiling teachers wearing this exact outfit . Its HIDEOUS to most modern eyes , but it did become something of a standard for working women through to about 1975 or so . <p> Bear in mind that its Thanksgiving Day and the office is mostly empty . Shes not likely to get to keep this corner office and she 's not likely to continue to wear pants during work . But it is a HUGE signal of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the characters , is perfectly primed to not only inhabit , but to rule . This is her world and were all just living in it . You want proof ? Here ; check out the eerie ways in which Peggy Olsons ad campaigns are starting to come true : <p> Or it just made some cool visual callbacks and solidified the point that she 's rising while everyone else seems to be falling . Well go with that . But a super-powered , reality-altering Peggy in polyester pantsuits would be kind of fun for the final season . <p> And finally , a family portrait : <p> Honest to God , we cant even look at that shot of them all looking up at the house , looking so small and confused . For all the complaints of wheel spinning and bad pacing this season ( many of which we still hold to be valid ) , we cant deny that it all led up to one hell of an emotional sucker punch at the end . There 's no story quite like a child coming to an understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The child is father to the man , " as Peggy pointed out in her Chevy creative rap session , once again proving her creepy psychic Peggy power . <p> Okay , costuming : Can we just say that we know dozens of grown men who would kill for Bobby Drapers entire outfit here ? Should we admit that were two of them ? Seriously , the skinny green pants ? The little Chuck Taylors ? The cable knit sweater ? Its as 2013-trendy as Stan Rizzos outfit . <p> What 's interesting to note here is how the kids are all heavily tied together with the color red , but Don stands apart from them , a dark figure , consumed by his shadows and demons . The kid with the popsicle actually has more to do visually with the Draper kids than Don does . Of course the kid with the popsicle ( which references motherhood , as per Peggy Olson ) is really a Dick Whitman stand-in . Don is n't just saying " I grew up here .

So it makes sense theyd shock the hell out of us all during the penultimate show finale rather than the actual one . Pete is free of all family ties and exiled to California ; Ted is trying desperately to maintain his family ties by moving them all to California ; Megan reveals that she does n't  want to work on her failing marriage , essentially calls Dons kids crazy , and walks out the door to California ; after a full season of getting buffeted around by the whims of the men around her , Peggy winds up in the corner office , with all of SC&amp;Ps creative department under her feet ; and Don Draper is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whorehouse where he grew up , all of his demons having effectively destroyed his life . Never before have thes e characters all been so scattered and far apart from each other . Another " broken family " in a long line of them in Dons life . <p> The grand irony of Dick Whitmans long exile from the world and feverish need to cover up his true self is that his greatest fear of discovery turns out to be true : people abandon him the minute they find out who he is . Just as Betty walked out once she found out Don was n't , in fact , a football star who was angry at his father but instead simply poor white trash , the partners of SC&amp;P forced him out the minute he told them all about his Whershey Whorehouse antics . For a decade and a half , he s lived in mortal fear of being found out and it turns out all his fears were well-founded , from his perspective . Megans the only person who stayed with him after hearing the truth of him but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them to stay connected and with last nights angry monologue after finding out he screwed her over yet again , we find out that Megan is n't quite as committed to this marriage as she tries to appear . And yet despite all the unrelenting darkness of this season and the constant threat of abandonment hanging over his head , Don still tries to reach out ; to reveal a tiny little bit of himself to the people he s hurting the most . Don does , in fact , show a little bit of growth here . <p> EDITED TO ADD : Because several have misunderstood us here ; were not saying the partners ordered Don out because of his childhood or that Betty left him because he was n't a football player . Were saying that , from Dicks perspective , his greatest fears turned out to be true each time . <p> Sally obviously is the young woman most affected by Dons demons at the moment and just as we said in last weeks review , her attempts to run away from her father by embracing her mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard she tries to , she cant get away from her fathers influence . Like father , like daughter : they both spend the night " in jail " after getting drunk . Once again Matthew Weiner rests the entire emotional weight of a scene on Kiernan Shipka and once again , she knocks it out of the park . The look she gives Don at the end ; that look of understanding coupled with anger , compassion and suspicion ; almost had us bursting into tears , it was that effective . She may never forgive him for what he did , but there 's some small part of her that understands him better . But will she run away from it like so many do when they glimpse the truth of Don ? The show is deliciously ambiguous on that front . <p> Having said that , the ambiguity sometimes got a little annoying , if not downright insulting at times . Matthew Weiner says in a post-season interview conducted by Alan Sepinwall that not only did Joan land the Avon account , but that he assumes the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mad Mens writing and the problem that arises when subtlety and ambiguity are goals for the show : the writers sometimes lose track of what 's in their heads and what 's on the page . Were reminded of either the commentary track or the " Inside Mad Men " video on " My Old Kentucky Home , " where Matthew Weiner goes on and on about what Betty and Don are thinking as they kiss each other at the end of Rogers party ; important , insightful bits of character information that inform the scene and put it in context none of which appeared onscreen or would be knowable in any way by the audience . On the one hand , we appreciate a show that expects the audience to keep up and figure things out along the way without being spoonfed . On the other hand , the shows pacing problems grew to epidemic proportions this season and it seems to us we could have been spared 30 seconds of- Dick Whitmans Whorehouse Frolics in order to get one short line informing us that the most important and dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Similarly , it feels like entire scenes are missing from Petes story this episode as he went from threatening to destroy Bob for his mothers death to somewhat resignedly packing up his bags and moving to California . We get why he s off Chevy and we can even understand why hed choose to go to California , but there was nothing bridging those scenes to show us how he got to that point . Bob humiliated him in front of the Chevy execs and that 's why Pete backed down ? Okay , so it would have been impossible to prove that Manolo actually killed his mother or that Bob had anything at all to do with it , but it seems odd that Pete would just resign himself to that fact with little in the way of explanation . <p> Granted and were likely to get into trouble with this we believe Bob when he says he had nothing to do with Manolo and Dorothys fate . Literally every single thing Bob has ever done in this story was done to advance in his career or protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward any larger plan or scheme . To be honest , we find the whole Manolo thing kind of hokey and silly for this show . We said all along that Pete was right to fire him , since there always was a kind of legacy of gay gigolo types preying on socialites , but to have both Petes parents die in such dramatic and similar manners is one of the ways in which the show has lost some of its subtlety this season . We think the writers have been playing around with more soap opera-style arcs this season , using the framing device of Megans soap , " To Have and To Hold , " but even so ; an aging socialite who gets thrown off a cruise ship to her death by her gay Spanish gigolo husband does n't  sound remotely like a Mad Men plot to us . <p> On the other hand , were thrilled that Bob is still in the story , still gay ( and if you do n't  believe THAT , trust us ; this exchange between Joan and him : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is PURE Gay and his best Fruit Fly , as is , " Gail had her hair done for you ! " ) , and not quite the scary sociopath he sometimes came across as . Looking at it from his perspective , he was kind of right to humiliate Pete like that . Pete just told the Chevy execs that Bob was n't going to make it to dinner with them ; clearly signaling his intent to screw with Bobs status on the account . But Pete should have remembered the lesson he learned last week : you do n't  tangle with preternatural charmers like Bob Benson or Don Draper . Youd do best to either get out of their way or hang onto their coat tails . For a brief moment , it looked like Pete was going to do just that after last episode , but he could n't contain himself and Bob got him yanked off the account simply by smiling and handing him a set of keys . <p> As for Peggy , she 's HAD it . " Well are n't  you lucky , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's been her arc all season as shes wound up in a home and a job that she got pushed into by other men . And while she 's snarled and strained at her restraints all season , she never got that moment of freedom or self-actualization . That she 's now got the corner office to herself is thrilling , but as with so much on Mad Men , its likely to be illusory and fleeting . Shes not going to be made Creative Director , most likely . Its still 1968 and she 's still a woman , after all . Besides , slimy Duck was right on the scene already with Dons replacement . But seeing her behind Dons desk , looking out the window Draper-style , we can really see for the first time just how close Peggy is to realizing all her career dreams . That Stan was standing there to admire her for it gives a whole battalion of Stan+Peggy fans hope for a relationship between the two down the line . That SC&amp;P has been such a ridiculously volatile company in its short five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue to benefit her if she just keeps her head down and does the work like she always has . <p> Bullet time , because this is already going long : <p> Margaret Sterling Hargrove is a spoiled little bitch . <p> Roger indicated to Bob that he would do well to be a " family man " if he s going to handle the Chevy account , so we wonder if hell go the Sal Romano route and find some poor girl to marry him . We hope not , if only because its a storyline that 's been done . Its possible he could make a play for Joan , but it seems pretty clear to us that Joan knows he s gay , which makes it seem unlikely . On the other hand , we 'd love to see Roger Sterling try to tangle with him over Joans affections . Bobll find out quickly that Rogers no pushover like Pete . <p> By the way , is Bob the sole accounts man on Chevy now ? That 's a hell of a move up the ladder . <p> Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gold " playing in the seedy bar , echoing the same song playing in a more glamorous Mid-Century bar in the opening moments of the show , and Petes goodbye to Tammy , which was framed exactly the same way as Dons goodnight to his children . <p> Trudys sometimes portrayed as a supernaturally understanding wife figure and we have to admit , we had a hard time buying her kindness toward Pete this episode . He detonated their marriage in a pretty ugly way less than a year before . Shes a single mother in 1968 with the same upper-class expectations for her life that Betty Hofstadt once had . We like that they 're drawing distinctions between her and Betty ( who was consumed with rage for years following the divorce ) , but her calmness and kind looks were a little unsettling unless Pete and Trudy are n't  really done yet ( which we have to admit , is our hope ) . Petes a shit , but he deserves more happiness in his life . <p> For the first time , Betty openly expresses regret over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals a return to a relationship for them , but we do think she was only able to be that honest with him on the phone because theyd recently slept together again . We really felt for her when she said that no matter how hard she tries to steer Sally right , the bad always takes over the good in her . Shes her fathers daughter to a T. <p> The more we think about it , the more annoyed we are that Joans story this episode was all about reconciling with Roger , with not a word uttered about Avon . Shes more than who she 's slept or been romantically involved with , writers . Come on , now . <p> We think there 's something subtly interesting about Rogers reaction to Dons reveal ; a sense that he s both a little repulsed by Dons seedy upbringing and more than a little offended by the way in which he revealed it . He s been let down by someone he considered a friend ( in his narcissistic , Roger Sterling kind of way ) . <p> Also notable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the moment he and we realized he had no friends here . <p> Hamm knocked it out of the park with that anti-Carousel , anti-nostalgia Hersheys " pitch .

Will Don ditch everything to follow her to California ? Granted , he does n't  have much left to ditch . <p> How chilling was Randian Lion Bert Cooper in that partners meeting ?

@@40422337 @422337/ <p> Here we go , Miss Porter girls ; the penultimate " Mad Style " of season six . Grab yourself a refreshing glass of Tropicana and let 's get started . <p> Props and costuming wordlessly setting up the conflict to come in this episode ; orange vs. cranberry . Megans outfit is eye-popping , as so many of her outfits are , trendy , and clearly very expensive . Shes definitely dressing for success , because its not really a requirement for a working soap actress to show up on the set looking this dolled up . If anything , it would be more normal for her to be dressed down , since she has to get into makeup and costume at some point . Another subtle way of reinforcing how her marriage helps her career ; another subtle reason to tie her to Sharon Tate , who was largely considered to have received major benefits to her career by marrying Roman Polanski . But keep in mind what we said a couple weeks ago : Betty Draper used to be dressed like Grace Kelly because she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a glamorous international career to marry and have children . Joan used to reference Marilyn Monroe because she faced a world of men who could n't see past her breasts and she had to fight her whole life to be seen as more than her body . But Betty is n't likely to die in a car accident and Joan is n't likely to die of a pill overdose . Janie dresses some of the women in the show like the most desirable women of the period to draw parallels , not to predict their fates . <p> At a different point in the season , we would have made a bigger deal out of that red signaling Dons prostitution issues but we think that , for the moment , those issues have been shocked out of Dons system . Were not suggesting growth on his part ; just that at this particular moment , he understands how he screwed up and largely why he screwed up . In fact , its why he s punishing himself so hard here ; because its not something he can escape or wave away anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer his self-loathing to someone else . <p> Dons plaid bathrobe will do double-duty on the meaning front in a bit . For now , let 's look at Betty , whose clothes keep getting better each time we see her . Shell never be trendy again the way Megan is , but check out that hem . That may just be the shortest skirt we 've ever seen Betty Francis wear . But its still a respectable outfit ; perfectly appropriate for a Republican candidates wife , but with a little bit of style to it . Pat Nixon or Betty Ford might wear something like this on their best day . <p> Blue and yellow ; again in a scene signaling a lack of connection ; not between Betty and Don . They 're actually in a pretty good place right now . Its between Betty and Sally . Betty is n't connecting with her and thinks Sally is mad at her for some reason . The golden yellow here has a slight metallic quality and the wealthier women on the show have always been the ones who wore the metallics to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Megan , most often . <p> Persistent themes and motifs here : Two people in the Draper apartment , one dressed , the other undressed . Blue/green towel signaling adultery ( which is the cause of Dons misery in these scenes ) . With the cutting back and forth to Megan and Harry , you get both the " east coast vs. west coast " long-time Mad Men theme , but you also get the " cranberry vs. orange " short-term motif . <p> Well , what else would you put Harry in for a scene " on the coast , " where he tells Don Sunkists back in play ? He s not even inhabiting the same world as the other members of SC&amp;P and his costuming once again shows it . Like Abes costuming signaling much earlier in the season that not only was he going to leave Peggy , but he was going to leave her over differences in- philosophy , Harrys clothing this season has been signaling more and more that he ca n't stay in the corporate , NYC-based world of SC&amp;P much longer . Somethings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Sunkist deal really goes through , he will have even more leverage to ask for what he wants . Either he walks soon , or SC&amp;P opens a west coast branch . Given the major clients and accounts the newly merged company seems to be bringing in left and right , the latter option seems all but inevitable . <p> You could point out that Don and Megan are clearly the trendier couple here , and that Don in particular is mimicking costuming from Rosemarys Baby . You could also point out that they can afford to look more dressed-up and glamorous because they did n't  come from the office like Peggy and Ted here . What we liked about this foursome was the way Don was mimicking Ted so clearly , right down to the turtleneck and plaid jacket . That 's a signature Ted Chaough look and Don is standing there , wearing it in dark grey and black , like a figure of judgment against him . It works perfectly on a thematic level because this episode dealt both with doppelgangers and with Don punishing other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted , their color story is very murky . Blues , greens and yellows . Blue and green consistently signal adultery and blue and yellow somewhat less consistently signal a lack of connection . The murkiness in meaning here really works , since were still not entirely clear in this scene if this is a full-blown adulterous affair or merely an office infatuation . <p> Youve got ta give it to them ; they 're one hell of a good-looking couple . We do n't  think Megans clothes here owe much to Mia Farrows from Rosemarys Baby , but as she talked about how creepy she thought old apartments were , we got the sense that these two are meant to be seen as the post-war apartment building version of the Woodhouses , the young , glamorous good-looking couple of the movie . Theres been quite a bit of horror in this apartment building for the characters this season and just as in Rosemarys Baby ( spoilers ahead ) , a glamorous young womans - husband made a connection with a creepy older neighbor lady ( sorry ; we hate Sylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy the marriage . Its all quite ominous when you take the Rosemarys Baby framing and decide not to take it literally . <p> Of course the character of Guy Woodhouse in the movie was a struggling actor , and quite a few viewers this season seem to think Megans been having an affair for a while , so make of that what you will . <p> Again , blue/yellow playing out , this time in a corporate , Don vs . Ted scene . Remember , this motif started when the two agencies merged , giving it an undertone of representing each side of this new whole . It also tends to pop up in scenes where people are not connecting , confronting or being honest with each other , which also works as an interpretation here . Rogers all in blue , Teds all in yellow , and Dons in yellow and blue , giving the impression that he s somehow bridging a gap here , when in fact he s still waging war on Ted . He s just doing it under the guise of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colorless ensemble , surrounded by men in color , illustrating how inscrutable he is . And that wallpaper sure got a lot of meaningful play this season on the whole " orange vs. cranberry " theme . <p> You cant quite catch it in these shots , but Pete is wearing a red tie here , tying both these characters together . We do n't  think Petes ever had a secretary work for him as long as Clara has , which means the woman deserves some serious respect for putting up with THAT every day for the last 4 - years . <p> As we said last week , we feel a little bad for not highlighting more of Clara this season , since Janie Bryants really gone to town on her costuming , giving her the chance to be pretty much the trendiest out of all the secretaries we 've seen on this show . This is pure 1968 , Edwardian , **35;0;TOOLONG , and yet another example this season of the anti-establishment youth trends making their way directly into the establishment . We loved this look on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clara changes up her style . Shes clearly quite the clotheshorse . Not even Joan in her heyday seemed to have as many outfits and looks as Clara does . <p> And speaking of standing out , look who pops the brightest and takes all the focus in this scene : <p> None other than the madly fascinating Bob Benson , all done up in bright greens , blues and orange . He almost looks like a logo himself ; purely surface , advertising a false image to the world and masking it with bright , friendly tones . More things to note : All the other men , in comparison to Bob , could n't possibly be more establishment and corporate , all in shades of blue , grey , and black except Ken , who 's in similar ( albeit less bright ) tones as Bob , giving them a kind of solidarity here . <p> As we said in our initial review of this episode , our mistake in last weeks Mad Style was assuming that SC&amp;P had some bare-bones form of credentials-checking process . In retrospect , certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the idea of sending a deli tray to Mrs. Sterlings funeral . No upper-middle-class striver would make a tacky bungle like that . Having said that , we still stand by pretty much every other thing we wrote in our take on Bob ; that he s " culturally gay , " as opposed to the intensely-closeted Sal Romano , that the law and the culture of 1968 make it extremely unlikely that any non-gay man in a corporate setting would pretend to be gay , and that his feelings last week for Pete really were genuine which make even more sense now , given his class-based ambition . Its HILARIOUS to make this comparison , but the blue-blooded Peter Dyckman Campbell was essentially Bob Bensons Betty Hofstadt ; the person who was going to erase his humiliatingly low-class origins by loving him back and making him worthy of his aspirations , just like Betty did for slimy little Dick Whitman . <p> He s definitely a grifter in the Dick Whitman mold , but we still find it very hard to believe that he s working some form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of SC for a year now , seemingly only wanting to move up the ladder . And if this is some sort of elaborate , year-long scheme to somehow get a hold of the Dyckman family fortune , hed have to be the dumbest , least competent con man in the history of the game , considering there has n't  been a fortune for years and the " con " requires two people to work well-paying jobs for long periods of time . <p> Back to costuming : we 've noted before that Bob tends to wear pin-striped shirts under his suit . Combined with a striped , patterned tie , it gives him a buzzing , distracting quality in closeups ; too much pattern , a feeling of being slightly off . It would have been perfect if hed just been dressed in blue and green here , so we could point and call him a cheater and a liar , but that orange is distracting . <p> Blue and yellow tones in Bettys outfit as she tries to connect with the pretty much **28;37;TOOLONG Sally ; a light figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Co. have spent this season redeeming Betty from the damage their writing did to the character just after the divorce , in season four . Her anger was completely understandable at the time , but they oversold it with scenes of her slapping Sally across the face and firing Carla . She had reasons for those actions , but they werent tempered with any scenes to show a more well-rounded Betty . For a good while there , she was just shown as nasty and angry all the time . <p> We would n't claim her weight loss is solely the reason why she seems so much more centered , self-assured , and focused on being a good wife and mother now , but Betty only functions well when she 's got some self-confidence . When she loses it , she loses everything in her personality . Besides , we tend to think a combination of sessions with Sallys old therapist , countless Weight Watchers meetings , and a supportive , attentive husband worked to remake Betty into someone who knows herself pretty well , making her a better parent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , on a purely superficial level , its great to see Betty with her style mojo back , but on a much deeper one , its great to see Betty happy and self-assured in her life . Sure , she snipes at Sally all the time ( and Sally snipes right back ) , but how is that different from practically every **27;67;TOOLONG relationship ever ? <p> Were really starting to like Moira . Shes clearly very protective of Ted , the way a good secretary was required to be . And while we 've seen some slight prickliness coming from her this season , we appreciated the relatively tactful way she spoke of Ted and Peggys flirting and the way she immediately looked guilty for bringing it up . Again , Janie Bryant dresses her in clothes that draw attention to her in a scene , much like Clara , and Megan , back when she was a secretary . Background players do n't  get such focus-pulling clothes . Moira matters in the story . Whether that means a bigger role down the line , we cant say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world on Petes side , but that does n't  necessarily mean shell ever get a big storyline out of it . <p> What 's most interesting to us about the costuming here is that once again , a blue-yellow dominance is evident in the clothing of everyone in the room except for Peggy , who shows no traces of either color . In fact , she is almost colorless except for that focus-pulling , busy print bow . Shes not part of the color dynamic here because she is the person everyone in the scene is talking about or thinking about . This scene is about how everyone else in this scene is reacting to Peggy , who is an almost totally neutral figure , with the only visual interest being a buzzing mass of tumult right over her heart . <p> This is the third or fourth dress in exactly this shape and style shes worn this season . She wore a purple version when she found out about the merger , a blue version ( slightly different ; without a collar ) when she and Ted kissed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the movies with him . Its literally her Ted dress. - Its a trick she learned from Joan . When you find a dress that works for you , buy it in every color . <p> Were desperately trying to figure out Joans status at the moment because the show is frustratingly vague . Did Avon call ? Who can tell ? Shes certainly acting quite secretarial throughout the episode ; shepherding clients to and from the reception area , mentioning the cookies in the conference room , and getting defensive with Don when he questioned her hard on the budget for the St. Josephs ad . She clearly knows what 's going on with Peggy and Ted and , like Don , she 's not impressed with how they 're acting . She managed to carry on an affair with a partner that lasted over a decade and practically no one ever saw evidence of it in the office . Of course shed be a little annoyed with how Peggys acting . <p> She wore this suit the day of the merger , when she ushered Peggy to her new office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making the use of it here a little on the ironic side . Its also the outfit she wore when Bob Benson rescued her , making us wonder if she 's going to figure into whatevers going to happen next with him . <p> Its ENTIRELY too much to ask the writers of this , but please give Joan the Avon account and have her appoint Bob her backup . We want the quintessential gay/fruit fly relationship , dammit . It would be hilarious , the two of them jetting off to Avon headquarters together , laughing the whole way about what an asshole Pete is and how you should never , under any circumstances , fall for a partner . <p> We kinda thought this dress was a bit too short for Sally . Perfect for the time , but we would have thought Betty would insist on a slightly longer hem than that for this trip . Even so , she 's the height of the good little preppy girl . The lady from Miss Porters has a pleated skirt , which is a slightly unusual detail for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preppy that suits the scene . Her autumnal shades speak of back-to-school and serve as a counterpoint to Bettys creamy pastels and Sallys dark blue plaid . <p> Josephine clearly does not care to dress Dorothy up like a drag queen , the way Manolo did . It should be noted that , while Dorothy is considerably less glamorous than she appeared last week , Josephine did in fact dress her far more appropriately for her station and even her personality . That 's why her Manolo ensembles were so hilarious ; because they were so over-the-top they bordered on inappropriate . <p> We do n't  pretend to have any advanced knowledge of elderly dementia , but we think the show does a very good job of portraying it in shades . Dorothys not a drooling idiot or raving lunatic . Her grasp on reality may not be as tight as was , but she has her moments of lucidity and even gets in a good line every now and then at Petes expense . In a weird , highly dysfunctional way , we thought this scene showed the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snapshot of a perfectly art-directed teenage girls room in 1968 ; from the heavy floral motif , to the butterflies , to the inspirational posters , to the puppies on the mantel and the Snoopy on the windowsill , its all very much of its time . - A " What if the Brady girls were rich east coast bitches ? " kind of thing . <p> Sally and the blonde are connected through their preppy plaids . They 're the ones who stay with the boys . The blonde and the other girl are connected through color . They 're the ones who belong here . <p> Glen and Rolo are two privileged east coast prepsters dabbling in counter-culture styles , but its all a put-on . Once they take their jackets off , they 're pretty much as preppy and establishment as any two teenagers could be at the time , even with the pot and the ugly toe-sandals Rolo brought to the party : <p> Tons of preppy plaids here . <p> Theyll both be in fraternities by 1972 and on the executive track by 1976 ; count on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Vietnam . <p> There was vigorous disagreement as to our take on this scene , but having watched it six times now , were standing by it . Rolo was a jerk and Sally absolutely should have put a stop to him , but when she told Glen he tried to force her , she was definitely- exaggerating . Once Sally said no and stood up , he stayed there on the floor , insulting her . Even when Glen came out , he stayed on the floor and called her a tease . A privileged dick of a teenage boy who needed to be put in his place , yes . Someone who was attempting to rape Sally , no . And she knew that . These scenes were about the many ways in which she 's trying to get away from her fathers influence by embracing her mothers desires for her , but she keeps demonstrating the falseness of the statement " My father never gave me anything . " From her blue plaid to her smoking and drinking to the need to punish someone else , Sallys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she ever wants to be . <p> Note that Rolo is wearing a black turtleneck , just like Don , the man Sally really wants to punish . Stand-ins within stand-ins in this story . <p> Peggy wore this suit in the first episode of the season , when she was dealing with the headphone client who was scared about the ear jokes made on Johnny Carson . So on that level , we can say its her " dealing with a difficult client " suit . But were kind of thrilled , because we picked up on the very persistent blue and green motif right at the beginning , with this suit ( " Peggy wears a lot of blues and greens in this episode , possibly signaling a new set of power colors to replace her old , mid-Century , mustard yellow power color . The blue-and-green color combo was extremely popular during this colorful period , as was the pink-and-orange one . They come back in and out of style , but they 're fairly strongly identified with the late sixties . " ) - We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to go this season , but we love that we noted it so early . <p> Put her next to Ted , also done up in blue and green , and the adultery motif gets even stronger . Its notable here that Don is only in gray and black ; a figure of judgment , just like the grey and black he wore in the movie theater . Joan also stands out boldly , as one of the few observers in the room who knows exactly what everyone is talking about . <p> Bob is wearing a second orange , green and blue tie and we think we know why with this scene . Ever the company man ( on the surface at least ) , he s deliberately working the orange from the new SC&amp;P logo ( seen on his coffee cup , because coffee cups are practically totems to Bob Benson ) in to his outfits , trying to sell that image even harder . Its an example of why Pete surrendered to him here . Bobs a charmer on a world-class level , right up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't win fighting someone like that . The partners all but told him theyd take him off Chevy he tried to take Bob off it . What Pete did here was ensure that he has a subservient ally on his side . We think the potential for this relationship is enormous . We hope they do n't  write Bob out after this season . A gay ( or at the very least , not entirely heterosexual ) Dick Whitman as Pete Campbells bitch is one of the best new ideas to come to the show since Lane Pryce fired the partners . As long as Pete does n't  mistreat Bob ( which is not assured at all ) , this could do them both a ton of good in their careers . <p> Notable here that Pete is essentially wearing a prep school tie , speaking to the massive class differences between the two men . Bobs also jacket-less , which gives him a sense of being without his armor . The only other time we can remember him not wearing a jacket is when he encountered Jim Cutler in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the upper hand on him . <p> And finally : <p> Betty got what she always wanted ; a daughter just like her , right down to the complementary blue tones and the smoking . We wonder if she 's going to press the issue with Sally , since its clear she knows there 's something going on between her and Don . That 's a look of motherly concern , but she may just want to leave it be , since whatever it is that happened gave her the perfect daughter in the end .

However , ticket sales are n't  an indicator of quality , alas , and this flick had more than its share of problems , which Tom ( who is recovering nicely from his dental surgery of last week , but will force you all to listen to his poorly formed " s " sounds because of the retainer he s forced to wear for the moment ) lovingly points out for you all .

@@40422385 @422385/ <p> Human-shaped basket of kittens Melissa Benoist took her show Supergirl from the far-off and scary lands of network television , where it never quite found its footing , to The CW , home of angsty , pretty , twenty-something people with superpowers and extravagant problems . And right out of the gate , its obvious that the teamup of show and network is a good fit . Everything- suddenly feels a bit more " right " for a show called Supergirl . We think it was when they did the super-powered version of the " trying on clothes before a date " montage that Tom turned to Lorenzo and said , " Our girl is home . " Only The CW and Benoist herself could make such a silly and cliched scene work . The CBS house style did n't  seem like a good fit for that kind of light heartedness . <p> Our interest in the first season of Supergirl fizzled out about halfway through and to be honest , were not even sure we could articulate why , except that feeling that it was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and as we noted , Benoist is more or less flawless in a role that calls for sweetness over muscle-flexing and posturing . Show runner Greg Berlanti has had great success translating superhero characters to television , with Arrow , The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow all minor to semi-major successes for The CW . The question of whether CBS was a good fit for a formula that worked extremely well at The CW , which has a much younger demographic , was practically built into the shows DNA at the start . There was plenty about the first season that charmed us not just Benoist as Supergirl/Kara , but Calista Flockhart as mentor/Miranda Priestley stand-in Cat Grant , Chyler Leigh , who manages to keep a lot of the silliness of the show emotionally grounded as Karas sister Alex and Jeremy Jordan as permanently friend-zoned Winn . But there was too much of a feeling that we were watching a semi-typical ( except for the super-powered girl in the cheerleader costume ) CBS procedural drama with a bit of workplace and light romantic undertones . Every episode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodrama and villainy , it tended to feel- tacked-on and perfunctory . <p> Contrast that sense with the scenes of Supergirl and brand new special guest star Superman , doing their heroic bit and saving that space shuttle whatchamathingy in last nights episode . Pure , joyous , old school superheroics . This is what the show always lacked and what the other CW superhero shows tended to have in spades from the beginning : a sense of old school heroism and adventure , coupled with a bit of angsty young adult soap opera antics . That 's what a Supergirl show should be , not a criminal investigation procedural or a workplace drama , but the adventures of a young , female superhero and the classic story of how she tries to juggle that with her attempts to make a life for herself . Benoist was always up to the job , but with this opening episode , it now feels like the rest of the show is too . <p> Tyler Hoechlin is a delight as Superman , returning the character to its charming , Boy Scout-esque , Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering through Henry Cavills mopey , self-absorbed version of the character . Even better , his- presence in the story has n't  done a thing to take away from the obvious fact that Supergirl is the star and lead character . Even their superheroing scenes together had a refreshingly equitable feel to it , with neither character treating the other like the one in charge . Shes not his sidekick , as the show makes clear over and over again , but the cousin who changed his diapers back on their home planet . Its a smart take and does nothing to dampen the shows clear attempts to position its story toward a female audience and keep it focused on a female characters point of view . <p> There 's some shuffling of chairs as certain characters and story elements experience the kind of rapid shifts that can only come when a show overhauls itself for a new season . Winn works for the DEO , which only makes sense , although it might tend to render him indistinguishable from The Flashs Cisco Ramone . Kara breaks things off with James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it was abrupt , we cant say were sorry about it . He s dull . Cat seems to have made some life-changing decision , which will no doubt be a reflection of Calista Flockharts refusal to follow the show full time into its Canada-based production . Superman says he s going to stick around for a while , which seems like a fun idea but could get old quickly . A lot of that will depend on Hoechlin , who has great chemistry with Benoist so far . In fact , he appears to be taking a lot of his cues from her . And the DEO gets a brighter , shinier headquarters , which were probably cheaper for the show somehow , but has the added benefit of- taking- it away from the " NCIS " look of last season . <p> We cant predict a perfect season or even that the energy of this past episode will continue forward to the next one , but for now at least , were happy to see that the character is living in the right house and seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to speak .

@@40422392 @422392/ <p> Let 's start with this first : We did n't  like this at all . In fact , we spent the hour smirking and rolling our eyes at all of the silliness . First , at the clear fact that this show was a mashup of Greys Anatomy , How to Get Away with Murder and a tiny soup+on of Homeland . Then , our eyes continued to roll at the cast of characters , most of whom are FBI trainees who look like models or worse , like TV actors . Our eyes continued to roll through every ridiculous twist and turn right up to the denouement that had our heroine escaping from federal custody in a city on lockdown after the worst terrorist attack since 9/11 . <p> But here 's the thing : It seems we might be the cheese that stands alone on this one because this show got pretty great buzz ahead of time and the critical consensus was that this was a fun , if silly , debut .

Certainly , the lead , Priyanka Chopra , is a stunningly gorgeous and charismatic actress ( with a Bollywood resume- as long as your arm ) . And we were never the types to complain too much about being forced to look at pretty people on our TV , especially if half the pretty people are of the penisd variety . <p> But if you 've read our American Horror Story or How to Get Away with Murder reviews , you know that we just do n't  have a lot of patience anymore for shows so loaded down with ridiculous plot twists and moments meant to shock that an interesting story or engaging cast are concepts that get thrown to the wayside all too quickly and easily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch than at any other time in the mediums history . That kind of intense competition could be seen as a great thing , but when we look at a show as derivative as this one ( the swoosh effect for the flashforward is identical to the HTGAWM one ) , which sends the message loud and clear that it has no intention to do anything but titillate and shock ( our heroine wakes up in the smoking crater of a NYC landmark after a terrorist attack AND engages in a modified reverse cowgirl with a total stranger in his car ) , we tend to start thinking the plethora of new TV just means a lot of bland ripoffs with a need to provide water cooler moments over narrative . Its stale , derivative fluff , from what we can see . <p> So yeah , we feel like the grumpy-grumps on the outside of this one .

Fred continues on without her : <p> There 's a lot of reasons we do n't  like this number . First , Fred was always much better with a partner ; second , it was of a piece with a trend in musicals that he and Gene Kelly started where they would try to one-up each other by doing these gimmicky dances ( like dancing with a cartoon character or a mop or a sheet of newspaper or on a ceiling ) and after a while it just gets old .

Anyway , after the dance , Freds all " Hey , maybe we should - " and Gingers all " Not a chance in hell , asshole . " On Gingers opening night , Fred toasts to her success with Oscar and some other blonde in a vagina hat . Unfortunately she sucks .

Ginger figures it all out and strings Fred along for awhile . She shows up at their apartment that night in a dress clearly made for ballroom dancing , but Fred does n't  get the hint .

@@40422420 @422420/ <p> Mr. Robot went from being a very good show with a lot of promise to be great in season one to a just-okay- show that still has a chance to become good in season two . And its all because show creator Sam Esmail focused way too much on what made the show so buzz-worthy last season without focusing enough on telling a story . <p> The Number One problem with the show right now is that it relies far- too much on the unreliable narrator trope to keep things interesting . That does n't  strike us as enough of a hook to keep the viewer invested , especially since it was revealed long ago how unreliable Elliot is . The theory that he- was actually in an institutional setting and not his mothers home was figured out by many viewers and reviewers in the very first episode of the season . Had we all never seen the show before , last nights rug-pull might have seemed shocking or exciting , but the show waited way too long to do the reveal and it seemed unaware of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the viewership was n't particularly surprised- to find out- that Mr. Robot was inside Elliotts head . Everyone figured that part out . The true shock of the season came when we found out Darlene was his sister . Its possible there will be yet another shocking , " Everything you thought you knew was WRONG " twist that will wind up being a true surprise to the audience , but if they do that , then we reserve the right to say that they 're officially spinning their wheels . <p> Now , we celebrated that same unreliable- nature when we reviewed the season 2 premiere , writing : <p> " It 's the very nature of reality that ca n't be trusted . You literally never know if what you 're seeing is what you 're actually seeing- Mr. Robot keeps you confused so you can not just feel what Elliot is feeling , but actually live inside his head with him . With Mr. Robot , you 're not a confused audience member , you 're a confused person inside the protagonist 's brain " and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the story . " <p> But as last night demonstrated quite effectively , were really not in the story . Were looking at it from outside ; at the mercy of whatever Elliott tells us . And as we found out with this episode , Elliott lies to us . <p> And while the transition from lie- to reality was well handled ( which is n't surprising , because Esmails mastery of the technical aspects of visual storytelling is at Hitchcock levels ) , its less an " Oh , wow " moment than a " Wait , what ? " one . We suppose many of the details will be filled in going forward , but its extremely unclear how that thing with Ray even went down . How did Ray approach him ? Where was all of this taking place ? How did Elliott rat him out ? Maybe these questions wont be answered at all . Maybe none of that stuff with Ray really matters to the story overall . It certainly never felt like it mattered while it was going on . <p> There 's a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and just move forward , but theyve painted themselves into a storytelling corner , so to speak . If the show moves forward and assumes that the viewer can fill in the blanks on everything that occurred with Elliott for the past six episodes , then weve really had our time wasted on a lot of nonsense and misdirection . On the other hand , if they spend too much time filling in the blanks of the past 6 episodes , the narrative is going to be stuck in an ourobouros of self-referentiality. - The options for storytelling going forward are to leave everything that happened maddeningly ( and almost irresponsibly ) vague and unexplained or to become so stuck in a self-referential loop as to stop being about anything at all . What is Mr. Robot about ? Its about how hard it is to figure out what Mr.Robots about . <p> In fact , even the non-Elliott parts of the story which have been the best parts of this season by far are showing significant strain from all this narrative vagueness . Esmails great at setting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this episode were so gorgeous as to be almost distracting ) , but he sure does n't  have time for the details of the story . And he s far too confident of that audiences patience . He seems to think it was a good idea to separate Elliott from all the action and most of the players in the story for most of this season , but it really was n't . Its been very frustrating watching the story fail to unfold week in and week out . Especially when so much of it strains credulity . <p> Darlenes group has been staying in that E Corp counsels townhouse for how long now ? Because several weeks at least have passed since the season started . How does that make any sense ? Why would that woman just abandon her house for weeks at a time without checking in on it ? Do n't  even get us started on how F Society dropped the balls , so to speak . Its a great visual to see a pair of giant metal bull testicles crash through the skylight of the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start thinking about it . How did this rag-tag group of hackers manage to climb on top of the Capitol building without being detected ? How did they manage to escape without being caught ? To not even spend a second of the storytelling explaining these things is sloppy and vague in the extreme . Its asking way too much of the viewership to fill in or ignore details like that . But Esmail seems far less interested in details , preferring to put all his work into the expressiveness and mood of the pieces . And while well never stop praising him on his meticulous technical skills , there 's something very off-putting about pairing that overly precise filmmaking with such vague and sloppy storytelling . <p> Having said all that , the scenes with Angela remain more engrossing than ever . Portia Doubleday is the MVP of this season and she 's doing incredible work with this character . Like virtually all the characters , its almost impossible to figure out what she 's thinking or what she 's trying to do , but unlike Elliot , who cant be relied on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from plan to plan , watching Angelas cooly impassive face or listening to her meticulously consider every single word she 's about to say before she says them makes for a fascinating character study . In addition , to our surprise , Grace Gummers giving the performance of her career as the shrewd and unflappable Agent Dipierro . If the season spent more time on these two women right now , we would n't complain . But that would n't solve the shows real problems . Esmail really needs to pull this narrative together tightly before the season finale . If it continues on this vague and meandering path ( What exactly is the point of spending so much time with Joanna Tyrell ? ) , we predict he s going to lose a significant amount of the audience by the time the just-confirmed season three rolls around .

You might forget that once we get into the nitpicking of what didnt- work for us , of which there is a considerable amount . Bottom line , before we get started : Stranger Things is a light summer diversion that pays homage- to horror and sci-fi films of the early 1980s , with special slavish attention to the kings of nerdy pop culture of the period , The Two Steves ( Spielberg and King ) . It- never truly gets as scary as it should , nor does it string you along breathlessly , but its well-crafted and there are times that it makes you care a great deal about the characters .

A big " YES " to that. - Does it have a whole range of flaws , some minor and some extremely glaring ? Also a big " YES .

For such homages to work , you have to have something you want to say about whatever it is you 're referencing. - Certainly , the argument could be made that a prestige period drama like Mad Men ( created by Matthew Weiner , who had no first-hand memories of the decade in which its set ) owed as much of its aesthetic to the films , advertisements and TV series of the period as it did to the idea of historical accuracy . But Mad Men actually played around with that imagery . The Marilyn-esque sexpot got raped and found feminism . The perfect nuclear family of the Drapers who were straight out of a Coke commercial of the period was loaded with rot and built on lies . The plucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect rendition of a particular slice of the 1960s and then told you all the ways in which it was false or more nuanced than you knew . With Stranger Things , there 's no attempt to make a comment about the period , only a clearly considerable effort- to accurately recreating one particular aspect of it . It looks just like 1983 ( for the most part ; the teenagers costumes were way off ) but it does n't  seem to have anything to say about it except for maybe " There sure were some cool movies back then , right ? " <p> When Spielberg showed a frazzled single mother and her sometimes unruly and foul-mouthed children , he was trying , for good or for i 'll , to work through his own feelings about fatherhood and what that role meant to families . When teenagers have sex in an 80s slasher film and then get impaled to death , for good or for i 'll , something is being said about the filmmakers feelings about sex in the age of AIDS or about his fear of women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , but strips them of their underlying meanings in the retelling. - Stephen King infamously explored the sexual awakening of kids entering puberty- in It , but in Stranger Things , all effort is made to circumvent the concept , even when its staring the viewer in the face . A group of just barely pre-pubescent boys hiding a mute girl in one of their basements and dressing her up in wigs and makeup ( when they 're not yelling at her and calling her a liar ) that 's an idea with implications that- should probably be explored a bit more , rather than glossed over. - But in 1983 , filmmakers werent exploring those issues , so the series does n't  either . Quite a bit is made of one teenage girls sexual awakening , which tends to go wrong in practically every way you could imagine , but virtually no attempt is made to get inside her head and have her react to the events around her in a way that makes sense . Without giving too much away , shes given a very John Hughes-esque , 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that practically begs for a bit of 2016 spin on it , given how it deals directly with issues of consent and slut-shaming . But no such introspection is offered. - There is , to be blunt , not one thing new about the story and not one spin put on the tale to give it a modern point of view . Its 1983 at the multiplex and that 's it . <p> But this does not take away from the fact that the pop culture references and homages are , at first , a lot of fun . And wed be remiss if we did n't  point out that at about the halfway point , the story kicks into high gear and the number of homages per episode goes way down . While the story beats tend to play out with few surprises and the series goes exactly where you 'd expect it to go after the first episode , its very well told from a technical perspective . Its practically impossible not to get sucked in , given how much mood is injected into every shot . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent performances : Winona Ryder in a thankless role as a near-crazed mother whose best and most important scenes all take place with nothing else but inanimate objects , David Harbour as the sheriff with a personal tragedy that parallels the main story , giving him a heavy weight he visibly carries in every scene , and Millie Bobby Brown , who anchors the entire series with an astonishingly nuanced performance that manages to tease something delicate and interesting out of a very cliched character . <p> But take any of our criticisms- with the following massive grain of salt : We finished the entire 8 hours in the space of one weekend and Lorenzo binge-watched the entire series in only two sittings . Whatever complaints or criticisms we 've expressed should at least be put in that context. - Basically , we just spent 1500 words to say what 's expressed in the title of this post . Stranger Things is flawed but fun .

@@40422502 @422502/ <p> We admit it ; were impressed . Season seven may have been one of the least consistent , most frustrating seasons of Nu Who , but at least it ended really , really well ; so well , in fact , that wed call this one of the very best episodes of the relaunched series . <p> But let 's backtrack , because we stopped reviewing the show shortly after it came back from its hiatus and we should probably explain why . Long story short : we werent happy . The first half of season 7 had its problems ( not the least of which was the ill-thought-out manner of dispatching the Pond-Williamses ) , but the second half of the season went completely off the rails . There was far too much repetition , far too much bombast , and far too little explaining to the audience what the hell was going on . We were actually angry when we got to the end of the Neil Gaiman-scripted episode " Nightmare in Silver , " an episode that seemed to consist of nothing more than a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we realized there was a great story there and even some great scenes with crackling or poignant dialogue . The problem and this has been a general problem for the last 6 episodes or so was that a 90 minute or even two-hour story was being crammed into 60 minutes , including commercials . Which means exposition got glossed over or spoken so rapidly that no one could possibly make sense of it and entire bridge scenes were missing , leaving us with a very jerky story told in rapid , barking shouts . <p> Even worse , we were presented with this " impossible girl , " storyline , which not only felt like warmed-over Amy Pond , it actually wound up being a much less impressively told tale in comparison to Amys . The " mystery " of Amys existence ( as well as Rivers ) was a storyline that played out over many episodes , spanning multiple seasons . After the initial presentation of the " multiple Claras " conceit , we literally got no more information on the topic , in order to further the mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of scenes of the Doctor , yelling , in effect , " WHO ARE YOU , YOU IMPOSSIBLE GIRL ? ! ? ! ?

In typing the following sentence , were just now realizing how difficult it must be to write a good Doctor Who story . This one worked because it had the best balance of adventure , pathos , humor , and darkness that defines the very best Who stories . <p> For the first time in a while , it really felt like the stakes were high . Were used to Moffat setting up big stories that tend to fizzle out , but this one did n't  .

" Silence will fall when the Doctor is asked the one question that should n't be asked , in the one place where no false word can be uttered . " That all turned out to be exactly true , although not in the way that anyone expected . It turns out the Silence actually had a good reason to stop the Doctor before he got to Trenzalore ; because once he goes there , the prophecy is fulfilled and dozens of worlds and trillions of people will wink out of existence . In other words , the Silence was n't trying to kill the Doctor in order to stop him from doing good . The Silence was trying to kill him in order to preserve all the good hed done . That 's quite a lovely twist , actually . <p> But the biggest , best fakeout of all was saved for the very end .

The name of the Doctor was merely a key used to open a door to destruction , which is why it had any power at all .

" <p> " But not in- THE NAME OF THE DOCTOR . " <p> Oh you clever boy , Steven Moffat . " The Name of the Doctor " does n't  refer just to his actual name . Its about the meaning and philosophy of the Doctor ; the promise of the Doctor . Which is why our Doctor refers to the other one as , " the one who broke the promise .

The same problem pops up when you consider Claras great sacrifice at the end . It was a wonderful moment , but it would have been even more wonderful if we had a better understanding of who the hell she is . Sure , we got her life story . Sort of . But all we really know about her is a couple bullet points and the fact that she can speak as quickly as the Doctor does .

It was somehow hilarious in its audacity while at the same time insanely admirable in its goals and in how well it pulled them off . Despite its Regency setting , this was definitely a Doctor for the modern age to an almost shocking extent . Screenwriter Sarah Dollard clearly saw the introduction of Bill as a perfect stepping stone to introduce the types of conversations Doctor Who has generally not spent too much time on in its history .

From the giant fish to the street urchins to the sneering upper-class twit who gets his comeuppance , its been seen so many times before that its quite fair to call it formulaic . But that tends to be a word used when the formula does n't  work or when the writer fails to find ways to make it fresh .

We do n't  need to be shown that the TARDIS is bigger on the inside . But it seems the modern Who audience ( or more likely modern Who writers ) need to work their way through scenes like these every time . And we 'd argue that such scene , repetitive as they may sometimes get , truly are essential to the viewing experience of Doctor Who over time .

If there 's one character through-line the Doctor looks for in his traveling aids , its an intense need to know the answer to the question , even as they 're forming the next question to ask . In decades past , such qualities in companions had a tendency to be rendered as busy-bodyness or an annoyance ( rooted in sexism , commonly ) or just a way to get the main character to spew some exposition .

One thing we noted when we decided to do a rough count of how many questions Bill asked this episode : the Doctor asked at least as many , if not more . An hour-long back-and-forth of two people constantly asking questions of each other ( sometimes big , important ones ) as well as everyone around them .

@@40422513 @422513/ <p> One of the more interesting choices made for the second season of Daredevil was to break the season up into distinct arcs that only tangentially refer to each other . Streaming TV series tend to follow the binge-watch model of storytelling , which pretty much calls for one season-long arc for all the main characters , but the creative team behind Daredevil opted for several . The two main arcs , which eventually overlap at times but remain refreshingly distinct throughout the season , are the Punisher arc and the- Elektra arc . With these three episodes , the former arc begins to shift slightly into the background while the latter takes center stage . And while we think there may have been some pacing issues this season ( which well get into more as it unfolds ) , we think the basic ideas behind each of these stories were well-realized . Part of the reason they worked as distinct arcs is that the show did n't  strain itself by trying to make them too similar or trying to find connections between them that werent needed .

Father Lantom , who seems to have no role at all this season after serving as Matts confessor through all of season one , does his best to try and give the scene some gravitas and make some sense out of it , but watching three characters act sad over a character they not only did n't  know well but who represented everything they 've been fighting against struck as an attempt to wring pathos out of a scene that did n't  require it . The only thing of interest in the scene was Lantom telling Matt to continue his vigilante work because he feels guilty , which does n't  make a whole hell of a lot of sense coming from a Catholic priest , but like most of the peripheral characters in this series , he is almost as interesting as the main character and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Lantom strikes us as another one of those people in Matts orbit who seem to get a little charge out of what Matts- doing , in a manner that does n't  necessarily speak well of him . After all , there 's something disconcerting about a priest urging a conflicted man to continue his violent ways . Similarly , Karen is someone who gets a charge out of putting herself in very dangerous situations over and over again . Both of these characters are presented as moral voices ; as the people who urge Matt to be better and greater than he is . But under the surface , both characters are , in fact , daredevils themselves ; people who get an adrenaline rush of sorts out of the pursuit of justice and/or danger . <p> We wish the show did a better job of pointing this out . It goes a long way to explain the sometimes inexplicable actions of both characters ( especially Karen ) and it sets Foggy further apart from them as the one moral voice in Matts life who does n't  think he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Daredevil is himself surrounded by daredevils ( including Frank and Elektra ) but his main emotional conflict this season is with the one person in his life who is n't much of a thrill-seeker : Foggy . Its part of the reason why Claire couldnt be with him too : like Karen or Father Lantom , she understood the need for a figure like Daredevil in Hells Kitchen , but like Foggy , she could n't stand to watch someone she cared about pay the price for that lifestyle . All of this goes unstated for the most part , but its interesting to see how Matt constantly surrounds himself with people who more or less are fighting the same demons he is . <p> Which brings us to Frank and Elektra . Both characters , in their own way , represent Paths Not Taken for Matt . In Franks case , Matt sees an only slightly more damaged and darker version than himself , which is why his arguments with Frank are so vehement and why Matt was so gentle in turning him over to the police . He sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long soliloquy about his life and his ghosts and then rather politely handed him over to the police ; specifically to Mahoney , who he urges to take credit for the collar . Granted , in doing so , he was also convincing Mahoney not to arrest him , but his main reason for doing it this way was more altruistic in nature . He knew that the kind of vigilantism he began and Frank accelerated is a net bad for Hells Kitchen if it takes power away from the people who are entrusted with actual law enforcement . <p> Having said that , we feel like its almost impossible to make Franks backstory soldier whose family is killed by the mob , leading him to take up arms in an act of vengeance seem even remotely fresh . It was a cliche back when the character was created 40 years ago and its only become a bigger one in the ensuing decades especially since this is something like the 4th or 5th interpretation of the character for the screen . The only parts of the slow uncovering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Karen , who becomes somewhat obsessed with the man , even if its not always made clear as to why . Still , their interactions in these episodes especially in his hospital room when she reveals she broke into his house ( an act which caused literal screams of " WHY , KAREN , WHY ? " to spring forth from us ) are some of the best parts of the season . Jon Bernthal is doing his best work ever with this character - and thankfully , is making us forget all those other lame-o punishers . <p> Just as Frank represents the darker side of vigilantism and the choices Matt makes in continuing his quest to keep the people of Hells Kitchen safe , Elektra represents the darker side of love and attraction , and how easily susceptible he can be to it . That 's perhaps not quite fair to Elektra to reduce her only to a romantic figure , since shes as darkly violent and murderous as Frank is and in fact , plays a much more active role in Matts life by trying to tempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care less if Matt becomes more like him . He just wanted Matt out of his way . But Elektra has this need to change Matt , which makes her come across as a far more dangerous character , especially since she 's got the one weapon Frank Castle would n't know how to use : sex . <p> You could argue that Elektra and Frank represent the same sorts of murderous impulses to Matt , but the story tends to present Frank as more of a tragic figure and Elektra as more of a seductress and temptress in the Old Testament mode . That 's slightly regressive writing , but its of a piece with the superhero genres conventions . In fact , like the slight staleness wafting off Franks story , the Catwoman-esque take on Elektra ( gleefully amoral , sexy , and tempting female figure ) threatens at times to collapse into cliche . <p> But Elodie Yung and Matt Murdock make all their scenes together sing . Like most superheroes faced with the classic Betty vs . Veronica scenario , Matt appears to have far more chemistry with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe that 's just us , though . While some of the scenes with Karen had a nicely romantic tone to them ( especially the one brightly colored scene that gave us screenshot at the top of this post ) , their relationship seems terribly one-sided . He lies to her constantly and she is n't always particularly forthcoming herself . Not that the Elektra relationship is one based on trust and honesty . Quite the opposite , in fact , although its got the one thing that Karen just cant bring to a relationship with Matt : a deep , cellular knowledge of the other person. - " You act like you have some sort of window into my soul and you do n't  . You never have , " Matt protests , but of course he s wrong . In the past , when she tried to convince him to kill the man who was responsible for his fathers death , she overshot her mark , but in the present day , she 's got him wrapped around her finger and changing into a tuxedo at the drop of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting than it may appear at first . Its not just that she 's a temptress , but that she 's a temptress who does n't  even have to work all that hard to tempt him because she knows him so well . Whether they 're taking out New Age Ninjas in skinny ties or doing their very best James Bond movie re-enactments by crashing Yakuza parties in formal dress , there 's no denying that their scenes together sizzle in a way that the scenes with Karen simply do n't  . <p> Frank and Elektra represent choices made and Paths Not Taken for Matt , its true . But its also quite clear that Matt still has choices in front of him and it seems like everyone in the story right now Karen , Foggy , Father Lantom , Frank , Elektra , Mahoney and the entire Yakuza organization are trying desperately to get Matt to go a certain way . There 's only so much tension you can put on the man before he snaps and itll be interesting to see what form that coming break will take , whether itll center around morals or romance or even mental health .

But Helena once again comes to the rescue for her new family by posing as Alison and somehow managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather quickly how she knew the names of Alisons campaign workers , but wed bet the show is adding a psychic component to the clones this season . Alison was standing right outside the room with her eyes firmly shut when the answers just leapt out of Helenas mouth . That sure does n't  look like a coincidence . <p> In fact , it seems that Kira might be exhibiting some form of clairvoyance herself. - Sarah might notice this if she paid the slightest attention to the poor girl , who 's clearly traumatized from all the upheaval and abandonment in her life and clearly not just a normal little girl , given how strangely shes been acting . Much like her dismissal of Felix this episode , it would seem the lack of attention Sarahs paying her daughter is going to bite her in the ass somewhere down the line . You cant just dismiss your family in this story without paying a heavy price for it . <p> Granted , Sarah , as per the usual , has a LOT on her mind at the moment , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw . Just as the show has doubled down on its family themes this season it has also gone all-in on the body horror . The scene in the dentists office slowly went- from mildly tense to horrifying until it exploded in a spray of blood . On the flipside , the show has n't  lost its dark sense of humor . The scenes of Alison and Donnie digging up Leakeys body were both disgustingly horrifying and laugh-out-loud hilarious at the same time. - - Tatiana Maslany and Kristian Bruun have fantastic chemistry together . Although to be fair , Tat has fantastic chemistry with just about any of her co-stars even herself . <p> And finally , in the body-horror sweepstakes , we have the almost-unwatchable spectacle of Rachel getting her new eye . We werent sure whether this character had long term possibilities in the story , especially since she 's played as , and looks like , a standard Bond villain , which is a little broader than this show likes to go ( guy-with-tail notwithstanding ) . But her rather toxic mix of sibling envy and parental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte , is making her come off more fascinating than ever . <p> And we kinda hope to see a Kira vs . Charlotte Creepy Kid Smackdown before the season is up . We do n't  know where things are going and were more than happy to just enjoy the ride , but that 's one thing that simply HAS to happen .

@@40422559 @422559/ <p> One of the best things about Fargo is how it works on so many levels simultaneously . Whether its all meticulously planned out by the creators of the show- or merely the various ways their subconsciouses affect the output , each episode offers up so much studied ambiguity that its like dangling a carrot in front of people like us ; people who just love to analyze the shit out of something that looks worth analyzing . <p> Can we offer a definitive take on what exactly the above scene is illustrating with regards to the rest of the story ? Does it tie in somehow with the theme of futility , as indicated by the episode title ? Are we meant to look at the rabbit , calmly- submitting to its fate or the man , offering affection and respect just before taking its life ? No , we cant definitively answer any of those questions , but we bet someone can . We bet a lot of someones can because its all so rich with possible meanings . <p> We , for our parts , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this scene to the same importance the creators of it clearly did . In other words , if we are to take the opening shots of this episode as somehow important on a symbolic level at the very least then we are seeing them as an establishment of the general color motifs ; blue , as seen here , and brown , in the shots immediately following : <p> Which are so brown there are literally no other colors to be found onscreen , just as the snow-covered scene just prior to it is awash in an almost eerie blue . We noted this color story when we looked at last weeks episode , and noted that it was all very period accurate and that these shades of blue and brown would be seen in these exact combinations quite often in this period . The seventies was an entire decade drowning in earth tones , after all , so its hardly notable that there 's so much brown in the art direction and costuming , nor is blue an uncommon color to be seen in any period or style . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it when you start paying attention to it . Yes , these colors are correct for the period , but so were greens and yellows and pinks and reds and oranges and purples and yes , even in menswear , even in rural areas like this . Any JC Penney catalogue of the late seventies would have a veritable rainbow of 70s-tinged color options available in both clothing and decor . Browns and blues were common <p> But they werent necessarily- this common . <p> Note how shabby Mikes outfit looks in this scene . Not only does it contrast with Joes much flashier 70s grandeur ( which illustrates his wealth and vanity ) , but it also looks dingy and slept-in because he has n't  changed it over at least a few days . And the power dynamic- is on full display here . There 's no question which man answers to which . <p> But does the overwhelming blue-and-brown color story mean anything in the context of the scene ? <p> Certainly Skip , with his furry collar , cheery name and fidgety ways , calls to mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snake in this scene , as she sidles up to him , mildly threatens him and literally pulls him out the door by his " patriotic " necktie , which will wind up as a darkly comic bit of punctuation in the final scene , when its the only thing left sticking out from his freshly paved grave . Costuming as foreshadowing . The minute she grabbed his tie , his fate was sealed . <p> Is it a law vs. lawlessness kind of thing ? Certainly Hanks and Lous brown uniforms are focal points in many of the scenes , but as you can see here , in a scene that is so awash in browns and blues , that not only is every character dressed in the colors <p> but so are all the cars ; in a scene like this one , can we really say one color equals law and the other one equals criminality ? No , clearly . Lou is in brown , but so is Dodd ( his coat and car match , in fact ) . <p> And the blues are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean something ? We do n't  know , but Floyd sure does stand out against the very limited palette , does n't  she ? <p> The blood red of her coat becomes a focal point of the scene , not only keeping all eyes on her , but foreshadowing and underlining the implied violence of the confrontation , in much the same way Peggys blood red hat and gloves reminded us of her crimes last week . <p> Her red turtleneck serves much the same purpose in an earlier scene that helped establish her role as head of a family who lives a hairs breadth away from violence at all times : <p> And again , she pops out ever so quietly and subtly in a scene dominated by blues and browns . Shes much more restrained and reluctant about the impending violence in this scene , so the red is much more played down , but when the guns are drawn and there are wolves at the door <p> She explodes with the color . <p> But no , we do n't  think the blue and brown palette necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however serve to underline a certain numbing sameness to the visuals , even if the art direction changes drastically from setting to setting or the characters are vastly different from each other . Look at the lighting in all these shots : muddy , low light , seventies-style cinematography . Everything looks like an old Polaroid . Rendering everything in such a limited color palette gives it a feeling of being in the past while also visually tying many of the characters to the settings , which are all blue sky and brown earth in many of the scenes . <p> And speaking of being visually tied to a scene , let 's move away from all these male dominated spaces and into the only female-dominated one and watch how the palette changes suddenly : <p> Teals , purples and pinks dominate Constances beauty salon , which is n't surprising , of course , but its notable just how intensely coordinated it is . Desktops and chairs and coats on hooks and hair style guides and even calendars on the wall all match. - Again , there 's that almost numbing sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches her smock because not only does she just want to be the very best Peggy Blomquist she can be ( and in her middle-class aspirational dreams , that means your outfits match ) , but also because right now and especially in this scene she just wants to blend in and not be noticed as Betsy all but solves her crime right in front of her . <p> This is in sharp contrast to Constance , who stands out entirely from everyone else in the scene with her pseudo-hippy styles drawing sharp relief between her ( who we should note is implied to be a lesbian ) and the middle class employees and clientele around her . Note the clashing patterns in that shot of Betsy and Constance ; all that visual noise as one woman figures our her crime and the other woman actually manages to connect her to it by remembering her busted windshield . Their- costumes reflect all the turmoil and fear Peggys feeling as this scene progresses . <p> And in one last clever bit of art direction and blocking : <p> Hank enters this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a sore thumb because of his unfeminine colors , but every female head in this shot , including the ones on the wall , is oriented toward him or looking at him , as if to highlight his outsider status .

It can be a slog to recap every episode of a show week in and week out , but reviewing a pilot fresh out of the gate ? That 's just good clean fun . <p> Neither of the following merited an overblown 1800-word review , partially because each show is typical network fare , mostly composed of fluff and cliches , and partially because its a bit too early to get much of a handle on either of them . But opinions must be formed and stated round these parts , and we happen to have control of the vehicle , so were gon na spew . <p> ( Sorry about all the mixed metaphors ) <p> In truth , there was no way we werent going to check out the pilot of NBCs Timeless .

The good news is , its the most important of the three . <p> The one-line description of the show ( helpfully provided by NBC in marketing materials ) , " A team is assembled to travel back in time to stop a man from destroying the future , " is practically all you need to know about the particulars of the pilot . In fact , that one-line description IS the pilot . Who is in this team ? Bare-bones introduction ! Who is this man they need to stop ? Bare-bones introduction ! How do they travel back in time ? HAND WAVES GALORE. - Not that we needed a treatise on the physics of time travel , but the pilot hits the ground running and does n't  spend much time holding the audiences hand throughout it .

In other words , when the team travels back in time to ensure that the Hindenburg explodes on schedule ( and fails ) , the show does a fairly good job of portraying a 1937 that looks period-accurate . And were not just talking about hemlines and hairstyles here . <p> The team is composed of Lucy ( Abigail Spencer ) , the kind of network TV series " historian " who knows everything about every time period , down to the most exacting details ( sort of like the historian version of Gilligans Islands professor ) , and wears a surprising amount of eye makeup in her day-to-day life , Wyatt ( Matt Lanter ) , a handsome special ops soldier with a secret ( because of course ) , and Rufus , a secretive , nervous engineer on the time travel project the other two team members just go drafted into . He s also black . This is not an incidental point , as countless comedians have noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in time travel stories . When drafted ( against his will ) to be part of the team , Rufus quite reasonably objects by noting- that practically any period in history is going to be much worse for a black man than the present . It may be a problem for the series down the line if he s constantly asked to " wait outside " by his teammates or forced to bow and scrape to historic racists , but for the pilot at least , this question was dealt with head on , giving Rufus a great F-you scene while still being more or less true to the history of the period . While Laura and Wyatt treated the mission as a curiosity and adventure , Rufus was pretty much terrified through the whole thing and that 's the only response that truly makes sense for that character . <p> But what charmed us most about the pilot was the sense of adventure and fun that permeated it . We cant say there was anything surprising about how time travel is being depicted .

What we loved about this storyline was the way the creators held back from giving the audience what they most wanted to see . Sure , its exciting to see Joan move into a new area in her career , but it was a more sophisticated and realistic choice on the part of the creators to depict her as unsteady and making some potential grievous errors . In other words , it would have been fun , but ultimately unsatisfying from a storytelling perspective to just have Joan ace the whole thing from top to bottom . Instead , there were several ( quite painful to watch , we have to admit ) indications that she was not only in over her head , but that she was n't as supremely knowledgeable about the company or her career as wed all like to believe . First , she completely misread the setup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you might remember , worshipped Joan and saw her as way more powerful in her job than she actually is ) was actually throwing a tremendous business opportunity her way . To Joans credit , she pivoted smoothly on the realization and we had to give a little cheer when she had that revelatory moment of picking up the check for the first time in her life . <p> But when you listen to what Joan actually had to say both times she met with the Avon guy , it was nothing but banalities about listening to the client . When he pressed her on the specifics of SCDPCGC , the only thing she could mention was media placement , because it was a job she once briefly performed . In other words , it was the only thing she could bring to the conversation , because almost all of her work knowledge is administrative in nature . Notice that when he mentioned checking out of his hotel at the second meeting , she perkily responded with , " If you had been a client you could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken care of that , " because that 's something Joan would know after almost two decades doing administrative and low-level managerial work for the company . And nothing was more cringe-worthy than the way she describes her job : " I 'm in charge of thinking of things before people know they need them . " That 's true in some respects , and she 's admirably good at her job , but its depressing that she really only sees herself as someone who serves other people in the company and cant even come up with an empowering way of saying it . Her self-written job description could be applied to a servant just as easily . <p> And worst of all , she stepped all over Peggys brilliant spiel about her own familys Avon lady and the emotion-filled memories she has of her . That 's all straight out of the Draper/Olson playbook of instantaneously casting a product or company in a warm glow of emotional responses and connections in order to woo the client . She could have had the guy eating out of her hand , but Joan did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has no experience at all in this world . Which brings us to our next painful revelation : everyone who yelled at Joan this week was pretty much in the right . <p> Its easy ( and satisfying ) to hate Pete , but he had a point . More than a point . Avon is 25 million dollars in potential billings . Its the height of recklessness for Joan to fuck around with that , not to mention a serious breach of protocol for her to cut Pete out of the meeting like that . She took it on her own to have a meeting with a potentially huge client and made sure that no one from accounts was present . She very well could have been fired for that , partnership or no . In her defense , she has spent years watching the movers and shakers of the industry around her take exactly the kinds of risks she took . She did n't  do anything that Roger or Don or Pete might not have done . The difference is that she has no power to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon . Its absolutely understandable why she did it , though . In her own words , she did n't  want to be " pushed off the diving board , " which she 's coming slowly to realize , she 's been pushed off it over and over again in her life and her career . This is a desperate , last ditch effort to secure some power and respect for herself . And let 's be clear here : she 's not a fool . For her to do this for Avon shows a savviness and self-awareness that should be commended . If ever there was a client tailor-made for the charms of Joan Harris , Accounts Woman , it would be Avon . Shes not likely to ever get such a perfect opportunity for herself again and she felt she had to take the risk to go after it . <p> And she and Peggy finally had the conversation they both needed to have with each other in order to move forward in their relationship . We wondered a couple episodes back , when the two characters were reunited , if Peggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner and how she got it . Turns out , she kinda does and that 's perfectly in character for Peggy and perfectly understandable given her own story . We know Joan and understand her the way the viewers outside a story can understand a character , but to Peggy and to everyone else in the story- Joan is someone who slept her way into a partnership , and that 's not something most people then or now could call an admirable act . Peggy would naturally have an especially tough time handling it , given her own history with Joan and all of that came beautifully roaring to the surface in their argument . If you think Peggy was being a judgmental bitch , we suggest you view some of the scenes between these two characters from seasons one and two . Peggy was right ; Joan never really supported her career goals and in some ways , actively derided or undermined them . Remember when Joan had the Xerox machine put in Peggys office ? Remember when she said " Peggy , this is n't China . There 's no money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its good to remember that she was n't always the most sympathetic character .

And now that she saved her ass with some quick thinking ( which earned her gratitude from Joan ; something she refused to give when Peggy fired Joey for sexually harrassing her ) , we hope that these two can have the friendship and professional relationship that we know would benefit them both tremendously .

His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there has been repeated all season long . Our theory that he s gay got a boost ( or got shot down , depending on how you look at it ) when Ginsberg asked him point blank if he was a " homo , " and Bob just laughed and avoided the question . <p> As for Ginsberg , we hate to sound so gleeful about it , but we got a TON of shit last season when we opined that his " Im from Mars " monologue was indicative of schizophrenia or some other serious mental health issue and we do so love being proven right . Were petty that way . Really , the question of Ginsbergs mental health has always been hanging in the air . He s never been appropriate or able to handle normal communications , and he s been prone to outbursts from the second he was hired . It seems to us the only reason he s still got a job is because , first , he s good at it , and second , the people of the company all have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he has a tendency to say things like , " I cant turn off the transmissions to do harm ; they 're beaming them right into my head . " Honestly , we hate to spin out any more darkly murderous conspiracy theories in a season dripping with them , but that 's a pretty ominous line in a season full of ominous moments . " I am become death , the destroyer of worlds , " he says to Bob . As we said in the first Mad Style of this season , " Ginsberg is running headlong into the counterculture styles of the late ' 60s , even as he works to sell Dow chemical to the masses . " That dichotomy is proving too much for him to bear . As an aside , his calling Stan a " mother hen , " was the most adorable moment of the season . <p> As for Don , his latest trip to California turns out to be the worst of any of them . Without the angelic Anna or the too-good-to-be-true , **32;182;TOOLONG Megan to anchor him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again , we hate to add to all the conspiracy theories , but its pretty ominous that Don hallucinated that dead soldier right after he hallucinated the perfect Megan . Then again , there was a heavy implication that Don was the one in danger of dying . " My wife thinks Im M.I.A. , but I 'm actually dead , " the soldier says to the man who 's been M.I.A. from his wife all year . " Dying does n't  make you whole , " Dead Dream-Soldier adds . " You should see what you look like . " Yikes . Don promptly heads out to the pool ( after real-Megan advised him to go for a swim and blonde lady told him " Theres a pool full of water out there " ) and pretty much re-enacts his suicidal Hawaii ad from earlier in the year , becoming a suit floating in water . <p> We did n't  mind these scenes , but they did feel like a return to Don spinning his wheels . He s dangerously reckless with drugs and alcohol , cynical to a fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mommy issues ( " Theres an extra nipple here , " says the blonde who offers him the hookah ) , unfaithful , and still fantasizes about Megan being the perfect wife and mother figure to him ; still expecting someone else to save him from himself . " What do you think it is ? " he asks Dream-Megan . " A second chance , " she replies . " Everybodys looking for you " is the last thing she says to him before disappearing . <p> And finally , while all this emotional turmoil is going on , Jim Cutler proves himself to be far more than a wry silver fox . We cant say we quite understand what his long game is , but he s clearly thinking of the agency in different terms than any of the original SCDP players and appears to be scarily adept at manipulating things to get a desired outcome . So SCDPCGC becomes SC&amp;P because Jim has plans to split the company " And not in half , " as Ted noted . Don , Peggy , Joan , Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they 've let a fox into the henhouse and they 're all so caught up in their own stories that they cant see what 's happening right in front of them . Once again its poor , angry , petulant Pete who sees what 's really going on but cant get anyone to agree with him because he s so fundamentally unlikeable . " This is not the same business anymore ! " he screams impotently , and he s right . The old rules and old guard no longer function as they once did . They 're in a dangerous , tumultuous time and Pete sees portential disaster on the horizon . But if no ones going to listen to him , then he s going to take a cue from the zeitgeist by tuning in , turning on , and dropping out . Pete smoking pot was easily one of the best images of the entire series to date and perfectly sums up the underlying theme of this season , which is how much the counterculture is invading all aspects of American life . There 's a reason those Carnation executives were so angry .

Its rather clear the charges of sexism leveled against him have been powering and informing a lot of the storytelling this season and with this episode , it seems like he wanted to take the chance to correct some of the poor work done on this character as well as to address certain criticisms of her portrayal . <p> Because we come to find out that she has an entire ( very active and very colorful ) life that has nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she has apparently been routinely stealing the TARDIS right out from under him for years . It turns out- she was never clueless about how badly the Doctor had treated her nor was she unbothered by it . Instead she was pragmatic and a little hardened by her relationship with him ; taking from him what she could get out of him , telling herself that he needed her more than she needed him , and ultimately , admitting in a beautifully played and written monologue that you " do n't  expect the sunset to admire you . " In other words , she always knew how one-sided their relationship was and made some ( in retrospect ) healthy choices as to how she wanted to frame him in her life . It subtly recasts ( and probably retcons ) her entire arc into something that gives her a little more agency and control over herself , even if it does make her do and say some pretty crazy things to compensate for it . <p> Additionally , in one fell swoop , that final scene gave the viewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should ask for : a true marriage between the Doctor and River . For all the talk about how she was his wife , the only part of their relationship that ever seemed remotely like a marriage was their bickering . He never truly appeared to be attracted to her and in fact , there were many times over the years where it felt like he actively disliked her . But when the Doctor revealed that her final night was going to be 24 years long and he intended to spend it with her , we admit , we got a little teary-eyed ourselves . Yes , it was ultimately just a silly fluff of family entertainment wrapped in a particularly loud and bombastic package , and maybe River got played out as a character several years back . And sure , its not always a good idea for a creator to go back over their work and try to correct weak points through some heavy retconning ( because none of this lines up with the River we saw in " Silence in the Library " ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that River Song , who was once one of our favorite characters in Who lore but had tumbled down the list due to some extremely poor storytelling choices , finally felt like a well-rounded ( albeit a bit nuts ) person who more or less got the life she deserved and wanted for herself . Maybe it was n't a great episode , but it had great heart and the ending was surprisingly satisfying . <p> Besides , even if the rest of it was shite , its hard to deny that Peter Capaldi and Alex Kingston have INSANE chemistry with each other . So much so , that it kinda feels like the whole relationship with Matt Smiths 11th Doctor was a huge mistake , in retrospect . They should have saved her for Twelve , because now we find ourselves , to our complete surprise , wishing we could be treated to just a few more adventures with the two of them together .

Also : Winston Churchill ! <p> The preceding has been an entirely verb free anouncement that this post is going to be rather light on fabulous costume design or even deeply meaningful costume choices . A mourning queen- in black who is literally likened to a nun learns a lesson about duty and her role . A preternaturally skillful politician in black course-corrects masterfully in the middle of a neglected crisis . A dying , powerless queen in bedclothes coaches the new queen in black on her duty to be nothing and to be silent ; a dark , bottomless hole into which the country may pour its hopes and fears . <p> To be honest , all of the above sounds a bit more interesting than the episode we got .

We give the writers much credit , however , for not shying away from subtle and gentle critiques of Elizabeths personality throughout the season .

Which is n't to say Elizabeth acted badly or wrongly in this episode ; just that the series is taking pains to explain why shes so duty bound , why she 's had problems with a lot of her familial relationships , and why she 's so mild-mannered as to occasionally come of cold or distant . <p> But if the costume design was appropriately dreary , dark and not particularly interesting , the story quite helpfully provided a flower growing through the cracks of the pavement : <p> We admit that part of our frustration with this episode comes from the heavy focus on Churchill in a biography of the Queen ( when you can bet you 'd never see the flip side of that in a biography of Churchill ) and a deeply puzzling ( until the last minute ) focus on the fictional and seemingly insignificant Venetia Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face on a national disaster that claimed a lot of lives , but even in retrospect , once her part in the story was revealed , it did n't  make her inclusion any more interesting to us . This is , after all , a biography of the Queen , and by extension all of the royal family surrounding the crown . There are plenty of opportunities and ways to view that tale through the eyes of " commoners " and working people of the day , but that wasnt really Venetias role . She was a tool to help Winston Churchill revive his political career , which makes her development as a character and the time spent on her a little bit of frustrating . She was n't a person , she was a charming- MacGuffin whose role had nothing whatsoever to do with the focus of the story , the Queen herself . <p> Or did it ?

In every other scene , its two strands . This is not serving to make her seem powerful in this scene so much as it underlines Queen Marys total lack of power . Marys frilly and old-fashioned bedclothes , in light-mourning violet , are a stark contrast to Elizabeths practical and unfussy style . <p> In her meeting with Churchill , she 's back to two strands and a position where she 's being railroaded by him once again , both on the question of the smog issue and the question of how much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the government intervening . <p> A snapshot of a scene that illustrates how costume design , art direction , cinematography and historical accuracy can all be utilized to support narrative themes and motifs .

But you can still look at the meaning and symbolism underneath , and we cant help but note that were looking at a smoke-filled room of men dressed entirely in gray and black largely being ineffectual in the face of killer smog . It just works on every level of the story . <p> As for Elizabeth <p> It is her fate to be surrounded by men in black , supporting her , advising her , questioning her and defying her .

In an episode stocked to the rafters with black costumes , she 's wearing white . If Elizabeth is the nun in this story , than Venetia is the nurse or shes attempting to be , anyway . <p> And just before she dies , her coat speaks of blue skies and her scarf speaks of growing flowers in sunlight . She is clothed in hope . She is also clothed in the only two colors worn by the queens in this story .

In the end , Churchill outsmarted them all , but Elizabeth learned a lesson about how and when to wield power and Venetia unwittingly played a part in that . <p> Stay tuned for more , darlings !

@@40422715 @422715/ <p> here 's something we did n't  realize until we sat down to watch the Doctor Who Christmas special . Turns out ? Its a completely different experience when you do n't  have the buffer of an entire season of the show between it and the previous years Christmas special . First , there 's a bewildering sense of confusion ( which is n't all that odd for a Doctor Who episode ) as you try to re-acclimate to the world of this character and its particular idiosyncracies . You find your Who skills are rustier than you realized . Or we did , anyway . Then , to our surprise , we found that we had no tension about the episode needing to " stick the landing " after a convoluted or messy season . In other words , a lack of recent- Doctor Who episodes actually made this years Christmas special better than expected . <p> To the frustration of a lot of fans , 2016 has been a year without a Doctor as the show went on hiatus for reasons . We do n't  know there was talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative burnout . Season 9 was n't a disaster by any stretch in fact , it had the best consecutive string of decent-to-very-good episodes in many years but we do n't  think we encountered one review of it that would have placed it among the shows better seasons . We honestly have no desire to litigate or rehash Steven Moffats tenure on the show , which has been somewhat controversial among its fandom ( although that 's not exactly unique in its history ) , but at this point , its practically impossible not to turn any review into some sort of statement on his work . Especially when its the first episode in a long time and its about to kick off the countdown to his exit from the series . <p> Anyway , the shows been limping for a while and the hiatus must have contributed to our lowered expectations going into it , but " The Return of Doctor Mysterio " was surprisingly fun and we do n't  know any other word to describe it but " palatable , " which sounds like a backhanded compliment but is n't meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterize Moffats aesthetic approach to the show , but for the purposes of this review , well stick to two : bombast and sentiment , which just so happen to be the two qualities we think define his Who work overall . From the ( in retrospect ) completely over-the-top and dragged-out exits of companions Amy Pond , Clara Oswald and River Song to the tendency to view the Doctor as something of a fairy tale character , his time on the show has been dripping with sentiment , and no Doctor Who episode each season of his tenure has more maudlin sentiment per square inch than the Christmas specials . On the flipside of that is the screaming , fast-talking bombast that characterizes most of the major stories of the 11th and 12th Doctors . Sure , there were moments of quiet calm and good character work , but there was also a whole lot of emphasis on yelling ones way past obvious plot holes or strangely conceived storylines . If we have to sum up the negative side of the Moffat years in one word , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we had to pick a few words to sum up the more positive aspects of the Moffat years , we 'd have to land on " witty " and " sophisticated . " What made this special so surprisingly appealing was the unexpected dialing down of sentiment and bombast and the very welcome dialing up of wit and sophistication . <p> Were not talking Noel Coward here or anything , but it was nice to watch a fun little adventure with likable characters who are so archetypal that you do n't  need more than a second or two to get on board with whatever they 're doing . A lot of times , when a show that does n't  have anything to do with the superhero genre ( although plenty would make the case that DW is situated smack in the middle of it ) attempts to do a pastiche of one , the levels of camp and silliness wind up overwhelming the story . But Moffat took his cues ( and several scenes and bits of dialogue ) from the best of the Christopher Reeve Superman films , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " built into its DNA . Sure , " The Ghost " is somewhat silly as a character , with a ridiculously complicated life and backstory ( as befits most superheroes ) and a costume that does n't  exactly scream " dignity . " But because the performers are so game and the story simply a fun and witty spin on some of the oldest tropes of the genre , offered up on a day when no ones really looking to be challenged much by their entertainment , it all worked really well . <p> Personally , weve always found the insane sentimentality of the Moffat-era Christmas specials to be more than a little eyeroll-worthy at times , so it was refreshing to see a special that barely even acknowledged any connection to the holiday at all . And while there were the requisite " Doctor + adorable child " scenes , the real fun came when the adults were bantering and adventuring , not when the Doctor was teaching lessons to a morose ragamuffin . It was also refreshing to have an episode so free of any continuity issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Song was mostly done well . Still , we enjoyed this one for just being a fun stand-alone adventure of the Doctor , with one-off characters , a new semi-Companion ( Nardoles a welcome addition and apparently well be seeing more of him in the new season ) , and a brief tip of the hat to the main characters emotional history . Capaldi can wear the character like a comfy shoe at this point and Moffat seems to be a bit liberated by the upcoming endpoint to his time on the show . If this is any indication of where the upcoming season is heading , then the long hiatus may just have been worth it .

By making this shift in style approach , he was observing the grand celebrity post-messy-breakup tradition of working hard to remind the public that it- once wanted to sex him hard .

@@40422754 @422754/ <p> Its sister vs. sister in the Royal family ! And Mummys no better ! Family dysfunction , duty , romance , sex , religion and tradition all come clashing together in this episode . Overall , the drama felt a little , shall we say , milked from the historical record , but it made for a wonderfully juicy Downton Abbey-esque bit of soapy , sister-y melodrama . <p> Even better : Most of the major costume motifs of the series came into play this episode , from the Pearls of Power , to green as a code for duty over family , to blue as the color of queenliness . In addition , various family relationships and how the members see each other were reflected in the costume choices . <p> Motif# 1 : Margaret in a romantic floral talking on the phone to Elizabeth , who 's wearing a very queenly blue suit . Let 's just skip ahead in the story to make our point : <p> In both phone call scenes- ( there 's a third , but were holding that one for later ) , Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The florals speak to Margarets freer , more romantic side . Shes in loungewear while Elizabeth is in a suit that speaks both of her professional responsibilities as well as her role as the Queen . There are statements being made not only about who each of these women are , but how they relate to and are different from each other . <p> Which leads us to Motif #2 : Family members dressing for other family members . To wit : <p> This is an interesting look to us . Green has been a consistent color story for Elizabeth , but in most cases , when she 's depicted wearing it , its a very sturdy , sober , muted green that almost comes off like the color of a military uniform . But this is a sparkly , stylish green . And the ensemble is an unusually chic and modern choice for a character who 's been depicted as the less modern and less chic of the two sisters . The jacket , gloves and capelet are all very much on trend for late 50s fashion . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as compared to the dressing scene in the previous episode , where she barely acknowledged what she was wearing . <p> We noted then that the figure of the Queen is a public performance for Elizabeth . When we speak of her in blue , it tends to reference the goddess/Madonna aspects of the role ; the image of the Queen . The idea of queenliness . In almost every episode , there 's at least one example of this blue-and-white " exalted figure " style of costume , such as this short scene later : <p> The entire series has been about the tension between Elizabeth the Goddess and Elizabeth the woman ; between the image/icon and the sister/wife/daughter . The former aspect is rendered above , but when it comes time to reference the daughter or sister especially when those roles come into conflict with her primary role , she 's often rendered in green . <p> Two things before we go any further : The first is that were trying to be careful about not ascribing intent here . Its possible all of these motifs were- laid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more possible that were picking up on things that were not intentional . This is n't about trying to crack a secret code so much as its about finding new ways to examine a scene or a story . <p> The second thing is to remind anyone reading that were discussing the characters in a fictionalized tale and not the real people , except as a reference or comparison . If we note that " Elizabeth " is dressed somewhat frumpily in comparison to her " sister , " were not referring to either of the historical , real world figures . <p> Anyway , our point here is two-fold , because Elizabeths costume is saying two things . One , that she 's coming up against a conflict between family and duty and that she felt the need to dress just a little more stylishly around her more stylish sister . There 's just a hint of vanity in the decision and it foreshadows a major act of vanity she will make down the line . <p> This idea that she dressed up to impress is bolstered by examining how each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're apart from each other . <p> Elizabeth ends the night in a frumpy , sensible , comfy nightgown , while Margaret <p> Spends the rest of the night partying in her ostentatious gold gown , which , it should be noted , is far more movie-star glamorous in style than Elizabeths pretty green gown . <p> Meanwhile , the Queen Mother attempts to mask the steam coming out of her ears at the news of her daughters romantic life : <p> Shes dressed in that same somewhat frumpy blue dress of which she seems to have a dozen copies . The color scheme is a queenly blue and white . And she 's got no less than THREE strands to her Power Pearls . The lady is read to throw down. - <p> Which she does , by facing off against a pearl-less Elizabeth in another " family dressing for family " moment : <p> The Queen Mother starts her appeal to Elizabeth by stating " I have two daughters whom I love very much . " That 's evident in her costume , which sports both the queenly blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Make no mistake , though . Her maternal feelings are swaddled in a huge fur-accented coat , which gives her a much broader and imposing feel . Also : One strand of Power Pearls to Bettys zero strands . Shes making her wishes be known and imposing her will on the situation . It strikes us as a fairly fictionalized version of the real person and her relationship to Elizabeth , but it makes for better drama to have the Queen Mother as something of an adversary to Elizabeth , rather than a loving advisor . <p> Next , - the most blatant " family dressing for family " moment : <p> This is really great costume design . They are day and night ; almost perfect mirror images of each other . A broad-lapeled coat with a cinched waist over a floral-accented dress accompanied by a double strand of pearls and matching earrings . And yet , its somehow very subtle . <p> The point here is that deep down , these two sisters are far more alike than unalike ; that they understand each other in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they 've been depicted very much like them throughout the series . But there is a fundamental difference in their roles and thus a fundamental difference in their outlooks ; a divide as distinct as night and day . Just beautifully represented through clothing and hair . <p> Yet another example of Elizabeth facing off against a male advisor while dressed to match him , in a dark , sober suit-style dress . <p> And while this ensemble is based on historical events , it felt to us like the addition of black accents to her usual queen-blue ensemble gave it a sense of foreboding and gave her an almost sinister feel . After all , this episode implies that vanity was at least partially behind her reasons for sending Townsend away sooner . She did n't  like the loss of attention . The Queen has a dark side and this costume backs that up . <p> After Elizabeths decision becomes manifest , Margaret makes one more phone call to her sister , but this time , the tone is very different . <p> The shift in their relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wear. - This time , Margaret is dressed far more formally than her sister . There 's still a heavy floral component to her costume ( including a real flower this time ) , but Elizabeths not in her queenly blue but in the her duty-bound green ; not among the stations of her office , but mucking about a stable . Glamour vs . Dull Tradition- as opposed to Romance vs . Royalty , which was the undertone of their earlier phone calls . Once again , Elizabeths- role as a queen has conflicted with her role as a family member . <p> And finally , a bit of fabulous High Drag : <p> Girlfriend knows how to milk a scene for drama , that 's for sure . Two things to note : You cant possibly lose sight of her umbrella , and she 's dressed in a very dull , dutiful green . Doing as she 's told , but in high style .

@@40422772 @422772/ <p> No , really . Were asking . Because we just finished the third episode of the season- and the answer to the question posed by the title above seems to be , " Not a whole hell of a lot , apparently . " <p> For the past few seasons of the show , we started off watching AHS extremely tentatively , tuning in for reasons of pure curiosity more than a desire to watch to completion . Wed had our fill of this show by the time its third season collapsed and we knew we were never going to end another season with the kind of satisfaction and sense of entertainment we got out of the first two . Once Jessica Lange bailed , it was only morbid curiosity about whether Lady Gaga could act ( spoiler : not really ) and some stunning set and costume design that kept us tuning in sporadically . But for the past few seasons , weve always dropped the show by the halfway point . We have no idea how Freak Show or Hotel even ended . And honestly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you can count on from a Ryan Murphy joint its a strong , often jaw-dropping opening chapter . From Nip/Tuck to Glee to American Horror Story , he s a creator who has more than earned his reputation as a poor closer , but damn , if he does n't  know how to start things off . American Crime Story : The People vs . O.J. Simpson is a rare instance of a show under the Murphy banner handing in a near-flawless season of television , from beginning to end . We wondered , going into this AHS season , if Murphy had n't  achieved a maturity as a showrunner and creator that allowed him to stay more focused . On the one hand , the first few episodes of- Roanoke- ( the long-hidden title of this season of AHS ) indicate a steady hand and a sense of focus without a need for a lot of fireworks and jump scares . On the other hand , its been the three most boring consecutive episodes of American Horror Story we may have ever seen . <p> Is this working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storyline , except with more hillbillies- and no Jessica Lange ? Because its putting us to sleep . Its not necessarily a problem that they 're doing another version of a haunted house story ( on the surface , at least ) . Its a problem that they 're not doing anything interesting or new with it . Homicidal nurse ghosts ? Mutilated pig men ? Kathy Bates doing an insane accent ? AHS has always been a lot of things , but " stale " was rarely one of them . We suppose it could be argued that the " cable-channel ghost story re-enactment show " hook is fresh . It was an intriguing way to start off , especially since the very format inspired some head-scratching . No cable re-enactment had production values or actors that good . And it comes off a little odd that the " re-enactors " are rather significantly older than the people they 're portraying . Worst of all , almost all drama is removed from any of the " scary " scenes because the very people involved in them are calmly narrating after the fact. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no doubt that if we spent a couple of hours digging through Reddit thread theories , we could come up with something that sounds enticing , but the show so far is n't really interesting enough to have- us dig any further . Murphy has indicated that they 're trying to tie all six seasons together , which could explain the sense of staleness and repetition and serves as an example of why tying the seasons together at all is a mistake . The minute you make continuity your primary concern , you sacrifice character and storytelling . But the problem is n't the haunted house or cable re-enactment hook or the bizarre attempt to retroactively turn an anthology series into one continuous story . Its the characters , which are some of the blandest in the shows history . <p> These people are n't  interesting and their problems are mundane and lack impact .

@@40422781 @422781/ <p> With the premiere of Sarah Jessica Parkers new joint Divorce and " Awkward Black Girl " creator- Issa Raes " Insecure , " HBO is to be commended for offering such disparate takes on womens lives , not only in their programming , but on the same night . But we question whether the programming block makes much sense , given how different each series is from the other . <p> One is the story of an upper-middle-class suburban middle-aged white woman whose cold and sad marriage has reached an endpoint . The other is the story of a Millennial urban black girl who wants to figure her shit out before the dreaded 30th birthday peeks over the horizon . Together , they do n't  fight crime ( unfortunately ) , but they do make up an unusual programming block for the network , simply because its hard to see an overlap of interest in their respective audiences .

The other is about aging , endings , and class . Both tell stories that have been told many , many times before , but only one of them manages to make their story seem fresh . <p> In many ways , its impossible to look at Sarah Jessica Parker in an HBO drama about an upper-middle-class white woman in New York state dealing with sex and relationship issues and not see it somehow as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead character in Sex and the City . We struggled with the idea of whether or not the comparison was unfair to her as an actress , but- after seeing this first episode , we do n't  think it is at all .

Fair or not , she 's playing depressed , middle-aged Carrie Bradshaw . It did n't  have to be that way , although getting away from the comparison wouldve required Parker to deliver a performance unlike any we 've seen from her . <p> But Divorce has issues , and Parkers performance , which is generally quite good ( if unsurprising ) , is n't really one of them . It just tends to make a decent stand-in for discussion of the series overriding problems : its stale and its depressing as hell .

In order to get the public to tune into a prestige cable series- centered around the topic , you better have a damn good hook . Showtimes The Affair managed one excellent season and one only okay one by formally upending the audiences expectations of how such a story would be told , but Divorce does n't  come close to doing anything like that . Its almost as if the series grits its teeth and decides to get on with the grim tale . We wont deny that there are times when the darkness of the script nails the emotions of a relationship several decades old ; the exhaustion and the constant fight to stay emotionally engaged with something that feels like the hardest job ever . What it fails to do is find any humor or wit in the situation . And that would be fine if this was a dark and serious drama , but the show is clearly trying to present itself as a dark comedy .

In short , it was tough to even sit though this one . The cast is good but the story , at least as it was laid out in this first episode , is anything but . <p> Insecure , on the other hand , is a total delight . Like Divorce , its not telling us a new story . The " young women in the city , talking about their dreams and their plans , looking for romance and professional fulfillment " series is a tale as old as The Mary Tyler Moore Show , which practically created the genre that was later advanced and built upon by Sex and the City and Girls , among many others .

I did n't  sign up for that shit ! " Were miles away from the perfectly witty little white-lady brunches of Carrie Bradshaw &amp; Co or the neurosis-fueled narcissism of Hannah and Marnie . <p> Which is n't to say Issa and Molly are n't  balls of insecurity ( hence the title ) and neuroses themselves . Issa is stuck in a job she 's had since she graduated college , but it does n't  fulfill her and has her actively questioning whether its even morally right for her , leaving herself open to situations like a classroom full of African-American children questioning her blackness and a conference room full of white people fetishizing it .

What makes it different and this would , not coincidentally , be the moment we fell in love with the show is when Issa allows herself to be pushed into picking up the mic at a club and freestyling a rap called " Broken Pussy , " which winds up infuriating Molly because Issa- used her own pain to impress a guy . Its both hilariously funny and sadly poignant at the same time .

And of course , making them to a stewardess that he s going to wind up in bed with , albeit very briefly . <p> Last nights HIGHLY awaited season opener left us momentarily a little disappointed , were ashamed to admit . Despite the fact that it moved briskly , gave us a peek at pretty much every major character , and set up the new status quo at Sterling Cooper , there was a bit of a " Thats it ? " when the credits rolled . Shameful of us , we know . <p> But in a strange way , it reinforces a big part of what makes the show so great , because to really enjoy Mad Men in a way that goes past " Look at all the clothes !

Things have more than one meaning ; events move slowly ; themes and motifs repeat themselves ; and all of that requires something of a level of commitment from the audience , which is why the show is generally considered one of the best on television right now yet never manages to score in the ratings the way it should . <p> So , before we delve any deeper , let 's look at the new status quo : Its spring 1963 , about 6 months after the events of the Season 2 finale . Sterling Cooper is in the throes of a post-British invasion takeover orchestrated by Duck Phillips ( who appears to be long gone ) . The air is heavy with change ( as evidenced by Dons darker suits and less Brylcreemd hair , as well as Petes slightly longer and Joans slightly bigger hairstyles ) and the fear and suspicion that comes with it . Snooty British Financial Officer Lane Pryce ( along with his equally snooty assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of changes that always come when two large companies merge : people are getting fired and there 's a feeling of doom hanging over the office . <p> Don and Betty are giving off the impression of connubial bliss and a newfound commitment to their marriage . " I just want everything to be perfect , " says Betty , revealing that despite everything that happened last season , she 's still ( unfortunately ) the same Betty . Roger has returned from his Greek honeymoon bearing gifts and Joan appears to have gone ahead with her Christmas wedding to her rapist husband and also appears to be leaving SC in the near future . Peggy is as ambitious as ever and cant get any respect from her new secretary , who ignores her on a regular basis , it seems . Pete , who we last saw drowning his sorrows and holding a rifle in his darkened office , is back to Pete form : insanely ambitious , wound way too tight , and attempting to be a man in the Don Draper mold but succeeding only in revealing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his marriage seems to have stabilized , at least . Trudy is doing what childless women of her social class are expected to do : social climbing by entertaining a group of wealthy museum docents . <p> There . Is that everyone ? Then let 's begin . <p> We wondered how the writers were going to handle Dons commitment to making his marriage work . After all , a Don getting up in the middle of the night to make some warm milk for his pregnant wife might give us all a little of glow of contentment , but it hardly makes for an interesting character . And a Don whoring around the way he s done in the past would lose some of its enchantment for the viewer because falling back on old ways would be disappointing to see and a little boring to boot . The opening scene gave us everything we need to know about the new Don . He s committed to his family yet haunted by his own past still . The scenes of his past intruding on his modern life were masterfully shot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to reveal about Dons past and truth be told , those little vignettes did n't  reveal much , but we had to laugh a bit grimly at the revelation that he was literally named after his fathers dick as an act of hateful defiance by his dying prostitute mother . That tells you an awful lot about him right there ; born into a family of spite , shame and hatred , and named after the male sexual organ . <p> The company sends Don and Sal down to Baltimore to smooth over some business with London Fog . Like almost every other aspect of the show , even the clients the writers choose to focus on are heavy with meaning . Sterling Cooper is in the throes of a " London Fog " of its own as everyone is unsure of what 's happening with the new Brits in charge . On the flight down , the adorable stewardess in her adorable uniform flirts her ass off in the presence of these two suave , good-looking men . After a highly flirtatious dinner with two stewardesses and the pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they can smoothly lie to people ( a skill theyve both honed to perfection out of necessity and for different reasons ) , they both score ; Don with a flight attendant and Sal with a bellhop . Apparently , they both have a thing for uniforms . <p> Well get to Sal in a minute , but we just want to point out a few things about Dons tryst interruptus . It was heartbreaking ( and completely in character ) to hear Don admit to this woman who did n't  even know his name and would never see him again that it was his birthday . When she asked to see his drivers license and he said it would n't do her any good , we were reminded once again that Dons life is a lie . Dick Whitmans birthday is known to no one and celebrated by no one . That he is so amputated is the word that comes to mind , from his past is all the explanation one needs as to why he does the shitty things he does over and over again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . " <p> So yes , Don went ahead with cheating on his wife again , but there was a difference this time . We do n't  buy this from our point of view , but from Dons point of view , he was being more respectful of Betty by choosing a stranger in another city that he would never see again . In fact , we 'd go so far as to say that to Don , what he was doing did n't  even constitute cheating in the strict sense . Shed never admit it , but we suspect a part of Betty would co-sign this point of view . <p> Its notable that Don made the one mistake he s never made before : he allowed evidence of his tryst to enter his home when he inadvertently left the stewardesss flight pin in his luggage . That 's so far away from the Don we 've come to know , that it forces a ton of questions about what 's going on inside . Last season , Betty went through every drawer and every suit he owns and could n't find any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief fling with a stranger and almost fucks the whole thing up by making a rookie mistake . And we got echoes of last season , when Sally said " I 'll be quiet , Daddy , " reminding him of his order to Bobbie Barrett to shut up . This time , Sally proudly wore the pin of the woman Don tried to fuck . Much like Bobby Draper unfairly serves as a stand-in for Don when Betty needs to vent her frustrations , Sally Draper serves as a stand-in for all the women Don has had . Its a little sick , but its very real . Children are always doomed to take on roles in the psyches of their parents for which they are not suited and which they should n't have to bear . <p> Now let 's talk Sal . If we can cheer on someone being unfaithful to their wife ( which is almost a prerequisite for watching this show ) , then we cheered the loudest for poor repressed Sal when he unexpectedly got what he wanted more than anything in the world . Kudos must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a way that was perfectly in line both with Sals character and with the times in which he lived . Gay sex was a quick and furtive thing carried out by strangers in those days more often than not . Sal would have never pursued an opportunity so one needed to literally be thrust upon him . We 've said it before and well say it again : only a gay actor could pull off the emotions required here . Sals complete disbelief at what was happening coupled with fear and an unleashed , breathless joy is something that most gay people can remember feeling at least once in their lives and Batt pulled it off beautifully . Another thing that needs to be pointed out was the hysterically funny gag of the exploding pen in Sals pocket . Do we really need to point out the layers of meaning there ? <p> As we saw last season with Peggy , Don deals best with someone when he knows they have a secret . In fact , Don is the best person to know when you have a secret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life because of it . When he encounters someone with a secret as great as his own , he ca n't help but respect that person for carrying it off as well as he does . He cemented a bond with Peggy that has benefited them both and now were curious to see if such a bond will grow between him and Sal , now that he knows Sals secret . He dealt with it in the best Don Draper manner . " Limit your exposure " was both a tag line , a form of acceptance ( he is , after all , the ONLY person in Sals milieu capable of accepting his secret ) and a smart bit of advice on the same level as his " it will shock you how this never happened " plea to Peggy last season . <p> And Sal appears to have taken his advice , because back at the office , he seems completely comfortable in his own skin .

Hell either go ahead with an affair with the Belle Jolie guy or hell wind up visiting some very interesting bars in the Village very soon . Count on it . <p> In other Sterling Cooper news , the new British overlords are content to have the staff engage in gladiatorial combat to get ahead . It speaks volumes of the differences between Pete and Kens characters when you look at how they both reacted to the same news . Ken thinks its a hoot and a half and absolutely refuses to lower himself to treachery in order to further himself . Hell blithely forge ahead , doing his job to the best of his ability and ignore managements attempts to get him to jump through hoops for them . Of course , Pete ca n't do that . Grimacing and huffing and puffing and all but stamping his little feet in rage , Pete is reacting to this maneuvering in the worst possible manner and he s going to shoot himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Draper-style . <p> Of course , Pete has good reason to be filled with rage and we got the tiniest little glimpse why when he was going over his accounts list and noted with no small amount of anger that Peggy seemed to be handling most of them .

With Pete in a position of power over her and carrying around a tight little ball of resentment that he ca n't reveal , its anyones guess what he could do . <p> In a more general sense , the show is revealing itself to be firmly set in the 60s by now .

Thomas has always been one of the more frustrating characters on the show because Fellowes wants the audience to alternately hate him and feel sorry for him , but has never really done anything to bridge those two sentiments in a way that makes for a consistent characterization . Thomas is simply either a mustache-twirling villain or a tragically friendless gay man desperate for love and connection in his life . Of course there 's no reason he ca n't be both of these things , but as we said , there 's no bridge , no shading or nuance that would allow both sides of him to make sense .

@@40422821 @422821/ <p> Hey , remember Falling Skies , the TNT series about plucky resistance fighters trying to secure their freedom under an oppressive alien occupation ? And hey , remember V , the ABC remake of the cult classic series from the 80s about living under an insidious alien occupation ? Boy , we sure do . In the days after LOST ended , we ( and seemingly every TV executive in existence ) were looking for a genre series with adventurous undertones and deep mysteries to fill the void . We latched onto both shows , recapped the shit out of them for as long as we could sustain interest , but ultimately abandoned both shows to their fates . Neither of them had the energy and intensity required to make a story like that work . So when we saw the previews for USAs new series Colony , which seemed to be about a family living in a Los Angeles controlled by alien overlords , we cant say we were excited about it . Or even interested , if were being truthful . <p> But the show started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that the casting of LOSTs Josh Holloway and The Walking Deads Sarah Wayne Callies seemed like - pretty smart choices to make at the outset , so we decided to sit down and watch the first episode , fully expecting it to be the only episode well watch . <p> Well , shut our mouths . That was a highly entertaining hour of television that introduced a world , its main characters , and the basic storylines going forward while never overwhelming the audience with a lot of exposition and managing to keep a brisk pace that kept us hooked the whole time . No , its not at all a new take on an old story . In fact , if the show was n't as good as it is , we 'd definitely be lobbing criticisms of staleness and shameless copycatting of other shows . The funny thing is , were pretty sure some of the more overt ripoffshomages copycat scenes were entirely deliberate . <p> Because when you put Josh Holloway in a cage and then force- him to sit down with a nebbishy , manipulative sociopath who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , its impossible not to have flashbacks to Ben Linus and the polar bear cages on LOST . And when you have Sarah Wayne Callies wandering streets completely empty of any life and hiding under vehicles when threatening figures arrive , there 's no way you 're not thinking of Lori wandering deserted Georgia highways and hiding under cars when herds of walkers pass by . These karaoke scenes of other , highly celebrated genre shows somehow seem to work , despite the obvious referencing . We suspect if other actors were cast in these parts it would seem more like a ripoff , but when you 've got the same actors riffing on some of their most famous scenes , it feels more like a cheeky wink at the audience . A way of saying " We know what you want to see and were happy to give it to you . " <p> We realize " It rips off other shows , you guys ! " is not exactly a stirring endorsement of the show , nor should it be taken as one . Its just , to us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows progenitors . What really made the hour interesting to us , and set the show apart from other , lesser alien invasion stories , was the extremely high tension that permeates the episode and the excellent depiction of life under fascism . Every single person the Bowman family faces , from hospital nurses to black market medicine peddlers- to teenage bullies to sociopathic bureaucrats , is a potential threat and the performances and direction make that very clear to you over and over again . Its not edge-of-your-seat stuff ; just a simmering undercurrent that plays under every interaction and winds up making you feel not just the fear the characters are feeling but the underlying rage that this is how their lives have turned out . Honestly , there are a couple of interactions thatll make you want to punch someone . <p> And here 's where the casting of Holloway and Callies really pays off . Sure , there 's a deliberate attempt to remind you of their more famous roles , but by the time the hour was done , we realized we had a newfound respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with material like this , based on their own resumes . Callies in particular is a revelation and we tend to think that any Walking Dead fan who screamed for Loris death for being such an irritating character might be surprised at how good she is when given material that does n't  make her look like an idiot . Holloway does n't  get to break out the charm in quite the same way when he was playing a sexy con-man , but he knows how to hit that sweet spot directly between " heroic figure " and " scared guy just trying to figure out how to stay alive . " She was badly served by a poorly written character in her previous series and he has found it difficult to find a successful show that plays to his strengths . It sounds weird , but were actually happy for both actors that they have this opportunity . <p> Sure , there 's always a chance this show wont be a success .

LOST showrunner Carlton Cuse is behind this show and it seems to us he s learned a bit since he launched the vampire apocalypse joint " The Strain " for FX , which has become something of a laughing stock and hate-watch for a lot of people . That show was obvious and silly and the characters all walk around saying and doing nonsensical things . But with Colony , Cuse seems to have returned to the plotting style that made LOST so great by doing something very little genre shows do anymore : withholding . Its not just that several characters have secrets that you might not have seen coming ( and that tend to be unexpected given the characters and actors playing them ) , its that very little about the current situation is explained . We keep calling this an alien occupation- story and it certainly has all the trappings of one , with a Los Angeles walled off from the outside world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law and order , but there 's one thing the show does n't  have that all other alien occupation- stories do : aliens . You never see one and the characters make it clear that no one knows anyone who 's seen one . Given the way the show clearly intends to be mystery-laden , we think this one idea may be the most enticing of all . The question here is n't " What do the aliens look like and what do they want ? " Its more " Are there even aliens here ? " which takes the entire story to a slightly surreal place . Everyone is living in fear and under oppression but no one knows who 's oppressing them or why . There 's something very modern about that take ; something that taps into the current zeitgeist . People are angry and scared but they do n't  know who they should be mad at and what it is that 's scaring them . Its like a sci-fi take on the current presidential campaigns . <p> Will it last ?

Up until now , Murdocks war against Fisk has been a battle between competing philosophies . But with Mrs. Cardenas , the tag line to a thousand cheesy action sequels is embodied : " This time , its personal . " She is Matts reason to go from crusader to tortured potential murderer . She is the victim that will prove to Matt Murdock that the devil exists . <p> Matt goes back to see Father Lantom , a character wed half-forgotten about .

It probably was n't the actors fault , but Father Lantom sounded like someone delivering lines in that scene instead of telling a story . But like we said , it was a deeply compelling scene , not only because the story he told was horrifying and fascinating at the same time , but because it made an interesting point about how blind ( you 'll pardon the term ) Matt is to- what Father Lantom is trying to tell him : that he believes in the devil , except he believes in him as a concept that 's embodied in peoples actions .

But Matt cant quite see that because he s starting to become consumed with a sort of obsessive rage for Fisk. - The scene ends there , which is important , because Matt has not yet realized that killing Fisk would not stop evil and it probably wouldnt even stop Fisks particular brand of it from thriving in a place like Hells Kitchen .

@@40422837 @422837/ <p> We were a bit pleasantly surprised by this episode . Like every stereotypical gay , we were both looking forward to an all-Madge episode of Glee , but we never thought theyd take such a semiotic approach to it . We should have known that the writers would take it further . This wasnt just an episode with Madonna songs ; it was an exploration of what Madonna means . <p> Now , well grant you , we have serious doubts that teenagers in 2010 think about Madonna much at all , but then again , anyone thinking this show is representative of anything but the twisted minds of the creators is in for a disappointment . Well never stop saying this : if you 're looking for realism on Glee , you 're looking in the wrong place . <p> Which reminds us , theyve really gone all in lately on the fantasy aspect of musicals . More and more , were seeing our singers off the stage and gallivanting through the school as they sing their lungs out in clearly **31;216;TOOLONG scenes . Personally , we love it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about realism can only be a good thing , as far as were concerned . <p> Anyway , Madonna : Were going to be 100% honest about something and we can already sense your disappointment . When we first saw the Vogue video with Sue last week we of course sat there with our mouths open in astonishment at how faithfully they recreated virtually every frame of the original ( and impressed with Jane Lynchs vocals ) , but the second it ended , our first thought was , " That 's it ? " That 's what everyone was making such a big deal over ? Sure , its a lot of work to recreate those iconic 5 minutes of video so faithfully , but its not exactly creative . Additionally , we cant say the song arrangements in last nights episode made our bits tingle , again , because they were so literal . " Like a Prayer " sounded great , but the second they added the gospel choir they confirmed what wed been thinking : they had no interest in interpreting Madge so much as paying respectful homage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no argument from us , but none of them will be heading to our i-Pod anytime soon . <p> But then we started thinking about it some more and realized that was okay . It was n't about the music this time . It was about the figure of Madonna and what she means . In this case , she means female empowerment , in everything from choosing ( or not ) to have sex ( and with whom ) to demanding and receiving respect from everyone around you , a rallying cry for not just the girls , but for anyone who feels the need and the desire to stand up and express themselves . Of course we probably should have just taken the title of the episode at face value instead of devoting so much time to thinking about it , but we never claimed to be efficient . <p> The fact that the halls of the school were packed with every Madonna look , from " Whos That Girl " Madonna to " Ray of Light " Madonna , painstakingly recreated as the entire Madge back catalogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development that made so little sense that we half-wondered if it was part of the shows contract with her to get the rights ) only further added to the **26;249;TOOLONG take . <p> Okay , there were far too many " Madonnas " in that last sentence . <p> Plus it was fun to pick them all out and a little surprising how easily we recalled every look and the song or video to which it was associated . In fact , one of the more shocking things about the Vogue recreation was n't so much the faithfulness of it but how we knew instantly it was a frame-by-frame recreation because every damn frame of it is imprinted on our brains . Since her entire body of work is seared into our collective memory , we do n't  blame them for taking such a literal approach with the music . You do n't  fuck around with the work of a legend . You pay it respect . <p> We have to single out the " Like a Virgin " number , which did a fantastic job of tying together a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the cherry-popping scale , Rachel decided to wait because she 's not sure who she loves , Emma couldnt go through with it , and Finn went through with it and found it disappointing because it was n't with the person he knew he wanted . Also have to single out Kurt and Mercedes on " 4 Minutes . " They both looked like they were having a lot of fun with it . <p> Our only ( slight ) disappointment : As important as Madonna is to the concept and ideals of female empowerment , she is almost equally as important a figure to gay men . Kurt got a little more time in the spotlight this episode ( laughed out loud at his soprano during " Like a Prayer " ) but we would have liked to have seen a little more of Kurt in the story .

They 're all in it together and they all want to prevent anyone from dropping out of the adventure because the less people in the group , the more work for the group . Its not just a study in survival ; its a study in teamwork .

@@40422841 @422841/ <p> What a flipping fabulous hour of TV that was , right ? Too bad we had to sit through so much Sylvia Rosen in the earlier weeks to get to this point . Season six of Mad Men has been choppier than most , we 'd say , with a rather problematic first half to it , but last nights episode proved that the show has n't  lost its knack for turning the plot dials up to 11 for the final hours of the season . Practically every storyline- came to a head , some in the most explosive manners possible and the amazing thing is , nothing has been resolved . All of these storylines are still up in the air . But of course , its the Bob Benson story that continues to fascinate the most . We really have to give Weiner &amp; Co. credit for creating a character seemingly out of thin air in the shows sixth season that managed to captivate the imaginations of the audience as if hed been there all along . Then again , he feels like he s been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We can see now where we made our mistake in assessing him . It was in assuming that Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce had some sort of credentials review process in place . Really , guys . Somebody needs to bring that up at the next partners meeting . Apparently , nothings changed in the 14 years since Don Draper glad-handed his way into a job . Because at the end of the day , that 's what the MUCH-discussed Bob Benson turned out to be : Gay Don Draper . Or more accurately , Gay Dick Whitman. - No , he was n't the upper-class striver we figured him to be , nor is he the sociopath , government agent or secret illegitimate child some others thought he was . He turned out to be pretty much what we said he was back in the first Mad Style of the season , " another version of a younger Don coming into the story He resembles him to the point that he could pass for a younger brother and he 's got the same kind of 3-syllable alliterative name . Plus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger on an elevator . " - We just did n't  know how literal that assessment was and how the similarities went much deeper . Bob Benson is , in fact , a poor , gay hick who lucked into good looks and has been conning and sleeping his way through a series of jobs away from his embarrassing upbringing , exactly like Dick Whitman ( except for the gay part ) . And it turns out that , like Dick Whitman , his first impulse is to run away when he s discovered and start over again somewhere else . <p> We still do n't  think he s any great schemer , though ; despite the uncovering of his past . He s been working at SC for about a year now and all he seems to have ever wanted out of the place was a decent job where he could move up the ladder , just like Dick . Even when Pete made noise about throwing him off the Chevy account , his first impulse was to defer and be obsequious about it , rather than unleashing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had every intention to screw with Bobs future at SC because of his sexuality that he tried that incredibly clumsy attempt to get Manolo and Petes mother involved . But that was not the move of a master con man . That was the move of a desperate Dick Whitman with his back against the wall . He s never really made an effort toward any other goal than just moving ahead in his job- and trying to score with Pete Campbell , of course . That was his big mistake . If hed really been the master manipulator people thought he was , he never would have made a move like that . As we outlined extensively in the last Mad Style , being gay in 1968 was not a minor inconvenience ; it was something that could be used to quite easily destroy a life . To us , that declaration last week really was an honest one ; Bob really was in love with Pete ( or thought he was , anyway ) , he really is someone who lives a gay life outside that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and that move was exactly as risky as we said it was , because it turned out to be Bob Bensons downfall . <p> Or did it ? This season has been all about calling back to or echoing previous scenes from earlier in the shows history , as well as exploring the concept of doppelgangers . Bob is so obvious a double of Dons ( a bit too obvious , right down to the poor rural upbringing ) that Pete recognized it right away . But here 's where Pete differs once again from almost everyone else in this story : Pete learns from his mistakes . The last time he had a sleazy schemer by the balls like this , he let him go , choosing not to use the information to his advantage wisely . He went straight to Bert Cooper with the news of Dons secret identity and Bert defused the whole thing with a " Who cares ? " No , Petes no fool .

Pete knows that the Bobs and Dons of the world can charm their way through almost anything and that hed do well to hitch himself to a rising star ( EVERYBODY in Berts office defended Bob to Pete ) rather than trying to shoot it out of the sky . We have NO IDEA where this whole thing is going , but the odd twist at the last second into a psychosexual master-slave scenario is utterly mind-blowing . Pete may act like he s repulsed by Bobs proclivities , but he s clearly delighted to have his own little gay Don Draper doll to do as he s told . We were in love with our " Best Little Boy in the World " theory of the character but we have to admit , this twist is infinitely more interesting and as far away from Sal Romano as the show could possibly get in devising a new gay male character . <p> In other news , all the women in Dons life seem to want to slam doors in his face and run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her door open for him , and Megan who 's so clueless right now that even 1960-Betty would look at her and say " Honey , wake up and smell the shithead .

" Its not entirely clear if Peggy and Ted are having a full-blown affair or whether they 're still in the flirting stage , but one things for sure : they are the two most irritating people in that entire office right now . Peggy had every right to be upset with him for blowing up her shot at a Clio ( in her mind ) , but Don was n't entirely in the wrong here . Ted was stringing Peggy and the client along by not being forthcoming about the budget issues that come with her idea ( although we find it hard to believe shed need that pointed out to her ) and they both were acting fairly foolishly throughout the office . Its one thing when one co-worker comments on your flirting , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to your actions and how they 're coming across . <p> But let 's not pretend Don was doing anyone a favor here . Don was punishing Ted because the returns are diminishing on punishing himself. - But despite Peggys attempt to cast Ted as a " better " man than Don , he was being singled out and punished for doing exactly what Don did : allowing his affairs to spill out in the open , for other people to see . That 's the thing that offended Don so much ; not the budget concerns , but the way Ted put his arm around Peggys waist in the conference room or giggled through the hallways with her or went to the movies in the middle of the day with her . It was the sloppiness that offended him . And the fact that it was Peggy , of course . If Ted was acting that way with , say , Joan , Don might not have batted an eye . But Ted was playing around in Dons territory ( which is how he sees Peggy ) and decided to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He really is a monster . He seemed pretty deeply affected by the word when Peggy spat it out at him , but since he s so incapable of real change or introspection ( let alone making apologies ) we have no idea how the two of them can ever get back the friendly ( if contentious ) , mutually respectful relationship they once had . <p> And just to prove that she is every inch Dons daughter , Sally not only had a drink and a smoke this episode , but she too decided to punish someone else for Dons sins . She used groovy Glen Bishop to beat up his goofy stoner friend by claiming that hed tried to force himself on her . " You like to be trouble , " said the bitchy Marcia Brady-esque girl from Miss Porters , and were afraid we have n't even scratched the surface of that statement . " My father never gave me anything , " she says darkly to Betty as she drags on her first mother-daughter cigarette . We said last week that she was ripe for rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell-bottoms , flower-in-your-hair route so many predicted . For now , she 's going to fulfill all her mothers preppy Main Line dreams for her on the surface , at least . Shes declaring Betty her " real " parent while she severs ties from Don and tries to make herself into the daughter that Betty always wanted . But this image of the perfect preppy Miss Porters girl is belied by what happens in those dorm rooms at night . Sallys rebellion is going to be decidedly preppy and plaid in nature , but apparently no less full of drugs , sex and alcohol than a lot of people predicted . <p> Bullets : <p> Witness Don flipping through the channels , going from Corinne , the evil twin played by his wife on To Have and To Hold , and then to the original twin sitcom The Patty Duke Show , in an episode where his doppelganger is revealed . <p> Poor Kenny . Mazel Tov on the baby . A shame about your eye . Now we know why Stan had that Moshe Dayan poster over his bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it that the seasons been full of ominous , violent portents and in the end , it amounted to Abe getting stuck with a knife and Kenny getting sort-of shot in the face ? Mad Men just does n't  do literal . This is a show that embodied the British Pop Invasion in the figure of Lane Pryce , after all . <p> How many people yelled out " Those bastards ! They killed Kenny ! " Everyone ? <p> What the hell is going on with Joan ? Because no one , least of all her , is acting like she brought in Avon as an account . The suspense is killing us . <p> Its amazing how much cheating on their respective spouses with each other has improved Don and Bettys relationship . <p> We miss Stan , Ginsberg and Roger . Theyve all but disappeared from the story except to make very brief appearances here and there . <p> As fantastic as this episode was , were sick to death of Don slapping his dick all over Ted Chaough . This show does n't  really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wed like to see Ted tear Don down and humiliate him . <p> Bob has been infatuated with Pete since the moment they met . " You complimented my tie . It was the greatest day of my life . " Knowing his background now , his infatuation makes even more sense . Of course poor white trash like Bob would be enamored with a fussy blue-blood like Pete . <p> Were not so sure Peggys Rosemarys Baby ad was as Clio-worthy as Ted said . For one , it was creepy as hell . For another , ads based entirely on current pop culture references are n't  what one would consider a masterpiece of the form . Plop-plop , Fizz-fizz is a masterpiece because it was wholly original and ran for over a decade . Peggys St. Josephs Aspirin ad would be dated within 6 months . And we question whether any mother would find the ad , with its references to demonic babies , as comforting as it should be . Its bold , certainly ; but it strikes us as the wrong ad for that client . 
@@40422842 @422842/ <p> Adrianne Palicki in ABC TVs Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D . and Grant Gustin in The CWs The Flash <p> When the real world does n't  allow , or the shows do n't  give us enough reason to write full length reviews , were going to be working these Quickie reviews in where we can . Because we cant go too long without expressing opinions or we get constipated or something . <p> The Flash , " You Ca n't Outrun Everything " <p> This episode is exactly the kind of episode we had in mind when we started batting the idea of doing short , quickie reviews occasionally . Sometimes , an episode just does n't  give you much to discuss . That 's usually because its not saying anything new with the latest episode or because the show has lapsed into a routine . In most cases , that could be seen as an alarming lack of momentum on the part of the writing , but that 's not quite the case here , oddly enough . - If the cast , especially the lead , was any less engaging or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show has become formulaic so quickly could be seen as a major problem . Every week so far : Barry feels he needs to do something about a danger facing the city . Everyone tries to talk Barry out of doing something . Lots of speeches are made on the pros and cons of Barry doing something . Meanwhile , Iris really likes her boyfriend , who is not Barry . Finally , Barry does something , is heroic about it , and everyone smiles indulgently at the lessons learned this week . Then Harrison does something mysterious or eeeevil and were out for another week . <p> But- the strange part is , its fun . Even as we can see how repetiive its becoming , and even as we have a very nagging feeling about a show that gets repetitive in its first month of airing , we cant help but be charmed by the whole thing . Its so refreshing to have a superhero show that 's entirely about being heroic while fighting really goofy , weird , out-there stuff . That 's the essence of The Flash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to television . Even if its too formulaic at the moment , its a formula were very happy to see . <p> Besides , we have good reason to believe that it wont stay in any rut for long . The particle accelerator explosion is the hook upon which this whole season rests , so in the first few weeks of the show , they have to establish a pattern of metahumans appearing as a result of the something-something science . Our point is , they 're at a stage where they have to throw a metahuman villain of the week at him just to establish that hook . And we feel like they 're right on the verge of a narrative breakout . We try not to give too much away , knowing what we know about the DC comics the show is based on , but they really ramped up the easter eggs and references last night , giving us reason to believe were going to see a lot more weirdness very soon . Keep your eye on that supposedly dead Ronnie guy , is all were saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father while in costume strikes us as a pretty huge deal with a lot of potential fallout down the line . Bottom line : were feeling it . All of it . Except for the West family , we have to say . Iris is still annoyingly clueless and defined solely by kissing scenes . And while we love Jesse Martin , we really do n't  need to see Joe tear up emotionally every single week . For a detective , he sure is emotionally fragile . <p> Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. , " Hen in the Wolf House " <p> BOBBI MORSE IS IN THE HOUSE . And she got the best introduction any character on this show ever got . Part of that 's on Adrianne Palicki , who knows not only how to make an entrance , but how to make the most of the material shes given . But part of it also comes down to the marked uptick in the quality of the writing ; not just in season 2 , but since season 2 started . We do n't  want to get ahead of ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative energy that fizzles out quickly , but this show is literally getting better each week . And the addition of Bobbi " Mockingbird " Morse makes it feel a bit more like were really playing around in the Marvel universe now , instead of some generic " Spy vs . Spy " scenario . If nothing else , it made the nerds happy . And only the nerds would see the irony of her introduction coming only a couple weeks after Arrow killed off the Black Canary character . <p> The scenes in HYDRA as Bobbi first tried to intimidate Simmons and then dropped her cover and got her out , were genuinely exciting , which struck us as ironic , since the bulk of them were set in a bog-standard , flourescent-lit , corporate drone cubicle farm . We 've long been complaining about the art direction on this show and we will continue to do so , because a unique look could only help it but those scenes in the office , like last weeks hotel room beatdown , show that sometimes , you just need good actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Itll be interesting how they handle yet another ass-kicking woman on the show . On the surface , she and May seem pretty similar , in terms of what they bring to team . With the ongoing ( and still not quite successful ) rehab of Skyes character into something very like the standard-issue Whedon ass-kicking girl , were just thankful they 've kept Simmons unique as the brainy type . And in another example of how the shows writing has improved , the Fitz and Simmons reunion was simply the most emotional moment any two members of the cast have managed to produce . It was pitch-perfect and it worked because theyd finally made us care about the characters enough to have an emotional reaction . The only problem was , it was dropped a little too quickly . After everything theyve both been through , a bit more would not have been unwelcome . But how fabulous is it that were getting such wonderful emotional payoffs at all , right ? Who could have predicted such a thing after last seasons ten miles of bad road ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both entertained and optimistic , we had Kyle MacLachlan tearing into the scenery and ripping out huge chunks of it with his teeth . Another actor who knows exactly how to make the most out of material like this . One of the best things about this season is that they 've built an actual world around these characters and then populated it with people on the periphery , like Raina or General Talbot , to use as the story sees fit . Its a very Whedon thing to do , and its a huge improvement over the weekly succession of random guest characters last season . Everything feels like its part of a plan on the creative team and its all humming along nicely . 
@@40422843 @422843/ <p> Our story starts here , when Stanley , the little girl with the dreadful tattoos , and the other one were invited , through my own largesse , back to New York from whatever backwaters they live in , to compete for my attention and affection . And also a prize of some sort . <p> Now , I love all these delusional little scrappers , but some more than others . I 'm only human , after all . <p> Yes , really . <p> And when I say " love , " I mean " respect . " And when I say " respect , " I mean I try to remember their names . <p> To my surprise and disappointment , my beloved Stanley showed up for Fashion Week with nothing but bolts of fabric and a pile of zippers and closures . <p> Disgraceful . Had I known this was going on , I would have had him removed from Manhattan . <p> But hope remains . Perhaps the little hyperactive bald one I sent over will help him out . <p> The little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very prepared and focused in her work . How drearily predictable . Wheres the fun ? The spontaneity ? The psychotic breaks we all love so much ? <p> This would n't do , so I sent her the cute girl to help her out and also to distract her a little . <p> Honestly , I thought she was a lesbian . I swear someone told me that . <p> The other one was " prepared " in the sense that she arrived with piles of what she called " garments , " but frankly , it just looked like a bunch of- stuff you 'd sell out of the back of a van at a Phish concert . <p> Not that I , Nina Garcia , Creative Director of Marie Claire magazine and best-selling author , have ever been to a Phish concert . Heavens , no . A little joke on my part . <p> Anyway , I do n't  like the other ones work very much so I sent her the chubby girl as a helper . Its tragic how much weight that poor girls put on since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! These things are n't  hard . <p> While I was sleeping , our dirty little contestants were getting up so early that only working class people were walking the streets . I had them sent over to Lincoln Center , where their dreams and my judgment awaited them . I made them stand silently inside an empty tent for hours . <p> It builds character . <p> Anyway , we filled the tent with gawkers and sponsors so that someone would clap when their little scraps of fabric walked the runway . I managed to keep an interested look on my face the entire time . Cameras present , you know . <p> My heart was filled with joy to be reunited with leading fashion designer and CFDA winner Michael Kors , because the German and the little boy were really getting on my nerves with all their talk about " Who needs more clothes ? " and " Maybe we should give the prize to that other one , with the scarves and the horse hair . " <p> I mean , honestly . I tried not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they act like they know what they 're talking about . <p> But the German must have done something to poor Michael . Or maybe he was just exhausted from his own Fashion Week preparations . Whatever the reasons , reason seemed to have left him . He too turned on Nina Garcia and tried to tell her that the one with all the hair was somehow worthy of being called a fashion designer . <p> I did my best to offer a reasoned response to their insanity ; to get them to see that I would rather burn the Marie Claire offices to the ground than feature Stevie Nicks old wardrobe in our pages . <p> I admit , I got a little angry and used some profanity . I 'm not proud of it . But sometimes , the world of fashion needs a warrior to defend it from flighty German supermodels and little boys who say foolish things like " Who needs more clothes ? " <p> Is there disgust on my face ? I 'm trying to keep it off , but I fear I never was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heidi and the little boy are easily distracted and I used the mind tricks taught to all leading fashion editors in order to bring them to heel . How else do you think we convince the public that things like rompers and sheer skirts are wardrobe essentials ? Fashion editor mind trickery . <p> So while the German and the little boy talkedtalkedtalked away to Michael , convincing him to join their cause , I merely stared forward and concentrated really , really hard , molding their sponge-like minds to my liking . I got a nosebleed out of it , but at least the right person won . Her tattoos and hats are hideous , but I 'm pretty sure I can do something with a couple of her pieces for the magazine ; something that wont embarrass me . <p> And there you have it . Thank you for coming on this journey ; a journey inside the mind of Nina Garcia , Creative Director of Marie Claire magazine , best-selling author , and anti-horsehair advocate . Youve heard everything I have to say on the collections , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Bloggers , " is it ? I 'll let these so-called " bloggers " express their own opinions . <p> My assistant will see you out . <p> Congrats to Michelle ! We really did n't  think she was going to win it , even though we thought she was the clear winner . Stanley seemed to be getting the winners edit , but we did n't  see how it was possible , since he was so ill-prepared and his clothes so pedestrian . Then it looked like they really were going to give it to Patricia , but after a while , it sounded to us like the judges were just being devils advocates to the idea that Patricia has a place in the fashion world . And while its true she does and even Nina agreed on that point it was clear to us that she 's not ready to be called a great fashion designer . Great textile designer , yes . But despite what Heidi tried to pull , that 's not what this show and competition has ever been about . <p> Best look on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; focused on what she 's trying to say and not getting bogged down with a lot of what Nina called " tricky " details. - Just a gorgeous , beautifully made , unusual look . <p> We did n't  love the tan and yellow combo as much as the judges , nor did we love this look as much as they seemed to . Its still pretty great , but the color combo does n't  work for us and the front pleat on the skirt does n't  really do much for it except distract you from the rest of the- details . <p> Maybe too simple , but she needed to put a couple " breathers " in between all the **25;277;TOOLONG looks . At least it ties in with the rest of the collection nicely . Cohesion was one of the biggest selling points on this collection over the other two . <p> Gorgeous . Totally did not agree with the judges on the ties . A lot of women-in-ties looks are unimaginatively androgynous , but she kept the femininity while still using an iconic male accessory to finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's just nothing interesting about that shape , and the colors turn it drab . <p> We still think the hem and the breastplate needed rethinking , but its still a really great , unusual look that fits perfectly into the collection . In fact , its something of a mission statement piece ; it sums up Michelles aesthetic nicely . <p> Still love it ; still think she could have removed some of the hardware and bags . <p> This is probably the most conventional look in her collection . It was smart of her to do something easily understood while still making it look like it belongs with the rest of the pieces . <p> Still love the sweater and pants , still do n't  get the chaps . <p> Adore the pants ; not in love with the top . Its too stiff and we really hate that neckline . <p> LOVELOVELOVE this look . That sweater is chic . The whole look is chic . We did n't  agree with the judges when they trashed the hat . We think the hat is what takes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he said this should have been cut down to a dress . That would have instantly corrected the proportions , which seem a little off to us with that squared-off plunging neckline she favors . <p> In the end , it was a nice surprise for us to have our pick for the win actually win . We can count on one hand the number of times that 's happened with Project Runway . Well get to the other two collections later today .
