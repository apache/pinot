@@25472526 @5472526/ <h> Wolters Kluwer Reviews State Tax Treatments of Retirement Benefits <p> ( NEW YORK , NY , January 2017 ) While the allure of warmer weather or being close to family are major factors in selecting a place to retire so is calculating the best places to stretch a fixed retirement income . A little pre-retirement homework on state tax treatments of retirement benefits and other financial factors can be a key step in deciding where to establish new , post-career roots . Specific factors to consider include : <p> Two other states New Hampshire and Tennessee impose income taxes only on dividends and interest ( 5 percent flat rate for both states ) . <p> In the other 41 states and the District of Columbia , tax treatment of retirement benefits varies widely . For example , some states exempt all pension income or all Social Security income . Other states provide only partial exemption or credits and some tax all retirement income . <p> States exempting pension income entirely for qualified individuals are Illinois , Mississippi and Pennsylvania . <p> States that exempt or provide a credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas , Colorado , Delaware , Georgia , Hawaii , Iowa , Kentucky , Louisiana , Maine , Maryland , Michigan , Missouri , Montana , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , Ohio , Oklahoma , Oregon , South Carolina , Utah , Virginia and Wisconsin . <p> States where pension income is taxed include : Arizona , California , Connecticut , District of Columbia , Idaho , Indiana , Kansas , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Nebraska , North Carolina , North Dakota , Rhode Island , Vermont and West Virginia . <p> ( See chart below for additional detail . ) <p> Significant State Tax Reforms <p> States enacting changes to their income tax laws for retirement plans in 2016 include : <p> New Jersey : The gross ( personal ) income tax exclusion on pension and retirement income is increased over a four-year period from $20,000 to $100,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly , from $15,000 to $75,000 for single and head-of-household filers , and from $10,000 to $50,000 for married taxpayers filing separately .

This exemption applies to single taxpayers with federal adjusted gross incomes of up to $80,000 and for joint taxpayers with federal adjusted gross incomes of up to $100,000 that are otherwise qualified ( these amounts will be adjusted annually for inflation ) . ( Change is effective beginning with 2017 tax year . ) <p> South Carolina : A new deduction for military retirement income is allowed . For taxpayers under 65 years of age , the deduction is $5,900 for the 2016 tax year , but increases by $2,900 each year until it is fully phased-in at $17,500 in 2020 . For taxpayers 65 years of age or older , the deduction is $18,000 for the 2016 tax year , but increases by $3,000 each year until it is fully phased-in at $30,000 in 2020 . ( Change is effective beginning with 2016 tax year . ) <p> While some states tax pension benefits , only 13 states impose tax on Social Security income : Colorado , Connecticut , Kansas , Minnesota , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dakota , Rhode Island , Utah , Vermont and West Virginia . These states either tax Social Security income to the same extent that the federal government does or provide limited breaks for Social Security income , often for lower-income individuals . ( See chart below for full detail on State Taxation of Retirement Income . ) <p> State Income , Property , Sales Taxes Can Add Up <p> In addition to state taxes on retirement benefits , other taxes to consider when evaluating financial factors on where to retire include : <p> State income tax rates:For example , income tax rates also can have a significant financial impact on retirees in determining where they want to live and can vary widely across the country . <p> While seven states have no income tax and two tax only interest and dividend income , several have a relatively low income tax rate across all income levels . For example , the highest marginal income tax rates in Arizona , Kansas , New Mexico , North Dakota and Ohio are below 5 percent . Some states have a relatively low flat tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 4.63 percent ) , Illinois ( 3.75 percent ) , Indiana ( 3.23 percent ) , Michigan ( 4.25 percent ) and Pennsylvania ( 3.07 percent ) for 2017 . <p> State and local sales taxes : Forty-five states and the District of Columbia impose a state sales and use tax ( only Alaska , Delaware , Montana , New Hampshire and Oregon do not impose a state sales and use tax , although some Alaska localities do ) . States with a relatively high state sales tax rate of 7 percent include Indiana , Mississippi , Rhode Island , and Tennessee . California has a state sales tax rate of 7.25 percent . Local sales and use taxes , imposed by cities , counties and other special taxing jurisdictions , such as fire protection and library districts , also can add significantly to the rate . <p> State and local property taxes : While property values have declined over recent years in many areas , it has not necessarily been the case for property taxes . However , many states and some local jurisdictions offer senior citizen homeowners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tax deferral , refund or other benefits . These tax breaks also are available to renters in some jurisdictions . The benefits typically have qualifying restrictions that include age and income of the beneficiary . <p> State estate taxes : Estate taxes also can influence where seniors want to retire . Rules vary from state to state , as well as from federal estate tax laws . While some states , such as Delaware and Hawaii , follow the federal exclusion amount ( $5,450,000 in 2016 and $5,490,000 in 2017 ) , others do not . The latter category includes Illinois ( $4 million ) , Massachusetts ( $1 million ) , and New York ( $2,062,500 for deaths on or after April 1 , 2014 , and before April 1 , 2015 , and $3,125,000 for deaths on or after April 1 , 2015 , and before April 1 , 2016 ; and $4,187,500 for deaths on or after April 1 , 2016 and before April 1 , 2017 ) . <p> Other states , including Arizona , Kansas and Oklahoma , no longer impose an estate tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have such a tax on their books , but collect no revenue because their tax is based on the now-repealed federal credit for state death taxes . In general , this is an area of the law that has been in a considerable state of flux in recent years and will probably continue to be so in the foreseeable future . <h> State Taxation of Retirement Income <p> The following chart shows generally which states tax retirement income , including Social Security and pension income for the 2016 tax year unless otherwise noted .

@@25472574 @5472574/ <p> A New York City corporate income taxpayer 's protest against a notice of determination was partially denied as it had substantial intercorporate transactions with its related corporations and was , therefore , required to file combined general corporation tax ( GCT ) returns . The taxpayer was a wholly owned subsidiary of a corporation that had a registered investment advisor and a broker dealer as its other subsidiaries . The taxpayer provided advisory services to one of the subsidiaries in return for annual management fees . The Department of Finance determined that the taxpayer had substantial intercorporate transactions and therefore was required to file combined GCT returns . The taxpayer argued it was not required to file combined returns as it only served as a common paymaster and provided limited back office support to one of the subsidiaries , and that even if there were substantial intercorporate transactions , there was no distortion because the prices were comparable to arm 's length transactions . The taxpayer further stated that the payroll factor was overstated because the department excluded only one general executive officer from the computation , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the receipts factor was overstated because one subsidiary 's services were treated as if they were rendered in the City whereas they were actually performed in Birmingham . The administrative law judge ( ALJ ) noted that the taxpayer 's substantial intercorporate transactions with the other corporations led to a presumption of distortion in the tax year 2008 , and that the taxpayer 's transfer pricing analysis failed to rebut it . For 2009 and 2010 , under the law as amended , combination was required where there was common ownership and substantial intercorporate transactions . Accordingly , the taxpayer was required to file combined GCT returns for the tax years at issue . However , the ALJ noted that the department erred in computing the payroll factor by concluding that there was only one general officer and in computing the receipts factor by not eliminating intercorporate transactions and not sourcing receipts to where the services were rendered .

@@25472591 @5472591/ <p> A motion to vacate the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals ' ( BTA ) decision reinstating a county auditor 's property tax assessment of a taxpayer 's property was dismissed because the BTA lacked jurisdiction to vacate a decision after the statutory deadline for appealing decisions had passed . The taxpayer acquired the property after the Board of Revision had reduced the assessment following a complaint by the then property owner but before the BTA reinstated the original assessment after an appeal by the board of education . The taxpayer argued it did not receive notice of the appeal even though it owned the property at the time the appeal was perfected . While , generally , the BTA loses jurisdiction to vacate its decision if the appeal period expires without an appeal having been filed , the only exception for the BTA to grant a timely motion to vacate is when it statutorily fails to transmit a decision to a person entitled to notice . In this case , although the records indicated that a copy of the decision was sent to the taxpayer 's tax mailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any such copy . However , there was no evidence that the copy of the decision was returned as undeliverable , or that the BTA had a reasonable way of knowing that the bank , which held a mortgage on the property and was the taxpayer 's tax escrow agent , would not forward the BTA 's decision to the taxpayer . While the taxpayer argued that the bank had no legal obligation to inform it of the BTA 's decision , there was no law that required the BTA to search for another viable address when the taxpayer had already provided an address for tax purposes . Due to the absence of actual notice to the BTA that the taxpayer 's tax mailing address was invalid or that a different address should have been used , the BTA 's notice was reasonably calculated , under all the circumstances , to apprise the taxpayer of the decision rendered .

@@25472629 @5472629/ <h> IRS Will Not Reject Returns Failing to Report Health Coverage Status <p> The IRS will continue to process individual returns that fail to indicate the taxpayer 's health coverage status under the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) ( P.L. 111-148 ) , the Service has announced on its website . The IRS apparently had intended to reject these so-called " silent returns " this filing season . <p> The ACA generally requires individuals to have minimum essential health coverage or make a shared responsibility payment , unless exempt . Government coverage , such as Medicare and TRICARE , and most employer-sponsored coverage is minimum essential coverage . Coverage obtained through the ACA Health Insurance Marketplace also is minimum essential coverage . <p> Taxpayers indicate if they had minimum essential coverage for each month of the tax year by checking a box on their return . If a taxpayer did not have coverage and was not exempt , he or she is required to make a shared responsibility payment with the return . Some taxpayers have failed to indicate their coverage status on their returns , the IRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olson told Congress that the IRS planned to reject returns where the taxpayer did not report if he or she had minimum essential coverage , did not claim an exemption , or did not make a shared responsibility payment ( TAXDAY , 2016/07/08 , I.3 ) . This change by the Service , according to Olson , was to be made during the 2017 filing season . <p> In the meantime , President Trump issued Executive Order 13765 ( TAXDAY , 2017/01/24 , W.1 ) . The executive order relays that it is the policy of the Trump administration to seek " prompt repeal " of the ACA . President Trump instructed the heads of federal agencies " to waive , defer , grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the ACA that would impose any cost , fee , tax , penalty , or regulatory burden on individuals . " <p> On its website , the IRS explained that it will allow electronic and paper returns to be accepted for processing when a taxpayer does not indicate his or her coverage status . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected by the IRS at the time of filing , allowing the returns to be processed and minimizing burden on taxpayers , including those expecting a refund , " the agency reported . The Service added that taxpayers may receive follow-up questions and correspondence at a future date , about their coverage status , after the filing process is completed . It also emphasized that its revised treatment does not change the underlying legislative provisions of the ACA that remain in force , including penalty payments , until changed by Congress <p> The IRS left open the question of whether it would revise other aspects of ACA compliance during this filing season . The announcement on processing silent returns began with the statement , without elaboration : " The IRS is currently reviewing the Jan. 20 , 2017 , executive order to determine the implications . Taxpayers should continue to file their tax returns as they normally would . "

Olson on January 10 released the NTA 2016 Annual Report to Congress . In the report , Olson recommended that the IRS revamp its " Future State " plan in order to adopt a taxpayer-centric focus and urged Congress to emphasize simplification when it considers tax reform in 2017 . The report noted that voluntary compliance , worldwide taxpayer services , geographic focus and a Taxpayer Bill of Rights ( TBOR ) are necessary elements of the Future State . It also contains a list of the most litigated taxpayer issues , Taxpayer Advocate Service ( TAS ) research and related studies and legislative recommendations . <p> Olson noted that the IRS was responsive to concerns she raised in the 2015 report to Congress about the Future State , including the Service 's operations and interactions with taxpayer . The Service has made Future State information available on its website and has provided assurances that it will continue to provide telephone and face-to-face services , should taxpayers choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of an evolving approach than a static plan , Olson suggested , based on discussions with taxpayers and stakeholders during the 12 public forums held around the country , as well as focus groups and nationwide surveys , that " the IRS adopt a fundamentally different approach to tax administration . " <p> " This is arguably the most important piece I have written about the IRS in my 15 years serving as the National Taxpayer Advocate , " Olson wrote in the report . She presented a series of proposals intended to improve tax administration , placing particular emphasis on changing the culture of the IRS . " To create an environment that encourages taxpayer trust and confidence , the IRS must change its culture from one that is enforcement-oriented to one that is service-oriented . " <p> Among the proposals suggested , Olson recommended putting taxpayers first ; instead of placing an emphasis on enforcement , funding should be directed toward meeting basic taxpayer needs . Placing an emphasis on service and trust can increase tax compliance , Olson believes . She noted that taxpayers who seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated as tax evaders . " This treatment in turn breeds resentment and increases the risk that the taxpayer who was willing to comply is no longer willing to do so . In this way , the underlying assumption by the tax agency that taxpayers will evade tax becomes a self-fulfilling proposition . The agency ends up converting a compliant taxpayer into a noncompliant one . " <h> Tax Simplification <p> The report noted that the TAS examined the current tax code 's compliance burdens and found that individuals and businesses spend approximately 6-billion hours a year complying with filing requirements , not including IRS audits or notices . Complexity " rewards taxpayers who can afford expensive tax advice and discriminates against taxpayers who can not , " according to the report . <p> Several areas of complexity that Congress should address were highlighted , including : repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax for individuals ; consolidating the family status provisions in the tax code ; consolidating at least 12 incentives to save or spend for education ; consolidating at least 15 incentives to save for retirement ; simplifying worker classification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or reducing procedural incentives to enact tax provisions that expire and require periodic renewal ( sunsets ) ; eliminating or reducing the gradual phase-out of tax benefits as income rises ; and streamlining the more than 170 civil penalties contained in the tax code . <p> The report also addresses the need for the IRS to further incorporate the Taxpayer Bill of Rights into its operations . In addition , despite improvements in fraud detection and identity theft , the Service needs to improve the accuracy of its determinations to avoid significant refund delays for taxpayers . Finally , the report raises concerns about questionable legal advice given by the IRS Office of Chief Counsel regarding the implementation of the private debt collection program mandated by Congress

@@25472641 @5472641/ <h> How to solve your client portal usage problem <p> Its a common problem . You dutifully set up portals for all your clients , - but come tax time , your clients still want to exchange documents via email or , even worse , hard copies . When clients get accustomed to one way of doing things , it can be hard to switch directions . Email is convenient , after all . And some people just cant break the paper habit . So once you 've committed to increasing efficiency and improving security with portals , how do you promote client portal usage ? <p> A recent whitepaper , 7 secrets to portal success , outlines best practices for implementing portals . When you implement portals in your firm , success depends on a number of factors . Low client portal usage is possibly the most important- cause of a problems . You ca n't force a client to use a portal , but there a few ways to plant the seeds for success . <h> 1 . Make sure clients- know they have a portal . <p> Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was created . However , its possible to suppress this email if you want to notify clients some other way or at a different time . For clients who are used to paper communication , some firms prefer to send a hard copy mailer first . If you suppressed the automatic welcome emails , make sure you remember to manually send them later . And it would n't hurt to send a reminder email once a year before tax season if your client has not been regularly using the portal all year . <h> 2 . Make sure clients- can find the portal . <p> Your firms website is often the first place clients look when they want to contact you . Make sure your portal is integrated into your firms website so clients can easily find it . This could be as simple as a link in the corner of the home page or a dedicated login page that integrates the Portal login screen . Offering a mobile app is a great way to add convenience for clients with smartphones and tablets . Depending on the circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the ability to upload an image from the clients mobile phone . <h> 3 . Make sure clients know how to use the portal <p> For the most part , a portal should be intuitive enough to use without a lot of training . However , some clients who are n't  as tech-savvy may need a bit of help getting up to speed . A link to a simple user guide on the log in page and in the welcome emails can be a welcome resource for these clients . Youll have the best results if your portals do n't  require clients to download any special browser plug-ins or complicated navigation . <h> 4 . Make sure your staff uses the portal <p> The more your staff uses the portal to communicate with clients , the more comfortable your clients will start to feel . If clients need to log in to the portal regularly , it will start to become routine . Your staff will be more likely to use portals when they are easy to use . That means being able to publish documents with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the document management system easily . If you are only using portals once a year to deliver tax returns , your clients may never realize the added value a portal can provide . <h> 5 . Acknowledge that some clients may never use the portal <p> No matter what you do , some clients will- have more trouble with portals than others . While some firms require all business to be conducted through the portals , many other firms make exceptions . How hard you push your clients to use their portals will vary depending on your firms goals and your client base . You may consider a formal policy for opting out of portals or look at each client relationship on a case by case basis . <p> Regular client portal usage is one of the most important factors in successfully implementing portals .

@@25472646 @5472646/ <p> Modifications to variable prepaid forward contracts ( VPFC ) did not constitute sales or exchanges pursuant to Code Sec. 1001 ; the open transaction treatment afforded to the original VPFCs under Rev. Rul. 2003-7 , 2003-1 CB 363 , continued until the transactions were closed by the future delivery of the stock . Further , the individual did not engage in constructive sales of stock under Code Sec. 1259 in the tax year at issue because there was no exchange of the extended VPFCs for the originals under Code Sec. 1001 . <p> Comment . A VPFC is a variation of a standard forward contract , requiring the forward buyer ( usually a bank ) to pay a forward price ( discounted to present value ) to the forward seller on the date of contract execution , rather than on the date of contract maturity . In exchange for the cash prepayment , the forward seller becomes obligated to deliver to the forward buyer : ( 1 ) shares of stock that have been pledged as collateral at the inception of the contract ; ( 2 ) identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collateral ; or ( 3 ) an equivalent cash amount . The actual number of shares ( or cash equivalent ) to be delivered by the forward seller is determined by a formula which takes into account changes in the market price of the underlying stock over the duration of the contract . <p> Under Rev. Rul. 2003-7 , VPFCs are open transactions when executed and do not result in the recognition of gain or loss until future delivery . The IRS agreed that the original contracts satisfied the requirements of Rev. Rul. 2003-7 . However , the IRS argued that the extensions to the original contracts resulted in taxable exchanges of the original VPFC under Code Sec. 1001 . The IRS also argued that the extensions to the original VPFCs resulted in constructive sales of the underlying shares of stock under Code Sec. 1259 . <p> Contrary to the IRS 's argument , the individual contracted for the right to receive cash prepayments in exchange for his obligation to deliver shares of stock ( or cash ) on specified future dates . After the individual received his cash prepayments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock or the cash equivalent . He did not retain any further property rights with respect to the contracts . Thus , when the individual extended the settlement and averaging dates , he had no right to receive anything more ; all he had were obligations that might increase or decrease in amount . <p> Moreover , the contractual provisions allowing the individual to choose settlement with stock or in cash and to substitute collateral did not equate to property rights . Those provisions did not have any value that the individual could dispose of in an arm 's length transaction . Further , the ability to substitute collateral was not absolute ; it was subject to the approval of the counterparties . Thus , the contractual provisions were not property rights but rather procedural mechanisms designed to facilitate his delivery obligations .

" At this point , we have heard no intention from the majority to hold a hearing after you release legislative language , " Levin wrote . <p> In addition , various town hall meetings during the congressional recess during the week of February 20 have revealed some resistance by constituents to repeal without a replacement that may not provide benefits similar to those under existing ACA provisions . Democrats have remained critical of GOP efforts to repeal the ACA before first putting forth a replacement plan ( TAXDAY , 2017/01/11 , C.1 ) .

@@25472730 @5472730/ <p> The Florida Court of Appeals ( court ) held that the trial court improperly determined that the countys ad valorem tax liens were superior to those of assessment liens of a community development district ( CDD ) because the liens were coequal . According to statute , the CDD liens are " coequal with the lien of state , county , municipal , and school board taxes . " The CDD argued that because its assessment liens were coequal with the countys tax liens , the tax collector should not be allowed to issue tax certificates while the CDD owned the parcels because it would " wipe out " its coequal assessment liens . However , the statute permits the tax collector to issue tax certificates subject to the CDDs liens . Consequently , the court held that the trial court had properly authorized the tax collector to issue tax certificates that will be subject to the CDD 's assessment liens.

These regulations define the activities that generate qualifying income from activities involving minerals and natural resources as set forth in Code Sec. 7704(d) ( 1 ) ( E ) . The regulations are effective January 19 , 2017 . <h> Background <p> Under Code Sec. 7704(a) a PTP is treated as a corporation . In Code Sec. 7704(c) , Congress provided an exception to this rule if 90 percent or more of a PTP 's gross income is " qualifying income . " Qualifying income is typically passive-type income , such as interest , dividends and rent . However , under Code Sec. 7704(d) ( 1 ) ( ( E ) , qualifying income also includes income and gains derived from the exploration , development , mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of minerals and natural resources . <h> Final Regulations <p> The final regulations are divided into seven parts . The first part establishes the basic rule that qualifying income includes income and gains from qualifying activities with respect to minerals or natural resources . The second part defines " mineral or natural resource " consistent with the definition set forth in Code Sec. 7704(d) ( 1 ) . The third part defines and identifies the specific component activities that are included in each section of Code Sec. 7704(d) ( 1 ) ( E ) . The fourth part provides rules for determining whether activities that are not listed in Code Sec. 7704(d) ( 1 ) ( E ) are " intrinsic activities " that require significant services by the PTP with respect to a Code Sec. 7704(d) ( 1 ) ( E ) activity . The fifth and sixth parts provide a rule regarding interpretations of Code Secs . 611 and 613 ( dealing with depletion of minerals and natural resources ) in relation to Reg. -1.7704-4 . The last part provides that the final regulations apply to income received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 , 2017 , but also contains a 10-year transition period for certain PTPs . <p> Other changes made by the final regulations in response to comments received include the following : <p> Definition of Mineral or Natural Resource . Code Sec. 7704(d) ( 1 ) defines the term " mineral or natural resource " as any product of a character with respect to which a deduction for depletion is allowable under Code Sec. 611 ; except that the term does not include any product described in Code Sec. 613(b) ( 7 ) ( A ) or ( B ) . The regulations adopt , almost verbatim , the same definition but also included fertilizer , geothermal energy , and timber in the definition . In response to comments received , the regulations also include liquefying or regasifying natural gas on the list of qualifying transportation activities . <p> Code Sec. 7704(d) ( 1 ) ( E ) Activities . Commenters recommended that the final regulations provide a general description of the eight listed active terms in Code Sec. 7704(d) ( 1 ) ( E ) ( exploration , development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marketing ) followed by a nonexclusive list of examples of qualifying activities . The Treasury and the IRS recognized that there would be practical difficulties of ensuring comprehensive coverage of activities generating qualifying income and adopted this approach in the final regulations . <p> Mining or Production . The final regulations clarify that the proposed regulations ' definition of mining or production activities includes only extraction activities . In addition , activities that convert raw mined products or raw well effluent products that can be readily transported or stored fall within the definition of processing . <p> Processing and Refining . Although the proposed regulations had combined the terms " processing " and " refining , " the final regulations separated the two terms in order to better clarify the activities that generate qualifying income . The regulations do not provide a general definition of " refining , " but instead set forth the activities that qualifying as refining activities under the specific rules for the different categories of natural resources . <p> Transportation . The final regulations clarified that ownership or control of the assets used to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action being performed is within the definition of a qualifying activity . Also , the regulations explain when transportation to a place that sells to retail customers or transportation directly to retail customers is a qualifying activity . <p> Marketing . Marketing is the bulk sale of minerals or natural resources , and products produced through processing or refining , and includes activities that facilitate sales . The final regulations continue to provide that marketing generally does not include retail sales . <p> Hedging . The proposed regulations did not address whether income from hedging transactions was qualifying income . However , the issue was raised by commentators ; therefore , the Treasury and the IRS are requesting comments on the methods to account for the income and gains , as well as the deductions and losses , with respect to hedges .

Here , the contractors that purchased and used the parts to repair the taxpayer 's machines were also the parties that used the parts , not the taxpayer . Thus , the contractors , and not the taxpayer , were liable for use tax due on the parts . Further , the taxpayer used a gas chromatograph , and a computer and printer attached to the chromatograph , to test the various chemicals it produced .

One week prior to the decedent 's death , the decedent 's son transferred cash and securities from the decedent 's revocable trust to the LP . In exchange , the decedent received a 99-percent limited partner interest . The son , as general partner , had the sole discretion to determine the amount and timing of partnership distributions . With the written consent of all partners , the LP could be dissolved . After the decedent was declared incapacitated , the son , acting on her behalf under a power of attorney , transferred the LP interest to a charitable lead annuity trust ( CLAT ) .

About nine years later , the government began placing liens on the property of the estate and the beneficiary/executor . The estate sent , by certified mail , a request for a collection due process hearing at around the same time that the federal government was shut down in October 2013 . <p> Following the stipulated decision in the Tax Court , the government assessed the new tax amount due . The suit to collect the unpaid tax was filed more than 10 years after this assessment date . However , the limitations period was suspended while the collection due process hearing was pending . The beneficiaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until after the 10-year limitations period had expired when they sent a letter to the government requesting the hearing and citing the certified mail delivery receipt as evidence that the request was received in a timely manner . The duty of consistency applied because : ( 1 ) the beneficiaries represented that the government received their request ; ( 2 ) the government accepted the certified mail receipt as evidence of the timely mailing and gave the beneficiaries a hearing ; and ( 3 ) the beneficiaries represented in the litigation that the hearing process was not initiated on the date the request was received but much later when the beneficiaries sent the letter . Rejecting the argument that the duty of consistency only applied in situations where taxpayers took inconsistent positions in different tax years , the beneficiaries ' representation sought to delay collection . In addition , the inconsistency was a question of fact , when the hearing notice was received , and the government did not have access to all of the facts since the beneficiaries had the certified mail receipt . <p> The beneficiaries ' claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reply to the beneficiaries ' counterclaim that the beneficiaries failed to mitigate , not failed to prove damages . The district court denied the claim because the beneficiaries did not provide evidence that the government 's collection action resulted in damages . Normally , when the district court ruled on a grounds for summary judgment that was not advanced by the parties , the appellate court would vacate and remand on that issue unless it was harmless . However , the beneficiaries did not carry their burden of asserting new evidence to negate harmlessness.

The couple argued that the Tax Court is not an independent agency within the executive branch and , therefore , the president 's limited removal authority violates separation of power principles . However , the president 's authority to remove Tax Court judges for cause does not violate separation of powers principles because Tax Court judges do not exercise any powers reserved to Article III judges . Thus , the president 's removal authority can not interfere with the Article III judicial power regardless of the Tax Court 's placement in the branches of government . <p> Comment .

For example , in response to the opinion issued in P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Tax Court is an executive branch agency , Congress amended Code Sec. 7441 to provide that the Tax Court is not an agency of , and is independent of , the executive branch of government . <p> The Tax Court 's jurisdiction is limited to adjudication of public rights disputes ; disputes between a sovereign and a subject that are not suits at common law , in equity or admiralty . Therefore , Code Sec. 7443(f) does not give the president the authority to interfere with Article III judges , who hear private rights disputes . Moreover , the president 's authority to remove only for cause is specifically crafted to prevent the president from exercising a coercive influence over a public official who may be removed only for good cause . The current removal statute also provides a role for the Judicial Conference of the United States , which is required to recommend removal of a Tax Court judge on the basis of inefficiency , neglect of duty , or malfeasance in appropriate circumstances . <p> Finally , the Court had jurisdiction to hear the couple 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to disqualify all the Tax Court judges from hearing its petition for redetermination was barred by the Rule of Necessity , which holds that where all are disqualified , none are disqualified .

Generally , if an activity engaged in by an individual is not operated for profit , no deduction attributable to such activity is allowed . Although all expenses and winnings from the activity were submitted by the taxpayers to their tax preparer in a handwritten summary and they saved receipts for those expenses , they failed to show that they used the receipts as a tool to slash expenses or to boost profit . The taxpayers ' automobile racing activity ran at a loss for 17 consecutive years and the expenses far outstripped the income , thereby showing that the taxpayers could never recover their losses and could not have sustained the activity without substantial income from the other sources . Also , the taxpayers did not maintain books or written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not create annual budget and expense forecasts , revealing their inability to make informed business decisions , to ascertain the breakeven point , or to determine how to make a profit .

According to Chairman Steven Chabot , R-Ohio , the Committee is working closely with Ways and Means members and Chairman Kevin Brady , R-Tex. , to ensure small businesses are " front and center " of tax reform efforts . <p> " There are a number of specific provisions in the current tax code that directly penalize the risk-taking entrepreneur , " Chabot said during opening statements .

" Equity financing for many start-up businesses is simply not available , " he testified .

@@25472791 @5472791/ <p> A majority of the Tax Court , sitting en banc , concluded that it had jurisdiction over an individual 's petition because a notice of deficiency ( NOD ) sent to the individual was valid , despite an ambiguity as to the amount . The NOD stated that the taxpayer was not entitled to a claimed refundable credit , but showed a deficiency of zero on the first page . The majority opinion noted that all that is required for a valid NOD is that it fairly advise the taxpayer that the IRS has determined a deficiency and that it specify the year and amount . <p> When deciding if a NOD is valid , the court looks at the notice and all of the attachments as a whole .

Because the NOD stated that the IRS was disallowing a refundable credit , and that such a disallowance creates a deficiency in tax , and after the initial page identified the amount of that disallowance , the taxpayer was not misled . This was sufficient to give the Tax Court jurisdiction . <p> One concurring opinion criticized the majority 's employment of both objective and subjective tests , stating that reference in prior case law to the taxpayer 's subjective knowledge was dicta , and that the only standard was whether the IRS made a determination with respect to the taxpayer which conferred jurisdiction on the court .

The proper test , according to this opinion , was whether the IRS made a determination ( a substantive matter ) , and whether the IRS issue a NOD pursuant to that determination ( a procedural matter ) . If both of these events occurred , then jurisdiction exists . This opinion also found fault with the majority 's conclusion that , because the party seeking to invoke the court 's jurisdiction bore the burden of proof , the IRS had to prove that the taxpayer was not misled .
