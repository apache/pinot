Really good . <p> Its simple , nothing expensive . Quick . To the point . Anyone can do it . <p> You might already know the tip if you follow along on Snapchat- or Insta . Lately its been so efficient for me to immediately share products I like immediately with you guys via these Apps . I am a human guinea pig . I try things all the time for you guys . There are so many things I never share because they suck . If I choose to share anything know that I like it , I use it , I believe it . If I do n't  , I do n't  share it . Easy . <p> Anyway , the tip- let 's get to it : AN ACUPRESSURE MAT . <p> Its kind of like a little bed of nails ? <p> Michael introduced me to the product . <p> Michael has this problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd actually . He orders too many books , weird contraptions ( do we really need a crockpot &amp; hot chocolate maker ? ) &amp; random vitamins ( without asking me&amp; we have to send half of them back because they 're GMO or bullshit ) . So this is one time his Amazon problem came in handy : the bed of nails arrived . <p> I am one of those people who knows what I like &amp; do n't  like . And I can tell you the second I laid down on the acupressure mat , it was true love . Mind/body connection right away . My body loved it , my mind loved it . Sold . <h> Let me back up . <p> What exactly is an acupressure mat ? Well , so glad you asked because I have research everything &amp; anything you need to know . <p> An acupressure mat stimulates the body to release endorphin hormones which have a soothing effect on the mind &amp; body . The mat- improves muscles to recover from workouts , and improves sleep instantly . Theyre- portable &amp; light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that , the- mat can help reduce pain in shoulders and hips VERY quickly . Also the mat is known to help deal with fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndrome . <p> Some- benefits of acupressure : help the body repair itself and heal itself from stress , back pain , sciatica pain , fatigue , muscle soreness , &amp; insomnia . According to many sources , " the power of acupressure has long been a best kept secret among those who believe in alternative medicine due to its immediate effect of reducing back pain . The mat is very lightweight and portable and can be taken with you anywhere . " <p> Oh , you should know when I say neck pain , the mat also comes with a little pillow for your neck . I am psycho &amp; love it so muchI actually slept on it a few nights in a row . This is craziness . I do n't  know if I recommend sleeping on it . Really 10 to 30 minutes is all you need . MANY sources say " a- daily use of 20 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your body . " <p> But I will say , the nights I slept on it , I felt GREAT in the AM . Again , I 'm intense &amp; weird . <p> Since using the mat ( for about a month &amp; half ) I 've noticed : better sleep , less stress , less neck pain/muscle tension ( &lt;&lt; from a car accident when I was 18 ) . <p> I like to use it before I go to bed . I take a book &amp; read on it while my neck hangs over the pillow &amp; my back is flat on the mat . The whole thing is very therapeutic &amp; relaxing . <p> Another tip from my friend , Erica : she has HORRIFIC back pain ( she 's a blogger &amp; co-founder of our company , blog-doo so she 's on the computer A LOT . Erica if you 're reading this : TAKE A BREAK FROM THE COMPUTER MAN ) . Anyway , she 's found that sitting on the mat while she 's at the computer has taken so much stress of her back ! If you 're in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portable . Just add it to your chair &amp; work . I promise you wont be disappointed . <h> Let 's talk about usage : <p> You can use them anywhere . I like to use them in my room on the carpet by the bed . Its recommended to use the mat in the morning when you wake up but I like to use them before bed BECAUSE I feel like they help with sleep ( some people say they wake them up ) . I use mine everyday . Also , I 've brought mine while traveling too . <p> Huge note : you should do deep breathing while laying on the mat too . Sometimes the- MAT gives slight pain in beginning seconds- but after that they start relieving any pain- &amp; stress . If you feel more pain with bare skin while using the acupressure mat , you can wear a thin tee-shirt . <p> but I go topless . HA . <p> Lastly , drink a LOT of water after- you 're on the mat . <p> I like hot peppermint tea post-mat too . <h> BUT Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Lauryn , does it hurt ? " <p> Well . I eat garlic cloves &amp; do n't  think they taste bad but a lot of people do ? <p> Sodoes it hurt to me ? No , not at all . Reviews online mostly say it feels good . I 'm not sensitive . I like THE MOST DEEP , DEEP TISSUE massage ever when I go to the spa SO maybe I 'm not the person to ask ? <p> Personally I think it feels amazing . Like orgasmic . Endorphins are going . I love it . Like I said , I sleep on the pillow . If anyone thinks it hurts , weigh in . <p> Oh &amp; please excuse Pixy &amp; Boone . They were being very , VERY bad during this shoot . In fact , Boone insisted on putting his black , wet nose in the camera lens like 100 times so I figured his display needed to be shared on TSC . Weirdly enough , they step on the mat a lot . Do n't  think I 'm crazy but I take the pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to LOVE it . They must love it because its stimulating blood flowwhich makes endorphins go crazy . <p> Ok , I 'm certifiable . <p> We are in Aspen &amp; off to dinner at Cache Cache- for some spaghetti &amp; dry red wine . If you have any Aspen recommendations , please let us know ! <p> OMG I NEED THIS ! I 've genuinely never heard of this ! My neck has been bothering me so much lately *side-eyes baby who nurses all hours of the night and puts his mother in the oddest positions throughout* . Time to do some online shopping , methinks ! Thanks for sharing ! <p> I was given an acupuncture mat as a gift last night and have used it sporadically due to laziness . I have a low pain threshold and I find that it did n't  hurt . It takes a couple of seconds to get used to but then after that , I 'm good . I use it for my neck and low back pain caused by a car accident years ago and it does help , when I do use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instagram about it . It hurts me so bad ! ! ! I can breathe through it for about 10 minutes , then I am done . My husband loves it though . He says it immediately relieves the stress of the day and when he gets up he can feel a high from it . I am going to keep trying and hope I toughen up . I really want to love it . Thanks for sharing your ideas . Love to try out your suggestions ! <p> Okay honestly Lauryn is this has completely changed my life . My neck/upper back pain has TRANSFORMED since I bought this after seeing it on your instagram . Seriously guys lauryn is the real deal when it comes to recommendations . I trust her 100% and this is just another reason to trust her . You should all look at her post on the eminance licorice root serum too because I swear by that now . Lauryn if you have any further recommendations sign me up ! <p> I ordered a mat when you first mentioned them and it arrived today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 minutes . And OMG I feel amazing ! ! ! I struggle to sleep alot so I 'm looking forward to seeing what impact it has on my sleeplessness . Thank you Lauryn xx <p> I got this immediately after you posted it on snapchat and it has already changed my life ! I get horrible back pains from sitting at a desk and computer all day , and 20 minutes on the mat and my back pain was gone ! Its seriously incredible . I like the idea of bringing it to work and sitting on it . You always find the best stuff ! I 'm obsessed with this.Thank you for sharing ! <p> Just ordered this yesterday after reading this post ca n't wait to try it ! This is the first I 've heard of them , but they seem like an easy and convenient way to get the benefits of acupuncture without having to schedule an appointment ( time is precious ! ) Thanks girl , your recommendations have never failed me <p> Thanks for the post about this ! I was dying to know your thoughts since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to try acupuncture in the first place . LOVE it BTW ! Looks like a lot of others got the memo before me , because the link you posted is sold out . Gah . <p> This sounds awesome ! This mat is something a lot of people could truly benefit from especially those like me who sit in front of their computers all day . Would you happen to know if there 's a weight limit on it ? <p> Hello Lauryn , acupressure theory is best to solve our all body pain related problems . It gives point pressure to each muscle that helps to recover our body pain . These tips are very helpful for us . Thanks for sharing these amazing tips . <p> Ladies . I searched all over and found both sides . I ordered this and used it once and then found out I was pregnant . Can I use it still ? I am dying to get back on it , but do n't  want to do so if its harmful in anyway . 
@@3098157 <p> here 's the thing : my skincare regimen is so simple , its almost painful how simple it is . <p> It involves a lot of rose hip or avocado oil ( I switch it up ) , &amp; this serum . If I have a zit , that 's a different story . But to be real I do n't  get a lot of zits because I do n't  overdo it on the product . <p> I 'm getting off track but seriously SERUMS . This brightener is a serum . And the best I 've tried . Plus its organic . The line , Eminence is my favorite too . Such great products . <p> So 6 months before the wedding I started using this serum about 6 times a week AND WHEN MY WEDDING CAME AROUND THE MOUSTACHE WAS- GONE . <p> GONE GONE GONE . <p> I really did n't  want to do a brown moment while walking down the aisle , so this was incredibly ideal . <p> If you 're struggling with a brown mustacheor perhaps you have a brown spotted forehead ( I 've been there too ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sorry . <p> I 've actually been so excited to come back &amp; do this post because if there 's one thing about The Skinny Confidential its that I want to provide value . Things that work . Things that are n't  23948723987429 dollars . Things that anyone can use with insane results . <p> I highly recommend getting a raw , cold-pressed oil &amp; trying these two together with an all-natural bar of soap . Right now I 'm obsessed with this goats milk &amp; honey soap . Really , it smells like graham crackersWHAT IS BETTER ? <p> Other than that I feel like my routine is very low maintenance . Its not hard . It takes about 30 seconds in the AM , 30 seconds in the PM . <p> &amp; for any lucky bitches that do n't  have mustaches , you 'll still want this serum because it brightens . <p> By the way : I 've found to avoid coconut oil on the face . My girlfriend , Erica , told me that it clogs the pores because of its thick consistency . So stick with avo or rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Snapchatting my 30-second nightly skincare routine this week so make sure you 're following along ! I want to make sure Im showing you guys the exact breakdown . Username is @laurynevarts . <p> Ok SO in the upcoming weeks you can expect A LOT OF BRIDAL , WEDDING , CABO posts . BUT no fear , this is n't turning into a full-on wedding blog . Like I do n't  want to make you projectile vomit . Do n't  want to overdo it on the couples thing . Just want to showcase the details in a pretty , valuable way ! <p> Ill sprinkle in other tips , tricks , recipes , &amp; randomness &amp; come mid December things will go back to normal . Good ? <p> Michael &amp; I are overwhelmed with all your incredible wedding messages honestly the wedding week would n't have been the same without having you guys along for the ride .

ENJOY ! <h> 55 comments Leave a Comment + <p> Until I read your post about Moustache Syndrome I did not knew there is one . I also have moustache but not so much as hair just like a brown thing , like you said . I thought its because once I took my moustache and then I went in the sun and it got tanned . hahha So silly I am ! My problem is that my skin is really pale so you can easily see my brown moustache situation . I will look into the serum you recommended . Thank you for the idea ! <p> I 've used oils on my face , after washing with either soap or cleaning with wintergreen rubbing alcohol . Many times I 've been complimented on my skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache that bothers me most . Thank you for writing this , I 'll try the serum <p> Love this ! As of lately ( and credit to you ) . I have been putting rosehips on my face / neck AM PM . I have also been putting jojoba oil on my body instead of lotion after dry brushing . I love the simplicity of it all and how these oils do not contain any chemicals . Can not wait to see the results . I will be adding the serum to my routine as well . Thank you ! ! and nowI patiently await your WEDDING EXTRAVAGANZA ! <p> Thank God your back ! And I am a single lady and I cant wait to hear about all of the details of the wedding and seeing you two in love ! I love it ! ! ! ! ! ! This post is amazing , buying this product already use the Rose Hip oil bc you told me too and i love it ! My skin thanks you ! This coming from a 31 year old ! xoxo Tiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't  worried about it being a wedding/coupley blog but you just got married and we want to see it all ! Ive been following you for years and weve all seen you get engaged and plan the wedding , now we want to see it at least i do , I 'm obsessed with all things wedding ! Congrats to you and michael ! Hope your life if full of laughter , car ride hand holding , first class work travelling , endless blogging success and more dogs <p> Inspirational as ever Lauryn ! Love how simple your skincare is with great results indeed . I feel like i spend way too muchwill give your way a try . Thank you for keeping us in the loop during this exciting/special time in your life ! You are appreciated ! <p> Thanks for sharing Lauryn ! I do n't  have this problem , but a couple of my girls always complain about this issue . Thank God there 's is resolution ! I know what I will be getting for their Christmas gift . <p> Hey Lauryn ! First of all congrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = Per all of your fabulous recommendations I 'm looking forward to trying this serum . Question about using the oils ( rose hip/avocado ) on your face/body . I notice when I put the rose hip oil on my face it leaves a bit of a layer of oil that never fully sinks in making me feel oily . Is that normal or does it sink right in for you ? Do you use them on your body instead of lotion as well ? <p> Hi Lauryn ! I feel better knowing I 'm not the only one out here with this unattractive mustache ! I am african american and dark skinned . I tried a product called sunday rileys good genes and it irritated my skin ( thankfully i did n't  actually buy it bc it retails at $105 ) i tried to get rid of my stache before my Cali trip and it was no bueno . I wanted to know if you applied this serum to just the LIP AREA or the entire face ? ? Also , I LOVE oils too . <p> I use Boscia tsubaki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil on my face and pimples came in addition to it being that time of the month . I had a feeling it mightve been due to the switch in what i was putting on my face . Thanks for the recommendations ! I also have avocado oil so ill see how that works . <p> Do you have any suggestions for pimples ? Sorry for the long comment ! ! lol <p> Per usual I love your post . Its simple , to the point , and oh so valuable . Ive been trying to simplify my routine with oils and this just answered so many questions . So would this serum work for minor acne scars ( discoloration ) , I 'm going to try it regardless but was just wondering if you had any input . <p> Hey ! Do you think this would work on dark under-eye circles ? I 've tried another cheaper brand of collagen eye masks you posted a while ago but they do n't  brighten , just reduce puffiness and my circles are DARK ! So can you use this serum around the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I got a facial last night and my facialist used all eminence products and I bought their skin starter kit ! Extra excited to try it out now that I know it has your stamp of approval . Okay oil question : I started using organic , pure rosehip oil on my face and I broke out . I gave it a good two weeks too so that my skin could get used to it . Do you think I was using too much oil ? Or is it one of those things that it may not work for my skin ? I have dry skin so I was surprised that my skin reacted negatively ! Would love your input . Thanks Lauren and CONGRATS to you and Michael on your wedding . Loved the drama . Xox <p> Good job for not doing what I did before my wedding to attack my brown forehead spots , which was to use an Rx cream from my derm to lighten them and then neglect to tell my eyebrow waxer this at my pre wedding appointment . A huge chunk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely forehead scab at my wedding . Terrible . <p> Hey Lauryn ! Thanks for this . I love oils lately I do have some acne so I used to fear them making me more oilycomplete opposite ! I 'm curious what all-natural soap you use on your face ? I have been using Cetaphil but would love a recommendation for a face soap ! P.S. CONGRATS on your wedding . Ca n't wait to see the gothic deets ! <p> This is EXACTLY the post I have been waiting for ! THANK YOU ! I have been using rose hip oil for a while now after reading about it on tsc and a few other places and I just love it , but I need a little extra something for my pesky acne scars ! Ca n't wait to try ! Always looking for new organic products to improve my SIMPLE skincare/ beauty routine ! ! Keep them coming please ! ! <p> I have used this products for my face and believe it or not it has improved my skin in just 15 days . After suffering form acne my skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternatives but still there was no improvement in the skin . I tried this and my skin has shown improvement in just few days . I would like to recommend to my family and friends <p> Lauryn ! This is a great tip . Do you think it would work for that dark shadow around your eyes ? ? Not under eye circles .. like the dark eye lid syndrome . RACCOON eyes , if you will . Def going to give it a try ! <p> Hi Lauryn ! I love this post I am always about trying new skin care products . I previously bought the rose hip oil after reading one of your posts on it and at first I noticed a big improvement in my skin . I use it at night as a night cream mixed with retinol . I do n't  have any hyper-pigmentation but I do have dark scaring on my face from the years of struggling with acne . Do think this serum will reduce the appearance of dark spots from scarring ? <p> Thank you , Lauryn . You rock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product or treatment to cure my mustache pigmentation that stayed after pregnancy . Everyone just brushes me off saying I am being over dramaticpfff ! They clearly have n't seen me without makeup . I am ordering this a.s.a.p . I appreciate you keeping it real , and this is the reason why I follow you ! P.s . It does n't  hurt that you 're a fellow Aztecclass of 08 over here . Xo <p> Ugh I have this stupid stache as well . People always ask if I got lipliner tattooed on lol definitely not . Quick question ! Did you use the serum on your whole face or specifically your upper lip ? Thanks so much ! This post is extremely helpful ! 
@@3098159 <h> The Makeup Hack of A Lifetime <p> Updated : October 5 , 2016 <p> by <p> LAURYN <p> Are you ready for the makeup hack of a lifetime ? <p> Ok , so have you ever applied your foundation like this : open bottle , squeeze foundation on top of hand , grab makeup brush or beautyBlender , &amp; then proceed to use the top of your hand as a makeup palette ? <p> Everyone right ? <p> Well , I do this every time I apply makeup . <p> &amp; every time , I REPEAT : EVERY TIME , I think to myself " fucking gross , I do n't  want this makeup sitting on my left hand ( right-handed , so think brush in right ) in the same spot . " <p> To be honest , I do n't  want the makeup on my face in the first place because who knows what 's in it . Side note : I try not to wear makeup every day . I REALLY TRY to eliminate a bunch of weird shit on my face every day ( &amp; pimples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get over the makeup on the hand thing . <p> There are not a lot of options for this when you 're in a rush though . You kind of have to use your hand/fingers . <p> Especially in my case , because my favorite CC cream on the planet ( if you have n't tried- this CC cream , you have n't lived . JUST MAKE SURE its the illumination one I use the- light shade ) is liquid &amp; comes squeezing out of the bottle . <p> OK , so one day I 'm in New York working with this CRAZY talented makeup artist &amp; she pulls out this tiny teal heart . While she 's chit-chatting , she proceeds to wrap it around her hand , kind of like a huge-ass rubber band . <p> AND THEN GUYS , she squeezes her foundation out &amp; puts it on the teal heart surface &amp; starts using this tiny contraption as a little palette with her makeup brush . <p> You know like an artist . A painter . So very Van Gogh . <p> Shes like blotting it &amp; moving it around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like she 's cooking or something . <p> NOW WHAT is going on ? Obviously- I was very much intrigued . And sure , I may have asked- 108 questions because I knew immediately that I had to share it with my Internet friends . YOU . <h> Some of my questions ( her answers in italics ) : <p> WHERE DO I GET THIS ? - Etsy . A small little online store . The girl makes- them herself. - <p> DO YOU USE THIS EVERY TIME ? Yes , I cant live without it . Especially for day long projects on celebrities or influencers or editorial shoots . Its reusable . <p> WHY DO YOU LOVE THIS ? Because- it protects the hands from makeup &amp; you do n't  get crap all over your clothes . AND what 's also amazing is you can use it as a lipstick , foundation , OR an eyelash glue palette . Its perfect to use with a beautyBlender or makeup brush . No makeup on hands , EVER . You do n't  have to wash the palette every time . I wash it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SO I DECIDED IMMEDIATELY : IM GETTING ONE . CANT WAIT . <h> This hack saves my life because WHITE . Yes , I wear a lot of white . <p> I 'm one of those girls that does her- makeup all cute with a beautyBlender- using my- left hand as a palette and then casually throws on a white dress , then accidentally touches my white dress with foundation hands . <p> Always happens . Highly annoying . <p> The palette- eliminates this foundation-y situation &amp; preserves the whiteness of my linen off-the-shoulder tops . PLUS , no more makeup shit on my hand , day after day . No mess , no crap . <p> Not to mention , I 'm always having problems with fake lashes . The fake lash application happens about once a month but STILL . The glue is always everywhere . When I use the Paw Palette- the glue does n't  stick everywhere . <p> This is adorable . But I 'm not quite sure how its that much different than using your hand ? I mean , you have to wash the pallet afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing something . I guess maybe the pallet washes more cleanly with no residue ? <p> The palette works better than a hand for me Jillian ! Its straight across and has a different texture than mixing products on the skin which I find better for application . Also , you only need to wash the palette once a week so its easier than your hand . When I use my hand for makeup I end up getting makeup stains on so many things ! Just a few reasons why I 'm a fan . Thanks for reading and your support with The Skinny Confidential : ) xx <p> Ummmm I seriously love you for this . I do this DAILY on my hand , and everytime I get so annoyed . It makes me feel so dirty and before I know it , I 'm staining my shirts , my boyfriends shirts ( he gets SO mad ) , getting makeup on my cat , and its just a mess all around . This is a serious game changer and something I NEVER would of thought of even existed ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make-up , if you will ! Soooo my beauty hack is right up your alley , but I add a few drops of tea tree oil to my beautyblender before applying my cc cream to keep things clear ! It makes all the difference ! = xx Shannon <p> I 'm so in love with this ! ! My foundation almost absorbs into my hand and leaves a stain if I 'm in a rush and do n't  have time to scrub it real good ( which honestly , I should be worried about what its doing to my face all day ) . Or I tend to forget its there and run my hands through my hair or something stupid . Super bummed the Batty Baby is sold ! I must have .

I know . This is the song that never ends . But honestly , these past two weeks have been CRAZY . So much so in fact that I had to take a step back . <p> Hey , we 've all been there . There 's nothing special about feeling exhausted . Everyone burns out from time to time . The difference this time , though , was the way I decided to deal with it . <p> Nothing happens to you , you create your surroundings &amp; I was creating a chaotic setting . You 're in charge of your life &amp; it was time I addressed the elephant in the room . Because normally with everything going on , I 'd sweep it under the rug . <p> Really though guys I 'm like that dog who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; his convo balloon says : I 'M FINE . <p> Typically , I 'd power through .

We 've all been there . <p> So I decided to cut myself a break &amp; STOP . <p> Ultimately , I need to be healthy . <p> This realization allowed me to see the need for some serious mental clarity : more sleep , more reading , more resting , &amp; SWEAT &amp; STRETCH . <p> One night , I was supposed to do a huge blog post . Instead , I randomly ended up on a mat . <p> I gave myself a break . I was n't feeling posting content that night .

I needed to sit with my thoughts . <p> Since then I am feeling clear headed because I 've made it a point to take time for myself and SWEAT/STRETCH . <p> Another cool epiphany was the realization that sweating is really not about losing weight or even toning up . It 's about your mind too . If you 're going to take care of your job and your relationship and your body why would n't you take care of your mind ? <p> I wrote a reminder by my- bed . Just a note to myself that reminds me every day to take care of my mind . To keep it sharp . There 's nothing weak about taking an hour of the day to work on your mind .

It 's kind of my workout go-to . Especially the heather gray zip up . Purple has been the theme around here lately . For some reason I love it . Heather gray &amp; purple together are really the ideal combo there 's something about the colors that complement each other in the best way . This getup is from Lululemon .

I love Frame workout studios in London and their motto is " Move your frame " so I adopted that as my motto- whether that be climbing , yoga , taking a walk round the block , or going for a run ; I was going to do something gentle every day to get my body moving ! Its had such a good impact on my mental health- just being able to get a tiny dose of self-care in every day . I love your attitude to it ! <p> Lauren , you hit the nail on the head with this one ! !

Ive been full of ruts galore this year and it makes me less &amp; less active and I 've noticed a direct correlation on my mood . Ive been stretching more in the evening before bed and that helps .

@@3098162 <h> G - G - G - G - G <h> Hi guys , its Carly ! <p> Becoming a mom has been the most incredible experience of my life . I always knew I wanted to be a mom and I love my boys so much it hurts ! There is really no feeling like it . All that said , being a mom is HARD . Taking care of little people can be overwhelming and at times , just plain exhausting . I want to share five practices that make mommyhood a little easier for me. - <p> Establishing some set routines and practices throughout my week makes it possible for me to take care of my people ( myself included ) as well as all the other important stuff that needs to be handled when you 're a mama . - <h> CARLYS TIPS FOR MAKING #MOMLIFE MANAGEABLE : <h> MORNINGS <p> I try to make every morning very similar because kids crave structure . One of the favorite times of the day for my family is morning time . Breakfast is our time together . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner , by the way ) wakes up everyday with Rio . I usually nurse Dante then head downstairs shortly after . <p> Rio often helps me make smoothies and we drink those first , then Rio and Adam play while I make breakfast . We make green smoothies and a big breakfast every morning , religiously . I think drinking green smoothies daily has impacted our health tremendously and it only takes 5-10 minutes , tops . So its doable , but if you are really crunched for time in the mornings you could make a batch at the beginning of the week and freeze them . This morning routine gets our day off to a good start and because Rio is getting so many nutrients right at the beginning of the day , I know he will function well regardless of what happens the rest of our day . <p> I realize mornings are busy for a lot of people , but this works for us . Making green smoothies has become therapeutic and drinking them helps all of us feel awake and alive . We all feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothie/breakfast routine gives us time to talk about the day ahead and Rio always knows what to expect . We also have a bedtime routine that we stick to very closely after dinner time . Having some sort of routine throughout the day helps kids feel secure and keeps me feeling sane . <h> ESSENTIALS- <p> By essentials , I mean the stuff that really HAS to get done . Sunday- is my day for this . I usually go to a yoga class then hit up my favorite farmers market &amp;- one grocery store - ( Trader Joes or Costco are usually in rotation ) . My husband knows that yoga is essential for me to feel healthy and grocery shopping is something I really enjoy doing on my own . So we work it out so that on Sundays , I usually have a good 3-4 hour block all to myself after breakfast . This time is sacred to me . Going to these markets alone is so helpful because I do n't  feel rushed and I can focus because I do n't  have to worry about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MUST get done during the week in order for their world to work . Figure out what things you can get done with the kids in tow and what things you need to do on your own . Then work with your partner to figure out a plan . Most days of the week I ca n't make it to a yoga class or the gym , so I do a walk with my double stroller . I love walking and being outside when I exercise so I 've figured out a way to do it with the kids and it 's a great workout . <p> Prioritizing what is essential for me has really helped me figure out how and when to get it all done . <h> SELF CARE <p> Self-care is about finding some time to do what makes me happy . Going to the farmers market and grocery store does make me happy , but they are also essential errands . Taking care of yourself means finding some time to do the things you enjoy , things that are wants , not needs . Maybe this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without kids , getting a pedicure , reading or writing , going to the gym or to a coffee shop , going to the library , getting your hair done , or getting a massage or facial . <p> I get a massage once a month and it is heavenly . And because I know its just once a month , I really look forward to it . It is in the calendar and nothing ( well almost nothing ) trumps it . All mamas have different things they want to make time for . <p> For me , it 's important to find a couple hours a week where I 'm doing something by and for myself . <h> MEAL PLANNING- <p> Feeding my family healthy meals is extremely important to me . In order to do this , I need to have a plan . I start by thinking about what I made the previous week so that I can do different things the next week . Throughout the week , I make a grocery list in my phone as I think of things or come up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much completed . I have separate lists in the notes section of my phone for every place I shop . These lists include everything I purchase from each store I frequent . I usually put a checkmark next to what I need for that week . This is super helpful to me because I used to always forget things I needed or forget the list entirely . <p> Since we eat a primarily plant-based diet , I always try to switch up the veggies I use weekly . I try to buy what is in season at the Farmer 's Market and go from there . I always make sure I have 4-5 different veggies to work with for the week . Examples of veggies I almost always have include spinach , carrots , onion , celery , sweet potatoes , zucchini , bell peppers , cucumbers , tomatoes , and broccoli . Plus a couple different greens like kale , collards , romaine or chard for smoothies . Since I have a Tower Garden , I do n't  always have to buy my greens . I buy eggs at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch up the fruit I buy every week and I always have tons of bananas ( for smoothies and baking- bananas are so versatile ! ) and always frozen fruit ( organic strawberries and blueberries from Costco ) for our smoothies . I always have apples ; Rio and I each eat one a day . I make sure my pantry is stocked with items like brown rice pasta , lentil pasta , beans , oats , lentils , nuts , rice , marinara sauce , quinoa , etc. - I plan meals for the week based around what veggies I have . <p> Mom Tip : If I 'm stuck or not feeling creative , I rely on my good buddy , Google . I type in the ingredients I have to work with and I can almost always get a fresh idea or recipe . Or I just text Lauryn for ideas . <p> I usually only plan 4 dinners a week . We usually have leftovers a couple times that week and maybe take out or out to dinner once a week . For breakfast we always have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with veggies/seeds/healthy fats . Lunch is usually light because we have huge breakfasts-think hummus and veggies with apples and nut butter , avocado toast , or maybe if we had oatmeal for breakfast we would do eggs for lunch and vice versa . Sometimes we eat lunch on the go , so sliced bell peppers , cucumbers and blanched green beans are easy veggies to throw in a baggie and eat without making a mess . I always put an apple in our lunch bag too , and maybe a Mamma Chia pouch or a Perfect Food Bar . <p> Planning meals for the week makes life so much easier . <h> DATE NIGHT- <p> Sometimes I 'm so busy momming ( It should be a word , do n't  you think ? ! ) that I do n't  feel like I have time to connect with my husband . Fortunately , my parents are amazing and offer to help us all the time with my kids , so we recently scheduled a date night every other Wednesday . Dressing up &amp; taking time for ourselves has been a game changer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have family around , so we rarely had a night out . I can totally relate to anyone who does n't  want to leave their kids with a sitter . I am that mom . One really great thing my husband and I did when we were in that situation was had a date night IN . On Friday nights after putting Rio to bed , I would make dinner or we 'd get take out , open a bottle of wine and talk . We would eat at the dining room table without TV and hang out together while the baby slept . We had to make it a point to catch up and connect . - We looked forward to Friday nights all week . <p> " Date Night " does n't  always have to happen at night or even away from home . Its about making time for each other every week , regardless of when , where or how . We are convinced that our weekly dates keep our relationship healthy . <p> These are the things that help me stay on top of my mom game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't forget to take care of your own needs ! <h> Our babies will be better for it . <p> G - G - G - G - G <p> Huge thanks to Carly for all her mommy tips ; ) . If you guys are mamas you got ta follow her on Instagram : @thepreggerspantry- &amp; on her blog . Be sure to follow along on Snapchat because I 'm going to see her Friday &amp; you guys will meet her two kids , Rio &amp; Dante ! <p> Great post ! I follow Carly on IG and love seeing her little family I was wondering if you guys ( Carly or Lauryn ) have any additional green smoothie recipes to recommend ? I make the collagen smoothie almost every morning and I 've made Carlys lactation smoothie a bunch of times ( I 'm currently 7 months pregnant ) but I would love to mix it up a bit . I know I can find a bunch of smoothie recipes onlinebut I would prefer to get a recommendation from you two b/c then I know it wont be full of filler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies ! You 're both awesome . xo <p> Loved this post because I can totally relate since I 'm a momma . I remember I had all of the time in the world to myself before my baby . And wow , did I waste time . Now , I value my mama alone time and I also make sure to schedule that in weekly . A massage , yoga , mani/ pedi , or even a night out with my girlfriends , its so important . When I get my alone time , I come home with gratitude , happier and more energized . <p> I made a great many resolutions when my children were born . Some were vague , if heartfelt : I 'll take good care of you ; I will keep you safe . Some were specific : I 'll breastfeed you for at least six months ; I 'll never hit you . It was a momentous turning point , the birth of a child , filled with pain and emotion . It was a date to remember forever . And so , of course , it was a time for resolutions . 
@@3098163 <h> In Defense Of Kylie Jenner <p> Updated : June 16 , 2016 <p> by <p> LAURYN <p> Been meaning to write this post for a year . <p> But sometimes it takes a year to wrap my head around things . <p> That 's just how I am . I take a hot minute to really think , absorb , OBSESS over what I 'm going to write about . If I 'm pushed in the wrong ways , I rebel . I cant help it . Currently working on it , trust me . <p> Ok so YES , clearly this post absolutely has to do with Kylie Jenner . <p> BECAUSE something is going on that 's HIGHLY ANNOYING . <p> ITS SO ANNOYING AND ITS RIDICULOUS . <p> I do n't  care if I 'm the only person on the planet with this opinion . That 's the good thing about blogging , its JUST an opinion . It does n't  hurt anyone . Regardless , I 'm just bursting with opinion on this subject &amp; really cant keep my mouth shut ( weird ) . <p> So what am I defending Kylie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's why Im annoyed : I log on to Facebook &amp; see SO MANY DAMN PEOPLE complaining about the Kardashians/Jenners . Specifically though , Kylie . They complain about her lips , her hips , her boyfriend , her dogs , her makeup , her outfits , her Snapchats , her car , her house , her wigs , her Instagrams , it goes on and on you get it . ZZZZZzzzzz . <p> And people are mad she 's making 100K an Instagram. but they 're still following her ? <p> Riddle me this : do you know how much money was spent on Super Bowl commercials in 2000 ? ANSWER : a shitload . <p> That 's right , like millions . <p> You want stats ? K. " A 30-second advertisement during 2000s game costs a cool $4.5 million . That 's an average of $150,000 per second . Commercials in the first Super Bowl in 1967 cost $42,000 . " <p> Just to put it in perspective . <p> Do you know why ? <p> Because . EASY : consumer attention . <p> The rate of the market goes where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the brands will follow . <p> So is it a fucking a surprise that Kylie Jenner is getting paid $100,000 an Instagram ? No . NO not at all actually . Essentially she 's a like a daily Super Bowl commercial . Tons of eyes watching her . DAILY . Consuming everything she 's doing , saying , wearing . If I was Coca-Cola , I 'd want Kylie sipping me on social media too . <p> Let 's go further though : when is the last time YOU , YES YOU , watched a commercial ? <p> Consumers are interested in social media in 2016 . Its where the eyeballs are at . Any brand in their right mind is following the eyeballs . <p> To be really honest with you , I believe that TV today is like radio in the 60s its on its way out . <p> Thats reality . <h> A reality which WEVE cultivated . <p> And we 've cultivated the massive attention on Kylie Jenner . <p> Its not Kylie Jenners fault . <p> In fact , if you had 100 million eyeballs on you , would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Let that sink in . <p> Kylie Jenner is a business woman . <p> Get comfortable with the fact that Kylie is in fact creating a new way of doing business . This is what the people want . Shes giving it to them . Its not an accident that she has 50 MILLION Snapchat followers or 63 MILLLION INSTAGRAM followers . <p> Face it : this is the time we are living in . <p> Embrace it or do n't  but this is what 's going on in the world . <p> My advice is : evolve . <p> Evolve with what the consumer wants . The consumer is over commercials . They want raw , real , authentic , real-time content . People are over the untouchable TV commercial and overly saturated &amp; boring advertising , in my opinion . Evolution is especially important if you 're running a business . Staying too much in your comfort zone is dangerous . EVOLVE WITH THE TIMES ! <p> Like I said , I 've been meaning to write this post for a while . <p> Its very frustrating signing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenner . <p> Shes simply giving the audience of 100 million what theyve cultivated . <h> 58 comments Leave a Comment + <p> I completely agree , in addition she 's not the only one making money on Instagram so why do people have such a problem with it ? If we werent so obsessed with it , it would n't be such an issue . People flip out over the most ridiculous things . Great post , and I have n't tried the lip kits . I have heard very mixed reviews . I really like the look of Dolce K though , it looks gorgeous . Which ones do you have ? <p> I just ordered my first lip kit and its on its way ! I love them &lt;3 But honestly , I do n't understand why there 's so much hate for the Kardashians/Jenners . Sure the TV show is n't exactly mentally stimulating , but that 's why people watch it , you know ? After 9 hours of work I do n't want to come home and watch documentaries about fish , I want something easy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean I 'm dumb or that I agree with their lifestyle , it 's just fun to watch . Sitcoms are n't necessarily intelligent humor either , but there 's not this much hate for Everyone Loves Raymond . It 's fun to see how the other half lives . I admire the family 's business sense I think they 're smarter than anyone gives them credit for . As for all of Kylie 's plastic surgery so what ? It 's her body . And if she was n't happy with it , I think we need to look at the beauty standards we tell people to look up to rather than criticizing the people who try to meet them . If she DID N'T have any work done people would STILL find things to hate on , so why not do whatever she wants to do ? I 'd DEF get some work done if I had the $$$ . Kylie could be doing a lot worse for herself ! <p> I feel the exact same way , people who complain yet follow her every move Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate ! Regardless , I am a big Kardashian lover and whether you love/hate them its undeniable that they are incredibly intelligent business women cashing in on just being themselves ! <p> You 're so 100% on this one ! If I do n't  enjoy a particular celebrity , I do n't  follow them period . Leaving nasty comments and complaining about them only brings negative energy to yourself . I always wonder how people find time in the day to leave comments for people who will likely never read them because they actually have lives . <p> YES to this . Clapping hands emoji to all of it . Luckily , some people ( i.e. Kara Swisher ) are at least beginning to recognize that Kim is a branding genius so maybe that will eventually trickle down to Kylie , should she decide to pursue the same route as her sister . <p> I have three lip kits and LOVE them . I think Kylie is brilliant and have nothing negative to say about her or what shes doing . I 'm sure if the haters had the opportunity to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more personal side on snapchat and I applaud her for it . After all , she 's just a regular woman like the rest of us ! <p> Preach ! All that hate simply comes from envy . Yes she 's was born into money but she 's legitimately working and building a business she 's passionate about- Still need to get my hands on one of those lip kits ! <p> Great post Lauryn ! You 're pretty much dead on and I too , if I 'm being honest here , will sometimes think negatively about a FB post or IG pic . However , I either stop following the person or keep it to myself ! I am annoyed though , I cant for the life of me get that dang lip kit ! ! ! ! Every time I go onto the site to order them the colors I want are SOLD OUT ! ! ! ! ! <p> well said ! and freaking AMEN . I 'm always baffled by the haters on social media say what you want about the Kardashians , but 1 ) they are extremely savvy businesswomen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  follow / subscribe / watch it ! <p> Oh Lauryn , I love , love , love this post . I completely agree with you that evolving is so important . One of my advice to friends as they say they want to start a blog ( which lol bc I 'm still learning as I go too ) is to follow the Kardashians/Jenners on social media . Seriously . They are marketing geniuses ( &amp; advertising is evolving and always will be ) and at the end of the day , the more people talk : good or bad , it just shows it is working . Right now , I think Kylie is my favourite . She is the baby of the family , so she has seen all of her sisters , including the closest to her , Kendall grow and evolve into fame so she was able to cultivate something that is hers totally agree that the lip kits are genius ( dying to get my hands on Heir &amp; So Cute ) . I 'm Team Kylie all the way and I HATE ( like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work done . ONE , she looks fabulous and TWO , that 's HER prerogative and a personal decision ( despite being famous ) and snarking on someones looks is just unbecoming , no matter how you feel about someone . Some of the best advice I ever got was from my father , and he was complaining about how things in his field were changing and he had to evolve.but then he stopped complaining ( pretty sure it was an act to make a point to me = ) and said " so I can keep complaining which gets me nowhere , or I can evolve , &amp; grow WITH it but at the end of the day , a new generation will be in this field year after year and will have no idea about the old practices even were bc it will be irrelevant so staying static without evolving is a recipe for failure " . That has stuck with me forever especially ESPECIALLY with blogging . <p> I absolutley 100% agree , but even more so ; people swear like they have a gun to their head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your facebook , instagram , snapchat , twitter feed then you cant handle the internet in general and need to stay off . Aside from Kylie , there are going to be offensive posts and blogs and tweets that you do n't  agree with , and if that 's the case its ok that you do n't  agree with it , but calm down mind your own business and move on to the next post . It is not necessary to obsess and dwell . You do know that it is entirely possible to move on with your life . <p> Haha right ? ! Not only with kylie with everything and everyone lately . If you do n't  like something just skip it do n't  follow that person and keep your nasty comments to yourself . Cyber bullying is just the worst , and its mostly coming from insecure people . <p> EXACTLY ! Shes amazing I think . Young , smart and absolutely gorgeous I think . So using all the attention to her advantage is nothing but a wise business decision . Shit , I 'd do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kind of trying to do the same thing ? Go Kylie . <p> Love this post . Kylie was born into a rich family . Who knows if she wouldve pursued fame if she was n't part of the Kardashian/Jenner clan but she 's created her own beauty empire out of the hand she was dealt . Shes also been through a lot recently ( her fathers transformation ) so at the end of the day people need to remember she 's still a real person with actual feelings . Hating on someone else only reflects poorly back on yourself ! ! Xoxo <p> This is a FABULOUS post . I 'm not a huge Kylie fan but I 100% respect the way she has expanded upon the empire her family continues to build and is making her mark in her own unique way . Shes a badass 18 year old . EIGHTEEN ! I cant even imagine being as business savvy as she is at 18 . It would be great if people could remove personal opinions about her long enough to recognize that she is a huge contributing factor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The playing field is changing and she is smart enough to evolve and take advantage of that very fact . Kudos to Kylie . On a side note , I really cant comprehend why people feel it necessary to throw shade and spew flat out hatred . If you do n't  like someone or something , do n't  look at it ! There is zero reason for the amount of negativity people project via social media . The only person that much hatred hurts is yourself . <p> Seriously .. best post ever . I 'm a marketing professional so I view things on social media , TV , radio , internet , etc. totally differently than a normal consumer . The Kardashians did what most of us can only dream of doing . They totally found a way to capitalize on the attention they get and make money from it . I for one , love them . Any time I tell a friend that the Kardashian/Jenners are actually smart AF they roll their eyes at me . People need to take a moment and actually watch an episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of us . Human and real . They put up with a lot of bullshit for being true to themselves and I CANT STAND IT . FB is dead to me , because its become a cesspit of people just whining about their lives and posting every meme on the planet making them the hottest expert on every topic including the Kardashians/Jenners . Jealous much people ? And if you do n't  agree with their message/lifestyle/brand then GET OFF THEIR CHANNELS . Its sad because it shows how eager and fast people are to tear down successful women .. ugh . <p> I completely agree with you ! I get so annoyed when people talk shit about social media/reality tv stars , especially the Kardashians . They are some smart ass business women and they have made THE MOST out of all the opportunities they have had . <p> Re : The lip kit . I am not sure if it is worth the effort to get your hands on one . You can just buy a mac liner and colourpop liquid lipstick and it is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at work all the time like " Kylie is so obsessed with her self " and " why does she think people care so much about her ? " and blah blah blah . Its like.well , you ARE LITERALLY talking about her right now . Positive or negative , she 's in your daily chatter at some point which is only keeping her more and more relevant . Kylie is a genius . Loved reading this post ! <p> OMG that is my #1 pet peeve of all time ! ! ! You are so right- I hate scrolling thru IG and seeing all these comments calling the Kardashian/Jenners every name under the sun but yet they are still following them ! Everyone also ignores that unlike other young celebrities , the Kardashian/Jenners never get into any trouble minus Khloe DUI .. no drugs , or shop lifting etc . <p> Love this post Lauren ! I actually have a couple lip kits and I love them . I love supporting Kylie and really anything the Kardashians do and that is why I have some of their books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this post . Love love love . <p> Thank you ! ! I have been feeling this way for the past year as well ! I have long been saying that the Kardashian /Jenners are the most famous family in America and a lot of people got offended . People spew hateful things about a family " they " made famous ! I have no problem with Kylie or any famous person for that matter . We do n't  know who they are but social media tricks is into thinking we might . Still that 's not a reason to judge . And I 'm addicted to the Kylie Lip kit for the record <p> This is what I keep saying to people . She and the rest of the Kardashian/Jenner clan are geniuses , like GENIUSES ! They are zoning in on this new social media way of life and are rolling with it , making money off their back . People hate on them , but would n't you want to make -10m or $10m reviewing products or taking a selfie with your new detox tea . Ermm yaaas ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Stop hating , start appreciating . They are smart and we should take a leaf out of their book . <p> ey Lauren , love your blog ! Just to make sure people do n't  get the wrong idea , Instagram does not pay Kylie ( or anyone else ) for posts . Third party advertisers will sponsor Insta posts when celebs like Kylie promote their products , like FitTea etc . Kylies celebrity status may not feel deserved or earned to many , but the reality is that millions of people follow her , which gives advertisers the incentive to pay her to expose their products . To your point , the Super Bowl does the same thing by paying top dollar for maximum exposure . Kylie is an easy target for criticism it seems , but she clearly maintains her mass appeal . Its hard to tell if she 's a truly good person etc , but I also feel compelled to give people the benefit of the doubt and reserve hate and distain for only the truly deserving . <p> Honestly , people who hate on/complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because its the " popular " and " mainstream " thing to do at the moment . Everybody does it , and most people have no idea why they actually hate them , they are just following the trend . And if people werent watching KUWTK , they would n't have gotten to their 12th season . It would have been cancelled a long time ago . = xx

I 'll get straight- to the point with 5 highlights from our wedding . Theyre simple but special &amp; I thought I 'd share a little peek : <h> 1 . ) Pre-podcast from our wedding : <p> Podcasting- from Cabo- was FUN .

It was blasting as we ran down the aisle &amp; everyone toasted with chilled champagne ! <h> 3 . ) Our friends &amp; familys speeches : <p> They were all very personal . Speeches by people who really , really knew us . Our friends did an amazing job of making their speeches about our story together as opposed to separate stories . If that makes sense ? Each person told the story of us as a couple- together- as friends . <p> AS FOR FAMILY , they were short , to the point , &amp; amazing . Our family was so on board to have fun and let loose .

Excited to keep listening <p> Loving the podcasts and the inspo behind the re-design and your shop . I know you love mixing high end and low end pieces . Any chance you can add a few more low end pieces ? Possibly from Forever 21 or one of the other stores you love ? That would help a sister and her wallet out But as always loved the pieces , so cute ! The pink skirts are EVERYTHING . <p> I TOTALLY see the Valley of the Dolls inspo with your re-vamp and LOVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot for sky high slits and cut out backs digging all these finds and that $23 price tag ai n't  bad at all ! <p> I totally feel you on growing slowly and organically I am like you where in my perfect world , perfection just happens but there is something so rad in seeing growth and how to evolve .

@@3098166 <h> Mini DeLites : Provence , France ( &amp; A LOT of Bread ? ) <h> view from our room <p> As you know , we were in France for two weeks ! Now were back but I figured I 'd bring a little France your way . Of course , itineraries/outfit posts are coming . In the meantime , let 's discuss Provence . <p> Ok so Provence is SO Beauty and the Beast-y . <p> You know the scene at the beginning when everyones like frolicking around the city popping their head out of windows or walking around with loaves of fresh bread ? Belles singing in her perfect voice , holding her straw basket with her book casually hanging out the side . Birds are chirpping , fountains are flowing , animals are smiling ? You get it . <p> Well , that 's Provence . <h> Straight up Beauty and the Beast shit , guys . <p> Its described as " a geographical region and historical province of southeastern France , which extends from the left bank of the lower Rh+ne River to the west to the Italian border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea to the south . " <p> Anyway , Gene &amp; Alex ended up joining us- on the latest episode of our podcast &amp; we broke down the importance of traveling &amp; creative ways to do soGranted the sound is n't the best but we were podcasting in the middle of nowhere in France so bear with us . You can now listen to TSC HIM &amp; HER Podcast by clicking the play button at the top of the site ( see above ? ! ) . FUN . Listen as you scroll . <h> the boys , their color scheme wasinteresting . HA ! <h> Farmers Market goodness <p> What else ? Oh , while we were wine tasting I found some amazing moisturizer which is un-linkable because its only available in Provence . However , the moisturizer is THAT good I want to re-create it for you guys . Its filled with a bunch of oils mixed together . As you know , I 've been so big on mixing oils together lately . So , SO big that you can see why this was an exciting find . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also went to the Farmers Market which was absolutely spectacular &amp; shocking at the same time . I 've never seen a Pet the Goat for $5 Dollars Stand so you can imagine the culture shock there . Lots of live animals at these Farmers Markets in France . And of course , A LOT of deliciousness like : real dried fruits , fresh garlic cloves , EVERY SINGLE herb/spice ever , delicious slices of salmon , &amp; beautiful , plump fruits . I was starry-eyed . Another plus : the wine does not contain sulfates which is just UNREAL because there 's virtually no hangover ( at least I did n't  experience one ! ) . <p> When in Provence you feel like you 're detached from the world . Its a weird , dreamy feeling . I liked it . I needed it . You know when you do n't  know you need something until you experience it ? That was Provence for me . <p> In other news , I am jet lagged as F. Does anyone have any tips ? Its insane how my body still feels jet lagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of which is slightly helping . Has anyone seen it ? Kind of dark , but juicy . <p> Tomorrow I have to be up bright &amp; early to head to LA find out where we are going on Snapchat . Its going to be day full of LOLS . <p> Wow , looks incredible ! ! What a dream vaca ! For the jet lag , I would try salt and potassium , drink A LOT of water , like double up ! You 're probably dehydrated from being in the air for so long . I 've also heard Niacin can help for jet lag . I 've also seen supplements for jet lag at the health food store . Hope that helps <p> Umm , I 'm LOVING The Night Of . I agree , very juicy and keeps me on the edge of my seat . I never know what 's going to happen to him in prison .

I feel like I deserve to try these famous salads after the hours of research . <p> So sure , you could say I feel strongly about the fact that everyone who works in an office setting NEEDS- these containers . <p> here 's why : it makes healthy eating effortless , its ready to go , you can make whatever you want the night before &amp; grab it from the fridge &amp; GO . Ultimately , I feel like a train wreck in the morning if I do n't  plan ahead , so this helps me feel like my life is together . <p> The 3 salads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keeping up with the K theme ) : <h> 3 . ) I Need to Fit in My Bikini Salad : <p> ** If you 're feeling feisty , do a fruit medley OR chop up some grapefruit with Greek yogurt , cinnamon , &amp; Stevia .

I literally have no idea where we are going . My birthday is May 21st &amp; Michael decided to surprise the shit out of me . He put earphones in my ears &amp; hid our tickets so ya , I 'm a million feet above air with no idea where the hell were headed .

For 500+ calories I 'd rather have pizza or a sandwich . <p> I am for sure guilty of googling what/where the Kardashians get their salads from . There is a new place by my house called Garden Bar ( not sure if they have these in California , I live in Portland , OR ) that I am obsessed with . They make Kardashian type salads and have so many lovely ingredients and different dressings and things . So freaking convenient and nice .

Do they just sit on a shelf ? <p> I just found your blog after researching Vital Proteins . I love this post and it makes me laugh so hard ! That is exactly what I have wondered the times I have watched that show ! I love your blog . Thanks for the good info and beautiful layout . <p> OMG ! ! ! Ive been dying to know ! So glad you researched this ( this is the research I can get behind ! ) . Now I used to HATE salad but I 'm starting to like them more and more .

I m Swiss ( from Geneva ) but work 4 years in Italy ( Firenze and Milano ) . I have to admit that i download the app of snapshat just for you are my morning bus delight . <p> What I like about you its your american way of seeing things and your honesty , I really really like it ( I never been to america and except tourist I never had chance to meet some ) . In europa people are not that straight so I will write this comment as honest as you are in your post Sorry in advance for the pain in the ass of my comment but keep in mind I really really like your blog . Now let 's talk about food = you are american @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fries ? I guess no does Italian only eat pasta and pizza ? ? ? ? definitely no I live there for 4 years and you have much more like you do in america . From what I experience ( work , experience . ) and also to defend the concierge if you go to whatever concierge in a 5 stars hotel ( i worked for fours seasons , kempinski and Mandarin ) they will automatically send you to a posh restaurant so you have to specify what you want casual family or gastronomy but I m sure that you know . The suggestion he gave you are more of gastronomy . And yes in Europe we have in our gastronomy stuff like pigeon partridge frog quail . it s just gastronomy you do n't  have anything in the plate and you will remain starving after it . oh and it does taste like chicken except that you have small tiny bones . I do n't  really like the part when you wrote that you ask the concierge where he will go , because everything depend on the situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quail but day to day of course they will go first to a trattoria . The first suggestion from the concierge was just an answer from what he thought you were looking for ( and you were staying at a four seasons ) and he was just wrong . And next time you go to Firenze try the local specialty damn you are in Toscany not in Napoli or Roma where you have to eat pizza but you should have take ribollita or la pappa al pomodoro or la porchetta or any pasta with funghi porcini or pecorino and the most and best ever le bistecca alla fiorentina <p> you are great and i m really looking forward to your next post have a nice day <p> Quail , pigeon , no . Amazing street panini and all of the best steak Tuscany is know for ? Yes ! <p> LAntico Vinaio for street panini La Giostra the dimly lit restaurant owned by Hapsburg princes with the to die for pear ravioli Family style steak and pasta at Il Latini followed by Perche Non arguably the best gelato in all of Venice . 
@@3098177 <h> Maybe The Weirdest , Most FLATTERING Halloween Tip EVER ? <p> LET 'S FACE IT : Halloween costumes can be eer , on the tighter , more revealing side . <p> I mean have you guys seen the costumes lately ? THEY SHOW SOME SERIOUS SKIN . <p> On that note , - I 'm going to introduce you to one of my best kept Halloween secrets : HOOTERS TIGHTS . <p> Firstly , no this post is n't sponsored by Hooters . The truth is , I 've been rocking Hooters tights since 9th grade . As the story goes , I was eating spicy chicken wings at Hooters with my ex-boyfriend who was literally drooling over all the hottie Hooters girls . To be real though , I was starring at their legs &amp; ass toobecause their bodies looked damnnnnn good . &amp; guys , this is pre-Instagram filters , Spanx , &amp; juice cleanses . So after full-on examining their outfits I realized they all were wearing nude tights . <p> NOW . <p> Let 's pretend for a moment were the CEOs of Hooters , mkkkay ? What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would say its how the girls look . And as business owners , were obviously going to find the most flattering outfits- on the market . An outfit- that make everyone look as hot as possible . That of course includes tights . And these tights need to hold the girls- in because they 're practically wearing a bathing suit everyday to work . They need to BE INCREDIBLE , RIGHT . <p> So as the CEOs of Hooters we are- going to supply THE BEST OF THE BEST , most flattering tights . BECAUSE ultimately , guys come to Hooters to drool over- the girls ( &amp; in defense of all men , the chicken wings are bomb too ) . <p> SO . <p> Back to me eating my wings many years ago . I had a SERIOUS light bulb moment : what are these tights that make these girls look SO amazing . AND THEN I REALIZED I HAD TO GET MY HANDS ON THOSE FUCKING TIGHTS . <p> LIKE I HAD TO . <h> I wanted my legs &amp; ass to look like a Hooters girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing around with the tights on my head , HA ! <p> For the record , I did n't  actually want to like , wear a bathing suit to high schoolbut for Halloween , I certainly did . <p> To be real , when I was in 9th grade the theme was sort of the sluttier the better ( thank God the times have changed . That Paris Hilton One Night In Paris moment needed to pass ) . <p> Coincidentally , that year I was going to be a- slutty- sexy fairy . <h> So as you can see , getting my hands on these magical Hooters tights were really necessary . <p> My first plan of action was to ask the gorgeous- waitress about where to purchase- the tights , who in all honestly , acted weird . It was almost as if she did n't  answer my question about the tights . She played dumb . So I asked another Hooters girl &amp; I had the same reaction a strange blank stare with a stutter . Basically these girls did NOT want to tell me where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know me , which I feel like you guys do , you know I love to share tips , tricks , whatever with other women . And in 9th grade , I was the same way . I just wasnt one of those girls who pretended like they forgot where their- Guess jeans were from . Like , we all know you know where you bought your amazing shirt . Just tell us . If its Forever21 , share PLEASE . <p> Really though , there 's enough Hooters tights for everyone , ladies ! <p> Once I realized that these two waitresses- were in fact NOT going to tell me where to find these magic nude tights , I made a plan . Because- anyone who knows me well , knows that once I get an idea in my head , I will not stop until its- finished . <p> So DUH , the next day I drove 35 minutes to another Hooters to get myself some tights for my sexy fairy costume . I really just could not get those Hooter tights out of my head . Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thankfully , the girl at the front sold me a pair she had in the back . YESSSSSS . She really was cool as shit . To this day I still remember her chill vibe . <p> Ok , so I got the tights , wore them to Halloween to a San Diego State ( OMG , frat boy city ) party , got tons of compliments on my legs &amp; ass ( thanks Hooters ! ) , &amp; felt tighter/leaner/etc . Imagine me fluttering around as a slutty fairy in my fabulous nude- tights , so proud of my Hooters missionmemories , HA ! <p> Unfortunately , I can not make this shit up . All of the above really happened &amp; to this day , I love Hooters tights if I 'm doing a revealing Halloween costume . The ones pictured are without feet , but I also really love the ones with feet ( it just depends on what you 're wearing ) . Try whatever floats your boat . <p> Thanks for the great tip Lauryn ! I love reading your blog to find out all these great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share with other women any tip that I 've found works great for me ! Kudos ! <p> LOVE THIS ! ! ! ! I hate when girls do n't  share . I always think of it if a girl asks , that means you 're looking good and if you 're looking good , no need to worry about how everybody else is looking ? Right ? ! <p> Love this story ! I got black no nonsense tights from the drugstore that are considered shaping and they are amazing ! They hold everything in and are great quality for tights.trista recently posted .. Holiday Party Planning 101 <p> So True ! !

I remembered this post from last year and knew I had to revisit to find out where to buy these tights ! I just ordered a pair and I could n't believe how cheap they are ! Thanks for the tip . I 'm looking forward to getting them ! <p> So I am a year behind on this post but somehow after reading other posts , I 've ended up here !

I throw a scoop in my smoothie OR down it in hot water in the AM and PM . Why I like this brand : it 's non-GMO , no BS , wild caught , &amp; unflavored . SIMPLE . ONE ingredient . <p> Beware because after doing some research I 've seen a lot of- collagen brands on the market that are full of filler . If you 're buying collagen , MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE INGREDIENTS . <p> 4 . Strengthens hair &amp; nails : collagen protein is the foundation of hair &amp; nails . Loyal collagen consumers notice that their hair and nails grow faster , stronger , &amp; more luscious . This is often the first noticeable benefit of many from regular collagen intake . Kind of like Biotin on crack . <p> 5 . Helps with cellulite : Collagen is the protein that forms the connective tissue in your skin , tendons , ligaments , and blood vessels . Structural changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent because the skin thins , loses shape , and is less able to conceal the irregularities below the surface . Collagen has got your back , literally . <p> OH ! Did I mention there 's 11 grams of protein in a scoop ? Sort of a no brainer guys . Is anyone else a collagen fan ? I can not explain my excitement over COLLAGEN . Two scoops a day keeps the wrinkles away . <p> As a blogger , I 'm trying new things ALL the time . Some I like , some I hate , some are OK . The Great Lakes brand I finished so now I 'm trying this one . They 're both awesome . I would say I like the taste of this one ( Vital Proteins ) more than Great Lakes . <p> Ive been adding gelatin to my smoothies for a few years now and I will say my skin is plumper and my joints/muscles recover much quicker ! Thanks for sharing this brand , I will have to upgrade mine to this Thanks ! <p> After reading all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collagen train ! ! Does this collagen powder have any sort of taste ? Also , what is your favorite collagen pill/capsule ? Thanks so much Lauryn ! : ) <p> Yessss I actually put collagen in my coffees every morning ( drinking one now ! ) but I like what you said about 1 ingredient . Now I 'm thinking the one I use is full of fillers bc there are a ton of ingreds ! This marine collagen looks incredible buying some right now . I also love the protein aspect and I 'm intrigued with the beauty greens . Thank you for sharing ! Have a great weekend ! x S <p> Thanks so much for sharing ! I 've heard so many mixed reviews about adding collagen into your diet that its nice to actually hear the positives from a trusted source . One question though : is it truly unflavored ? Can you add it to smoothies and drinks without altering the taste ? <p> I find that if I add it to a smoothie or juice , I do n't  notice it , but if I add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mild , salty-ish flavor . Nothing major and 100% worth all of the benefits ! ! xo Ruthie ( @tortugatravels ) <p> I liked it a lot ! As a blogger , I 'm trying new things ALL the time . Some I like , some I hate , some are OK . The Great Lakes brand I finished so now I 'm trying this one . They 're both awesome . I would say I like the taste of this one ( Vital Proteins ) more than Great Lakes . <p> Lauryn , First off I 'm one of your biggest fans . Seriously , been following you for years . Aka eating up everything you say and all your product recommendations &amp; buying tons of them . But I 've been doing so much purging fromm my bathroom lately and I still feel like a total hoarder . So , can you provide any guidance on your must haves as far as health and skincare ? <p> I bought the collagen you had posted about a while ago , the Great Lakes one . It tasted so awful I was gagging ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not picky when it comes to comfort vs. health . How do you recommend to consume collagen ? Maybe I was taking too much ? I tried putting it in my smoothies to hide it but it basically ruined my breakfast . It sounds like it really helps so I want to take it daily . Thanks ! ! -xoxo <p> I think the recommendation was linked to the gelatin collagen from Great Lakes ( which is n't water soluble ) there is another one from the brand ( Collagen Hydrolysate ) that is water soluble and dissolves quickly in water . Tastes kind of like licking a leather bootbut its easy to chug quickly ! <p> Yes ! Getting enough collagen while pregnant is critical because it provides essential proteins that our bodies utilize daily and that promote optimal health for a growing baby . Collagen helps to build and repair our bones , joint surfaces , skin , teeth , eyes , arteries , intervertebral disks , and much more . Collagen is needed to ensure a strong body and to help you to continually heal . Although , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health needs while pregnant and nursing . <p> Totally obsessed ! ! Ive been using the bovine collagen ( simply because I was n't aware of the options when I purchased ) for about 6 months now and I can totally see a difference ! ! My nails grow strong now ( never happened before ) and my friend recently commented/gushed over the fact that I have absolutely no wrinkles , not even crows feet ( I am only 30 and wear sunscreen every.damn.day ) . Anyway , I could n't agree more that this product is definitely worth adding to your life ! <p> This is sooo informative , I 'm definitely going to get my hands on some ! Will collagen help with acne ? If it wo n't , do you have any recommendations on tips and tricks to help with acne ? I feel like I 'm in a losing battle constantly with my skin so I 'm open to any and all suggestions you might have x <p> Love it ! I use the same brand and am a huge fan of it I put a scoop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , I do find that if I try stirring it into cold drinks that it ends up making a bit of a paste and does n't  dissolve as well a tip for anyone trying it out ! <p> This is SO helpful ! ! ! Ive been dealing with a bad bout of acid reflux , and most of my research has shown me that its actually a lack of hydrochloric acid in the stomach that causes it . Also , since its been going on for months , my poor stomach &amp; esophagus are very inflamed Im ordering this ASAP ! THANK YOU <p> LOVE Vital Proteins ! I 've used their Collagen Peptides for a couple years now . I have n't tried their Marine Collagen though . Could you explain the difference between their Collagen Peptides and Marine Collagen ? Is there a huge difference in quality or effectiveness ? <p> Ahhh , I 'm with you on " collagen is QUEEN " haha . I recently discovered collagen and have been crazy about it as well . I 've noticed a huge difference in my skin ( so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hurt a lot after leg day and running , but since I 've introduced collagen in my daily diet knee pain has seemingly magically disappeared ! xx , R @ the girl in polka dotshttp : **28;0;TOOLONG <p> Hey Lauryn ! I just bought collagen but am struggling to incorporate it into my daily life . When you put it in hot water does it taste bad ? Do you take it like a shot ? I drink tea at least 2x a day so I want to add it but I 'm afraid it will ruin the taste . thanks ! <p> I cant wait to try this version as I have been using the Great Lakes version ! Ive been doing some reading and found that marine/fish collagen is better for hair , skin and nails as it is a type 1 collagen . Bovine collagen is n't considered as affective as the fish . Thank you for this follow up post ! <p> Hi Lauryn ! I am very interested in purchasing Collagen Peptide Powder and want to know which one is best for mixing in with coffee AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water rather than hotany suggestions would be great ! I am hooked on your website and am OBSESSED with all the natural products you suggest . Please let me know which one I should purchase for that perfect " glow " !

Ive been naturally minded for some time , so I 'd shudder wondering what chemicals were lurking in other intimate products . I love that its all natural , cheap , readily available , and works great . <p> Plus if you have it out in the bathroom or vanity , lube is probably not the first use anyone is going to assume it there for . I 've had friends accidentally leave out intimate products in sight and not realize when company comes over , which can get embarrassing for some .

Def have to try it now ! <p> I 'm confused Youre all for using coconut oil as an all natural lube but yet you douche ? The ones with fragrence can be extreamly irritating and drying to the vagina .

On a side note , i read so many comments on this post about UTIs . I was never prone to them until a few years ago when they became a major problem for me.until one day a nurse at my doctors office gave me the real skinny " you absolutely have to pee right after sex " I took her advice .. if I pee , no UTI . Do n't  peeUTI . Such simple advice and a total life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm from Jamaica and I have freshly made coconut oil , i go through the whole process of grating it , boiling it and bottling it . It really is amazing , I use it for lube , baths and a scrub along with sea salt . Love your blog keep on doing what you 're doing ! <p> I am going through menopause and I cant stand the dryness , I never had to deal with it before nowIve been using coconut oil every evening like soap , it leaves my skin feeling clean and I use it after a shower on my body , my skin has never looked better ; however , I have never heard of using it as a lube , I need to try something because the dryness is killing me and I do n't  want to have sex because of the pain that is associated , I 'm talking Sahara dry , it even hurts when I run sometimes .

After reading the comments , I 'm glad to know I 'm not crazy and not the only one doing it ! <p> Hubby and I will be giving the coconut oil a go . We already use it in the kitchen and I like it as a moisturizer . Just had a UTI ( my first ever in 53 years ) . Hoping this one stone will kill two birds .

We had purchased some Coconut Oil ( they now started carrying Extra Virgin Coconut Oil ) in the baking &amp; cooking aisle . I started hearing all benefits of Coconut Oil so I had rubbed a tad on the tip of my male appendage &amp; was very impressed so I got some &amp; put near the opening of my posterior &amp; began to work it in which it did n't  take long at all and was impressed on how well it felt . So I bet you can figure out what happened next . And have used it going on several weeks now w/no problems . Its edible , tastes good , smells good , &amp; healthy because its a natural antibacterial , lubricant , etc etc . So if can clear acne , moisturize , kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard of several a of somebody out and about was in an accident &amp; was in need of an IV and with a real Coconut a hole was drilled in to where a hose was incerted in to the hole &amp; a needle attached to other end of hose &amp; tapped venously like a saline solution with extra benefits ! ) I do n't  see anything wrong with using it either

Sorry I 'm not sorry that I 'm not a fan of overly curled hair . I 'm just not . Then around 11 pm , I grab MY BEST FRIEND IN THE WHOLE WORLD AKA my cute little , yellow alligator clip &amp; shake my head downward towards the ground- ( remember that George Washington game you 'd play in the pool back in the day ? Where you took your hair over your head &amp; rolled it like old Georges powered wig ? Whelp , that 's the motion you want to make ) . Whip your hair downward and grab your cute alligator clip . Twist the- sleep bun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while your hair is spilling towards the ground ( make sure every inch of hair is secured ) . Result : you should have a super high top knot on the very top of your head . <p> AND thennnnn go to bed . ZZZZzzzzzz . Wake up &amp; remove the clip ( honestly I could not live without these yellow alligator clipstheyre all over my house/car/purse you 'll even find them clipped to my clothes throughout the day ) . Then shake your hair out slightly &amp; add a dime size amount of this oil to ONLY *I repeat only* the bottom of the hair . I also add a spray of hair spray ( only one or two , this is n't 1950 , you want your hair to actually have some movement ) &amp; one spray of hair sunscreen ( yes , that 's right , - hair sunscreen ) . Then I brush only the top of my hair ( think to your ears ) with The Wet Brush ( if you do n't  have The Wet Brushyoure missing out ! ! ) . <p> Ok so what does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> It softens . <p> Softens the feel . <p> Softens the hair . <p> Softens the look . <h> The sleep bun creates that hippie , effortless , not too overdone look . <p> I put in the sleep bun every night until the next hair wash because it keeps those soft curls for dayyyys &amp; dayyyysss . To maintain the hair for 3 to 5 days , use dry shampoo- on your luscious locks . Just do n't  forget to use your cute alligator : <p> I totally trust you when it comes to hair . In may 2013 I read your post about not really washing your hair and decided to give it a try . Remarkable about this I guess is that it was 2 weeks before my wedding ! When I told my hairdresser she almost fainted . Well , my hair looks better than ever , I am down to one or maximum two washes a week and I use only clay powder . Nothing else . My hairdresser rambled on about how it could not be done with colored hair and yadayada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works ! So I will try the bun too , thanks Lauryn ! <p> Love love LOVE this post ! My hair is always a complete wreck when I wake up and most mornings there 's no saving it , so up in a pony it goes . Literally running out the door now and getting some clips . Ca n't wait to try the sleep bun out ! Thank you for your awesome tip ! Xx <p> Nobody believes me but ok I got very thick hair I wash itat night put oil hand comb it go to sleep with damp hair but for some reason the next morning my hair is gorgeous and people think I spent my morning styling it ! ! ! When I tell them what I do they just do n't  believe me . <p> Ive been doing a sleep bun for a long time too , although I do n't  start always have the gorgeous curls . A bun at night and plenty of dry shampoo is basically my hair routine , because washing it everyday is just not happening . And the sleep bun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hair straight on top of their head in the evenings ? <p> I 'm a hairstylist and catch flack from my coworkers for this , but my ultimate go to hair product is a $3 can of Suave dry shampoo . I have tried DOZENS of professional and drug store brands and no one can top my Suave dry shampoo . <p> Could you post step by step pics ? Embarrassed to say I am a very unexperienced bun maker . This goes for a sleep bun or your regular just " on top of your head bun " for days you do n't  want to do your hair . Which for me is a lot of days .. <p> I love this ! I usually just clip up the top half of my hair so the face framing parts do n't  get flat and oilybut I wash my hair 2x a week and not to sound like a dirty girl but also I 'm not great about brushing it so it gets knotty ( I have thick long hair and washing/brushing is a PITA ! ) . The sleep bun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tip I have to go find an alligator clip now . <p> Absolutely love your honesty ! I hate when I ask someone where they got something and they feel the need to lie ! Its like just tell me that you got it at target ok ! ? And btw I literally laughed out loud when you brought up the " Washington " pool hair ! <p> I LOVE this idea i 'm sure i 'll love it just as much as my wet brush thanks to you ! Living in New York I have been to dry bar and im obsessed as well . After a long day of work on a Friday its a great relief and I feel refreshed and ready to go out . My hair is shorter , angled and layered what 's the best way to make sure all of my hair fits into the clip ? <p> Love all your posts ! Your hair always looks so effortlessly perfect . My hair illiterate self is currently growing out a long bob that I regrettably cut last summer , so the whole high bun thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting that beachy hippy look on shorter hair , post-sleep ? <p> Easy ! The best thing I can advise ( especially for broke girls like me ) is to buy a reeeaaalllyyy good sulfate free shampoo ( I get mine at Cosmo Prof. because my momma has a nail tech license , but I 'm sure Sallys or whatever would have some ) and use it twice a week . On the other days , if your hair stays oily like mine , use baking soda instead of shampoo on your roots . It can be used as dry shampoo but I prefer to use it in the shower to rinse it out . <p> This post is too perfect ! ! First I am glad I am not the only one who finds the entire Dry Bar process freakin AMAZING ! ! ! People think its weird I go about once a week . Little do they know how much more time I get back since I can keep working while someone else makes my hair look way better than I can . Just last week I was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bag that the stylist must have dropped in there by accident.it was an alligator clip ! ! haha Now I have to try the sleep bun ! ! Thanks for the tips ! ! ! xo <p> I have long hair like yours , and it feels so good to get it up out of my face in the evenings . I love the beachy vibe of your waves ! My best hair tip is using Wen its seriously transformed my hair . I can wash less often and its so much silky and shiny . Even my stylist was surprised how well my ends have held up after multiple lightening rounds ! That and some super cheap Suave Keratin dry shampoo .

Hmmm . <p> With time-blocking , you do one thing for the amount of time of your choice . <p> For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out my closet . 15 minutes showering . 10 minutes on makeup . 1 hour , 3 times a day on e-mail . You get the drift . <h> Once that time goes off you STOP . <p> There 's something about it that JUST works . <p> You should also know that you are supposed to do ONE task only for the entire time . So JUST e-mails . You cant get distracted on Daily Mail or start a blog post . That sort of defeats the purpose . <h> According to this source , time blocking helps you make smart choices- in regards to : <p> Priority of each item <p> Time required to complete each item <p> How much time is available to work on each item <p> They state : " A to-do list is important , but it is not sufficient . You need to prioritize tasks based on importance and then schedule adequate time for them on a personal calendar . This is called time blocking . You are blocking time on your schedule for those activities you intend to accomplish . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIFFICULT part of working on a task is getting started , right . <p> I start with my most important tasks first , ALWAYS . I wake up &amp; immediately- make a list of SEVEN , only SEVEN priorities for the day , every day . Ive been going with lucky number 7 for the last year &amp; its really worked for me . The number 7 came from Richard Branson who said he sets 7 goals to complete for the day , every day . This provides motivation- to follow through with the commitments- listed . <p> This article states that time blocking is ESSENTIAL : " Continuous learning should be a part of what we do regularly . But this is one of the areas in our lives that gets whatever time is left over . And there is never time left over. - Blocking out time on a regular basis for education makes sure that we are always growing personally and professionally . Blocking out time for fun , sleep and physical activity also puts our minds in better condition to get the most of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is your automatic response the answer yes when someone asks you to do something ? This can lead to feeling overwhelmed and the problem of not getting your important things completed . By blocking out time , you know whether or not you have time to do an additional task for somebody . If you do n't have the time for what you are being asked to do or it is not important , let your calendar be your excuse to say no . ' " <p> There are really no cons here . It just works . <p> The time cube I like is found here . Also a fan of the tomato timer but I feel like the white is cuter , right ? <p> Little update : FOUR more- exclusive app- posts- will go live at the end of this week on TSC APP AND a new podcast episode went live this morning . Its called THE BREAK-UP EPISODE . Enjoy I hope you listen to TSC Podcast while doing your makeup and of course , with your time cube ON .

This great book I 'm reading Psycho-cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz has been so influential in providing excellent nuggets of information , such as the importance of only trying to do one thing at a time . The author explains , sometimes we unconsciously , actually , try to do our entire to-do list at once , which is crazy right . Time blocking , doing only one thing at once , can be revolutionary to working habits if you 're not someone who normally works that way . Love this post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Love this post ! Time block makes so much sense I make a to do list every Sunday its so long its actually overwhelming.Only doing 7 things a day I think will be more effective and less stressful than my current method . <p> I am buying one of these asap ! Every since you first talked about this thing on your podcast , I have n't been able to stop thinking about it . I have the hardest time delegating my time to thing I need to get done , along with just taking a few minutes to breathe ! Thank you for sharing , you are amazing ! xx <p> I love learning new time management skills ! I 've never heard of this one before , but it does remind of Cal Newports book " Deep Work . " Multi-tasking is SOOOOO bad for your brain ! So I 'm a fan of anything that prevents multi-tasking <p> I highly suggest the book THE ONE THING ! You choose 7 things to do a day but this book shows how ONE THING can change your life ! Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed my life ! Cori <p> But , please remove the link to the readers post . In it she makes light of mental illness . OCD is NOT a cutesy way of saying I 'm organized . It is a serious mental illness . Making fun of mental illness has no part in your post about being organized , empowered , and smart . <p> I know this is an old post but quick question , how loud is the sound when your time is up ?

@@3098197 <p> After- the shower , - I rub raw coconut oil on my arm pits ( make sure its post-shower ) . You know , like deodorant . Because of its antibacterial properties its great for a pre sort of deodorant . Then after a few minutes , I apply my actual deodorant . <p> ( By the way , I have YET to find a deodorant that I like AND works . Anyone ? ) <p> here 's the thing : this all provides a much closer shave WITHOUT razor burn . <p> Also I shave in one direction always &amp; avoid travel-ish razors at all costs . <p> If you still get razor burn after this , you got ta try Tend Skin .

If that still is n't working speak with a laser specialist because they ALWAYS know what to do . Especially if you feel like nothing else is working . <p> Other tips : stay out of the sun ( I feel like it makes any razor burn worse- sun spots suck anyway ) , dry brush ( fabulous for the skins stimulation ) , &amp; always moisturize head to toe ( I use basic coconut oil but what else is new there ) . <h> Post navigation <h> 56 comments Leave a Comment + <p> I always use a mens razor too . It works way better and gets into the curve area ! I never thought of using coconut oil though , I use it everywhere else , so why not ? ? Genius !

Also your entire underarm area will be so much smoother because ( not certain on this one ) I think the hairs begin to all grow in the opposite direction you shave ( I shave down only and I 'm certain they all grow up ) <p> The other day I somehow forgot to shave my arm pits in the shower so a few hours after I got out it really started bothering me . I decided to try shaving them with dry arm pits and a dry razor and it worked better than in the shower . The razor went over better and I got a closer shave then normal . Weird I know but something new . <p> I run a razor over my armpits every time I shower , Ive done it for 15+ years now and as long as I keep that up no razor burn for me . I also use a scrub on them one a week or so which really helps.Andrea @ Blog Strength recently posted .. Marketing and Advertising and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that Ive always dealt with SUPER sensitive armpits when it comes to shaving . I used to have to wait like 3 days ( I know gross ) before shaving again because of how sensitive and irritated the skin got . Thankfully I found something that works for me and I figured I would share it here SHAVE EVERY DAY ! This is one of the main things that has helped and I know it seems counterintuitive but seriously it helps exfoliate the build up in that area and prevents ingrown hairs from developing . I would love to do a follow up on this post on my blog http : **25;84;TOOLONG , as I think its an actual issue that a lot of people face that can affect your self esteem especially in the summer time . Thank you Lauryn for bringing this topic up ! Hopefully some of my tips will help out even more ! <p> P.S. Oils are the shitcoconut oil is the only thing that helps my eczema in the winter ! <p> Hey Kris ! Do you use coconut oil for shaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn when shaving my legs and I have tried everything from different razors to different shaving creams . Never seems to work and its painful and I never get a close shave because of it . Never thought of oils until this post , maybe its the answer . <p> What about leaving your pits the way God made em w/perhaps a little judicious trimming ? I gave up shaving pits when my son was an infant ( 17 yrs ago ) ; NOT ONE COMPLAINT . We 've all been brainwashed , ladies ! <p> I have been trying numerous natural deodorants . So far the one that works the best is Lavanila . I have the vanilla scent and its too strong when I first put it on and then it calms down and blends in nicely . Second favorite is Weleda spray ( citrus scent ) . Although nothing works as great as an antiperspirant but I wo n't use that anymore . <p> LOVE this post ! ! Ive been using an intuition razor forever and love the ease of use for my legs . However , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I shave every time I shower ( which is n't every day , let 's be real ) and lately have been getting some ingrowns but not too bad . Literally going to buy a mens razor after work and I 'm also obsessed with oils so check that one off the list . Thanks Lauryn ! xo <p> Totally agree on mens razors ! But I 'll have to try the oil . Ive been a soap and water on the daily type of gal , but the pits could probably use a little bit of lovin . Also , on the deo : just started using Primal Pit Paste ( the jasmine one is my fave ) . Its natural , free of that nasty stuff you 'll find in Secret , and it works for everyday use . At the gym , not so much still working on finding something effective enough for that . <p> Its a must to get laser hair removal on your armpits ! ! Its seriously lifeeee changing . <p> There 's a place in LA , specifically in Encino and its a place called New Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ! ! ! You only need 8 treatments for it to be effective . Then touch ups every so often . <p> I started a year ago and I NEVER shave . There 's no hair anymore and when it does grow back its super thin then I go get a touch up . <p> if you use oil instead of shaving cream ( i usually just use body wash but am loving the benefits you mentioned of oil ) , how do you keep the floor of your shower from being permanently oily and slippery ? <p> I 've tried so many natural deodorants but never found any I liked that also worked . However , I recently started using milk of magnesia as deodorant and its amazing ! Im hooked on using milk of magnesia and wish I 'd found it sooner . Keeps me dry , odor free , and bonus I get a little more magnesium in my body too . All you do is spread a thin layer on your underarms , give it a minute to dry , and youre good to go . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reusable roll-on bottle for easy application . Just make sure to purchase milk of magnesia that only has magnesium hydroxide + filtered water . Some brands try to sneak in sodium hypocrite ( bleach ) and other not great stuff . The brand I buy is GoodSense Milk of Magnesia Saline Laxative , Original , 12 Fluid Oz . Got mine on Amazon ( http : //amzn.to/1QcitX0 ) and it lasts ages ! meg recently posted .. currently <p> i need to start using coconut oil for moisturizing . i 'm such a bad moisturizer and its so so important ! Thanks for the reminder ! As for armpitsno secrets here but i 'm with you that shaving cream is chemical craziness . So glad you promote clean ingredients everywhere ! xo <p> You have to try getting an underarm wax ! It leaves the armpit looking smooth and clean because you cant see the hairs that are below the surface like you can with shaving . It does n't  hurt too bad . = <p> Great post ! I started using a mens razor after being recommended one by my mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the Dove Advanced Care deodorant in the clear tone version . Its said to lighten armpits , which I found to be true . <p> Im allllll about mens razors . Its a little Fed up beacuse there has been so much proof that they ( like Khaled says NO to THEY ) up charge women for the same products as men ! But I 'm with you , I find they get a closer shave &amp; maybe an extra blade or two . Love the avocado oil idea I will def give it a go ! <p> As far as deodorant , my mom got me one from some random farm in Texas that I was OBSESSED with and it was the best ever but it was literally just coconut oil , baking soda , arrowroot , and oils . I am thinking DIY is the best route ! Another great one was Meow Meow Tweet I loved their lavender one ! <p> I have the same problem with deodorantI recently started using the Dove spray . I find it works well ( I sweat a lotanxious much ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to start using natural deodorants , and I have my eye on this one at LUSH ! Havent tried it yet but it smells AMAZING . Also , second Tendskin ! ! ! I just make my own at home now , but it is a lifesaver , particularly for bikini area ( which I refuse to touch with a razor anymorewaxing ftw ! ) . <p> I use a gel deodorant because those " no show " solid deodorants never work for me they pill up and leave stains on anything dark . Secret Outlast Unscented works great . Thanks for the other tips , I 'll have to try using oils ! <p> I always wax , I think its the only way that I have it smooth and nice . <p> As for deodorants , a natural one that my mum used on me and my sisters growing up , is literally lemons , just slice it and use it as deodorant . It gets the job done and I swear it does not make you sweat at all <p> Now that we are older we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never sweat . <p> If you 're a big fan of shaving with oils I highly recommend LOccitanes Almond Shower Oil . You can purchase it at Sephora or Nordstrom ! It smells absolutely wonderful and leaves my legs/under arms as smooth as can be xoTaylr J recently posted .. V-Day Gifts for Him <p> My mom found this deodorant ! Its the best one I 've ever used , though I have n't used it consistently because I usually need to change mine up to avoid building a tolerance . However , this stuff is great . On another level . <p> The only natural deodorant that I 've found that works is Lavanila , especially if you can reapply . They sell travel size options that I keep in my purse so , I 'll usually reapply in the late afternoon . Although , if there 's any chance I have a meeting , I still use a regular deodorant because nervous sweating is caused by our hormones which induces the odor . Regular sweat does n't  do that . ( Sorry , gross , but interesting , right ? ) <p> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so its right up your alley ! No harsh chemicals whatsoever , and some may think its expensive ( $9 ) but I do n't  go through deodorant super crazy fast so I think its worth it . And unlike other natural deodorants , this one actually stays smelling fresh and prevents the sweat ! They also have lots of scents to choose from . God I sound like an informercial , sorry but I just love it that much ! Dianna recently posted .. Origins Original Skin Mask <p> This sounds super weird . but try waxing your pits . Yes , it hurts like hell the first few times but I did it every two weeks RELIGIOUSLY for a like 4 months and I literally have maybe 5 hairs under each arm . And , now that I do shave every couple weeks ( sounds gross but seriously , the hair is so fine you cant even see it ! ) I do n't  get the irritation , ingrown hairs , etc . It sounds like a lot of work to go get waxed that frequently , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , its super super easy ! ! ! ! I bought a wax warmer on amazon for about $30 , works great . I actually have kind of a big hole in my armpit because I had all of my Lymph nodes removed , and I literally ca n't shave there now , I cant get the razor into the dip . Going to a salon every time you need a wax is annoying , and doing it at home with a hard wax is sooooo easy . I highly recomend . <p> I 'm sure you prob have a post about this , but what kind of coconut oil do you use ? I cant use regular deodorant either and I think I would like coconut oil . I switch up what I use , but currently use arm &amp; hammer essentials and my man likes everan jack he s actually tried many kinds and only likes that brand . <p> Started shaving with coconut oil as of recent ; seriously do n't  know why I did n't  start sooner . its amazing ! No razor burns or irritations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your skin . I 've especially been using it down south such an easier shave ! My boyfriend shaves his chest and since he started using it , he does n't  get irritations either . just a dab of coconut oil on wherever your shaving , and your skin will feel moisturized endlessly . <p> Since you brought up coconut oil after shaving , here 's my little deodorant tip . <p> I also apply coconut oil after shaving for its antimicrobial and moisturizing properties . But I also mix in a drop or two of essential oils . Usually its peppermint , but sometimes lavender , lemon , or whatever Im in the mood for . Later , after that has fully set in I spray on Weledas rose deodorant . That said , sometimes the coconut oil and essential oils are enough . I once forgot to put on the Weleda before going to Pure Barre one morning , and still smelled fresh after class , even though I did get a little sweaty . <p> That said , if you are switching from a more conventional deodorant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched from a conventional over a year ago , and my body went through some weird detox type phase for like 2 weeks .

I feel like everyone makes it harder than it is but treating a zit is really to the point ( literally ? ) . <p> You should know the idea of this post came to me when I was on INSTAGRAM LIVE the other day . Someone asked me how I get rid of black heads . &amp; well shit , I get rid of them easily &amp; efficientlywith a black head popper . Ive been using this handy-dandy tool since I was in high school . And let me tell you- it works . <p> here 's the thing : if you pop a zit the juice of the zit is what spreads the pimple . Whenever I pop anything I make sure not to get any of the residue on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice around the zit YOU CAN COUNT ON THE ZIT SPREADING . That 's right guys , bacteria spreads .

Which is why when you get a zit &amp; pop it- more zits pop up . <p> Anyway , here 's my actual zit cure . <p> I take this very seriously because Ive very much perfected this over the years . In fact its kind of- a magical cure .. <p> This zit clay was recommended by my favorite- esthetician , Lindsay . Its from Sweden &amp; has so much praise . Plus its two flipping ingredients : TWO ! ! ! One of them being WATER . And with no dyes or synthetic additives . <p> I have used this FOREVER . The stuff works ASAP , immediately . I 've never seen anything so magical . <p> here 's the main secret though : the directions says to leave it on for ten minutesI leave it the zit overnight . So I sleep with the clay on the pimple . Works like a charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end is a loop tip for pressing &amp; extracting , the other sharp end is for piercing or poking . <p> G To minimize damage to your skin , the needle is an effective way to remove blackheads , acne , or pimples . <p> G The remover is also a safe way to clear your pores than squeezing blackheads using your fingernails . <p> - G With the help of these needles , it will lessen trauma to the surrounding skin . <p> I found mine at Rite-Aid . Its nothing special but BOY OH BOY does it get the job done . So much better than popping anything with your dirty fingernails . I like to use this after I get out of the shower because my skin is soft . <p> If you do n't  have a black head removercheck out- this- breakdown to pop a zit : " When you get out of the shower , wipe your face with a clean , never-been-used , freshly washed towel .

@@3098210 <h> EVERY GUY NEEDS A HOT WHITE TEE ( GREAT GIFT IDEA TOO ) <p> If you 're looking for a chic , COOL gift to give your man : I got you covered . <p> I may or may not have found the raddest present ever ? <p> First off I have to say I am ALL ABOUT A WHITE TEE ON A GUY . <p> THERE 'S NOTHING HOTTER REALLY . <p> So when Son of a Tailor , a company that 's based in Denmark , reached out &amp; told me about their businessI becameobsessed ? <h> Why you ask ? <p> Well I mean there 's nothing worse than when Michael reaches for the Pinot Grigio on the top shelf of our walk-in cabinet &amp; his shirt rides up . NO . We can do better than that . <p> Especially because Son of a Tailor will NOW design the shirt to your liking &amp; specific measurements . They offer a variety of colors , and you can even customize the neckline . <p> Guys this is music to my ears . <p> Seriously . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100% custom fittingYES PLEASE . <p> If you 're crazy like me , you can even get the tees monogrammed by the seamstress on the hang-tag . I love a good personalized moment . <p> Forget about me though , let 's ask the man : <h> Michael 's opinion : <p> I wear black and white t-shirts 90% of my life . It 's always been a mess finding a brand and product that fits me well . I have broader shoulders and a smaller waist . If I buy a large it usually comes out too big and a medium ends up too tight and short . With Son Of A Tailor I am able to send in my exact measurements and get exactly what I 'm looking for . A well-fitting shirt that does n't ride up too short or hang down too long . I know it sounds strange but t-shirts are some of the best gifts Lauryn can get me . I live in them , I work in them . They can be worn with anything . Lauryn 's friends are always asking me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted t-shirts are the answer and Son Of A Tailor nails it . Best in the game . Thinking of gifting these to my new brother ( what up Myles ! ) . <h> Lauryn 's opinion : <p> Yes , back to my opinion ( HA ! ) ORGANIC COTTON ? SHIT , I 'm in . Who cares about Michael ? I like it . Very much my vibe . Plus who does n't love a guy in a hot white tee . I 'm very much into Charlie Hunnam . Heard of him ? If not , run RUN to watch Sons of Anarchy . He 's always rocking a hot white tee with a leather jacket . There 's really nothing hotter . If you 're looking for a unique , COOL gift to get for your manTHIS IS IT . Not only because it 's rad but because you no longer have to look at their horrid fitted white tee . <p> Ok so this is how it works . You order a giftbox , which includes a measurement tape in case you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom fitted T-Shirt . It comes pre-wrapped so it 's super easy to pop under the tree , and when he has the time your guy can then customize the T-Shirt exactly how he likes it , easy right ? <p> Anyway , I feel like I 'll end up stealing it &amp; rocking it with my dark washed flares &amp; a black pump . Stalk Son of a Tailor 's gift boxes &amp; get a free measuring tape/tee shirt voucher + free shipping . <p> Was LEGIT just telling my boyfriend he needs a " nice looking white t that does n't  look like it came out of a plastic bag from target " and he was like WTF are you talking about a white t is a white t . SO TY LAURYN ! ! Now I can show him EXACTLY what I mean ! ! You 're the best xx <p> Now I 'm definitely gon na try it out . Heard great things about this brand and love the simplicity of their t-shirts . My man will definitely look handsome in a Son of a Tailor t-shirt ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love about it !

If I invited you over for mimosas you most definitely would thinkIm a bit crazy . I mean who would n't with an ACTUAL- smoothie cupboard , 281 elixirs , &amp; random powders , herbs , &amp; spices . <p> IN MY DEFENSE , each potion serves a purpose so do n't  judge until you try . <h> Basically these are my two favorites of life . <p> OH &amp; if you 're a total stress case ( HI ! ! ! ) then try CALM ( the lemon/raspberry flavor is where its at ) . Really , its natures Xanax . Sometimes I mix it with hot tropical green- tea &amp; a little apple cider vinegar . Once I gave it to my sister &amp; she literally passed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trust me . <p> Plus its full of magnesium ( SO IMPORTANT ) which gets everything moving &amp; grooving in the AM , winky-winky , if you know what I mean . Basically it will flush all the toxins out . Thank me later . <p> &amp; lastly , I must know , because I can be kind of voyeuristic : what 's in your pantry that 's welldifferent . Something random that really gets the job done ? Perhaps something that one would n't expect ? Shock me . <p> I 'm well aware these items are n't  really- food so next time I promise I 'll share more food-friendly optionsI should have called this post : what 's on my witch doctor pantry shelfbut it did n't  flow as well , you know ? <p> These are my favorite posts ! I just had to tell you I have been using gelatin for about 5 years now . It has helped tremendously with Rheumatoid Arthritis pain and joint fluidity !

Trust me , Kym just had the best business advice ) . <p> OH , AND she wrote a bookwhich I spent the entire weekend reading .

All while- building an insane empire . <p> If- you 're a female entrepreneur , you will LOVE it . <p> Alright . Let 's talk shop : <p> Hi Kym ! So excited to have you on The Skinny Confidential . Ok , so introduce yourself <p> I had several companies before True Religion . I wanted to start a denim company with my then husband who was a fabric salesman . But not the typical jeans co @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hip and high quality jean that would change the industry standards . <p> I was relentless as I spearheaded the push to get TR into the public eye by doing everything I could and more , all while raising three young children .

That 's why I love living in Malibu , and being close to the ocean . <p> As a designer , every line or collection is different of course , but I always start with the fabric : the textural way it feels , moves , stretches , &amp; what can be done with it . This is my starting point . <p> Then I look at the seasonal forecasts &amp; market trends : I look for what 's missing or a void in that market &amp; then find an original , yet compatible way to design a fresh new look . <p> I 'm always looking to be the first to be first , not the first to be second . <p> Why did you want to share your story ? <p> KG : - For years I wanted to share my vast experience &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , together with my co-author Sharon Soboil , I wrote the telling memoir titled , Gold Standard . <p> I felt strongly about empowering a younger generation of women , &amp; that sharing my tumultuous journey in the fashion industry ( especially as a leading business woman in a man 's game ) along with my personal life struggles of relationship mistakes , business failures , &amp; successes , that it would give some valued insight to the upcoming fashionista 's . <p> Maybe just the extra needed strength &amp;- useful tools to help even one woman , whether in fashion or not , onto becoming a stronger &amp; better version of themselves . <p> Ok , Kym you 're DYNAMIC ! !

When we arrived to Hong Kong I was n't feeling so hot . I 'd been working non-stop around the clock , not sleeping well , &amp; definitely had a sniffle or ten . <p> So I booked a lymphatic drainage massage . <p> AND HOLY MASSAGE . <p> Ok , I 've had A LOT of massage because of constant neck pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible , horrible car accident where the other driver T-boned us HARD . Ive been stuck with lateral whip lash ever since .

Its not a deep tissue massage like I normally prefer- but the after effects were so insane- that it was worth every second . <p> Picture this : it was- a couples massage . Michaels next to me getting a head massage ( get that mind out of the gutter , he was getting his scalp massaged by a burly man ) . After massaging my lymphs in my legs &amp; arms , the- masseuse- flips me over &amp; starts on my under eyes . At this point I 'm so relaxed I fall asleep , fully snoring . With four people in the room . Michael tells me afterwards he could n't relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> MMMmm , SEXY . <p> Back to the massage details : she massages under my eyes gently , by my eye sockets , &amp; the sides of my eyes . I am dead asleep . ALL OF A SUDDEN I AM WOKEN UP by a flush . There 's a drainage detox- throughout my body ( it was an orgasmic-like flush kind of like endorphins running through the body ) . My sinuses immediately drained . It also felt like fluid drained ( by the way guys , were going for authentic in this post , not hot &amp; sexy- ) from my eyes down in to my body . I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT . <p> Afterwards I had a full-on cough attack on the massage table ( P.S. Michael is still in the room trying to have a relaxing head rub- while I 'm snoring , snorting , &amp; coughing#relatable ) . The- masseuse- almost knew this would happen because she had a water bottle on hand . I drank the whole thing &amp; then had to get up IMMEDIATELY to pee . <p> Like immediately , immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a billion questions : <p> Why did I cough ? <p> Why did I have to pee ? <p> What was draining ? - <p> What are the effects ? <p> How long does this last ? - <p> AND OMG THAT WAS AMAZING ! ! ! - <p> Basically she said the cough was- a natural reaction after the- lymph system drains . Its totally normal &amp; its the- body releasing toxins . The immediate need to pee ? Even more normal . When you get a- lymph drainage massage it cleans the- toxins out &amp; they release through the- kidneys . The draining was built up fluid . And the effects are clearing toxins out of the system while- INSTANTLY de-puffing the under eyes . Instantly though , its crazy . The effects last for about a month . And how often can you get it done ? She said- once a month would be fine . The massage is known to relieve any pain levels . <p> Get this : afterwards I did not have ANY puffiness under my eyes .

Not to worry you or anything.I do reallyyy love lymphatic drainage myself , in fact I have a whole folder on my email account full of videos of this stuff <p> Lymphatic drainage massage is actually very good for many cancer survivors that have had to have lymph nodes removed- for example , a breast cancer survivor may have to have axillary ( ie armpit ) lymph nodes removed , which can cause the arm on that side of the body to chronically swell . Lymphatic massage encourages the lymphatic fluid to reenter circulation , allowing the patient more comfort . <p> My aunt is a lymphatic masseuse and I 'm amazed on what she was able to do on both my mom ( a breast cancer survivor ) as well as myself when I had a sinus infection <p> I must try this out right now .

Sophie xxhttps : **30;194;TOOLONG <p> Just a comment about concerns for anyone with a history of cancer getting a lymphatic drainage massage . One of the side effects of cancer surgery and radiation is damage to the lymphatic system which results in a chronic condition called Lymphedema . Manual Lymphatic Drainage ( MLD ) is the mainstay of treatment for those patients , to help them reduce their swelling and pain , reduce the chances of infection , and be able to maintain their limb at its optimum size along with the use of compression garments , exercise and good skin care . <p> There has long been speculation and fear that getting professional lymphatic drainage might increase chances of cancer spreading . Currently there is no clinical research studies or data to support this . Even a patient with Lymphedema and active cancer can still get the necessary MLD but the known tumor site may be avoided for any manipulation . If a patient with active Lymphedema does not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the potential to cause serious health issues . <p> The excerpt below is taken directly from the American Cancer Society website : <p> " A growing number of health care professionals recognize massage as a useful addition to conventional medical treatment . In a 1999 publication , the National Cancer Institute found that about half of their cancer centers offered massage as an adjunctive therapy to cancer treatment . Some studies of massage for cancer patients suggest that it can decrease stress , anxiety , depression , pain , and fatigue . These potential benefits hold great promise for people who have cancer , who often must deal with the stresses of a serious illness in addition to unpleasant side effects of conventional medical treatment . While some evidence from research studies with cancer patients supports the use of massage for short-term symptom relief , additional research is needed to find out if there are measurable , long-term physical or psychological benefits . <p> Meanwhile , most patients do indeed seem to feel better after massage , which may result in substantial relief .

Large , well-controlled studies are still needed to determine the long-term health benefits of massage . <p> A special type of massage called manual lymph drainage ( MLD ) is done as part of Complex Decongestive Therapy ( CDT ) , which is used to treat lymphedema after certain cancer surgeries .

It treats water bloating , cellulite , and pains from bloating . It can slim down even 3 lbs in a session depending how bloated you are .

Thanks ! ! ! <p> Actually , you DO NT DO lymphatic drainage when you are recovering from surgery . And you do n't  do lymphatic drainage when you are sick . The reason is that it can move illness around your body . I get lymph drainage weekly- and I had my gallbladder removed and I had to wait 3 months until I could resume for that reason . Other than that , its a great massage . Its also feather light . Its a touch that is so light that its above the muscle between the skin and the fascia . It really moves the lymph fluid by gently pulling up on the skin , releasing the stagnant fluid . <p> Great post lol ! You are too funny ! Lymphatic massage is good for releasing all those nasty toxins . If you get a lymphatic massage only on your face every week then you will start to look younger ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too funny !

Or is it something you can pick up at the pharmacy and do yourself ? ? ? I would n't mind doing it but going every month to see the Doc is n't really an option . <p> Another Great Tip Lauryn ! I recommend the Methylcobalamin B12 shot over the Cyanocobalamin B12 because it can be used directly and avoids one extra step in making it available . Incidently the Methylcobalamin is a Methyl donor which is useful for Methylation , this is an important process in the Phase II Detoxification pathway in the Liver .

Insurance covers it . My copay was only $3.83 ! And that included the syringes . It is very easy to measure the liquid and to administer the injection . Tiny needle , you will barely feel it .

Amazing ! <p> I have a B12 Injection every 2 months at my doctors , I 'm really interested to know how people can inject it themselves , I find them quite painful as the B12 has to be injected into the arm muscle , and there is no way I could do this on my own . <p> I love the B12 shots . I am on a strict meal plan ( 4oz lean protein 6 times a day ) &amp; workout regimen ( weights 3X a week and 2-3 cardio ) and instantly feel rejuvenated once I get the injection .

For the ladiesThey have a " PMS Remedy " vitamin injection , it takes my edge off , calms me down , and reduces my cramps . A must try ! <p> Its possible that B12 shots might be more difficult to come by soon . The FDA has stepped in to separate drug compounding for individuals ( 503A ) versus for bulk use ( 503B ) . So a lot is changing at the moment and the people who have made B12 shots in the past did n't  make them aseptically ( in a clean room ) and I 'm guessing that the FDA will try to shut them down . Many people got sick or died in 2013 from similar injections .

I was prescribed daily B12 shots for several months then gradually reduced the frequency to now just once a month .

The injections are cheap too . Only about $5 a pop . I could tell a big difference in the way I felt fairly quickly . <p> B-12 shots are necessary if your body can not process Vitamin B-12 in your stomach . A shot bypasses the stomach and therefore you body is able to absorb . If you are unable to process B-12 you will need to get shots every month to avoid the horrible side effects of low B-12 levels . You do n't  have a problem absorbing B-12 you can take an oral supplement and do n't  need shots . If your body is not running low on B12 any extra B12 you consume will be removed from your body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level ( and while you are at it have him check your iron level . ) If you are n't  low , do n't  waste your money taking extra B-12 you body cant store it .

Read up on it and turns out you should NOT ( and which I did ) is just went and bought any old supplement . MAKE SURE you 're not buying magnesium oxide which Ive read from other sources is common in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want . I 'm going back to try the Magnesium citrate and one of the brands Lauryn reccomends ! ! <p> I am having some difficulty understanding which form of magnesium to buy . I see the brand you like , however if I want a pill form ; is it best to buy magnesium oxide , glycinate , or citrate ? TwinLabs is oxide but you also picture citrate . Thanks ! <p> I just replied to one of your posts ( Re:probiotics ) . I mentioned Plexus and how great their ProBio5 product was . I also mentioned that I took several of their products one of which is the BioCleanse . It contains 380g of magnesium which helps with a number of issues including my anxiety levels and leveling out my BP ( I 've been in BP medication for 7 years no more by of these Plexus products ) . The benefits Ive seen from the entire Plexus line of products is amazing ! They are all natural too no artificial sweeteners or dyes which give me migraines ( again , no migraines since I 've started these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ? I researched them for two months ( I 'm a skeptic and I also used to work in the pharmaceutical industry ) and learned so much about gut health and how it relates to your overall health and wellness ! ! If you have n't heard about these products you should look into them ! I could send you some info if you are interested ! I 'm sharing the info with anyone that will listen be I feel so good myself I want to share ! ! <p> Hi Ashley , I 've heard of Plexus , but have always wondered why the BioCleanse incorporates magnesium oxide , which is about the cheapest and least bio-available form of magnesium . Do you know why they use this form rather than something the body can actually use for more than just a " Milk of Magnesia " effect ? <p> No thanks . I 'm literally super healthy on paper and after tons of tests my heart looks fantastic ! SO instead of pill popping ( which is totally fine if that 's going to help a condition ) I 'm going a less western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to talk to a counselor about anxiety . <p> here 's to a healthy lifestyle addressing the issue not just the symptomcheers ! ( Ill cheers you my Whole30 compliant black coffee ? ) <p> so I 'm late to the magnesium party ! lol but since the new revamp of SC Ive been looking through tons of posts ! question , is it better to take magnesium once in the morning and once at night with melatonin or should I just take it all at night ?

Plus , I LOVE to cook ! I grocery shop twice per week ( Sundays &amp; Wednesdays ) &amp; grab things that I know I can use for a few different purposes and meals . For example , some of my staples are : salmon , avocados , kale , any &amp; all of veggies , lentils , nuts , &amp; seeds .

That already saves me a big penny ! Katness recently posted .. ROCKING VENICE BEACH <p> Is there anyway for more a more specific recipe to follow for the avocado/kale salad she listed ? It sounds so delicious but I 've never worked with miso or some of the stuff she listed so I 'm nervous I would n't put enough or maybe too much . Any advice ? Thanks ! ! Great post definitely one of my favorites ! Christine recently posted .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and always love your Skinnistas ! Always so inspirational , but this food diary is sooo unrealistic ! I doubt Annie ever ingests more than 1200 calories in a given day , especially when she 's drinking her own $9 juices multiple times a day . While Annie is eating clean and " good " food , the amount of caloric intake is just unrealistic and not very healthy . <p> Thanks for the comment . This is actually a sample of a week of my eats I documented a month or so ago . I do n't  count calories ( too complicated ) and Ive eaten this way for quite a long time . It works for me . I eat when Im hungry and stop when Im full . Whether that 's 1200 calories or 1800 , I do n't  know and do n't  care . The bottom line is I feel good . I eat out , I eat in , I skip breakfast , I eat big breakfasts.just depends on the day and how I 'm FEELING . I encourage everyone to follow the one simple rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! My body is not your body or anybody elses . Its mine and what it wants might look different from what yours wants . I shared this diary to show everyone how I incorporate juicing into my daily life because the #1 question I am asked is " can I drink juices even when I 'm not cleansing ? " Because I drink so many juices throughout my day , I wanted to show that yes , you definitely can ! <p> I hope that helps you understand why/how I eat the way I do and why the way you eat does not have to or need to be the same by any means . <p> A month ago I might have considered this diary unrealistic but after juicing for the last couple of months it has really changed my habits . Annie hit it on the head when she said she tunes into her body . I used to wake up and eat breakfast right away because I was " supposed to " . after juicing throughout the day I have realized my body is telling me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was used to . Lately my body craves what it NEEDS instead of what it wants . Very inspiring food diary ! <p> Olivia , you 've got it ! You 're exactly right . So important to follow hunger cues vs. set meal times . Nothing is wrong with skipping a meal or throwing in an extra one if that 's what you need that day . Thanks ! <p> LOVE this post ! Ive been obsessed with Suja juices since the beginning and have loved incorporating them into my daily routine , and I 've encouraged everyone I know to do the same ! I disagree about Annies way of eating being unrealistic-shes a great example of focusing on clean , whole foods that provide your bod with all the right nutrients to fuel an active lifestyle . Every body requires a different caloric intake and she gives awesome advice saying listen your body , babes ! Juices are an amazing way to keep on trucking in between nutritious mealswhether they be Suja ( ideally ) or green juice powder for babesicles on a budget . My meal might be twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I for sure want to follow in her footsteps of knowing what her bod needs and eating real foods straight from nature Erin Lane recently posted .. In With Energy , Out With Nasty Stuff <p> LOVE Suja juices- so delish , so good for you , and so refreshing ! I only wish that I could afford to buy them all the time and drink them on the daily like Annie . Regardless , I usually treat myself to one or two during the week and then I do n't  feel so bad ! <p> Can You buy Suja juices in the uk ? Also I agree more detailed recipes would be great ! I try to eat clean , I am no where near as disciplined as Annie but I enjoyed reading her food diary , taken away some good ideas to try . Thanks !

Shes also very witty AND pretty . Oh , &amp; also COOL . I like her a lot . <p> Anyway , Michael &amp; I were guests on her podcast this week &amp; we did a little ( LIGHT ? CASUAL ? TRADITIONAL ? ) wedding recap . You know , what brides do . She recapped her recent wedding&amp; then we went into our psychotic wedding freak-out stories . <h> + Introduce yourself , tell us everything . <h> + You 're a podcast queen ; its a shitload harder than it looks . Tell us what goes into it . <p> Its a lot of fucking work . <p> One of my biggest struggles initially was trying to figure out how to speak my mind without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother has a podcast these days so its important to be unique and provide something different . I try to- be mindful of who is listening , why they are listening and what will keep people listening . I try not to over think it and just say whatever the hell I want and hope I do n't  get into trouble with my Human Resources departmentor Legal . <p> I have always been a very overly opinionated person &amp; started the blog to purge myself of really ridiculous feelings in essay form about Gwyneth Paltrow &amp; kitten heels . It definitely represents the popular yet unpopular opinion . Its incredibly aggressive and offensive but so authentic and funny ( complimenting myself #unlikeable ) . <p> I am someone who has disproportionately intense reactions to insignificant things &amp;- the blog gave me the perfect portal to unleash my bitchy beast . I pride myself on saying what other people are thinking but have enough dignity not to say out loud or publish on the internet . <p> Angela is very particular . She pretends to know a lot about wine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally worried about EVERYTHING . Angela has major anxiety issues and I just CANT WITH HER . Literally picking out a suit with him is like Sophies Choice . <p> I am obsessed with him and he is so cute I want to kill him but Angela needs to RELAX . I know that Angela is primarily my wrongdoing and I take accountability for that . <h> + I know you talk about your wedding on the latest podcast but give us a sneak peak ? <p> We got- married this May in Palm Springs . We wanted somewhere close enough to make a quick trip but far enough to alienate distant relatives ( sorry ) . We wanted it to feel like a vacation for our guests , like a bougie summer camp and Palm Springs is the perfect spot . I was super adamant about making it as fabulous and not overly bridey . I would have curb stomped somebody if I saw an inch of burlap or a mason jar . Our vibe was all white , acrylic , &amp; flamboyant without anything frilly . <p> Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clearly you 're amazing at comedy , any tips for someone who wants to break into the comedy , podcast , blogger industry ? <p> My best advice is to not filter yourself and never be too insular . Sharing private details helps people get to know you which is important , but you never want to bore people with the daily woes of your life . That 's too self-indulgent ; - people have diaries for a reason . <p> Its like telling a table full of people about the dream you had the night before . No one gives a shit unless it relates to them personally . Its so important to remember that if you want to make a business from comedy , ultimately you are providing entertainment and content not self-relief . Also remember that you are your best material . I think in order to make fun of anyone or anything you HAVE to make fun of yourself more , otherwise you seem bitter and hypocritical . <p> That 's very nice &amp;- very generous . I have spent years setting the bar low so that I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my appearance . I try to eat what I love , drink what I love ( moderately ) , dress in clothes I love , surround myself with people who I love and I feel like that self-indulgence translates . <p> Its so important to live moderately &amp;- find that balance of deprivation and going off the walls . I cook dinner Sun-Thurs so I can eat what I want and make small alterations so I do n't  gain 450 lbs but still get my pasta because gluten feeds my soul . <p> And laugha lot , its so much cuter than crying . Happy people look better . Its the truth . <h> + Youre sent to a far off island , who are you bringing ? Andrew ( husband ) or Leo ( dog/BF ) ? <p> Leo . No hesitation . <p> If he could afford me I 'd voluntarily live on an island alone with him . I am obsessed with him . It takes all my self-control not to actually suffocate him because normal loving affection just is n't enough , I want to be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is basically a human . <p> Before you learn to bake your face ( what the hell IS that ? ) learn how to stick to a great skin regimen . You do n't  have to spend a fortune on products ( except eye cream ) just be vigilant with your routine . I would fall asleep in full body Spanx before falling asleep with one hint of makeup on . I also LIVE for rosewater you can spray pre or post makeup . It tones , hydrates and women in my family SWEAR by it . <h> + Best piece of advice you 've ever received ( go crazy here ) : <p> I am very selective with advice and only take it from a very selective group of people . I always say to be self-aware , listen to yourself ( because no one knows you/ wants better for you ) OR people who really know what they are talking about . I would n't ask Helen Keller for outfit advice or MC Hammer to do my finances . <p> We need to pick and choose who we solicit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their shit together . I also think it is SO important for people to learn how to be alone . My source of sanity is solitude . If you do n't  want to hang out with yourself why would anyone else ? My best advice is to get to know yourself . Not in a dumb Eat , Pray , Love way but in a very honest way . Go to lunch alone , travel alone , shop alone . Also never wear a casual shoulder bag with a cocktail dress , you look like a pre-teen attending her first Bat Mitzvah . <p> I am a 56 year old cross between you bitches !

Let 's just say your breath will smell like a dirty toad that fell in poo . Funny how I literally do n't  care because the benefits just completely out weigh the- breath smell . Plus , that 's why God invented toothbrushes- for garlic lovers , duh . <p> I 'm not going to lie I 've been weirdly excited to share garlics benefits with you . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  be alarmed- Im just SO EXCITED &amp; I JUST CANT HIDE IT about this post <p> Why I eat raw garlic cloves , like everyday : <p> + No bullshit , during Egyptian times it was used as a traditional remedy to aid in health &amp; treat many different diseases ( AKA Egyptians could n't pop over to their local Rite-Aid &amp; grab an antibiotic so they had to make due ! ! ) . <p> + Its filled with the good stuffaccording to this source : " intact cells in garlic contain a natural compound called alliin . When you crush garlic cloves by chewing them , alliin is released from broken cells and contacts a garlic enzyme called alliinase . Alliinase converts alliin into a volatile oil , allicin , which is a main active ingredient in crushed garlic . Garlic also contains other oils , called ajoenes and terpenes , as well as several water-soluble compounds . Some amino acids , Vitamin C , calcium , iron and other minerals are also components of fresh garlic . " <p> + Chewing raw ( RAW ! ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancers . This is because the compounds in garlic can stop cancer cells from dividing &amp; may cause them to die . PLUS IT BOOSTS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM LIKE NO OTHER ! <p> + Its known to lower cholesterol &amp; reduce blood pressure in people with high blood pressure . <p> + Garlic kills infection and helps fight viruses . In fact , I 'm going to make garlic soup next time I 'm feeling sick . The recipe I found is here &amp; looks supppppper interesting . Basically raw garlic is known for its anti-bacterial &amp; anti-fungals powers ! ! <p> + &amp; ONE of my FAVS : " oxidative damage from free radicals contributes to the aging process . Garlic contains antioxidants that support the body 's protective mechanisms against oxidative damage. - High doses of garlic supplementation have been shown to increase antioxidant enzymes in humans ( source ) . " <p> WHAT ELSE can I tell you about garlic . Oh , I typically eat them while I 'm cooking . Usually three cloves . The allicin compound only comes to life when the garlic is crushed or cleaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just CANT RIGHT NOW , then at least add some diced garlic to your salad/sauce or AT LEASTTTT take a daily- garlic supplement or try garlic extract . Another fun way to get your garlic is to mash up raw garlic , mix it with olive oil &amp; lemon and spread it on a piece of sprouted toast . YUMMMM . <p> No one will convince me to give up garlic cloves . I will undoubtedly be eating them the rest of my life even when I 'm 97 years old , walking my cat , &amp; wearing a YMCA visor . <p> I also love raw garlic , so you 're not alone = I always use it in salads and make my own garlic dressing . I 've never tried it in soup though . Will definitely try that the next time I 'm sick .

Do you die ? <p> Worth mentioning : all meats are free of hormones &amp; antibiotics and come from the ranch down the street . <p> Back to the reason I wrote- this post : lately I have been REALLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go somewhere . And for some reason every time I go back to Flora Farm . Where its all good vibes . <p> ( I KNOW , I KNOW you 're supposed to clear your mind when you mediate but screw that- I am doing it my own way ) . <p> " Visualize the most peaceful- place , " I think to myself every morning . Meanwhile my Relaxing Melodies- App is playing on noise canceling headphones . And guys , it works . It kickstarts my day off right even if only for a few minutes . Maybe I 'm not Ghandi yet but at least I 'm a WIP ( = work in progress ) . <p> And good news : you can go to your happy place for five minutes too ! Just pick a place , any place . Wake up , open eyes , do not reach for your phone , put on headphones , ok maybe reach for your phone to turn on the- Relaxing Melodies App , put phone away , close eyes , go to happy place for five , or ten , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works . At least for me does . <p> To be real , I just couldnt do the whole roll over &amp; pick up my phone dance forever . <p> Its like The Backstreet Boys , - it got old . <p> Times are changing&amp; my meditation Flora Farm method weirdness is working for me . <p> Your turn : do you have a place or space that radiates good vibes ? Come on , tell me- wheres your happy place ? Get weird . <p> I 'm going to try to fall asleep now . Its 10:30 pm exactly &amp; I 'm really , sincerely trying to get to bed earlyI mean , as if I would be able to fall asleep right nowregardless- giving it a shot .

Honestly , my happy places are either in the barre3 studio or in my home I made sure that when I designed my home ( especially my bedroom ) , itd be 100% MY space . No stress , truly my sanctuary . <p> There is a national park only an hour from me , Waterton Lakes National Park ( located in Alberta , Canada ) , and anyone who has been there says it gives off this vibe , this magical feeling . I have been there so many times over the years and yet every time I pull into the park a wave of good vibes washes over me . It has a Hawaii-esque vibe . <p> Good vibes , always ! A place I love to go to ( besides the mountains bc I live in Denver ) is the local farmers market every Wednesday &amp; Saturday ! I absolutely love every little thing about it- fresh &amp; organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also does lavender ice cream ( ! ! ! ) , the cutest coffee stands , the people who go there , the fact that A LOT of people ride their bike there &amp; they have the little carrying rack on the back , everyone is carrying around their own bag ( no plastic bags ) , I love the location of it , &amp; there 's also a solo person or a small band playing their music , and you can tell they are n't  there to just get money , they just actually love playing live music for people . Its the most charming place ever , to me ! ! 
@@3098250 <h> An Egg Salad Makeover <p> Updated : February 6 , 2017 <p> by <p> LAURYN <p> Sometimes I think people do n't  actually want to know what 's in their food . Ignorance is bliss , right ? Not so much . When I put gas in my car , I like to know what the quality is . So call me crazy , but when it comes to food , its not entirely absurd that I 've adapted the same thought process . I prefer to know what 's fueling my body . <p> Regular egg salad calls for relish . Welp , I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but relish contains high fructose corn syrup , preservatives Yellow No. 5 &amp; Blue No. 1 , to name a few , &amp; tons of chemicals with long , hideous names . In this skinny version of egg salad , I used finely chopped cornichons- &lt;&lt;&lt; obsessed w/ these little guys &amp; fresh onion in place of nasty relish . <p> Another staple in egg salad is mayo . Instead substitute olive oil based mayo for the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but eliminate two of the yolks . <p> This fabulous recipe below is the Nanz my lovely grandmother . When we were little we 'd beg her make this on rye bread . I modified her egg salad slightly : serving it open-faced , using Oasis 8-carb bread , &amp; adding a bed of arugula . Enjoy ! <p> Directions : hard boil four eggs check out how to boil eggs here . Dice cornichons &amp; onions . After 12 minutes remove eggs &amp; submerge them in cool water . Leave in water for a few minutes &amp; then peel the shells off I like to use two full eggs + two egg whites . Add eggs to a big bowl . Throw in diced cornichons , onions , seedy mustard , &amp; mayo . Toast one slice of bread per person . Using a kitchen masher or fork , press down on all ingredients until there 's small bits of egg . Add some arugula to each slice of toast . Put egg salad on top . Sprinkle pepper + sea salt to taste . 
@@3098251 <h> A Pathetic Attempt At a Wedding Update <p> Updated : September 29 , 2015 <p> by <p> LAURYN <p> WELL HELLO ! ! ! <p> So Ive decided if there was an award for worst bride to be ever , I would win . <p> Its not intentional ( I tried to get excited over a Pinterest board , really I tried ) . The whole wedding planning thing is just something I have yet to get excited about . IS THERE ANYONE ELSE ON THE PLANET LIKE THIS ? PLEASE ? <p> Realness alert : getting engaged was so special to me . It fit like a shoe . Also , it was done away from social media ( we kept it a secret for like a month &amp; half ) . And well , I like being engaged . You know , just being . I do n't  see the rush in planning a wedding . I 'm happy with where I 'm at now . Also , I 'm busy . Full-time blogging may seem like you write a couple paragraphs &amp; post a picture , but its A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience. - Its a round the clock job that 's taken a lot of energy &amp; time . I 'm not complaining ; I just do n't  have time to add wedding plan to my list of 3895719013475 other things right now . Anyway , the past couple weeks have given me time to think a bit &amp; I 'm starting to come around to the idea of wedding planning . SLOWLYYYYY THOUGH . <p> I 'm not one of those girls that 's overly excited about her wedding . I 've tried to get giddy but I 'm just not . I 've never dreamed of my wedding when I was little . And now at my age , I dream about my chihuahuas running through fields ( LOL ) &amp; building my own business . And Ive come to except THATS OK . I 'm ok with not being the girl that knows exactly what/where/when/how/why wedding details . <h> G Location , location , location : <p> I want a destination wedding . Small , intimate , not too many people . Kind of a no pressure thing , like if we invite someone- &amp; they cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had TSC Book launch party there were a lot of people . Which was- AWESOME , but I feel like I did n't  get to enjoy the whole experience fully- because I was busy saying hello to everyone . I missed out on eating , mingling , &amp; soaking in the whole night . <p> When I get married I want it to be about the man I 'm marrying . Not saying hellos &amp; making rounds , you know ? So very small , very intimate . <p> My friend , Emily reminded me about something I said : " our wedding is on the mooneveryones invited . " Ha , aka no pressure . If people can come , great , if not , no worries . <h> G OMG , the dress : <p> Cinderella moment is out . More effortless , non princess-ish- is in . I 'm not into the Barbie look for me . It works so well for so many women , but at this point in my life I 'd prefer an effortless , shoulder showing/backless look . In high school , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like its something I 'd never go back to . Especially when I 'm getting married . <p> Also , I do n't  want to spend a billion dollars on the dress because I 'll wear it once . So for my dress : simple , chic , relaxed , effortless . Do n't  want to show a lot of tit either . HA . Classier the better for this day . I have n't done any real dress shopping . Besides on Instagram ( do screenshots count ? ) . Tips ? <p> * Dress above is from 5 seconds of trying on wedding dresses at a cute , little shop under my house . It was more for fun . <h> G Haircan I be real though ? : <p> Michael fell in love with me when my hair was down , unwashed ( I know weird , unwashedlol ) . When I get married , it will most likely be down , unwashed . Personally , I 'm not one for up-dos because I look like a 5th grader in braces &amp; a training bra , but again , that 's just me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people , but not for me . If an up-do looks good on you , LUCKYYYY . <p> I wont highlight my hair before I get married because I like a little highlight growth . If you know what I 'm talking about , you 're my spirit animal . Having dye on the root looks weird on me . <h> G Foodkeeping it simple : <p> here 's the thing : people think they 're feeding Roses mom in Titanic at weddings . I 'm not a fan of this method . Generally it seems people are pretty simple when it comes to food. - You know : simple staples . I 'm more of a street taco and chips &amp; spicy guac girl myself . Like dover sole with caviar &amp; truffle potatoes is way too intense , in my opinion . <p> Also , I 'd love a good old In &amp; Out truck for later in the night . For our food , its going to be food we love that 's simple- &amp; just DAMN GOOD . <h> G Getting into decor : <p> Decor is the same as the dress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a neutral vibe . Again , relaxed/simple with my own personal twist . Havent planned much here so there 's not much to report . Need to get on it . Soon . LOL . <p> So literally I just made my full-on list of what I 've done so far . On my blog . To all of you . Is this pathetic ? <p> I think I wanted to do this post so I could show myself just how far behind I am at planning this wedding . Because if you really look at the list , I have n't ACTUALLY- planned a thing , ya know . There 's just an idea in my head of how I want it to go . Got to remind myself that The Skinny Confidential started the same way . An idea . That I sat on . And kind of cultivated . So let 's hope my wedding thoughts keep comingby the way , this is a very real post so please do n't  judge . <h> Perhaps it could be worse ? I could be a raging Bridezilla &amp; talk Michaels ear off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm trying to look at the whole wedding thing from a logical business standpoint too . Personally I 'd rather invest money into our businesses &amp; not go bankrupt over one day . It just does n't  make sense to me . Besides the honeymoon is what really tickles my fancy . <p> ( I know , I 'm THAT bad . I 'm more excited for the honeymoon , - than the wedding ) . <p> OH ! &amp; another reason I did this post is- FOR ADVICE ! I know a bunch of you are engaged or married : what 's your take on the whole situation ? What has your experience been like ? If you 're not engaged or married , what 's your ultimate vision ? <p> If you 're wanting a destination wedding with relaxed vibes , no need for fussy decor , and great food and cocktails , I cant recommend the French Quarter in New Orleans enough . You 'll enjoy every moment ( unless you do an outdoor wedding in August ) . <p> I did n't  care about the details besides what I wanted to look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides that , I could n't have cared less . <p> The hardest part of wedding planning for me was having every one else talk my ear off about what they think I should do because they could tell I literally did not care . After so much of that , I just wanted to redirect the questions to someone else ! I guess invest in someone you trust to take those questions that wo n't cost a pretty penny ? A person to tell them NO ! for you ? I wish that existed . <p> One day I was at a buffet place with my future mother-in-law and she would not stop talking to me about wedding planning , so I got up to go get more food/get away/make her leave me alone . A little old lady walked up to me who overheard what was going on , grabbed my arm and said , " Remember , its YOUR day . No one elses . Keep it that way . " <p> And that was probably the most valuable ( and cutest ) wedding advice I received , ever.Bret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about weddings ! I never dreamed of mine . I find the traditional stuff a bit silly . Like how people register for gifts . " We love each other ! here 's a list of stuff from Williams-Sonoma that we want . " Also those ugly tiffany blue bridesmaid dresses , I could die . Or creepy baby slideshows . I could rant about cheesy weddings all day . PS I love Lauren Santo Domingos wedding style , if you are in need of more inspiration . <p> I like your realness about being engaged . Many people bloggers especially make an enormous drama out of it . Its refreshing that you 're so down-to-earth . : carmen recently posted .. Working Woman // OOTD <p> I am in the exact same boat . I am legally married , but since my family is across the globe , our wedding is planned for September 2016 . Honestly though , I am already useless when it comes to planning .

Since getting engaged I have shown no interest whatsoever in planning my wedding . People keep asking what are you going to do about XYZ ? and I think aaarrrghhhh ! ! I can barely plan my dinner each day so I have no idea how I 'm going to cope with this . Reading through your list , I think you have made a lot of progress from absolute zero to this !

Life Lately <p> The wedding is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it real for sure ! For my wedding we did Cabo San Lucas as it was so much fun to bring the family together on the beach and as you know Cabo has such a cool vibe . We booked out Marbella suites and had the whole family stay our wedding was about 50 guests so pretty small and we for the rehearsal dinner we did tacos and chips and salsa and Margs with beers then that night we did a bonfire on the beach with smores which are my favorite it was so chill no uptight wedding drama and everyone was so relaxed because the beach is just a calming place ! The wedding was also beach casual and I did a vintage style dress with my hair all down and my dog walked me down the aisle and my other dog was with the flower girl as they are a big part of our relationship ! All my love to you ! ! Courtney Bentley recently posted .. How to Build Lean Muscle Mass <p> I had a BIG she-bang and I now tell everyone to keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sounds like you 're in the zone with that ! Honestly , the best part was the honeymoon ( Thailand ) . I 'd say that 's the thing to invest in , not the ceremony . People who are close to you will ALWAYS enjoy your wedding day , regardless of what type of event you have , because theyll just be so damn happy for ya ! P.S. Wishing you a speedy recovery ! <p> No need to apologize for not being overly excited about planning your wedding . If you are more excited about spending the rest of your life with your man you already have everything you need and want . It sounds like you know exactly what you want for your wedding . Remember this post when you get further in the planning because everyone will have an opinion of what you should do . Ive been married for 10 years ( I 'm 31 ) and I had a small , inexpensive wedding and it was perfect . Let the vision you have be your guide . What you and your guests will remember is how happy you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decor on the tables . The best thing I can tell you is have fun with this period of your life and enjoy the planning . Time really does fly when you are happy ! <p> I think the big thing is do exactly whatever you want because its about you two . I was frustrated with my wedding , Sam and I still look back a little bit annoyed about it because we wanted to do a destination wedding and our first mistake was listening to other people saying that they really wanted to come so we should have it where we livedwe invited more people than we should have even though we tried narrowing down the list it was so hard and we spent waaaay way too much money . And like you said , we did n't  get to enjoy our night because we had to talk to everyone.it was pretty much ridiculous that I felt like I was throwing a party for other people and having to entertain them on my wedding day when I just wanted to be enjoying being a newlywed with Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there it was just unnecessary stress . We actually ended up leaving our reception early because It was so overwhelmingSo our honeymoon is definitely what I was looking forward to ! ! And it was amazing . Also a lot of things did n't  turn out as planned for the wedding so I just had to roll with itand why I did a strapless wedding dress I 'll never know . It was so heavy and hard to keep up . Anyway . I think its nice you have time to think about what you really want . Our engagement was 6 months and I was never the girl who dreamed about her wedding either so it was ALOT to try and figure out in such a short amount of time which is why i think it went the way that it did ! Our honeymoon was the best part for sure ! Amanda Waltman recently posted .. 4th of July Weekend <p> Wow this makes me feel much better ! I 'm from NY and got engaged 6 months ago . I have n't planned a thing but everyone wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notoriously over-the-top , spend your life savings , kinda deals . My fiance is actually from San Diego so were thinking of doing it there since it can be a little more mellow .. Plus were way more excited for the honeymoon ! Haha were thinking the Maldives ! It sounds like your wedding will be exactly what YOU want it to be , which is the most important <p> Couldnt agree more on every aspect ! A destination wedding is SOOOO awesome if you have the right people in your life .. Chase and I could n't do that because he has some crazy family , and it would n't have blended well for a week .. But if you do , its amazing ! We went to one in Cozumel , MX last winter and it was just awesome .. all of the people closest to the bride and groom spending 4 days together bonding , eating , paddle boarding , other excursions , poolside , whatever .. and it made the wedding so beautiful . And I also agree with decor and your dress .. simple , chic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honeymoon .. That 's the best ! We did two weeks in Europe and it was such an adventure right after our wedding . Just fly somewhere from where your destination is ! My friends had their wedding in Cozumel , then flew to Belize for a week . Perfection ! Good luck , and do n't  worry that you are n't  too focused .. there 's no need to be ! <p> Looovee this ! I am getting married in 29 days and I feel like I can offer some bits of advice do n't  feel like you HAVE to do anything . Do you . Do you and Michael . I 've had so many family members , and members of my fiances family , tell me I have to do things a certain way or make me feel bad if I 'm not doing things how they view it . Just do you . That being said , involve as little people as possible . Seriously ! I always thought you needed to have a million people and have nights doing crafts and going shopping with a gizzilion people and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridesmaids and it was torture . Once you start involving other people , opinions may clash and frustration begins . Were having a small wedding of 80 and I 'm planning on dancing the night away not making rounds to every.single.person . Well , that was a rant and you can see how Im ready for this wedding to be here already . haha Good luck ! ! <p> I completely understand this entire post ! I was NOT into wedding planning either . I sort of felt like I had to plan this big wedding and invite all these people and do these sort of things that EVERYONE does and it just felt so fake to me . I was really only excited about our honeymoon ( we went to Maui ) because it was just going to be about us . So a few months before our planned wedding , we cancelled everything and just decided to get married in Maui , just the two of us . Literally the best decision of my life . We did lose some money on initial deposits , but we ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I did n't  want . It was SUCH a special day because it was just about US and only us . The great thing about destination weddings too is they take care of a lot of the little details ( decor , cake ) that I did n't  care as much about . And we have the most amazing pictures from our special day . Good Luck and do what you want to do ! ! <p> I am totally with you on the " just being " , " not going bankrupt over one day " vibes . But at the same time , I have been subconsciously planning my wedding for a few months now ( no , i 'm not engaged but I am engaged to be engaged .. or I like to think I am ) . I live in Canada and am a huge cottage-camping-bonfire kinda girl . My dream is to get married on a floating dock in Muskoka , have an intimate garden party ( with twinkle lights and BBQ and summery cocktails ) , and an evening bonfire ( with a smores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even thought how cute would it be to have bride and groom hoodies for the evening party ? My best friend , on the other hand , is in the midst of planning her old hollywood wedding . Cool , but not for me ! <p> You may feel like you have nothing planned , but honestly figuring out the right vibe/style for your wedding is the hardest part ! Your post makes it sound like you 're stressing yourself into thinking you HAVE to have the traditional Cinderella wedding to please the outside world , BUT YOU DO NT . Its your day , and you should make it everything you and Michael want . Also considering how busy you are , I would look into getting a wedding planner . A talented planner can take all your wants ( and do n't  wants ) , and handle the awful tedious parts , to help you plan the perfect wedding that fits YOU . <p> You are speaking my language ! I just got engaged in March . We are having a destination wedding in Key Largo . Totally with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location . Do not even think about coming near me with that ball gown ! I 'm obsessing over a simple Grace Loves Lace dress and will be scooping up some ocean water for perfect undone texture for my wedding hair . No worries girl ! There are plenty of us engaged gals just like you : ) <p> Your post is me to a T. I got engaged a couple of months ago and I want a small , chill wedding . I fundamentally do n't  get people that have like 14 bridesmaids and spend half a mil . So , I am thinking simple chic champagne ! ! but most importantly , sharing with those we love how much we love each other . In my professional life , I am able to tick of a to-do list like its nothing . I just ca n't get amped to do this . Maybe I need to set a date and then I will feel the pressure . I work a lot better under pressure . Cliche , yes ; but its true . <p> Okay , what you have planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I was never the type of girl who dreamed of her wedding either , and my ( now ) husband and I just decided one day that we were ready and skipped the whole engagement thing and planned a fun trip to Vegas to get married just the two of us . I would n't have done it any other way . It was the best 3-day-date of my life . We went to the spa for hours , spent all the money we would have on feeding other people at the best restaurants , and stayed in the most amazing suite . It was only about us and each other and it was perfect . Now the actually " ceremony " part was a little strange because there 's about 3 people that youve never met before , but its a hilarious memory and we love it . <p> So I do n't  have any real " wedding " is advice .. but just focus on each other . Keep it all simple ! Do n't  worry so much about the dress , we will all hate our wedding dresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wasting your time saying hello and goodbye to a million people , and for the love of God do n't  go bankrupt over it ! Good luck ! You 're onto something here , it will all come to you = <p> I have a wedding planning business and I LOVE weddingsIve been obsessed since high school buying wedding magazines and pulling out pages to save but never in all of that did I ever imagine that for myself but here I am 23 days away from my own and I have a giant great dane that was bit by a radioactive spider anxiety monster traipsing about inside me . I do n't  have anxiety about marrying my fiance , I 'll sprint down that aisle to marry him but its all the people and the hellos and the expectations that are engraved into all these peopleim more of a fade to the background kind of girl from the get go . <p> What 's been most important to me is feeling like myself ( as much as you can in a wedding dress ) on that day . I 'm wearing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ponytail because that 's how i wear my hair , garter and bouquet toss , nope , not happening . Food , its simple and good and if you do n't  like it , honestly , I do n't  carewalk yourself to the bar and have another drink and forget about dinner . Bridesmaids pick your own dress , I will not shackle to a chiffon nightmare for $300 that you will never ever wear again . <p> Everyone will tell you its your day its your day . Which I 'm sure they mean , but their well intended suggestions throughout the process make it feel like its theirs . My favorite line has been , " thanks for the idea but its just not our taste . " <p> You are definitely not alone in how you feel . Stick to your guns cuz tranditionsmadition , we build the lives we want ! Know that you will end up spending more money than you want but it will be okay , and that there are a bunch of women who feel just like you supporting you on your day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh hey , I just showed up here , like this , and now i 'm getting married type of gals <p> The wedding is just one day , the marriage is forever . Have a simple and sweet wedding and Invest time and energy and money into the marriage . that was my philosophy and I could n't have been happier with how it all turned out . The guests had a fun and relaxed time , my husband and i werent stressed out and were able to enjoy ourselves and not be exhausted after the ceremony.Julie recently posted .. Beachy Fashion <p> I never dreamed of a wedding either and the only reason I ended up having one is because I 'm an only child and I was trying to avoid a ten year guilt trip from my mother . We kept it very small and intimate with only our closest friends and family , but even that was a stressful experience . Everyone had a strong opinions and mile long lists on how we should do things . We actually had to tell a couple of people to fk off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our day was beautiful and I 'll never forget it , but even now , I wish we had gone and eloped in the Maldives as we wanted to do in the first place . <p> My point to all this is that you will love your day no matter what , but you should go with your gut in how you want it to pan out . Make it what YOU want it to be . Remember , you do n't  have to have a wedding to get married . <p> Not going to lie , I 've never been one to really have this entire vision of my wedding . I know what kind of vibes I want to give off and that 's about it . As excited as a lot of women are for their weddings , I am more excited for my marriage ( whenever I finally find someone to get to that point with , lol ) I think a lot of people forget that after your wedding and celebration , you have a marriage that you need to nurture and grow into . Honestly , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , I 'm so excited for you ! Hope you 're still healing well ! xx NoraNora C recently posted .. Red , White , and Boom ! <p> This is exactly how I was during my wedding planning . We were 31 and did n't  want to spend so much money for one night . We had a destination wedding in Mexico , at an all inclusive resort . We let the beach be our decor 20 of our family and closest friends made it , no bridesmaids or groomsmen- just my niece and stepson were in the wedding party . A sunset wedding and reception on the beach and we stayed at the resort for our honeymoon after everyone left . Easy breezy and I do n't  regret it at all . <p> My fiance and I got engaged over 2 years ago We are getting married this September &amp; its been an enjoyable wedding planning process . Each month we checked something off our " to do " list , and some months we skipped wedding planning all together . Our style is effortless California chic all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quantity . Were looking forward to a fantastic night with our closest family and friends , and not stressing one bit about whether the flowers are in the right place or not . Enjoy being engaged its a big chapter in anyones life &amp; should n't be rushed ( in my opinion ) ! love . <p> I am a wedding planner and honestly , you are a breath of fresh air , like the dream client ! I love when a girl can just ( literally ) let her hair down and make it about her and her new life partner , not the food , and how her mom is going to like things ! <p> For dresses , I would check out The Dress Theory here in SD . <p> And for destination , I imagine something in Mexico . Close enough for family to get to , yet still far enough away so you wont have crashers haha . <p> Check out these awesome venues that I LOVE ( For destination , I always suggest airbnb or private residences , because they are SO private and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million people ) <p> I officially have 30 days until my wedding and I cant WAIT to get it over with . We wanted to get married in Italy and have a very small intimate gathering , but I 'm an only child and my parents begged me to have a wedding in San Diego that they would pay for . How can you say no to that ? I should have ! Please please please make it about yourselves and do n't  let anyone else get involved . I should have listened to my heart but now we are going through the motions of an actual wedding and its terrible . It seems like you are on the right track ! Go somewhere beautiful that also comes with a wedding planner so you do n't  have to think about a thing . It will save you from all the stress and fights that come with a wedding . I wish you lots of luck and just focus on Michael . You two are the cutest ! Muah xoxo <p> Hi Lauryn , I decided to focus on a few things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I saved on all the other things . I knew I wanted a live band and a sit-down dinner with full bar . So I paid for those things , and kept a tighter budget for the extras . I would say you should definitely choose a good photographer and videographer . I did n't  get a video and wish I did . Also , I had 94 people , which is actually a small wedding , and we hardly got around to all the tables at dinner to say hi . Keep it small ! Ashley @ A Lady Goes West recently posted .. Travel plans and everything I ate yesterday <p> I 'm right there with you . I do n't  care about my wedding . I 'm not engaged but I 'm in a committed , serious relationship and I honestly think he wants a wedding more than me ! As for me ? I could go to city hall with a photographer to capture the big day and call it good . I guess I 'm more practical than anything . I 'd rather have a great honeymoon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have discovered in planning our wedding is the book and blog called A Practical Wedding . ( apracticalwedding.com ) Literally a life saver . The authors spend a lot of time giving real advice ( i.e. you do n't  need to give wedding favors ) to more meaningful advice ( i.e. what does a more beautiful version of myself even mean ? ) . I would so highly commend the book to you first ( its a really easy read ) and then the blog if you have time . I think it puts the wedding into perspective we always say that he asked me to marry him , not plan a wedding with him , but recognizing that this wedding is a necessary step , were trying to keep the big picture and smaller budget in mind . Good luck ! <p> Thank youuuu for being the voice of reason that weddings do n't  have to be $7892374 days with insane destination bachelorette parties that will bankrupt all your friends . So over that ! Ok , actually , I was never into that , lol . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at most , just our immediate family , then have a fun party-ish thing with our friends when we get home . <p> This post is everything ( &amp; more ) ! Reading this post is exactly how I feel about the whole wedding process . I 'm at the age where ALL my friends are getting married + having babies and getting SUPER excited about it . &amp; Here I am pinteresting all my favorite honeymoon locations not giving a F about a big fairytale wedding . Would love to see blog posts on your honeymoon planning process since that 's what I am most excited about . xoxo ! <p> Love how you 're trying to keep it simple ! . You 're saving yourself from tons of worry ( trust me my brother had a somewhat big wedding and his wife was freaking out up until the minute she walked down the aisle . ) My wedding was simple too : my husband and I married next to a brook on my best friends farm in Vermont . We selected the local fresh farm foods that were available that spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of what you guys love ( i.e. Champagne ! ) and spend on what you enjoy . We did the same , kept the wedding small and had the time of our lives without breaking the bank ! Check out the Anthropologie wedding dress site : http : //www.bhldn.com/ . I like their aesthetic and prices range from low to high . <p> You 're definitely not alone with the long engagement , chill pace of planning a wedding . I live in the south so there 's so much pressure to get the ball rolling and have everything planned the second the ring is on hand . So far I 'm just looking forward to wedding cake and champagne <p> I never dreamt of my wedding as a kid . After 6 years of dating we got engaged and kind of forgot to get it planned for like 1.5 years . I wanted to " elope " and couldnt get my husband to agree . He threw around Vegas , destination etc. and it was just soplanned and seemed so touristy . Any venue we looked at locally was ridiculous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up getting married up in the mountains in CO as we live in Denver . Our parents joined us . Then we came home , invited people from out of town ( about 35 total ) and had a big BBQ with cocktails and pizza from our favorite place for those that traveled . Then we had those same people plus local friends to one of our favorite upscale Mexican restaurants the next night . It did n't  end up cheap necessarily , but it was a good compromise and no plated food to deal with . <p> I loved getting married ! But I was never a girl who dreamed of how every plate , centerpiece and flower would look . Getting married actually showed me how decisive I was ! I planned my whole wedding in less than 6 months and for me that was perfect . I never felt rushed ( even though people told me I was crazy for trying to plan a wedding so quick ) and everything just fell into place . My hubby and I had been together since we were 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas Dance lol ) and we were just ready to say " I Do " . <p> My advice , just remember on the day of your wedding , not only our you marrying the man of your dreams but you are also surrounded by all the people who love and support you ( and him ) the most ! That 's pretty much the best damn feeling . So ignore the small things and keep your eye on the prize ! lol <p> First of all , CONGRATS ! You are going to be an absolutely stunning bride ( washed hair or not ; ) ) <p> I 'm not engaged yet , but I cant wait to be . I 'm like you and havent planned out a single second of my wedding ( except alcohol and dessertsplenty of each ) . I think its smart that you have n't completely gone ham on planning your wedding . I feel like there are SO many cool ideas on Pinterest , insta , etc , and it can be overwhelming . Not every idea goes together or is right for your wedding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your man candy , and everything will be stunning and perfect . LOVE YOU ! ! <p> Lauryn I know you do n't  think so but you actually have a TON planned out . You are just letting it happen organically , rather than forcing it , and you will see , like how TSC blossomed to the business of your dreams , your wedding will do the same . <p> A few weekends ago , I had to go way out of town for a wedding my boyfriend was in . He got there on Tuesday , and I got there on Friday well on Tuesday , rather than having a " bachelor party " , the groom spent those days with the guys who came in ( most of us cross-country ) and had three full days of guy time . No strippers , clubs , etc. , but more like golfing , breweries , scotches , and dinners . Then , the day before they went out with the bridal party for dinner and a winery . I thought that was a perfect way to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could EASILY implement that . Have your girls come in early , then have poolside cold pressed mimosas , lymphatic massages , and dinners . . The wedding ceremony itself was at a Botanical garden , in the Rose Garden , and it was pretty dreamy , with the reception being in the courtyard . I know they are all over different cities so who knows ? Also , Cabo is so special for you two , so that could be another to consider ! Portland , OR has an international rose garden with over 10,000 different varietals . It is STUNNING and that city is so , so , so fun with some of the best restaurants . <p> I am not married , but I already have it planned ( sounds crazy but hear me out ) I decided the wedding is just about me and him , so we would have a private beach side wedding of just the two of us ( maybe a photographer to capture it ) . Then throw a few parties to celebrate after . Its kind of a fancier way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also why I like the Honeymoon idea , because its just the two of yall . Like you , I 'd rather invest the money in my future , rather than one day . But ya , that 's what I have planned . <p> Stone Cold Fox is launching their bridal line this month so I am sure you will find some gorgeous options . Free People has some good ones , and honestly , check out Etsy ! You might find a hidden treasure . <p> Anyways , sorry for writing you a NOVEL , but wanted to share some thoughts/ideas with you . Best of luck with planning , and I hope you are healing well . &lt;3 xx <p> I got married 2 years ago and felt EXACTLY the same way that you did . I wanted to look and feel like myself ( not like I was in a costume playing dress up ) and I wanted it to be small and intimate and meaningful . I felt like I did n't  fit the " bride " role at all . so I did n't  do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are so many RULES out there but it is possible . My biggest pieces of advice are : stick to your gut . If something does n't  feel right to you , do n't  do it ( even if people start making noise which they will ) . I did n't  want to do a registry , I felt weird telling people what to buy me &amp; I wanted meaningful gifts . EVERYONE told me this would be a disaster but it was one of our best decisions FOR US . <p> Also , I went to two bridal salons and then quickly gave up on the whole " wedding dress " thing instead I spent a glamorous day of shopping at Barneys and Bergdorf Goodman ( I live in NYC ) and bought a drop dead gorgeous long white Giambattista Valli dress . If you start looking at designers ready to wear collections you will be AMAZED at how many white dresses they have and a RTW Valentino or Oscar de la Renta or Chloe or Calvin Klein ( etc ) dress is wayyyyyy cheaper than your average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their wedding dresses . They have some gorgeous non-princess options . If you buy it in person at a designers shop or at someplace like Bergdorf , they will tailor it to you so you will have a perfect fit . I feel like I had the most beautiful wedding dress in the world AND I felt like myself . <p> Lastly , I opted to get married on the 4th of July on a rooftop in Manhattan so we could all eat outside and watch the fireworks and sip mojitos . This kept the event relaxed and fun and not too wedding-y and we did food trucks for our rehearsal dinner and they were great , so I definitely approve of your in-n-out idea Oh , and we worked with our favorite local restaurant to cook our dinner on site , so that we did n't  serve our guests awful catering food this just meant that we had to hire waiters and rent linens/dishes from a different company rather than getting an easy ( and boring ) all-in-one catering package . It was a little more complicated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ! ! ! I have been engaged for three years because I was never in any rush , nor did I want to plan or have time to plan my wedding . Its like everytime I started I got overwhelmed and nothing I wanted . I thought I was soooo weird since everyone around me was just so excited for me and wanted to plan the whole thing , and I wanted nothing to do with it . Hence why were still engaged . I 'm Just not sure how to even start without getting freaked out . And wedding planners , tried two , and they 're even more scary . I also glad I am not alone in this . But is three years too long ! ? <p> Totally related to all of this ! Simple , intimate and relaxed are definitely 3 words I 'd want for my wedding too . Have you checked out greenweddingshoes.com ? There are some wildly styled shoots but in the mix are relaxed , effortless , beautiful , real weddings . This site has given me a lot of inspiration and validated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to be hardcore princess bride obsessed , as I 've gotten older Im more like you about weddings . The funny part is , my parents and grandparents eloped . My grandparents were hopelessly devoted to each other for 57 years and my parents have been married 27 years . Now I just want to wear a sexy dress that reminds the guy why he married me , eat my favorite food ( kale Cesar salads , Mac and cheese , lobster ) , dance , have great pictures , party with the people my future kids will actually know by name , and marry the man I love . Love your honesty , as always ! MacKenzie recently posted .. Pageant-versary <p> This was totally me ! I was not excited about the wedding . The engagement and the honeymoon were where it was at . Everything was very low key . We did a bbq and finger foods . No one wants to sit down and wait for the party , and that 's what a wedding is supposed to be right ? A celebration of you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If its you and you 're having fun , all of your guests will too ! Heather O recently posted .. Meet the Newest Member Of the Family <p> I would say small and intimate is the best way to go .

I have been at big weddings and people did not even know the grooms name . **33;253;TOOLONG . Do n't  sweat all the small details because in the end it really does not matter .

Chilled vibes , simple food and tight friends would definitely make for an awesome wedding . I could see that being so you too ! I cant wait to see what you decide on . xx , Pia <p> My husband and I recently married in Tavarua , Fiji . Its a really special place for us and I 've been going there for years .

Plus we saved SOOO.MUCH.MONEY !

Poor guy asked me twice but I still cant get it together to set date/details . The whole fuss makes me cringe . I 've always been more into our **28;288;TOOLONG wealth .. Felt that way in my 20s when everyone was getting married and now at 34 I still do . ( half of them are divorced anyway . Maybe they got more caught up in the idea of wedding rather than the two of them . But I would love to celebrate now the two of us and have our kids part of itsomething small totally get you . <p> I feel ya gurl . I just had my wedding 4 weeks ago and did not enjoy the planning process one bit ! Everyone thought I was such a weirdo . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all worth it , but I would never , ever want to go through that again . So much unnecessary stress on top of everything else going on in life . <p> My advice keep it simple . Keep it focused on you two and the things YOU love . People will remember the couple , the music , the food , the drinking , the dancing . All the other details will be forgotten , so do n't  stress over them . Take your time planning . Make it a goal to cross one big thing off of your to-do list a month . For every annoying thing you have to do ( guest list , addresses , etc. ) do something fun ( food/cake tasting ) . It will make the process way more enjoyable if you mix it up . Good luck ! <p> I was the SAME way . Plus I was studying for the bar and couldnt be bothered . <p> We had a destination wedding in Mexico low key dress my favorite people awesome bartender .

How to Deal with Toxic Crap on Social Media <p> When it comes to eating clean , I crowd out the bad shit to make room for the good . <p> When it comes to people , I crowd out the gloomy Eeyores to make room for the positive Pennys . <p> And when it comes to social media , I crowd out the negative to make room for the motivational . <p> The older I get the more I choose to follow motivational , uplifting people on social media . <p> So instead of reading negativity on all of these social platforms , I 've made a strong choice- to follow/like/etc. positive role models , gurus , people and magazines . Basically I crowd out angry statuses ( or block them ) so I can focus on things- like " Entrepreneur Magazine " or Ghandi quotes or whatever makes me happy . <p> This could be positive blogs , funny people on Snapchat , a dogs Instagram page , entrepreneurs on Twitter , a rad charity on Facebook &amp;/or motivational quotes ( &lt;&lt; like the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is because I feel like social media is a part of my life so I might as well make it a pleasant experience every time I log on , right ? <p> And the reason I 'm telling you guys this is because I want to encourage you to really look at who you 're following/liking/etc .

Several years back I was bombarded with toxic , negative posts all over my social media and I kept thinking " I 'm 21/22 why is this a thing ? " and then I realized it was the people I had surrounded myself with and allowed to be toxic in my life . I have severe anxiety and my husband noticed that my attacks surfaced from all the negativity I would receive or see on line . My old blog , in which I had for 9 years , got hit with negativity because I was " Too uplifting and Honest about my feelings . " and I did n't  understand that because I am a honest , uplifting person . Apparently negative people do n't  like honesty ? I had a ongoing series on my blog for about a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and it was about building myself back up because of all the hate I was getting in my life from broken friendships , and this hate was being brought to all of my social media accounts .

I am still positive and uplifting . and now that I 've blocked out all the negative energies , I am loving the responses I am getting because of the people I 've surrounded myself with .

We covered Venice for you but promised Florence . So TA-DA . Of course if you have anything to add to this post , PLZ DO . We love hearing your recommendations . <p> I very much plan on going to Florence again . If not for the beautiful sights , for the heart- ( YES HEART ) shaped pizza . Literal best pizza EVER . I could have eaten ten . Seriously if I lived there I would for sure be 20 pounds heavier than I amjust because of the pizza . <p> Anyway , I 'll let Mr. Travel Guru , Michael take it away . He really delivered with Florence . We hope this helps if you guys make the trip to Florence ! As always , leave any questions or suggestions below . Ok , here 's Michael : <p> Ok , so I 'm going to keep it as short and sweet as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to get the low-down quickly and efficiently . There are plenty of sites online that will tell you about the major landmarks &amp; museums so I wont waste your time with all that . <h> These itineraries are what Lauryn &amp; I recommend based on what weve actually done : <p> PRO TIP : If you are going to Florence for the first time , I recommend going for 3 days max and taking the train to another Italian city/location if you have extra time . The city is small enough to fully walk in a day or two . The train is really easy in Italy so why not see another part of the country if you have the time ! <p> If you are considering seeing the sites , museums and galleries I recommend grabbing the Firenze card . It will save you time . No lines which can be a huge headache . This card gets you in to all the majors . <p> Boboli Gardens " Go here and use your Firenze card to take a tour of the gardens which are really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After , grab some wine and cocktails in that area . <p> David " go see Michelangelo 's David and his little dingaling , it 's something you should see if you make your way to Florence and after go to the Piazza Del Duomo . <p> Piazza del Duomo " The Duomo is amazing , the detail is incredible . Go to the top if you can , it 's a hike though so be warned . Your Firenze card will work here as well . I made Lauryn go to the very top ( she 's scared of heights ) &amp; we both agreed it was well worth it . <p> Four Seasons Bar Atrium- " The Four Seasons was actually an estate owned by the Medici family who ruled Florence for many years . The property is amazing and has an awesome pool and garden that are both worth seeing . <p> Florence has a really cool bar scene at night . You can bar hop all night if you want ! <p> Wine Tasting in Tuscany- - Florence is in the Tuscany region . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasting . It 's a must in my opinion . If you are up for some adventure there is a really cool town built up in the hills of Siena called San Gimignano . <p> Gusta Pizza- - Lauryn made me walk across the entire city in order to get a blogger picture of the heart-shaped pizza . It was 100% worth it though because the pizza was just amazing . <p> Last but not least , drink a lot of wine and be romantic . Florence is a really easy city to walk in and see amazing sights . Every building has so much character and detail . Walk around and when you get tired stop in at any number of places and have a glass of wine , rinse and repeat . <p> The highlight of my trip to Florence was near the Ponte Vecchio . Go to the bridge that is parallel to it . You know , where probably every photo you see of it would be taken . Take some wine and cheese with you . Go out on the bridge and there are massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the ledge and go sit on the pillar and drink wine and enjoy the stillness of the Arno and the gorgeous view . The pillars are massive , we fit 15 people on it . Just obviously be careful and do n't  fall off or youll land in the river . <p> The heart pizza is cute but it bothers me how the cheese is not evenly distributed ! ! I 'm sure I would be that Ugly American who complains because it does n't  look like my frozen pizza from Publix . But I bet the sauce &amp; dough were delicious ! <p> I think Florence was one of the most romantic places I have ever been and I have THE BEST memories from there . There was a bunch of stairs that looked over the city ( Piazzale Michelangelo ) but if you go there at night you can bring a bottle of wine and watch some people play music and watch the sun set over the city . This was seriously like straight out of a movie and so amazing .

Ca n't wait to share all of the details with you guys. - Travel itineraries , memories , &amp; outfit detail posts are COMING SOON. - Promise . <p> That being said , there are a few items I literally would have died without while traveling . They kept the whole situation organized &amp; feeling cute while bouncing around France , so I figured I 'd share them ! <p> LOVE this carry on . Its super sleek &amp; chic . Plus it has TONS- of compartments inside so you can stay completely organized . While traveling abroad its very likely ( unfortunately ) that your luggage could get lost . So definitely ALWAYS bring a carry on with at least two days worth of clothes &amp; all of you 're valuables ( jewelry , sunglasses , favorite makeup ! ) .

Keep your skin hydrated &amp; nourished so you can keep that dewey , healthy- look throughout whole trip . This mask is definitely one of my favorites . Its also small &amp; convenient which makes it ideal for travel . More mask posts coming . <p> Another little travel tip , get a suitcase that is EASY to recognize . When you 're standing in baggage claim- its so much easier to spot this cute suitcase than a generic black bag that looks like every other black bag . Plus , how cute will you look- walking through the airport with this bad boy ? ! <p> I 've learned this one the hard way .

@@3098267 <p> Ok , so if you did n't know , we are having- a MAJOR , MAJOR drought in California . <p> &amp; this post is about the little things YOU ( &amp; I ) can do to make a BIG , BIG difference . <p> I think it 's very important to utilize the Internet to spread awareness , especially when there 's a community of people involved . I 've partnered with Niagara Conservation to help spread the word on how you can make small changes that create- a world of difference . <p> On that note , let 's hop right into it . <p> Water conservation . <p> The water sitch is real guys . <p> Every day I do small , little things to help conserve water . <p> Like what ? <p> Glad you asked . <p> Firstly , the obvious : I do n't take 29384723947 hour showers . I 'm in &amp; out . Baths are few &amp; far between because 1 . ) I 'm a busy bee &amp; 2. ) taking a bath 3 times a week is a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much obvious thing : I never leave the water on while brushing my teeth . Ever . It 's actually a pet peeve . Anyone else ? <p> We also installed a water-saving shower head &amp; it 's awesome . Easy took one second &amp; it saves a TON of water . <p> To be entirely honest , when I was in college I would run the dishwasher or washing machine when there was barely anything in it . Made eggs ? Ran the dishwasher . White pants needed cleaning ? Threw it in the washing machine . <h> Now though ? I 'm much pickier . <p> This may sound weird but I like a full dishwasher &amp; full washing machine before I run it . Exception : if I do n't want to mess up- my clothes , I 'll run white pants , a white tee , a white dress , &amp; a white bra together . No need to JUST run the white pants . You live &amp; learn . <p> Now let 's discuss .. TOILETS . <p> A toilet seems like a weird thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; what else do you expect from The Skinny Confidential anyway ? A toilet is actually something you &amp; I use everyday Really , think about it , everyone on the planet uses a toilet so why not make it the right toilet ? I 'm all about helping the planet in small ways because , let 's face it small changes every day make a huge difference . <p> For our LA condo , I worked with Niagara Conservation to install their new Ultra-High Efficiency Single Flush toilet that not only helps save water , BUT is also very inexpensive at only $149 &amp; stylish ( yes , a toilet can be stylish trust me ) . Plus , you may even get a rebate from the water supplier just for installing it to find out if you 're eligible , check here . BUT let 's go deeper : the main reason I 'm obsessed ? WELL , it 's the MOST water efficient toilet on the planet . <p> Every day I feel like I 'm making a difference when it comes to the water problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should know that an average toilets flush uses anywhere from a container of milk TO a fish tank of water . I MEAN , WHAT ? Yes completely true . It goes deeper though . One dumb toilet wastes a freaking SWIMMING POOL of water a year . <p> That 's sick . <p> Once I found that out &amp; we were looking for a toilet , I immediately wanted something more practical . If you 're interested in spreading the word on this crazy wasteful situation , you can check out this campaign . <h> The guy who installed it took 20 minutes . <p> It was in &amp; out , a total WHAM BAM THANK YOU MAAM , bang-it-out kind of thing . <p> Jenni Pulos from Flipping Out did a whole campaign about the toilet &amp; I was immediately sold after watching her informative video . She also said she stopped watering her grass as much &amp; actually noticed that the grass grew MORE . <p> To fully wrap up the toilet talk : try not to use your toilet as an ash-tray or waste basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We ca n't all be perfect but little changes can make a huge difference when we 're properly informed . <p> OK , I 've been wanting to do a post on water conservation for a while now . Needed to get all that off my chest . Thoughts on this ? I would love to know how you guys conserve water . Are you mindful of this even if you do n't live in California ? What 's your take on this ? <p> Chat soon , lauryn x <p> + this post is in collaboration with- Niagara Conservation . All opinions are my own . <p> I am super sensitive about water conservation . Recently we faced water problem and learned a lot of ways to save water . I would like one of the ways which I love a lot is , using the water used for washing fruits and vegetable while cooking , for watering the potted plants . And to my amazement they grew super healthy ! ! ! <p> I feel the same way about water . It literally drives me crazy when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even in there and all little things like that . Its so easy to make some changes to our lifestyles ! <p> This only works if you have a tub-shower combo but I like to sit in my tub and let the shower rain down , its my " lazy shower " time ! Especially after a long day , I just find it really relaxing . Did n't  they do something similar in Casino Royale after they killed those mercenaries in the stairwell ? ? All the laziness of a bath with the efficiency of a shower . And then I can wash my hair under the tap , that helps my hair get way cleaner than the weak sprinkle of the shower . <p> A great water saving toilet is life changing when you start to pay water bills ! It is amazing how littler changes can make the price drop . Its always great to hear of a new brand that actively seeks ways to help conserve ! <p> Another way to reduce your water footprint is to reduce your meat and dairy consumption . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lb hamburger considering the water to grow the feed crops , the water the animal drinks and the servicing of the animal . ( See water.usgs.gov ) . Even a couple meat free days a week really makes a difference ! Another way to save is to capture the " warm up " water from your shower in a bucket and use on plants or for dishes . You may not get a lot with the low flow shower head but its something ! Thanks for posting this and raising awareness ! <p> Great post Lauryn ! Before moving to California , my home country was going through a drought too so Ive been trying to conserving water for a while . Small gestures are so important and each and everyone of us can make a huge difference . Thank you for spreading awareness about this issue ! <p> I am very mindful of water saving . Like you I only take super short showers . Also I do n't  eat meat which saves a ton of water . And I never run the dish washer unless its full . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good you are writing a post about this . <p> Maybe not for the drought in CA specifically , but reducing animal product consumption is a huge water saver ! Producing one pound of beef uses 2000 gallons of water . INSANE . The agriculture industry often gets overlooked when it comes to sustainability but to me its super important to recognize ! <p> Yes ! Nearly half of all the water used in the United States goes to raising animals for food ! ! And animals raised for food produce over 100 times the excrement as the entire human population and animal farms pollute our waterways more than all other industrial sources combined . " Run-offs of animal waste , pesticides , chemicals , fertilizers , hormones and antibiotics are contributing to dead zones in coastal areas , degradation of coral reef and health problems . " <p> The water shortage has been a serious issue in California , as I 've heard from some friends . These tips can help anyone looking to conserve water , so thanks for sharing ! I 'm going to give some of these tips a try at home . 
@@3098269 <h> Buying Tickets To The Circus ? <p> Updated : March 13 , 2017 <p> by <p> LAURYN <p> Drama . <p> We 've all been there . <p> I feel like its been almost a theme with specific people . Can anyone relate here ? Drama is yawn , yawn , yawn &amp; usually very avoidable . <p> The problem with drama is it sucks the energy from you . Its like a Dementor from Harry Potter . Sucking all positive energy giving power to the negative . Of course no surprise I do everything &amp; anything to avoid it . <p> Because if you think about it , its all very pointless ? <p> To be honest I love drama when its appropriate ( design-wise , LOL ) but when it comes to peoples drama ? I stay far , FAR away . Just because I feel like its a waste of energy . CREATIVE energy , life energy , positive energy . And boy do I vibe off energy <p> ANYWAY ! Recently I was listening to The Bitch Bibles Podcast &amp; her guest , - Marissa Hermer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOST AMAZING QUOTE EVERRRRR : - do n't  be surprised if you see elephants if you buy tickets to the circus . <p> And I stopped &amp; re-listened to this quote . <p> Its true though : how many times have we subscribed to dramatic delusions &amp; then were shocked there 's a negative response ? <p> On my end ? Eer , A LOT . <p> SO many times Ive gotten sucked into negativity &amp; was then surprised by the kind of gross , dramatic outcome . <p> here 's the thing : there should be NO surprise if I entertained the drama in the first place ( AKA went to see the elephants ) . Basically its my fault if I 've given it energy . <p> Jackies response to Marissa was : if you 've had a problem with everyone you know , ITS YOU . <p> How many people are self-aware enough to recognize that ? <p> I feel like the way to avoid drama is to mind your own business . This is a whole different post but really , I 've found minding your own business is the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this means- LISTEN to this podcast episode with Mark Manson . He wrote this book called The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck . There are SOOOO many fantastic lessons in his book- its nuts . Lessons that separate bullshit from priorities . Lately , I 've been choosing carefully where to give my fucks &amp; I 'm giving none towards petty drama or toxicity . <p> For a drama-free life : if I want to give advice I ask someone if " they 're at request for coaching " &amp; if they say yes I try to know my limits . Or I simply mind my own business &amp; stay in my own lane . <p> If all else fails I say NO- &amp; try not to entertain the drama especially when it comes to gossip . <p> Again gossip wastes energy . Energy I would rather put toward my business or friends/family . <p> I used to work in a place where it was constantly drama , like non stop . I got also caught up in it few times but even if I was not involved just by hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Makes you think all day about it , ruins your mood and basically its a waste of time.http : //mihabalan.com <p> I so agree with this ! My dad always said , " Lifes too short to put up with other peoples bullshit . " And drama is just that bullshit . There 's so much more to life than that . Its best to focus on the positives . <p> Haha I love the dementor comparison . So true . I hate drama . I 'm with you thoughI like drama and excitement in certain areas of my life , but avoid other peoples issues entirely . I laugh at those memes that say like " cant have any problems if you just always stay home " and although that 's extreme , its really true . <p> Oddly enough I just posted this : https : **33;376;TOOLONG on Insta yesterday about drama ! I honestly ca n't stand it , I avoid it at all costs . I cut out a lot of ppl in my life that always had drama in their lives bc , quite frankly , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and I preferred to have guy friends over girls in order to ensure there was less around me . Which is probably the reason why I have ZERO girl friends now . No its not bc I do n't  like girl friends , I had my son over a year ago , and I do n't  have a lot of time for friends anymore . I noticed once I cldnt go out that the friends dwindled off , and that 's okay with me . I enjoy spending quality time with my family , and alone time is the greatest thing in the world if you ask me ! I also noticed that once my circle of friends got smaller , that I have ZERO drama in my life anymore ! So I 'm very happy with how it worked out ! Lifes too short for bullshit ! We should all just focus on the present , ourselves , and the ones that truly matter . At least that 's my opinion. = I cldnt agree more with you Lauryn ! xX= <p> I HATE drama ! I used to entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep certain relationships . But in the last year of my life Ive just realized that I do not have time or space for negative people . I can be there for someone who 's hurting or going through a rough time , but that 's totally different than having truly toxic people around you . Great post , Lauryn ! <p> At my previous job , I entertained gossip , therefore inviting negativity into my life . I also opened myself up to people I should n't have . I was constantly feeding into the drama and was shocked when I found myself feeling like I was drowning in negativity . I felt confused , unhappy and disappointed in not only the people I was associating with , but also myself . I took the initiative to leave the job , and started a new one about a year ago . I made it a point to combat any negative/gossip comment with a positive response . I now feel so much more satisfied and genuinely happy that I am NEVER a part of any drama or BS . I always try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other peoples perspectives in any situation . I think the best way to avoid drama is to make a conscious effort practice positivity and optimism . It might be difficult at first , but its like going to the gym . Once you start going and getting into the habit , its hard not to feel guilty when you do n't  go . So I thank you for this positive reminder to be your best self and emphasizing the importance of self-awareness ! ! <p> That . Is. a Brilliant Quote . I hate drama too , and made a conscious decision around age 24 to avoid drama as much as possible . Since then , I only put energy in people I love , make me happy and are low on the drama scale ( this does not include crises I 'm all about helping friends in a crisis ) . This approach has been working great I just do n't  buy tickets to the circus anymore = LONG ... <p> HATE drama . I vibe hugely off energy too &amp; I need positive , uplifting people near or else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to stay in my lane &amp; only give advice if its asked for . ( unless its my best friend , we have no filter with each other LOL ) Life is short , there 's no time for BS !

Unless of course its 11 AM- &amp; you 're feeling more of a cucumber &amp; lemon water moment . <p> The logic behind this is simply that the alternative to a blowout is to waste an uninterrupted hour of work on washing- it myself and my hair never looks as good when I 'm doing it myself . The hour of work is worth the dough . Time is money , right . <h> Is this theory off-base ? Thoughts ? <p> Ok well let 's get right into the whole reason you 're reading : two hair products . <p> These are two products that I literally bring in my purse to the salon OR use at home . They 're nothing fancy . Straight to the point actually . I 've used both of these for YEARS &amp; honestly have n't ever swayed . Its like a bad boy , motorcycle riding hottie ex-boyfriend you cant quit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , even if you 're brunette . Why ? Because ! ! ! It takes the brassiness out of hair . Just ask my friend , Erica from Fashionlush . You know the orange-ish , sometimes yellow-y look ? Well- purple shampoo dilutes that while kind of cooling it down . Personally red / orange tones are not flattering on my skin ( which is also why I always ask for spray tan shades that do n't  have red tones in them ) so the purple shampoo removes all those unflattering tones immediately . <p> I use it every OTHER week , not- every time . Its overkill . You 'll also need conditioner because purple shampoo NEEDS something moisturizing- to compliment it . Lastly , make sure you leave it on for a hot minute . Do n't  rush to rinse it out , you know ? Just let it chill so you can soak up all of its magical goodness . <p> This one is $10.76 &amp; its the holy grail of shampoo in my opinion ( &lt;&lt; nothing sponsored , just LOVE ) . I pair it with- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal too if you want . Use both every other wash for best results . <p> The best thing about this product though is that it sort of gives waves with that chic , edgy vibe . Its hard to explain but it takes the 4-year-old curl out of the equation . Basically makes the curls less precious ? My waves DO NOT LOOK the same without this product . After waves are added to my hair I add this thick dry finishing spray to complete the look . I spray it about 6 inches from my hair &amp; kind of shake up the hair . If you 're curious about more hair details : sex pot curl breakdown here , video tutorial here . <h> It gives the perfect finish to a wave or curl . SO IDEAL . <p> Honestly I would n't even want- my hair done if I did n't  have this product . Its that good . <p> Oh , if you 're going to get- this , no need to buy the full size . Just get the travel size . Its less expensive &amp; fits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What is your holy grail hair product ? Do n't  get too crazy , you know I hate to wash my hair so an expensive shampoo is not my favorite ! HA . <p> Talk tomorrow , happy Thursday ! <p> lauryn x <p> + be sure to listen to our latest podcast episode . My friend , Danny , is one of the most motivational people EVER . Listen for free on iTunes or just click the play button at the top of blog ! Also , new exclusive TSC App content is LIVE : " 3 Ways To Get Your Ass In The Gym " by yours truly &amp; " What Lauryn Does For Me " by Michael . <p> Obsessed with purple shampoo and conditioner too ! ! I use Pravana Perfect Blonde Toning Mask and Fanola No Yellow shampoo , they are both amazing ! Also , in between using purple shampoo , I like to use the Malibu C Hard Water Wellness shampoo , it removes any mineral buildup from hard water ( I live in LA and the water is terrible ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purple shampoo since it can build up on hair causing it to darken and prevent the shiny bright blonde that I love . <p> A couple shampoos I like are Living Proof and Kevin Murphy . I also have a Kevin Murphy serum that I add in before I blow dry . I think most shampoos are good , the key is just scrub your scalp real well and make sure you rinse everything out , even more than you might think you have to ( Which they will always do for you at the salon ) . For thick hair , brushing your hair before you wash it is another thing I try and remember to do . Or even brushing it in the shower ( yes , I have the wet brush ! ) You have got me curious about the Oribe spray ! <p> I LOVE a good blowout and 100% agree that it is worth the money spent . I look forward to trying this dry texturizing spray to my curls ! They need all the sex and all the drama they can get ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Purple shampoo has seriously become a life saver for me ! I 'm so excited to see that you talked about this ! It seemed like every time I dyed my hair , my blonde would turn into the heinous brassy , yellow color . Which was farrrr from the nice ash hue I was always aiming for . I live in the Sunshine state so the sun did n't  help make it any better either . I started using the purple shampoo by Keratin Complex . They has a debrass shampoo and conditioner and its been amazing . Not sure if you 've ever used it before but its worth looking into . Honestly for my mess of head , it worked wonders .

Specifically : building a brand , business , &amp; platform online . <p> Bit of a background on Cernovich so you can understand why Michael &amp; I were VERY excited to go on the show . Firstly , Mike Cernovich is the author of Gorilla Mindset , which happens to be one of Michaels favorite books ( you know this though if you 're in the monthly book club ! ) . Its a book that has helped millions of people change how they think and feel through his mindset techniques . His podcast is the most popular mindset podcast in the world . His- writing has been covered in the Washington Post , MSNBC , and many other outlets . He runs a popular website called Danger And Play- too . <p> His podcast just MOTIVATES THE HELL OUT OF ME . Its one of those podcasts where you just run on the treadmill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mike calls it how it is . No bullshit . A real dose of reality if you know what I mean . <p> For some reason , people may assume his podcast is for men . <p> Well , I beg to differ because I like the aggressive , in your face realities he podcasts about . <h> It makes me want to hustle &amp; stay on brand &amp; just kick ass . <p> Anyway , when we found out we were going on his podcast , we definitely did a little champagne cheers . <p> The episode ended up being all about the realities of running a business . The truths , pulling the curtain off of the Wizard of OZ &amp; seeing what 's really there . Mike works 7 days a week on his craft . To be a master , you do what you got ta do . <p> I agree with Mike there . I 'm always trying to do the work - it- builds habit &amp; persistence , which in my opinion , eventually builds success . <p> This interview with Mike is raw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you like it , PLEASE LET ME KNOW because then I will do more blog posts on the truths/BTS of- building a brand , business , &amp; platform . WARNING : will not be sugar coated . <p> Oh , &amp; get excited because Cernovich will be coming on our podcast- in late August . Questions for him ?

When he walked into The One &amp; Only Palmillas terrace restaurant everyone applauded &amp; he loved every second . Truthfully I was very focused on his light pink shirt which was very TSC-esque ( right ? ) . Anyway , this was his time to shine . He basically almost put on tap shoes . <p> Kygo played in the background while everyone was served THE YUMMIEST , CALORIE-FILLED BREAKFAST FOOD . <h> Like I skipped the cake because of THE HANGOVER BRUNCH . <p> Remember in Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factory ?

@@3098279 <h> My Favorite Workout : Core40 Pilates <p> Updated : April 29 , 2016 <p> by <p> LAURYN <p> Can I say that I dieover this workout ? Die= I love.love.love. &amp; also meaning its incredibly hardin all the right ways . For the past couple of months , at least four times a week , I 've been attending classes at Core40 . I 'm addicted ! ! ! . <p> Why ? Its high intensity , high energy Proformer Pilates with uplifting music they also offer an insane spin class too . After forty minutes , I leave the studio feeling strong , motivated , &amp; dripping in sweat . The workout is all about creating that long &amp; lean muscle . I 'm also teaching it now- so come see me ? Ok , ok , here 's all the deets : <p> + Describe the new &amp; improved BodyROK . <p> Core40 : Were so excited about our new brand-- Core40- Studios ! When we first opened in Solana Beach as Sculpt over three years ago , we offered only the incredible sculpting benefits of SPX Pilates aka Lagree Fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago , the studios have evolved into such a unique concept with the sculpt , the cycle , &amp; the motivating vibe , that it was time to bring it all under this exciting new brand . Another new development is our partnership with the amazing surf photographer , Aaron Chang , whose photographs are now gracing our walls . Who does n't  want to gaze into beautiful ocean art while getting an amazing workout ? ! We are the same studio , same body sculpting workouts , same incredible community just a new name and a sleeker look ! <p> + How many classes per week does it take to see results ? <p> C40 : - Three to four times a week is the best bet . Since its a form of strength training we recommend taking every other day to give the muscles a chance to recover , but you can always take a cycle/spin class in between to mix it up ! <p> + Which parts of the body transform the quickest ? <p> C40 : - Abs &amp; buns ! The machine allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that really sculpt them- fast ! And we have so many awesome moves for lifting and toning the buns : even lunges done on the Proformer do the trick for the backside more so than with any other method . <p> + Best part of teaching at Core40 ? <p> C40 : - Watching people transform is definitely one of the best parts of the job . We see people of all ages 20s to late 60s slim down , tone up , &amp; become stronger- its incredible . All of the sudden we notice their arms looking more defined , waists whittling , &amp; buns lifting- everything that we work out for ! <p> Another plus : time efficiency . You work out for forty to fifty minutes a day &amp; see results in about three to four WEEKS . Ca n't beat that ! <p> + What makes this workout stand out ? <p> C40 : - Our method is based on slow movements &amp; isometric holds while keeping the heart rate up throughout the whole class . If you do things at a slower pace , it digs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean muscle that we all dream about . And the isometric holds send the muscles in to that exhaustion state- all you can take is forty minutes of this class . Andits so fun ! <p> + Describe Core40 in one sentence . <p> C40 : #bestworkoutever . <p> ++ For examples of the Core40 workout , click here .

Hopefully next week we can actually get to the wedding . Four days of wedding is a lot of content ! ! ! <p> Clearly we did more white than black here . Black was more the accent . Everyone had a big , HUGE , THICK white tile at their seat . On it was their name in whimsical calligraphy ( thank you Seniman Calligraphy for this festive touch ) . <p> There were a lot of white flowers ( babys breath &amp; white roses ) with a hint of black callilies . <p> And tons , AND I MEAN TONS , of candles . <p> The day of The Rehearsal Dinner I actually sent someone to Rite-Aid to pick up 200 more candles . <p> I could have cared less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white candles , all different shaped &amp; sizes dripping everywhere . The candles were all down the table , some in glass cylinders , some free-standing , some so dirt cheap they burned in 5 minutes . <p> Whatever . <h> JUST A LOT , everywhere , I needed a million . <p> Twinkle lights hung above the table , the band played Rat Pack music , &amp; the chilled shots were flowing <p> I 'm always one for fun but I do n't  like to get too drunk . I mean I prefer a great buzz off a few glasses of wine or a couple of skinny margaritas . <p> But here 's the thing : when you 're getting married , YOU ARE BUSY . So busy that you forget to eat . Now I usually never forget to eat . I mean how could you ? Its the best . I love to eat . <p> But I 'm telling you the week of my wedding , I forgot ( any brides relate ? ) . You 're so busy , so crazed , &amp; mixed with work &amp; entertaining my familyI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But really you justforget . <p> And well , the day of The Rehearsal DinnerI fucking forgot . I think I had some eggseer , for breakfast &amp; maybe a few chips ? Maybe ? Not nearly enough water . Like a sip . <p> Horrible . <p> NOT only did I forget to eat : there were Karma tequila shots everywhere . Typically I 'm not a shot person but for some reason I wanted a few to be like one of the guys . Just a big-ass , atrocious FAIL . <p> Stress was also a huge factor . <p> There was so much stress leading up to the events : family , friends , arrangements , getting rooms ready , e-mails , planning , the band , the decor , flowers , seating charts , blah-blah-biddity-blah , &amp; of courseleaving everything to the last-minute ( &lt;&lt; me ) . <p> So ya , I basically got wayyyyy too wasted . <p> ( Really not a hot look in a gold mini .

Let 's get very detailed here : I even threw a banana at Mimi ( not in a mean way ) &amp; squished kiwis on the floor with my heels . Mimi was a little perturbed to say the least . <p> Charming . <p> AND THIS guys , is why I had a 55 person weddingso I could have my Sharon Stone Casino slicked-back ponytail psycho moment . <p> AND lose my mind . <p> I mean it was a good crew , no one judged me . Everyone laughed . &amp; the next morningI felt better . Relieved to let it all out , you know . A BREATH OF FRESH AIR . <p> ( Keep in mind this shit show did n't  happen until later in the night- THANK GOD- so the parents did n't  see the whole show , only half ) . <p> here 's the best part : I ( like me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and me in the other . But I was so psycho I ended up forcing him to sleep in my room with me . So his room was empty . Because that makes sense ? And we woke up together on our wedding day ( insert knife Emoji here ) . <p> I should also note : Michael ended up hiding in a bush at the end of the night because I so was nuts . Like actually hiding in a bush . Picture me screaming his name &amp; he s shaking behind a bush . CONRGATS TO THE HAPPY COUPLE . <p> ! ! ! I WENT PSYCHOTIC ! ! ! <p> What 's a hungry , stressed , drunk bride to do ? <p> Well . Actually if were being real I kind of liked it . <p> The whole display was funny &amp; added character to the wedding weekend . HAHAHA . ( Told you , I 'm nuts ) . A good story to tell my future kids . Besides I hate boring . <p> So if you ask any of my friends about The Rehearsal Dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I was SO very in the same rocky boat . Had our nice rehearsal dinner &amp; then decided to get one drink ( always start like that does n't  it ? ! ) with our Bridal Party and got drunk ( TOO MUCH FUCKING STRESS ) . Woke up at 5:30a on my wedding day feeling like death and needed my girls to get extra strength advil and some ginger ale to survive that morning . Luckily I was alive by the time we got to the venue but yyyeeeaaahhhhh that stress drinking is no joke . For the record , literally had 2 glasses of champagne through the whole wedding/reception soooo &lt;3 <p> This is hilarious and so relatable . When I threw my first thanksgiving ( not nearly as stressful but i 'm v type a and a perfectionist ) and started cooking so early I thought whatever i tasted while cooking would tide me over . WRONG ! white wine , empty stomach , stressed out meant I got way too drunk , cried because the mashed potatoes turned out not perfect , and fell asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while cooking now . <p> Your honesty is always very refreshing and fun to read . You could have easily left out your psycho drunk moment and made everything seem picture perfect , but I 'm so glad you included it . Like you said it will make for a funny memory looking back I 'm sure . And how nice to be surrounded with such supportive people that did n't  judge you or hold it against you the next day , but just laugh it off with you . Thats goals right there . Also , all the pictures are amazing ! ! XO <p> I seriously love that you had a meltdown LOL I feel like you are very put together ( even when you 're not " put together " ) and you had SO much going on all at one time . a diva moment/total meltdown was totally deserved !

I always tell my bf things starting with " Well Lauryn &amp; Micheal " like we know you personally hah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty incredible party ! When we got married , my husband was super conscious of the fact that when I 'm working parties &amp; events I never eat , so he was really attentive in making sure that I ate both at the cocktail hour and at our dinner .

LONG ... <p> Haha I love how honest you were in this post , seriously every girl has this moment at some point , no worries ! And you totally SLAYED in that dress , lovin it ! Anyway , would love to know where you found your candle holders . They are so expensive everywhere , and I would love to have lots of candles at my wedding as well , but so not willing to break the bank on them . Thanks girl ! <p> Ha , I got drunk at my rehearsal dinner and made my husband sleep in the same room as me that night , too ! So fun , but definitely a bummer to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reception , I was feeling loads better . Looked beautiful , congrats ! <p> How did I miss this post ? ! ! ! After a week of hell at work and in general , I needed this laugh . I just cackled in the ugliest , loudest , most obnoxious form .

@@3098285 <h> our plunge pool x a ginger margarita ! <p> This included more Treadmill and wait for itmy LITTLE secret : MORE WALKING . <p> WALKING IS SO FUCKING UNDERRATED GUYS . <p> SO , SO underrated . <p> WALK . <p> Walk to the store , walk to the gym , walk to dinner , just walk . <p> I swear you will not believe how weight falls off when you walk . You can eat more when you move more . <p> Tomorrow make it a point to walk more . Just see how you feel . When I know I 'm going to be in a bikini , I turn on my pedometer iPhone app &amp; try to track 10k steps a day . The difference this makes is unreal . <p> Not everything ( including diet &amp; fitness ) has to be so hard . Walking is easy . Shit , I do n't  even care if you talk on your phone or work on email while you 're walking . Just walk . <p> Walking is such a lost art . This is a whole blog post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Anyway , on top of walking I upped- TSC Bombshell Body Guide workouts to 4 a week instead of 3 . I also added one day of Reformer Pilates ( I walk to class ! ! ) . <p> Diet-wise , I cut back . <p> Not a fan of crash diets , they wont work &amp; the second you get on vacation you gain it all back . Over juice cleanses right now &amp; not one for Atkins anything SO I sort of create my own diet. <p> This entails lots of free range eggs ( LOTS , I love eggs ) , no eating after 7:30 , water , water , water , light alcohol ( AKA vodka sparkling water with tons of lemon juice ) , no wine , light starchy carbs ( normally I 'll do one piece of toast in the morning &amp; then cut the starchy carbs for the rest of the day ) , lots of fish , veggies , fruit , AND ACCOUNTABILITY . <p> Accountability is funny . A lot of people will tell you " do n't  weigh yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can track exactly where you 're at so there 's NO grey . <p> I do n't  look for a specific number on the scale BUT I do track my accountability . For instance , if I weigh 293872347 lbs in December , I weigh myself &amp; make a goal to maybe drop 5 pounds by Cabo . It keeps me accountable , that 's it . The scale does n't  run my life , just shows me where I 'm at . <p> Another thing that helps if you really want to get bikini ready : My Fitness Pal . More accountability . I did n't  do the app for Cabo but if I was doing a big shoot in a bikini , I 'd sure as hell be using it . <p> I 'm pretty balanced when it comes to weight . I do n't  stress about it ( firm believer in if you stress , it creates more Cortisol ) . If I 'm having a glass of champagne , I 'll skip the crackers . If I 'm eating Cheez-Its ( &lt;&lt; obsessed ) , then I 'll skip dessert . And if I 'm having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I balance my diet like a checkbook . <p> So while I have worked hard to get bikini ready , I 'm also reasonable . You know ? <p> Love these . Never been to Cabo , but have always wanted to go ! Whenever I have an event coming up , I drink my acv cocktail/green smoothies religiously , drop dairy/starchy carbs/fun drinks , up the cardio ( time ) , and add hot yoga if I can the sweat really does something for me mentally &amp; physically . Have fun in Cabo ! ! ! Definitely adding the walking to my plan ! <p> I just love how real you are ! I totally agree that walking is over rated . Are you guys planning your wedding in Cabo ? Ive been planning mine in my home town , and decided today to fuck it and go to hawaii . I 'm super over the huge big wedding and thinking a destination is the way to go ! Have a ball ! ! ! ! xo <p> Love this . You are so right walking is SO underrated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months without a car , ate so much food but still lost weight from walking everywhere . I literally could n't keep the weight on haha . Its so easy to be sedentary in the U.S. and it makes me sad.Amanda recently posted .. Bloglovin <p> Balance balance balance ! Everyone has a different lifestyle , career , climate to work with and as long as you find what works for you never deprive again and enjoy lifes most precious moments to the fullest . <p> Mexico is my absolute favorite place in the world- loving all the snaps from you and Suze . ENVIOUS . I need a marg and guac and a little Mexican friend ASAPo . <p> You 're so right about walking making a huge difference . Sometimes its easy for me to forget to do , too ! I will definitely be stepping up my game to get ready for summer ! Enjoy your time in Cabo , it looks SO beautiful ! <p> Thank you for being so real ! Its freakin hard to get bikini ready and you have to make some scarifies and really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vacation is watch my salt intake . I do n't  add it to food and avoid things like soy sauce and processed food . Salt = bloat , no thanks . Have fun on your trip Diana recently posted .. Weekly Workouts <p> Literally my idol ! I learned a lot of good tricks from my mama growing up for example , if I have a burger , skip the bread or eat it with one slice instead of two . If at all possible , skip products made with bread/flour and go for more produce-based options ( sweet potatoes , squash , etc . ) Another tip GINGER TEA . My mom taught me to boil sliced ginger and lemon with a few mint leaves , and I swear you feel it cleansing you from the inside as you drink it . ( In the winter she boils cinnamon sticks and apples with ginger for different take ) . I swear by these low-maintenance teas for helping with keeping clear skin , good mojo on the toilet ( BUH BYE constipation ! ) , and just a feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cool how you mentioned walking my abuela walks EVERYWHERE , and even though she is almost 70 , she does not look a day over fifty . ) ) <p> Loving all these tips and I love that you mentioned you knew you were going so you set up a plan to feel your best , and it makes all the sense in the world . I like the idea of chipping it off the fitness block . I am actually lucky to live in a very walking friendly city but it seriously makes all the difference . Especially getting groceries ! I like to think of it as a bit of strength training since the grocery bags can get so heavy lol ! What app do you use ? I will DL it now ! <p> As cliche as it sounds , when I know I have a big thing to prepare for , I do what a lot of the VS Angels or models in the VS show do . I follow them religiously since they have it so figured out so I upped my egg whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kendall Jenner ! ) &amp; three of the above is my go to when I have no idea what the hell to make for dinner . I find keeping them on hand , constantly , makes it just a no brainer . My FAVOURITE way for sweet potatoes is with chili powder , chili flakes &amp; a squeeze of lemon juice the sweet , smokey , spicy combo is incredible and I crave this constantly ! ! <p> Ive been a reader for a while now and I 'm a big fan of yours . You are always trying to be real with your readers and its so refreshing . So now I have a real question for you . You seem to be say " follow along on snapchat " frequently and consisting on your blog posts and Instagram posts recently . Is there some kickback you are getting to have more friends or views on SC ? I noticed you encourage us to follow Michaels SC as well and I was very curious why you seem to be pushing it so hard . It would mean so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so flattered you like the blog ! I have absolutely no affiliation with Snapchat , I just really love the platform . It allows me to connect with you guys one on one &amp; its all about realness . Definitely my favorite right now ( no one is paying me or making me say that ! ) . XO <p> I totally agree about weighing yourself daily . Ive been doing this for years and it is n't an obsessive thing or anything , it just let 's me know what 's working for me and what is n't . Oops , I 've gained a pound or 2 , need to watch my portions more . Or awesome , I 've lost a few pounds , let me think about what 's been working . <p> And I loved when you said , " I chip away at fitness . " Such a great way to think about it . Its ongoing and every little thing you do makes an impact , one day at a time . <p> Whenever Im really trying to lose weight I get really into tea to help curb snacking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately , especially in the evenings when I 'm thinking about snacking on something not so healthy . <p> Walking is the best ! The saddest part to me with our SUV-bound culture , walking becomes " weird " and walking around draws attention from people who wonder what you 're up to , or slow down because they think you 're having car trouble odd looks/energy , or outright staring or comments . even when I 'm not wearing rouge stilettos and flourishing a smoke bomb = It just takes all the fun out of it . One of my favorite things in a big city with a lot of walkers , Chicago as my favorite example , is just being a person in the crowd , no one looks at you twice and you have the freedom and anonymity to stroll about enjoying the weather and all the sights without feeling under scrutiny . <p> So jealous that you are wedding planning in Cabo . I am stuck in cold NJ planning mine ( but daydreaming of my warm honeymoon location in June ) . We were actually looking at Cabo as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ocean there ? Is this true ? So we changed it .. lol . <p> I totally agree about its the little things that matter . If you try to do a crazy diet , I think it makes you sort of crazy .. haha . <p> Anyway , your blog is the one I look forward to reading the most everyday . Just love your personality and how real you are . <p> I follow a lot of the same ideas and also chug LOTS of water . It often helps keep me from grabbing something unhealthy . I really like your idea of setting a date in advance to startdefinitely helps with accountability ! <p> Hi Lauren ! So glad you 're having a great time in Cabo ! I grew up in North Dakota where people hardly ever walk , but I recently moved to Minneapolis for school and I 've had to walk everywhere since I did n't  bring a car . I can not believe how much better and stronger I feel ! Its such a stress reliever , and walking for miles a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip ! <p> I needed this . I 'm headed to Jamaica late March and I 'm just now getting into the eating healthy/workout groove ! I totally agree with the walking thing Short walks throughout the day really add up ! I typically do no carbs after breakfast ( other than fruits and veggies ) and try to drink a crap ton of water ! At night if I 'm craving sugar I 'll have a cup of good decaf coffee or a cup of tea with agave nectar and almond milk ! <p> BALANCE ! Yes ! I hate when I read get fit tips that involve cutting out EVERY good thing there is in life ( I could live off of wine and chocolate ! ) so this was super refreshing to see someone who knows that balance is truly the key to a healthy diet . One of my HO diet tricks is to down a large glass of cool water with a teaspoon of honey and cinnamon mixed in every morning before eating breakfast and right before eating dinner . This has helped me keep of weight especially during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as fills you up a little bit before eating so you do n't  over indulge . Definitely a nice and easy thing to try , PLUS it increases your daily water intake which is always good ! There 's more of my diet tips on the other side of this link &gt; http : **27;441;TOOLONG <p> Hi ! ! I have been a long time reader . I am in the planning process for my honeymoon ( ! ! ! ) and am wondering what resort this is ? ? You seem to have such positive experiences here and I would love to check it out !

For you guys to come together with so much support on the post about The Nanz .. was actually unbelievable . The outpour of support I received was unexpected &amp; in a strange way , some type of closure . I woke up the morning after writing that post in a kind of funk . To be expected , I guess ? After a cup of coffee , I checked TSC comments , emails , &amp; some Snapchat messages . <h> My jaw was just on the floor . <p> I actually could n't believe that so many of you took the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been- so grateful for all of your support . <p> Actually to be real , at this point she would be accepting autograph requests . HAHA ! Her " Im becoming famous " call would have happened at night after finally figuring out how to click " her Internet " ( yes , she really called it " her Internet " ) to access my blogwhich she accessed from my personal Facebook page because she never understood what a URL meant . " Her Google " was usually acting up , what can I say ? <p> Anyway , I am humbled &amp; grateful for such an amazing community of women . Your words inspired , moved , &amp; uplifted me . I actually do n't  even think I can explain how much each of your messages , comments , &amp; Snaps aided in the ongoing healing process . The love you guys had for my grandma &amp; your words are really- beautiful . In a weird way , reading all your messages gave me some sort of peace . I am so , SO glad I shared her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be alive . <p> SO THANK YOU . Thank you . THANK YOU . <p> OK , switching gears . I am so gnarly into my calendar strategy with Steve that we 've gone as far as to schedule " winding down " time . That 's right . He informed me that I needed an hour before bed to wind down in order to fall asleep . I 'm trying to work out in the AM instead of later in the day ( HARD ) &amp; get my sleep schedule on track . I 'm very excited to do a post on this whole calendar thing because its really changing my life . That sounds strange , but when you plan out your entire day , you feel in control . <h> No chaos , you know ? <p> Tomorrows post will kind of go along with this theme &amp; I 'll try to get the calendar post up ASAP . <p> Lastly , you should know Michael &amp; I interviewed our good friend , Danny Kurtzman on the podcast this week . Danny is a spitfire who 's dealt with muscular dystrophy his entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; positive humans I 've ever met . YOU GUYS WILL LOVE HIM . He came on the podcast &amp; just killed it . Danny helps run a charity called Life Rolls On . <h> ( literally ) the sweetest surprise <p> The day after we recorded the podcast , Michael &amp; I went to a Life Rolls On event &amp; it was INSANE. - Life Rolls On hosts- FREE epic surf &amp;- skate events for wheelchair athletes . They roll to 10 cities on both coasts , bringing hope and freedom to thousands . Its honestly such a cool cause . So no surprise , I 'm very , VERY thrilled for this episode . Always fun to introduce you guys to some of my childhood friends too . Ok ! Just wanted to give you a quick backstory on that ! <p> ALRIGHT , my hands need a break . Off to drink some of Michaels new sleepy , soothing- tea ( see Snapchathes absurd . Like , what the hell ) . <p> Michaels tea moment on Snapchat was actually hilarious . I was laying there in bed laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going on ? Then he proceeded to make himself a cup of tea in the morning . I 'm not even joking . So , thanks for that guys ! ; ) Love that throw on the couch , btw , and LOVED the podcast with Danny !

All these products contain harmful chemicals and there are so many safe alternatives that perform just as well . You inspire me with healthy food choices on Snap Chat but I urge you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stay " on brand " with your makeup . <p> I completely get where you 're coming from . I obviously try and use as many products as I can that do n't  contain potentially harmful chemicals but I 'm human and at the end of the day I love certain products that may have those chemicals so I choose to go natural in other ways such as food ! All about balance . xx <p> I spy so many favorites here .. which basically means I need to try the products I 'm not familiar with right ? Just recently started to use rosehip oil after one of my friends raved about it -http : //www.tellestickers.com <p> I have been desperately needing a new makeup routine and cant wait to try some of these out . I have SUPER sensitive skin . Like cant use anything with oil or my face will freak . Do you think any of these have oil ? <p> This is truly an amazing post !

@@3098292 <p> What we put in our bodies reflects in our hair skin and nails ( you know this if you 've read The Skinny Confidential Lifestyle Guide ! ) . Foods rich in zinc &amp; Vitamin B6 are SUPER important for maintaining a healthy hair &amp; scalp . DRINK so much water , hydration is key , especially with fighting things like dandruff . <h> No surprise here : stress can have a HUGE impact too so make sure to sweat it out , drink some tea , &amp; keep your cool . <p> Excessive shampooing , especially with harsher chemicals can irritate the scalp &amp; dry it out which causes more dandruff . When washing with an anti-dandruff shampoo make sure to leave it on for at least 5 mins the first few times so it really has time to work . <h> Oh ! &amp; brushing your hair right out of the shower will help distribute the oil that is naturally occurring in your scalp . <p> YES ! <p> 4 . ) Although it is tempting , do not pick at your scalp ! This causes soreness &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dandruff . <p> ( Eer , I always pick my scalp when Im nervous ! ) . <p> Instead , after washing , apply tea tree oil to your scalp to help with the oils . You can take a fine toothed comb to get some of the flakes out without irritating your scalp . A coconut oil hair mask is always fun too . Just add raw coconut oil to your hair after you shampoo &amp; condition , leave the oil in your hair overnight ( bun-style ) , &amp; wash it out with cold water the next morning ! <p> 5 . ) There IS a difference between dandruff &amp; dry scalp . <p> Dandruff is the shedding of dead skin cells or sometimes an infection &amp; typically diagnosed by a dermatologist or a doctor . It can be caused also by extreme heat or cold . Dry scalp is more a flaky texture that is caused by dehydration , over washing of hair and using poor quality products .

Just eat healthy , drink a lot of water , maintain a stress-free-ISH environment use the right products , &amp; do n't  over-wash ! <h> 24 comments Leave a Comment + <p> Dandruff is definitely not from dry scalp . Its actually due to too much oil . I 've always had dandruff and I 've found if I skip washing my hair too often and dry shampoo too much , my dandruff only gets worse . I have n't found support for this online , but it seems like dry shampoo only further clogs what 's going on around the hair follicle and makes my dandruff worse . I would think dryness and flaking on the scalp could be eczema related . <p> Generally speaking , I have my dandruff under control . I use Neutrogena T-Gel worth every penny ! I also alternate with Nizoral which Ive found is the best combination . I swear by them both and my family loves them too . I also try to really massage it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then like the directions say , I try to leave it on as long as I can so the medicated shampoo can do its magic . I 've generally found that if I just shampoo first , leave it in , and do my other business , that 's long enough . What 's a bummer is it takes a while if you want to do that and deep condition . The things we do to stay beautiful .. <p> BTW Lauren , the new website design looks great . I just wanted to give some feedback .. in typing this long comment , its kind of difficult to read all this text in the text box while its italic . I do n't  want to sound like a grandma but I zoomed in my browser and its still hurting my eyes . Idk how it looks on mobile . <p> Yes exact same with me . Whenever I go longer than 3 days without shampooing ( while using dry shampoo every day ) , that 's when I get bad dandruff problems and very itchy scalp . I tried for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've read so many great things about doing that , but as soon as I started going back to shampooing every 2/3 days and using Head &amp; Shoulders once ( I know , its not good for your hair ) , the problem has been reversed . <p> Ok so the first thing I want to say is that dandruff ( or dry scalp depending on what definition you or your stylist prefers ) can be several things and first attempts should treat the symptomsif that does n't  work then go to a dermatologist . <p> Ive used various products over the yearsmy mom used to tell me that I was n't using my conditioner correctly and that caused my dandruff . For most of high school I used Neutrogena T gel shampoo and conditioner every other wash . It did n't  always work , so I wrote my mom off as annoyingly wrong . <p> Oh silly me .. my current stylist had has clearly corrected me ( and confirmed my mother was mostly correct ) . We were prepping my hair for bleaching and pink dye and my stylist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you havent had this before ? ! " I told her I 'd had it in high school , what my mom said about conditioner , and that it had started back up while I was testing dry shampoos for the coloring . I told her I 'd been using the Lush solid shampoo for dandruff and the Natures Gate Tea Tree Oil shampoo ( I was trying the natural route ) and minimal conditioner and it was n't helping . <p> She told me this : that my " dandruff was being caused by buildup on my scalp , I have naturally oily skin , plus new products plus going several days between washes and getting sweaty PLUS not actually washing my scalp when I wash my hair led to buildup and clogging causing itchy flakey gross . But definitely not dry . <p> So now I still use the Tea Tree shampoo ( seriously smells so good ) every other time I wash ( so every 8 days-I go 4 between washes ) and I make sure I scrub my scalp , not with the nails , but like they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure I use conditiner only on the ends , I do n't  go up past my neck to have one less product on my scalp . <p> So maybe not everyones dandruff is this , but if you have oily skin , or sweat a lotdefinitely consider product buildup on your scalp first . <p> Hey ! Thanks for this post , I have the worst dandruff in winter sometimes ! Sorry I have n't been so active on your blog lately Ive been super busy . A friend and I created an app called Watcher , its a safety app for people who are afraid to walk home alone at night . Through some terrible experiences of my own ( http : **35;470;TOOLONG ) I 've learned you can never be too cautious and I 'm super excited to share this new project ! If you 've ever been scared walking home alone at night , I 'd love if you could help me in spreading the word about Watcher so we can build a community of people looking out for each other . <p> I just looooooooved the new version of TSC. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra worth it ! ! ! <p> I loved the video with Garyvee , loved the way you dominate the whole conversation , I learned a lot just from watching your body language . I love all your book tips that 's why I cant wait to read the #askgaryvee book , I 've already read the " crush it " book ( ( ( I sent you a snapchat photo of me reading it and you quickly answered it I loved the *attention* and loved to see how this engaging thing that Garyvee told us really work . I mean , if I could , I would reply everysnap , comment on every photo , but I do n't  wan na sound like creepy . I mean , I already nominated myself as creepy brazilian fan . hehe . ) ) ) As I was saying , I cant read to it but it will have to wait because I got a big line of books on my desk ( all of them are you&amp;michael tips ) . Btw , can you please stop recommending books ? I do n't  think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke obviously I love the fact that you 're giving book tips , this is SO important . <p> Well , I actually do n't  have anything to say about the dandruff post because I never had this kind of trouble in my life , but I enjoyed to read it anyway , I like the way you 're willing to talk about literally anything . I love that we can be so open about everything here . <p> I guess that 's ittt. keep going girrrrllll , do n't  you dare stopping now that we all got so addicted to everything you have to say ! ! ! ! <p> I have been pre-treating my scalp with organic unfiltered apple cider vinegar for over a year and it works miracles . Massage it into your scalp and let it sit for about 20 minutes before washing it out . It kills the itch and definitely helps to prevent flakes . It is well worth the extra time and leaves my hair feeling super clean without being stripped or overly dry <p> For any TSC readers who have tried just about everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea tree oil shampoos , tea tree oil and coconut masks , etc. ) for their dandruff like I have without results , try Jason Natural DANDRUFF RELIEF ! <p> It was pretty pricy at Whole Body ( $15 ! ) , but is the only thing that has consistently worked for my severe dandruff . I think it might be sold at stores like Walmart now for half the price . <p> I wash my hair every other day or so and have been using it for about 5 months flake free . I hope it helps someone else out there ! <p> That 's not the most unglamorous thing ever , but something that we have to deal with everyday : Stress . Its quite annoying that people say : stress is bad for your hair , your tummy , your bitten nails But , its part of your everyday life ( college , for some myself included ) , work . It could be interested to speak about the ways to reduce stress and anxiety , deal with it , share tips ( like essential oils , music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Thanks a lot ! <p> You could also talk of the big big issue of having big boobs and liking fashion . You 're not able to wear comfy sweat-shirts , high collars or simple shirts ? Some advices on flattering clothes for normal size breasts , and not child ones like we see on adverts ? <p> I absolutely LOVE your blog and have been a reader for years but never commented . here 's my question and what I think would be a great blog post . How can a girl get away with not washing her hair everyday if she is at the gym everyday ? I have a lot of hair that I have to have styled for work each day ( think blow dry , straighten then curl = lots of damage ) I have n't figured out a way to get away with not washing my hair everyday ( or even every other day ) when I work out because unfortunately , I sweat , and then it feels like it becomes a greasy/build up situation which I ca n't handle and then end up washing/creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? I would love to be able to not wash my hair more often to save time and prevent damage <p> For Me , Aloe Vera also plays a vital character in promoting healthy hair growth . Certain enzymes present in aloe Vera such as proteolitic enzymes take off dead skin cells from the scalp so that the hair cells do n't remain blocked . aloe Vera features properties like alkalizing which promote to cleanse pores and balance your pH levels . <p> Applying natural aloe Vera gel on scalp of hair is one of the best ways to prevent hair loss and promote hair growth .

That happened . <p> It was so weird . We were accessing normal American sites &amp; then BAM ! ! One day they just did n't  work . <p> So . I actually COULDNT work . It was a total first for me .

The Chinese freaking know their tea . Tea is a full blown HUGE deal &amp; I was loving it . TEA , TEA , TEA , &amp; MORE TEA . <p> The girl who helped us told us about Puerh tea . Her eyes lit up when she talked about this particular tea . <p> She told me all her girlfriends drank the tea twice a day , after meals to stay slim .

I would describe Puerh tea as chia seeds on steroids/crack . AKA do n't  drink the tea before a hot date night . And since I finally got a damn Internet connection , I was able to research . Here are the details : <p> According to this source , " Pu-erh tea ( also spelled Puer ) - is a kind of healthy beverage , which not only has a long history of Chinese tea , but can help us reduce fat and lose weight . The cooked tea can keep the stomach fit and warm it , while the fresh tea has a better effect on weight loss than the cooked tea , on account of its strong taste . <p> Pu-erh tea has been touted for many years as a great weight loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shed pounds , as well as having a deliciously mellow and deeply earthy flavor . Drinking Pu-erh tea at the correct times will help you she 'd unwanted pounds by helping your body to metabolize fat . If you drink Pu-erh at the wrong times , it is said that it will actually cause you to gain weight instead . The best time to drink a cup of Pu-erh tea for weight loss goals is one hour after a meal , so that the Pu-erh tea can remove excess grease and help your body eliminate unwanted and leftover , hard-to-digest fats . However if you drink Pu-erh half an hour or so before you eat a meal , it will cause the opposite effect and can cause you to gain weight instead because when you drink Pu-erh tea before a meal it clears up the fat deposits in your body and any residue in the stomach so that it actually increases your appetite , causing you to eat more . <p> Ideally , to lose the most weight using Pu-erh tea , you should drink Pu-erh tea without adding any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea .

I myself have tried quite a few now , many of them disappointing , especially the bagged versions . I 'm starting to think loose leaf is the way to go to get the most out of them . My favourite so far is from a brand called Nude Tea Australia ( **43;507;TOOLONG ) they only sell organic loose leaf and each one also comes with a bag of powdered herb concentrate so the tea is super gutsy after its brewed.David Bryant recently posted ..

Pu-erh tea seems me so cool for weight loss .. actually my cousin suffering from weight loss .. I will definitely share this post with her .. she will get to know so many things from this post I think .. Thanks @ Lauryn for sharing it .. <p> I come from Colombia , a country that drinks coffee without all pretentiousness you find it in another countries . Is a normal beverage with nothing fancy about it . Then I move to China for 4 years . I became a Cha fan . I ask , I research , went to many places and try different qualities , prices and types . ( Important to mention price , specially in China , where is a synonym of high quality in the urban areas ) . <p> Pu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking it . Also the water need to be a certain Tempeture , so you can avoid burning the leaves ! Need to be leave under water a couple of minutes , but not too much to avoid this intense earthy flavor . On a personal note , I do prefer the super intense earthy flavor that Pu er cha has , is kind of a espresso flavor . In Colombia is super normal to drink coffee without milk or another additionals , so for me strong flavors are a more natural thing . <p> Also my Chinese and Korean female friends told me , that I should only drink Pu er cha one hour after a meal ! Cause you drink it before it would give you more hunger and you will possible end eating way more than expected . I follow their advice , they are the skinny ones ! <p> Now I live in Austria , and you can get it in most super Chinese markets ! just ask for the PU ERH TEE ! <p> THANK YOU for the " no mixing " with pu-erh advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , steep the first pot for tens seconds then pour out , and refill . That takes care of caffeine overdose and impurities ! Hope anyone interested in holistic detox with pu-erh will find some value in this complete LONG ... <p> Puerh tea definitely is wonderful but be careful about the purported health benefits . A lot of what you see out there is just marketing without a lot of science to back it up . All tea is a healthy beverage choice and many people will find that they loose weight while drinking it , especially if they are swapping it for sugary drinks like soda .

@@3098303 <h> BOOB JOB REALNESS . <p> Ive been wanting to write this post for a while but its a big one &amp; a tad overwhelming , if you know what I mean ? <p> One of the top three things I get asked about is BOOBS . <p> Specifically BOOB JOBS . <p> GASP OMG WHAT . <p> I 'm totally not afraid to tackle the subject , its just a long post that requires me to get personal . <p> ( Also , my grandma reads my blog . UGH ) . <p> First off , I do n't  share every single thing on social media . I like to pick and choose what I share so I can maintain sanity &amp; some level of privacy . But I feel like this is one of those subjects that needs to have a little conversation . Especially since there are so many young people getting plastic surgery now-a-days . <p> Plus , its obvious that I have big boobs so its not like I 'm sharing life shattering information . Maybe this is against blogger code to talk about boobs but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion &amp; lipstick starts to become a real bore after a while ) &amp; its not like we have n't discussed butthole enemas , camel toes , vagina steaming , &amp; Kegels already sooooo . <p> Might as well talk about boobs . <p> Let 's take it back to when I was 18 , shall we ? <p> here 's the history : I 'm not stick skinny . I 'm not a 6 foot model . I have an ass . I have hips . AND I HAD ( AND HAVE ) BOOBS . <p> I started with a B cup . Not too bad right ? But ever since I can remember ( I 'm talking like 9th grade ) I 've wanted bigger boobs . It was weird . My friends from high school would tell you I just always wanted bigger boobs . Not boobs like Real Housewives Tamara circa 2010 . More like more- voluptuous , - voluminous boobs . I wanted my boobs in proportion to my hips . <p> So at 15-ish I decided I wanted a boob job . I did n't  tell anyone that I was saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; saved . <p> I worked as a hostess and later on in high school , at a local boutique . I put half of what I earned aside . <p> I babysat , I picked up tiny modeling gigs , I helped out at a local news station . <p> And I saved for like , four years . <p> So obviously the second I graduated high school , I met with a friends dad who was a plastic surgeon ( if you 're in San Diego &amp; want his info , e-mail me ) . After that I went around &amp; met with three other doctors . I liked my friends dad best ( &amp; honestly he gave me a great price ) so I emptied my bank account &amp; paid the doctor five thousand dollars on June 16th . <p> I did this all by myself without telling anyone , which is so me &amp; not the smartest ? But I was determined , stubborn , &amp; driven to do what I wanted to do . <p> A few days before surgery I told my parents . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was 18 and paying for it myself . My poor parents . <p> Totally not knowing what to expect ( &amp; not the healthiest human on the planet ) , I stocked up on Top Ramen ( ouch ) &amp; FLIPZ chocolate covered pretzels . I even invested in a brown Juicy Couture jumpsuit because it was comfortable &amp; very chic at the moment . I do n't  know why I 'm sharing all these details , I just feel like they really set the scene of where I was in life . <p> To make decisions on sizing , I researched for hours online . Again , I was a full B &amp; did n't  want to go huge . I was at first going to go with 250 CC ( which is really not that big ) but settled on 300 CCs . I really , really looked at a million pictures &amp; weighed my options with the doctor . Together we decided it was best for me to go through the nipple ( to get very detailed , he only cut a half moon ( so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) &amp; under the muscle , not over because I was very specific about NOT wanting Tori Spelling boobs ( no offense Tori ) . I also explained that I DID NOT WANT BOLT ONS . I chose saline over silicone because at that time silicone was being- recalled . Saline is water so if it pops in the body , the body absorbs it . At the time silicone was known as a very dangerous chemical . <p> What I wanted were boobs that I could play up , or play down , you know ? So people could never look at me immediately &amp; be like BOOB JOB FOR SURE. I wanted like did she or did n't  she boobs . <p> Anyway , the day before the surgery I picked up some prescribed antibiotics &amp; pain killers with the extra money leftover in my savings account . <p> And on June 30th , my dads birthday ( sorry dad ) , I had my ex-boyfriend of 5 years ( BF at the time though ) drive me to the surgeons early in the morning because hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( IMMATURE/NAIVE MUCH ? ) . He dropped me off &amp; that was that . IV in the arm , passed out , woke up&amp; I had boobs . <p> My ex picked me up , dropped me off at home , &amp; 2 hours later I was drugged up lying under an umbrella by the pool , head to toe in Juicy . CHIC . <p> When you get a boob job they wrap you in like this white sort of tape , so I was wrapped in that . And for the record , I did make Daddys birthdayeer , happy birthday ? <p> The night of the surgery , I was fine , went to bed . All good . <p> The next three days were tough . <p> It sort of felt like I had weight on my chest . And I could n't sleep . I am not a big pill popper . I do n't  like pills . Because 1. ) they make you constipated and 2 . ) I do n't  like how they make me feel . So I sort of weened off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get anesthesia I get depressed afterwards . Sometimes the body reacts funny to it and I remember being SO , SO depressed . It was so weird . I wanted the boobs OUT . Yes , I wanted them like to be taken out . Keep in mind this was also 4th of July . I just got out of high school , everyone was celebrating , &amp; I was in bed dealing with boobs . <p> Because I was depressed , I read . I read every book I could possibly get my hands on . I remember being up at 4 AM reading " EVERYTHING ABOUT ME IS FAKE &amp; IM PERFECT " by Janice Dickinson ( she is the bitchiest , most hilarious author ever ) . <p> Overall the experience was weird . I just remember feeling weird . I called my dad crying , begging him to help me pay for a surgery to remove the implants . He said no , &amp; I would basically have to figure it out . INDEPENDENCE LESSON . STICKING TO YOUR DECISION LESSON . OWNING YOUR CHOICES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Two weeks later I was fine . I calmed the F down . But my boobs were pretty big . Like I could rest a champagne glass on them . I actually ended up modeling for Maxim magazine &amp; they looked too big for my liking in the shoot ( but I guess totally acceptable for a Maxim college girl ) . <p> Fast forward to today , &amp; theyve settled . BIG time . No more bolt ons . <p> Heres what I think people should know about boob implants : <p> 1 . ) When you first get them they 're huge &amp; feel too big . You think " oh no I went too big . " <p> 2 . ) And thenthey settle . Meaning they sort of go down . And you 're like " oh no I went too small . " <p> 3 . ) In my opinion , going a little bigger than you think you want is good ( if you 're more conservative , like me ) because after they settle you kind wish they were a little bigger because you become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer a dropped boob more than a Housewife tit . Its sort of that natural shaped breast with a little more OOMPH . <p> 5 . ) After many years ( aka where I 'm at today ) , you wo n't even think about them . I think about my boobs only when Im asked about them . They sort of settle in with your body . I 'm very happy with the size boob I have now . In fact , they 're especially fun in a swimsuit &amp; make me feel womanly- ( again , my body , my opinion , everyone has different bodies/shapes/opinions &amp; not that I did n't  feel womanly before , but they sort of enhance that feeling for me ) . <p> 6 . ) People will talk . After I got my boobs done people would talk shit . They would say " omg she got her boobs done ! ! " Like it was some secret &amp; YES I KNOW I GOT MY BOOBS DONE , I ACTUALLY WENT UNDER THE KNIFE . For the record , it was also crystal clear because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scientist to come to the conclusion I got my boobs done , you know ? I did n't  do it for anyone except myself . <p> 7 . ) Research size , saline or silicone , your doctor , &amp; the full scope of the surgery before committing to anything . <p> 8 . ) NIPPLES . If your nipples are large , expect your nipples to look larger because they 're being stretched . I 'm a firm believer that part of the way they look after has not only to do with the surgeon , but the way your boobs looked before the surgery . Think of it as a balloon . When a balloon blows up , it stretches . <p> 9 . ) Looking back , I should have waited until I was 21. 18 was maybe a tad too young for me . <p> 10 . ) DO IT FOR YOU . In my opinion , you should do the surgery for you &amp; no one else but you . <p> Another question I get asked is : How do they feel ? They feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the computer HAHAHA . I mean , in all honestly if you really , really tried to feel the actual implant , you probably could . But I feel ( &lt;&lt; see what I did there ? ) like mine feel pretty real . I guess you 'll have to ask Michael that question . He felt my boobs pre boob job ( 8th grade #TBT ) AND post boob job so I feel like he s sort of a- connoisseur . <p> Oh &amp; before anyone hops to conclusions about how I 'm a hypocrite because of my healthy lifestyle &amp; blah , blah , blah . <p> WAIT . <p> CONSIDER THIS : The reason I love wellness so much today is because my journey has paved this path to health . I am a firm believer that my past experiences have shaped my life today . Each &amp; every experience has lead me to share the importance of wellness , health , &amp; balance . Without having stuff or adversity or challenges , life would be a real bore . <p> If I were to sit here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life &amp; never done anything wrong " , that would be pretty damn boring too . LIKE YAWN , YAWN , YAWN . <p> I 'm here to say : I 've been down &amp; Ive gotten up . Ive been unhealthy &amp; I became healthy . I 've gotten a boob job &amp; here 's what I learned . <p> This is n't an excuse , its the truth . <p> Also , getting boobies taught me a few lessons ; this sounds weird but wanting something for so long &amp; putting my own money together to get it , taught me the following : 1. ) how to make my own money for something I really wanted , 2. ) the drive to get what I wanted when I wanted it on my own terms , &amp; 3. ) patience because well , shit . I had to save for 4 years . <p> Ok so would I get a boob job today ? <p> I do n't  know . Probably , yes . I think I would . But I 'd certainly do more research , eat healthier after surgery , &amp; talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Oh &amp; honestly , after I have a baby I 'll probably have to get new implants . <p> Everyone says you have to get new ones after ten years , but I 've talked to a lot of plastic surgeons who say otherwise . I think everyone is different &amp; you should do what works for you . Personally , I 'm not going to get to that ten year mark &amp; be like " OMG ITS BEEN 10 YEARS , I NEED NEW IMPLANTS . " Because well , if its not broken do n't  fix it . <p> Trying to be as transparent as possible here because I 've gotten A LOT of questions &amp; want to make sure Im being real . <p> If you want a boob job , do not base your journey off mine . You do you . AGAIN , everyone is different . <p> Ive been waiting for this post ! ! ! Not because I want a boob job , but because they just intrigue me soooo much . I 'm a member of the itty bitty titty committee in a major way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universe of tiny boobs ) and for years I struggled with " do I want to change them ? ? ? " At 23 Ive finally gotten to a place where Im happy with my lil boobies . If a genie appeared and offered me a bigger cup size fo free ? Ok yeah I 'd probably take him up on that onebut I 'm glad the feeling of needing to change passed . I think your story is so important , since you did it FOR YOU and saved for everything yourself . You 're so different from other girls who go under the knife and make it the hugest deal in the world . You go after what you want and you own it , and I admire you so much for that . Rock dem titties girl , you 're absolutely stunning inside and out ! xoxo CarlyCarly recently posted .. Saving My Skin <p> Yes . Esp if you get them " below the muscle " meaning under the pectoral minor and above the pec major . That 's the more natural look which gives surperior poll fullness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural breast tissue , even below your superior pec muscle .

I have n't been ballsy enough to talk about my boob job on my blog ! I had mine 6 years ago when I was 23 . My recovery was horrible because I did n't  listen to the instructions of setting an alarm to wake myself every 3 hours to take my pain killer medicine . I woke up the night after my surgery and almost went into shock !

I waiver between accepting my small boobs ( legit , like AAs ) , and wanting bigger ones to fit my curves . I 've wanted a boob job since I was basically 13 .

But I cant help it I 've always wanted boobs ! <p> I feel like I couldve written this post . This is all me to a T ! I had a similar experience and feel the same way . Sometimes I question having this foreign object in me because I 'm so health-conscience these days . I worry a little about being able to breastfeed later b/c my incision is in the same place . <p> Loved reading this post and loved the honesty !

Its not for others to judge ! <p> I really appreciate this post ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boobs . Just havent done it yet . <p> I am only 50 ? tall and luckily my momma gifted me with a curvy lower body ( I 'm talking booty ) . However , they must have been overly generous with the lower half of my body and forgot about the top half . I barely can pull off a B cup ( my mom on the other hand , DD ) Seriously . Like whaaaaaa ? So not fair . I 'm not saying I want DDs but a nice C cup would be cool . I 've always gone back and forth because everyone in my family are anti boob jobs . I think this kind of puts a damper on my feelings of wanting new and improved boobies . My boobs are what I like to call teardrops You know what I 'm talking about , right ? No upper boob to save my life ! <p> I felt like you supplied all of us blog readers with a lot of information . I took a lot from this post because I am also very sensitive to medications and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards to the surgery . <p> Probably a naive question , but does having the boob job make going braless more comfortable ? As I 'm aging , I notice how low things are hanging if you catch me , and my dream was to actually get a reduction after I have babes , preferably so I do n't  feel the need to wear bras even at home alone . <p> I guess I imagine the job gives you perpetually perkiness , is that the case ? <p> Big boobs are big boobs , fake or real . I went from a B to a DD . From never really needing to wear a bra to def needing to wear a bra . Perky , yes and the shape and lift I want , yes . So even though they are perky , they 're still boobs , big boobs . But there is a difference between a bad boob job looking like beach balls on your chest and a more natural , shapely , full tear drop , fairly discreet , good boob job . <p> Its all subjective to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still boobs with weight . It does n't  really matter what size you go to , up or down some people with Bs like to wear bras , some do n't  . Same with Ds . Theyll be more shapely and perky , but they 're still boobs . <p> I have been a huge fan of your blog for a few years but honestly this made me like you even more . To be like , this is me , here it all is , no one is perfect.is just really inspiring . Everything you talk about is full of passion and care and I really appreciate it . Thanks so much ! <p> Thanks for sharing , I 'm glad you posted this . I had a similar experience myself . I got the surgery 14 years ago ( ! ! ! ) when I was 18 right after I graduated high school . I wanted boobs since I was 11 , so it was no surprise I would get the surgery . I was completely flat chested and wanted to feel womanly and curvy and not like a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anderson and big breasted VS models . I do n't  think you are meant to make big life decisions at such a young age . I was on a mission and no one would stop me ! I did n't  even factor in possibly what I 'd do if I wanted kids/breast feed . I loved them especially in the beginning , I like being noticed and they were much bigger looking and high . By the time I turned 30 , I have been seriously thinking of getting them taken out . I am only a C or small D and they look so natural , no one knows . Not even guys I dated ! Sometimes I made the choice not to say anything , sometimes I felt ashamed for being so materialistic or just felt like they were part of me after a certain number of years . I am glad I did n't  go bigger , and most of the time I try to down play them . I just do n't  want to be noticed in that way . And now I think about being pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to breast feed . My life took a healthy more natural path a few years after the surgery , so I feel strange having these fake things in my body ( also saline through the nip . ) I am scared of taking them out and just being freaked out how they will look ( deflated and saggy But I also do n't  want to keep changing them out for the rest of my life . Will I have fake breasts at 70 ? ? Some things to think about . Sometimes I just wish I had never messed with my body that way . <p> ZJ Do n't  worry too much how they will look if you do decide to take them out . I actually had one deflate ( after 15 years ) and it did n't  look bad at all . So much so that I considered having the other one taken out rather than having them replaced . I also started out pretty flat-chested , so that could have something to do with it . Anyway , I did end up going with replacements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel good about that . <p> You 're lucky your boobs look so real ! My mom has those housewife huge DD tits that stick up like a 15 year olds boobs in a push up bra . Bigger is definitely not always better when it comes to plastic surgery . I love how open &amp; honest you are , by the way . This post definitely opened my eyes . <p> Thanks for sharing ! I am considering a boob job cuz like you I have wide hips size medium . Unlike you i 'm xsmall on top and double AA . I might not get breast augmentation but I love being able to read about it openly . Its shame when girls feel embarrassed to admit they have work done . Anywho , I live in San Diego/del mar so I would the info on your surgeon . With love barbs <p> Lauryn : these posts are my absolute favourite of yours . As a reader , I totally appreciate you getting so raw and personal . I think this post is extremely helpful for anyone considering getting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Funny , how you can totally set the time period with the simple description of " juciy velour sweat suits " ! It is weird all the strange connotations to getting work done , and I think you hit the nail on the head with point #6 . Thank you for not making it all so Taboo , because there really is no reason for it to be since it is such a personal choice . And I 'm just going to say it but YOURS LOOK AMAZE . ? ? <p> If I ever save enough money to buy some boobs , I totally will because if someone saw me shirtless without seeing my face , theyd probably think I was a 12 year old boy ? I 've learned to accept the fact that I do n't  have tits and never will , but part of me still REALLY wishes I had them . Bathing suit shopping sucks honestly . <p> Thank you so much for this post ! When I was younger , I wavered so many times about whether I wanted one . My boobs are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've finally come to a point in my life where I 'm okay with the size . Do I wish they were bigger ? Sometimes , yeah . But I do n't  know if I 'd want to spend the money on it and sometimes I 'm so wishy washy , I would n't want to have gotten it done and then a month later think , " Fuck , why did I do this ! ? " I found it interesting that you thought that yourself , since most stories Ive heard about boob jobs , there 's never been any statements of regret . <p> Thanks so much for sharing and being so real about it . It really is amazing to read your blog . I kid you not , you are the REALEST blogger I read , the kind that I think , " Well damn , this is a girl I could be drinking mojitos with " . It really does mean a lot to a blog reader and a starting blogger to see realness in the industry . Thank you ! coffeeslag recently posted .. What 's In My Bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old for your blog , but I ca n't stop reading it ! I love the way you write and love your frankness . I just have to comment , because the only boob job Ive ever considered was a REDUCTION . The grass is always greener , right ? I keep thinking how nice it would be to wear a blouse that did n't  gape open in the chest area , or to not have deep bra strap indentations on my shoulders , or to go braless just once , or . Plus , as you get older , they get bigger ( I 'm sure , due to gravity ) . I 've gone from a 34C to a 32D/DDD , and Im HWP . So .. just like you said , whatever you do , do it for yourself , and do n't  go too big . Trust me . <p> I do n't  have plastic surgery and do n't  really have any intentions of getting it , but I just had to comment because I love the way you write so truthfully about your life . This was super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Lady Goes West recently posted .. Friday Favorites : A bar giveaway and more <p> I have always wondered if it is possible to nurse a baby with implants . Can you do it or must they be removed ? I am nursing my girl still and I always said to myself that I would wait to get implants until after having children but I never did enough research to know if you can have implants and still nurse . Now that I am done having babies , I am less interested in getting breasts because I think- let 's spend the money on a wild vacation with just me and the hubby instead ! hah . <p> This procedure is something that has been on my mind on &amp; off for years . I wear a C currently but as mentioned in the comments above , no upper boob and just want something fuller and sitting higher . I flip flop between being satisfied with what I have and having an idea of what I want . My only hesitation really comes down to the fear that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any tips , guidelines , or questions to ask of your surgeon to make sure things look &amp; feel as natural as possible ? <p> Thank you so much for sharing ! I 've always wondered about this . Its so nice to hear a candid , full story from someone . Also MAJOR props to you for paying for them yourself and sticking to your choice . xx , Pia <p> Good for you for posting this ! I am the complete opposite and seriously , seriously considered getting my boobs reduced my junior/senior year in college . I was about 30-40 pounds heavier and my boobs were big and floppy and I was just unhappy overall with the way they looked . And the way I looked honestly , and I thought getting my boobs done smaller would fix them . 30ish pounds later , they definitely have gone down , but once I have kids I will definitely get them reduced and lifted.Cheri @ Overactive Blogger recently posted .. 9/11/2001 <p> Love this ! I got my boob job @ 18 fresh out of high school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once I graduated , I told my mom and she said I needed to talk to at least 3 doctors before committing . Found my doctor and Tah-Dah ! Lol , I have 315 CCs and they have definitely settled and I majorly wish I went biggerLike at least 400 CCs . <p> Awesome Post ! ! ! Love it , and had awesome info for girlys looking to enhance ! <p> Thanks for sharing your story ! I have been back and forth about getting a boob job for the last few years . I 'm now 27 and still want one , and I 'm starting to seriously consider going to different doctors for consultations . <p> What are your thoughts on saline vs silicone today ? Do you think surgery techniques have changed since you got them ? <p> I had my boobs done almost 4 years ago ( from a 34 large B to a DD Im 510 " with hips &amp; a butt , so they look proportional ) and love them ! I 'm actually looking into going bigger in the next few months I also went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since its considered safe whereas the old silicone ones werent . In terms of recovery , I did a lift since my boobs got saggy through gaining/losing weight . That recovery is definitely more difficult since they cut much more into the breast to do the lift . I was pretty out of it on painkillers for 3 days , and worked from home for the 5 after that before I ventured out into the world again , but I never got depressed about it . Having my husband taking care of me really helped , as did eating a good number of fruits/veggies and staying away from sugar for the most part . One thing I 'd recommend with a lift is to make sure the cuts on the breasts dry completely . I forgot about it , and since the skin was so wet the wounds did n't  heal very well or quickly , so I ended up with more scarring than necessary . The way to avoid this is to use a hair dryer on a low setting I completely forgot about that tip as I was healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lauryn ! When I was considering mine , I was 29 , and I only knew one person who had gotten breast implants for fun ( vs. after having their breasts removed after cancer . ) I felt very alone and like I would be judged a lot , and it took a lot of heart-to-hearts with my husband to help me work through my concerns . Working through my concerns was good , but seeing the topic written about and discussed and experienced , by people who are not porn stars would have eliminated some of the concerns , and I 'm sure will help others . For the record many people tell me my boobs feel/look natural , but it does depend on whether you go above/below the muscle , how big they are , etc . And I agree that going bigger than you originally think is a good idea hence I want to go bigger soon , I feel like its easier to play them down than up , and they 're just fun ! <p> As another " taboo " topic , I was thinking you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemas ! <p> My boobs are so big I could stand to go down a couple cup sizes . " Normal " ( aka bras you can buy in the store ) bras do n't  fit properly and theyve caused back pain over the last few years . I think boobs/boob size is such a personal thing and size especially is a different preference for everyone . Ive come to love and accept my roundness so thanks for sharing your experience so openly ! Meagan recently posted .. Too Young for Back Troubles <p> I support anyones choice for augmentation but I think wide hips/big butt and a flat chest can be a good/eye-catching look and allow a woman to pull off some interesting fashion ! ( Think Iggy Azalea before breast implants ) " If everyone looked the same we 'd all get tired of looking at each other " My boobs have gotten bigger as I 've gotten older and my weight is redistributing . Its weird because I weigh the same and I do n't  notice other body parts getting skinnier , maybe I 'm losing muscle ? ? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when were tempted to leap onto expensive trend-wagons . No one should be ashamed of having fake boobs ! ! ! I feel bad for people with botched surgery too trying to be attractive and beautiful to society is not a crime and people should n't be mocked for it <p> Beautiful post . Ive been looking forward to reading it since you mentioned it in passing whenever long ago . I think your breasts look very natural and if I ever get breast augmentation surgery , I 'd want mine to look similar so I may email you for that surgeon info . = Once I 'm done saving up . = <p> Last thought , I cant believe anyone would judge you for being about health and wellness and having breast implants I do n't  see how these things are mutually exclusive . Being a judgmental asshole who tells other people how to live , versus health and wellness I think those things are more mutually exclusive . Wellness means a healthy , non-judgmental mind to me <p> This was one of my favorite posts ! Could you elaborate more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way NOT to end up with bigger ones ? Is there a way to get smaller ones after implants ? Also , this may sound dumb but is there a difference between breast implants and a breast lift ? Thank you for being so honest ! ! That is why this is one of my fav blogs ! &lt;3 <p> I got my boob job when I was 18 and now that I 'm 25 and more comfortable in my skin I regret it . I wish I had waited to make an important decision like that . I went from an AA to a small B so no one can tell I have had anything done .. which I really like like . From the beginning even at 18 I knew I did n't  want to be . C or anything bigger . And I still feel that way . I have thought about taking them out one dayjust worried I 'll have stretched skin with no fat tissue to actually look like breasts . <p> But even with my regret it does make swim suit shopping a lot easier ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I also have better posture . ( I would always subconsciously curve my spine to hide what I lacked ) . <p> Anwayyyyyys thanks for sharing girl ! I love when you talk about so called " taboo " subjects . Reading this post made me feel like we were girlfriends chatting over some wine in your living room about our stories = <p> I got implants and hated them the day after I got them . I never felt like me.Eight years later I had them removed and had a lift and my nipples reduced in size . I love having my own breast tissue and they look and feel right for me . Everyone is different . Do lots of research and do it for you and no one else . <p> I love this post ! Thanks for sharing . I 'd love to know whether or not having implants helps your boobs stay in place ? Like do they still fall naturally or do they stay pretty perky on their own ? I 'm a C and i 'd like to go bigger and also have my boobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always kinda just chillin a little lower than where I think they should be and when I 'm laying down they like to disappear to under my armpits ! Does that happen to anyone else ? ! I 'm like where did my boobs go ? I hate it ! So does getting implants help them stay put ? And then I 'd also like to know whether they do fill out up top of your boobs are a little more tear dropped ? Thanks for sharing Lauryn xoxoAmanda Waltman recently posted .. A Bushel and a Beck <p> The procedure to have your boobs stay more up on your chest is called a lift . I got one almost 4 years ago , and it definitely keeps them from disappearing under your armpits when lying down ! They have to make an incision all the way around &amp; below your nipple though so it will be much more scarring than just implants . I felt like it was worth it , but its definitely something to consider . <p> You can get implants without a lift , but if your boobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up higher , and your natural tissue lower , especially if you get the implants behind the muscle . <p> My experience was a lot like your except I was older and it was a year after having a child . It was actually 10 years ago &amp; they still look fine . I used to wear padded bras , so when I had the surgery most people had no idea I had work done . I also started off as a 34A and now I 'm only 36B/34C . I have saline too . You 're right , your body determines how they turn out . I had one boob higher than the other &amp; that 's still the case now . Post surgery was not that bad , but that 's considering I 'd had a c-section the year before &amp; even endured 2 surgeries from a major car accident 10 years prior . Its a personal choice . You do need to do it for you and no one else . Actually my hubby was against it , but he loves them now . <p> Unrelated to Boob Jobs although I totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can you do a post on how you built your following ? I would love to gather some tips and tricks &lt;3 Thank you ! <p> I love your honesty . It takes a lot of guts to talk openly about something like this because you know so many people will disagree . Way to go ! My dream is to be a C cup hahaaha . Maybe one day thanks to this post ! <p> This was an amazing post Lauryn ! There is nothing unhealthy about cosmetic enhancements or any other medical procedures/treatments in todays day and age . I think your boobs look amazing and definitely agree with the 18 year old lessons we all learn from making big decisions at such a young age . I have my fair share of those to say the least ( and do not regret a since one ! ) . Love your blog , as always . xoxo <p> Thanks so much for sharing your story ! I think your boobs look awesome and natural . A boob job in no way makes you a hypocrite on health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . I also lold hard at this line : " I even invested in a brown Juicy Couture jumpsuit because it was comfortable &amp; very chic at the moment . I do n't know why I 'm sharing all these details , I just feel like they really set the scene of where I was in life . " <p> I love and admire your realness . People are too afraid of saying half the stuff that we actually want and need help with . This is a great post and your attitude is refreshingly honest . SO thank you . Plus you look amazing so fair play . <p> This is an incredible post as usual Lauryn ! I wanted to offer a few thoughts since I have implants too . I went from a COMPLETELY flat chest to a 32C I also went under the muscle , but with silicone implants ( cant remember the cc unfortunately ) . My father is a plastic surgeon and encouraged me to wait until I was over 21 to do it , so I did the same sort of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my own to do it . I met with three different surgeons before deciding on a friend of my dads ( SO important to shop around and find someone who makes you VERY comfortable ! ) . However , the surgery was BRUTAL for me . It was the most painful thing Ive ever gone through . I could n't move for 6 weeks , developed a muscle spasm in my neck and shoulders that I 'm still coping with , and for months after it was still difficult for me to do anything with my upper body . I could n't drive or even open doors for 2 months . I had to have my mom stay home with me through the whole recovery because I could n't lift anything . All that said , I would do it again in a heartbeat . I LOVE mine ! They look beautiful , feel super comfortable now , and make me so much more confident . I 'm not sure if I struggled because I had no boobs to start out with , but it is definitely a possibility to have a hard surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller-chested ) friends to prepare to possibly have to put your life on hold in a big way in case its a harder recovery . But I am pro-boob jobs 100% ! <p> Part of me really wants a boob job and the other part of me knows I 'll never do it .. I just ca n't get over the surgery ( biggest fear of LIFE , ) the recovery , and the fact that there is something foreign in my body at all times . But people like you do it RIGHT and make it SOOOO hard to NOT do it : -P . Anther great post ! Thanks for sharing . P.s. - I think we all want to see what Lauryn looks like in Maxim = And gosh , I mean that in a TOTALLY non-creepy way ! Hahahatara creel recently posted .. How to Make Fitness Easy ! <p> I had mine done only 8 months ago , silicone , through the armpits and over the muscle . They look fing AMAZING and noone can tell just by looking at them . The only weird thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor to know if everythings ok . <p> Thanks for sharing this post Lauryn , I 've been looking forward to reading it since you mentioned it a while ago ! I was dying for a boob job since I was a teenager but never did it . I still think about it now but I was always worried that I 'd be able to feel them inside , or that they would look like bolt ons ! Its good to hear that you did n't  experience this ! Christine recently posted .. Goat 's Cheese Salad with Walnut , Beetroot and Apple <p> Great article . Big boobs are not everything they are cracked up to be ! I 'm a natural born very full chested DDD cup . I would love to be a full C cup . The upper back pain that comes with large breasts and sagging is no joke . Along with the bra straps that dig into my shoulders . I cant even wear cute sleeveless tanks or nice button down shirts without looking like crap . There really are a pain . <p> Thanks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any complications . As a Licensed Esthetician for 15 years ( in San Diego ) I see bad plastic surgery often . If you do another related post can you please talk about finding a Double Board Certified Plastic Surgeon ? ? ? ? <p> I got mine done at 21 and I am so so so glad I did ! ! ! I saved and paid them off myself and seriously it was the best decision ever ! I am so much more confident with my clothes and I feel like I just look more feminine . I got married in August of 2012 and got my boobs done in January 2014 . It just made me feel so much better , I tell everyone if they 're thinking about it to just do it ! I as well did saline just felt like it was the safer option and I did under the muscle , with incision under the boob- if you do this MAKE sure your putting scar cream on it ! I did 300ccs as well and was a full A before . Now I 'm roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone a little bigger but I feel like maybe after kids maybe theyll get a little bigger or if not , HEY ! Ill just get them re do in my 30s <p> Loved this post ! It was incredibly honest and raw so thank you ! I had mine done but under the muscle and also did them quite young . Best decision I made for myself but I pulled a lot of similar things that you did of not telling anyone/parentals until I had to . The one thing about going under the muscle is that you cant lift your arms up past your hips for 3 weeks and even then its not cute or easy . Also what people do n't  tell you is to NOT look at them till the doc pulls of the bandages and says its ok . Thanks again for sharing your experience ! <p> Thanks for sharing ! I follow you on Instagram and love your post ! I am also interested in getting mine done and yours look great and is exactly what I want ! I would love it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours ! <p> Love this ! I made the decision to get my augmentation a year ago for my 30th birthday after my once naturally perky c-cups ( often mistaken for a boob job , even by a mamogram tech ) deflated a bit after weight fluctuations in my 20s . I was a full B , but lacked the fullness at the top of the breast that I used to have . Together with my doctor , I decided to go with 325cc silicone to achieve my former full C look with as natural as possible feel . Like you mentioned , I freaked out and thought I went too big shortly after surgery , but once they settled , they were perfect . <p> I did n't  have any nipple stretch , I was concerned about that , but my doc assured me not to worry maybe it was him or maybe it was the fact that we were replacing boobs that were there before ? Maybe both . <p> The only thing I 'd add is that girls considering should realize that you 're going for a visual cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I actually wear a 32 DDD because augmented breasts are fuller at the top , unlike natural boobs . <p> Loved reading this and your take on your boob job . I love to how you stress , its YOUR journey and for your readers to do themselves . I had a boob job almost 10 years ago after having 2 kids . I chose to do a lift ( national geographic anyone ? ) with silicone implants under the muscle . They look great and super natural , but I think I went too big . Now as a Mom , I 'm a little self conscious when my boys have their friends over to swim in the pool . I 'm probably going to get them re-done in the next 2 years and go down a full cup size . Just something to consider Tiffany recently posted .. Lake Powell Houseboat Vacation Recap <p> Love this post and appreciate your honesty . I got my boobs done when a couple years ago at the age of 28almost everyone had something to say like why do n't  you wait till after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really even matter ? The answer is yes . I 've always been physically active and a runner so I had quite a bit of pec muscles but my boobs looked like they were deflated ! I tried gaing weight and birth control to make them a bit fuller but to no avail . I knew that I wanted a boob job . At the time I was 32B but without a bra I looked like I 'd been breastfeeding for 10yrsand no I do n't  have any kids ! Anyways I 'm 5ft tall and petite and had the same trouble figuring out a size . My plastic surgeon ( San Diego ) was amazing ! We settled on silicone at 300ccs . Best decision I ever made . I felt so much more feminine instead of having manly pecs I had perky full boobs ! I still run so it has n't  changed my life style and most of the time people cant tell . I 've had A LOT of women/friends give me shit for it and argue against it but whatevs to each their own . I 'm happy and confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . So to anyone out there that 's thinking about it my only advice is to make sure you do you ! <p> So I had a boob job when I was 20 and had to pay for it myself too . However , fast forward 5 years and I 've been going through what 's called capsular contracture where your boob basically moves upward due to the increasing of scar tissue on top of the implant . So now my 10-20 year investment has turned into a 5 year sunk cost , and if were being honest here , I absolutely hate how my boobs look . I went from being a 32A to a 32D or 30DD depending on the store . AND I AM PISSED . He used 275CCs on each side and went under the muscle . I never wanted to be this big , I wanted to be a small but full C. First of all , my doctor does n't  even practice anymore , huge red flag . Secondly , when my mom had hers redone from this same guy , he made her a size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny and tight in my chest my boobs look like bolt ons . Theyve never really settled ! I 'm so frustrated , especially now that next year , I 'm going to have to go under the knife , have my contracture taken care of , have new implants put in , recover from that , and then deal with all the horrible side effects of going under the knife ( hair loss , depression , etc ) . I cant wear bikinis anymore because my left boob looks like its fresh from surgery while my right one is slowly joining it . Had my 20 year old self had more confidence and self awareness she would have waited until after she had children . I 'm thoroughly concerned with not being able to breastfeed when I decide to have children since the incision was at the nipple . Oh and that 's nice that your doctor made such a small incision , the doctor I used basically cut the entire underhalf of my nipple . This wasnt like a groupon doctor either , he was at the time , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another doctor and we 've discussed doing a tear drop shape implant and using silicone , even though saline if it were to burst is safer for your body to absorb , for my tightness in my chest this would be the best route . And were going to go in from underneath the boob . It was funny when I was telling this new doctor all about my issues he almost looked in horror when he saw my breasts since the previous doctor obviously did such a bad job . ugh . over it . Hoping the next set are better than these ! Thanks for sharing this info , I definitely think you need to include a section on " what happens when boob surgeries go wrong " you can use me as a case study . I have the most botched boobs . Oh and you can see the rippling of the implant when I flex my pectoral muscles . <p> I have had my boobs done twice . The first time I did exactly what you said I went small &amp; conservative . Then when they settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back when having huge faker looking boobs was the thing , though . So then I had them re-done , and went a little bigger . It was a mistake . Now I 'm older , and I have children . And the " style " is to have smaller , natural looking boobs . Plus the style of clothes has changed , and they have been making all the tops that loose fit . When you have large boobs &amp; try to wear loose fitting tops , you look like a tent . Not cool . So I have actually regretted going bigger , big time . And now , I wish my boobs were smaller . <p> My advice to women who want to get their boobs done keep in mind that the middle road is always the safest . Then you can make them look bigger with a push up bra . But if you end up going too big &amp; then regret it later , you 're screwed . <p> Love this post ! I had mine done when I was 19 ( I 'm 26 now and agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Up until this year , I always loved my implants and too always felt my double AA just did n't  make me " feel " like a woman . ( But to reiterate your point , those were my personal feelings , so I am in no way saying that boobs or lack there of makes anyone more or less of a woman ( plus I was like 19 , remember ? ) ) . But this year , it was my newish boyfriend ( been about a year now ) who made me question them when he started talking smack about plastic surgery ( and to my utter disbelief , I realized he had no idea my boobs were fake despite " plenty " of exposure to thembig shout out to my doctorhey oh ! ) I consulted friends ( after he did it enough times to make me feel really insecure ) and they all reassured me that he obviously only knew the " superficial , hollywood " stereotype of plastic surgery , and needed to be reminded that , aside from the fact that he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so quick to judge people anyway ! Plastic surgery is a personal journey , and , so as long as you 're doing it for yourself and not anyone else ( and not over doing it ) , you should be confident of your decision . Thanks for this wonderful post ! <p> Thank you thank you for sharing this ! ! I read this post last month when I was considering getting my boobs done and now that I just booked my surgery for January , I went back and re-read this post . So many people I find out ( later on ) have gotten their boobs done , but are almost afraid to admit it . I love your honesty and I was so relieved to hear you have saline because that 's what I decided on too . Thank you again for inspiring others and for reassuring me with this post ! xoxo <p> I was curious if you 've had any complications or symptoms since having your boob job ? Some women say that they get really sick and eventually have to get them taken out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surgery done ? <p> Lauryn ! I 'm 17 and Ive just finally decided after many years of trying not to think about my itty bitty titties , that once I turn 18 , I 'm going to get a boob job . I 'm just wondering what paper work I 'll need ( I 'm probs not gon na tell my parents ) and how much is enough money to have in the bank when the time comes ? <p> I just wanted to send a message to all the women on here and all women considering breast implants . <p> This blog is great but this does need to be shared . <p> I grew up with a twin sister however we are non-identical . My sister had DD boobs with an athletic figure while I had A small A cup . I was always envious and considered having breast surgery as I have a very athletic body . I studied a bachelor science degree in marine sciences and zoology and after that studied a remedial massage therapy course . I am very passionate about health and about researching all theories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you I researched for a long time on forums to read real peoples stories as much as researching the published medical data . I want you to all be aware of doing this while removing yourself from your ego desires . When you can read and analyse you will start to weigh up whether getting a breast implant is worth it or not . <p> There is a lot of evidence now coming forward Showing the long term health risks of both saline and silicon implants . Women with strong immunity may not see the effects of this type of surgery for a very long time while others will see it very soon. ! Being a massage therapist I rely on my hands and arms and there are a lot of case studies now showing women with breast implants unable to raise their hands , hold their babies or pick up a pen as they have arthritic bones from the toxic build up of these foreign objects in the breast . Autoimmune diseases are now becoming highly prevalent in women with boob jobs and there is double the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many women get toxic repercussions from these implants especially with silicone leaching into the body with evidence of hair Strand analysis showing silicone toxicity in the blood and organs . In addition saline Breasts garb their issues with bacteria and fungi found living inside the saline implant and leeching out into the chest cavity causing immune diseases and candida overgrowth . <p> Please research for yoruselves . I have good friends who are doing well with their implants while others are in and out of hospital with unknown autoimmune diseases . as much as this is not the case for every implant , we do not know the very long term implications of breast implants And I fear this billion dollar indistry is killing our women and poisoning our babies through breast feeding . Please always question and research , try to be critical with all accounts and then make an educated decision for yourself . I am glad I did n't  get implants as I could not handle the worry after all the research and evidence I found that it would affect my health and I wanted to also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know I have no problem meeting good beautiful men who have loved my curved booty , big smile and small boobs . They tell me they love my confidence and I believe this is huge in your life . Be confident with or without implants . <p> Thanks for sharing this ! I am from the other camp where I am athletic and small waisted but have a full DDD cup . I used to hate them but over time have come to appreciate them even though they make me look chunkier than I am . I have been considering having them removed and implants put in ( in part due to potential health concerns ) and appreciated your insights ! <p> I had a BA and lift after children . I went from a B to a DD and I hate them . I feel so big , so fat and like everyone notices them . I wanted to be the woman that no one really knew . My plastic surgeon said he would make me a full C , which was perfect . Now when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go that big , which is 325cc and 370cc in the other . They look amazing , which is the sad part because after a year , I still can not accept my body . I 'm so shy about attention and now I spend my days hiding them or trying , which makes me look like a fat slob because nothing fits . <p> Which leads me to the question of , how do you make clothes work with breast ? Every cut or shape that looked good before is not nice now . I just do n't  know how to dress without being all here are my boobs . <p> Next month will be a year and I have been trying so hard to accept them but ultimately find myself depressed and in hiding . <p> Thanks for sharing ! I just had mine done and am laying awake at 4:30am the 2nd night thinking " what have I done ? ! " because they hurt so bad ! ! ! First day was n't so bad and now BOY am I feeling it . This definitely helped calm my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " oh no I went too big " and " maybe I should just have them taken out ! " . Looking forward to seeing the end result though thanks again ! ! <p> Hello LAURYN , Thank you for writing you own thought and words . Each and every woman deserves to be and feel feminine all the time , and for many women the shape and size of their breasts can make them feel that they lost their femininity . Having breasts that are not in perfect harmony to their figure can also alter self-esteem . Thanks again keep sharing <p> I 'm 33 mother of 3 and I just got mine done around month and half ago . I was a small C but after having kids , my boobs were little saggy . Its really hard to lay flat on my back . As time goes onwill the implants feel more normal ? I 'm not use to them yet and I feel like I may have went too big but I 'm hoping things will settle down . Do they feel soft like a normal breast in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like balloons when you touch them . Last question.Mine are also under the muscle , will my upper area stay high or will the go down ? <p> Hi Lauryn , Great write up I think you really covered everything here that there is to cover and im sure these girls will appreciate it- especially if they have a million questions like I did pre op .. I recently had my tatas done and I could n't be happier . Unlike you , I waited till I was 21 , 25 ok fine 27 to get them done .. It was n't a delayed decision because I was unsure about it in terms of whether I wanted/needed them or not ( I definitely needed them- hello bee stings ! ) , but i was waiting for my own to grow ( they never did ) and also prioritising my funds it was important for me to get the travelling out of the system before I splurged on this long term investment . I really appreciated reading that you did the op for YOU and no one else . I think a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation to uphold and think body image is everything . Ladies there 's soooo much more to this thing we call life so if this is something you are doing make sure you do it for the right reasons- that right reason being YOU ! Well done Lauryn , so wise at 18 ! <p> I wanted to touch on one thing if any one is wondering at all . When I had my initial consultation and in the process of choosing my surgeon , it was really important for me to know that my surgeon understood my concerns of breast cancer . My darling mother was unfortunately diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015 so having my boobs done was something very close to my heart ( literally ) and hers . As women we are all taught to monitor our breasts , massage them regularly and feel for lumps , so I was worried that with implants I would n't be able to feel for this . I decided to go with a surgeon who specialised in Breast Oncology so he understood my concerns completely and of course , was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given he constructs them from scratch most of the time ) . The good news is ladies , implants or not , doctors are able to monitor your breast exactly the same , so do n't  be afraid to have them squished down in the boob machine they wont burst ! . <p> For those of you considering a breast augmentation , really consider your choices when it comes to surgeons , reputation of the clinic and do n't  just go with old mate mr chow in Thailand because he offers the best price and you get to stay in a nice bungalow to recover . Go with a reputable clinic and doctor , read about their qualifications and stay in a nice private hospital ITS TOALLY WORTH THE EXTRA COIN ! <p> A breast lift restores a firmer , perkier , and more aesthetically pleasing shape to sagging breasts . This not only can improve a patient 's appearance by restoring her youthful , feminine proportions , but also help bras and swimsuits fit more comfortably and attractively . <p> My mom got best inplants yearrs ago , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble in that department , but I 'm all for a boob job if you want one . In fact , I decided a long time ago that when I got older , and my boobs ever got too saggy I would DEF be all for it ! Back to my mom , after 10 years her bear implants both popped , and she had to get them removed , and redone ! She does n't  even know when it happened . <p> Increase in breast size is possible by means of implants . It is essentially a day care procedure and you can go home the same day . Breast augmentation is suitable for women who perceive their breasts as being too small , either because they have never had full development of breast tissue , or as a result of the loss of breast tissue that sometimes occurs after pregnancy and breast-feeding . <p> I feel like I could 've written this post . This is all me to a T ! I had a similar experience and feel the same way . Sometimes I question having this foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I worry a little about being able to breastfeed later b/c my incision is in the same place . <p> I had undergone my breast augmentation procedure from a clinic in Barrie . My breasts were saggy after delivery of two daughters and breastfeeding . I tried a lot of exercises to tighten up my boobs , but none of them worked . A friend of mine has also done breast augmentation procedure ( LONG ... ) . She insisted me to do the procedure after I discussed my problem with her . I had it done after my daughter stopped breastfeeding . I am happy with the result . There were no side effects , and I needed to take rest for only a week . <p> Even though I 'm finding this article a year later it is relieving beyond measure to be able to finally relate to a boob job article . I havent had a boob job , though you could ask my family how many times I asked for silicone bra inserts for Christmas ( 14 and naive poor family ) . I finally bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Vegas , or nights out in Hollywood .. Though I 've began to maintain and love my 28 r old , 510 height , Barely B boob , slender figure . But even as I found a new love in not having big boobs and rarely a bra , I still want them . Ive been thinking about them more as I feel the same way as you , not big , but volume and playful , able to be up or down , just like I do now . <p> I am commenting to thank you for being honest , relatable as always , and glad I found an someone who was happy with 250/300 cc . Its a permanent decision hence the waiting . But now I 'm also financially stable enough to handle the 5k cost ( at least quicker than 4 years ) = <p> I was 21 when I moved to California . My first week in this vanity prone state led me to meet an older woman that was 43 . She was and is still so beautiful . I have often told her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculpted by a God with magic ways because of her divine body . One issue arose as soon as we became lovers , She was so self-conscience of her breasts and how they looked . We agreed on an an augmentation asap , The boost of spirit and confidence in her , increased my lust immeasurably.She not only started to climax fully , more frequently and in succession , but had ejaculations as well .. I would not hesitate to recommend and contribute to anything that was such an esteem booster . Wisely she requested the largest filling possible , If you there , get em as big as you can , WE DID I am a lucky man , <p> I 'm like you , I 've wanted a boob job for years . I was thinking about it well beyond what would probably be considered normal or healthy . Had I been single and able to save my money and only focus on me , I probably would already gone under the knife . I realize Im weighing in late but I 'm curious if you researched or had any issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this might be partly obvious but the other thing is because and I do n't  mind informing people of new subjects , is for the longest time I suffered ( I say suffer because I was/am self conscious about ) from flat nipples . I breast fed my son which helped draw them out a little . After doing research , trying a product or two out , and waiting for something new to come along , as its still not talked about enough despite more women experiencing this than what you might believe when first hearing about it ( just like bacterial vaginosis but that 's a completely different topic ) I finally found a product that actually worked not just temporary but long term . I still use them and because I am bad about routine I could not say whether repeated use would permanently fix all issues , I can say that even when I go days without using them I feel much better about the erection of my nipples now . There is a point to this , I promise . With more erectness , came more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had it in my mind that erect nipples are sexy , not simply because that 's what I 've been taught and believe that 's the only way it should be but I truly find them sexy on other women myself . I should be able to comment on that , sometimes I think I may be more attracted to women than men lol . Anyhow , I would prefer , as I expect within the end of next year to have a breast augmentation that the surgeon go through the nipple , but with my newish founded erection has come new sensitivity and I do n't  want to lose that ! Did you have any noticeable change in your nipples sensatvity.m ? Obviously something I will discuss with doc but was curious on your personal experience as I loved your post on this . Sorry if someone already asked . <p> Very nice post , Thanks for the Tips . I had been planning about breast augmentation since realizing I was n't going to grow any as a teenager . Its nice to read blog posts like this . Its very informative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not to have a breast augmentation surgery . <p> Hi , I 'm seriously considering getting a boob job ( been wanting one for years ) My main concern is how long it actually takes to recover . When will I be able to be up and about doing regular life , and then when will I be able to workout ? <p> Hi I 'm new to your blog and love love love it . I was actually doing research for breast augmentation and your blog popped up . I 'm pretty nervous doing it since I 'll have enough funds by the end of the year . My concern is how can you decide on sizes etc ? I 'm pretty oddly shaped myself I have to have a larger strap bra size but my breasts are a 38b and I can hardly fit the bras that are made since have a wide chest . Will the doctor give you an idea what size would fit ? I 'm nervous but I really really want this . Especially having two boys and breast fed both of them . So you can definitely say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear from everyone soon . <p> So I really want mine done too but I 'm worried whether I 'll lose feeling in them when I get them done because I have tiny boobs however I do n't  want to go crazy with the size I just want maybe a cup and half size bigger but that 's literally my main concern is wheter my nipples and my boobs will lose feeling . <p> I have just recovered from breast cancer and considering having a breast reconstruction surgery in the coming months . A doctor I consulted before was furious and was not able to answer to my entire question . I have just got answers to all of my remaining questions .

You owe it to yourself and all of the young women you 're reaching to know ( and spread ) the real story . <p> I love this post , too real . Hits home to me , the moment I came home after my boob job I wanted them out they felt TOO big , ( I went from an A to 300 CC ) . fast forward three years post baby . I should have waited until after a baby because STRETCHHHHH . From an A to a DDD ( breast milk ) . Love to get the surgeons deets . My surgeon told me pre surgery he would give me great cleavageand after surgery he told me he was n't able to because of the structure of my chest . Its important for others to know that your boobs will still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 36 B and was always fine with my breasts but my husband who is my high school sweet heart has become very comfortable telling me he wants me to get implants because that 's what he likes and we argue about it constantly . Should I consider getting breast implants ? <p> There is nothing wrong with getting a boob job , just make sure that you are getting it for you . If you are fine with your boobs that is all that matters . How would he respond if you asked him to have a penis enlargement surgery ? Would he do it ? I think you should only get implants if you want to , but it sounds like you do n't  since you are fine with them . The size of your breasts should not be a factor when it comes to love . He should love you no matter what size your boobs are . Maybe you and your husband stay together forever , but maybe you do n't  . Now you have some Big Ol Tits that you never really wanted in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've just gone through my boob journey . And I have to say , recovery really is n't as bad as you 'd think . I am clockwork with my meds . I am not playing with that . But , things I 'd like to voice along with your blog .. THE DEPRESSION . I do n't  hate them , not at all . My depression is n't even thoughts of them . I 've just been sooo depressed the last few days . So what I say about that- talk to people . Let them know . Do n't  suffer quietly . The support around you is shocking . <p> The other thing . SIZE . omg I am depressed about my sizing choice . I knew to go bigger than what I thought I 'd want . So I liked like 350/375 so I went with 400 . And I was so nervous previously that that would be so large . Nope . I really wish I had actually gone larger still . 25/50cc really is n't a lot . This last one is just a side thought- even after you 've saved enough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keep that special savings account for if/when you need or what to redo . <p> Excellent blog post doll ! I did my boob job recently ( I am 27 ) I found it quite hard finding a bra after my breast augmentation that fits my slender curvy petite physique with very large breast cup size F to G ! I had a look at all of these brands doing DD+ bras such as curvy kate , freya , panache but the fit was not quite right for my proportions .

Proud of you <p> Exercise are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to your body . There are lot of natural ways through which women can easily control their sagging breast problem but the more effective process for them is breast augmentation which make them shape their breast according to their choice . <p> Thank you so much for talking about this . I found a really negative site the other night about fake breasts and it had me feeling pretty bad about myself and about the reasons I wanted to get implants until I read your post . It made me realize some things , and I am just really appreciative that you are so open and honest and shared all of that ! Thank you ! <p> My landlords wife had implants when she was young . Now she has four breasts , the two fake ones , and her natural ones down below here they naturally fall after menopause . I felt embarrassed to see that . She and her husband are very affectionate with each other . I suspect , or maybe they mentioned they have a healthy sex life . I wondered which of her breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two below . <p> Thank you for writing this ! I 'm 18 and planning on getting a boob job before college . Ive been doing research to decide on the sizing I want , and it is rare to find an article that actually had something positive to say about ladies my age receiving breast implants . Honestly , I was almost swayed away from surgery . I am a confident , healthy person , and I want implants entirely for my own happiness and femininity , and you reminded me that it is entirely OK ! I 'm sure many other girls feel the same . We do n't  need people raining on our parade just because we are young and want breasts . You 're awesome Lauryn ! <p> Hi , I came across this during my most recent obsession with checking out before and after pictures for breast augmentations . I 'm 40 , a mother of 2 , and have always been embarrassed of my breasts . Left is much smaller than right , and the shape just is n't great . I 've considered getting implants for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  know why I have hesitated all these times , mostly I think fear of the unknown , having to take time off work ( I 'm a fitness instructor ) , and wanting to stay true to my " healthy lifestyle " and being a good role model for my 12 year old daughter . Thank you for addressing the topic . I appreciate the info <p> Lauryn , such a great post . Ive come back to it again and again as I think through my own breast implant decision . You got them young , far off from childbearing . I 'm much closer to that phase of my life ( must happen in the next 1 3 years ) so its hard for me to decide when to do the procedure . <p> So appreciate how much you share with us . Your style of expressing your experiences is fantastic and inspiring . <p> Thanks for posting this . I have been thinking about getting a boob job for some time , but I have had some surgery fears . Also worrying about what other people think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It is nothing to be ashamed of and this post made me feel better about my decision to get one . I feel like I would feel more womanly if my boobs were a bit more voluptuous . Thanks for posting .. <p> Hi , Thanks for doing the blog ! So you talked about how they feel if someone touches them , but I want to know how they feel actually inside your body ? ! Does it feel likes there is something in there , or once you get used to the weight can you not feel them at all ? ! I hope to get some help from this question I 'm pretty close to getting a breast augmentation , but my mum it giving a lot of weird questions which I 'm trying to answer so she will be supportive ! And she wants to now how it will feel once they are inside . Thanks so much Steph <p> Hi ! I am currently looking for a surgeon in California . Would love to check out yours , if you could get me in contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank you &lt;3 My email is crosaquinn@gmail.com <p> I think anyone interested in getting implants should google the health issues related to them . Saline implants have a silicone shell and doctors do n't  tell you that . They also do n't  tell you about the autoimmune issues they can cause . Its a hush hush world in the land of plastic surgery because implants are their money maker . Google Dr. Lu-Jean Feng and Dr. Chun and Dr. Barnett as they are all specialists removing implants every damn day in order to restore the health in women . Go to FB and search Breast Implant Illness.that will be an eye opener for you ! Also , ten years is the time frame for replacement.are you really going to do that ? You even questioned yourself if you would do it all over againbecause deep down inside , I do n't  think you would . <p> Hi ! I had a boob job a few months ago at 19 , I went from not even a 32A to a 32C which was kinda crazy seeing that I 'm very petite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted a boob job at 15 so started saving , however my parents had to chip in a little bit . I was as confident as ever after the surgery , but now I 'm worried that I look too fake . Maybe people are just getting to me now after hearing all the talk about me getting a boob job , even though I deny it . Should I even do that ? I overthink about them during sex now ( sorry if that 's tmi ) worrying that they probably feel weird/fake since Im tiny , like I had no fat on me so all they can probably feel is the implant Any advice on how I could boost my confidence , not stress about this as much , or just advice in general would help !

@@3098304 <p> So I decided to make- a list of ways I like to spend time alone ( weird , but sometimes a visual works for me ) : <p> 1 . ) Go outside : this- includes taking a walk , listening to a podcast ( latest favorite : Serial ) , walking the dogs , going for a run , &amp;/or working out outside .

Most of my energy goes into my business &amp; my **36;696;TOOLONG . Some of it goes into working out , hobbies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning , etc . And usually ? There 's really nothing left after that . <p> Which means I have no energy , &amp; I MEAN NO ENERGY , to give to toxicity . Toxic friendships or work relationships are out . I do n't  even question it anymore- if it does n't  feel right , its out . Nothing against anyone , its just that I simply do n't  have energy- for negativity . <p> So yes , this year I 've learned to cut the fat &amp; cut it for good . <p> I have no interest in wasting energy on relationships that are unhealthy . Anyone else ? <h> SHOW THE BTS , THE GOOD , THE BAD , &amp; THE UGLY : <p> Instead of only creating content this year , I feel like with the power of Snapchat I 've been able to provide a raw view of the behind the scenes .

@@3098314 <h> Talking with the Creator of the Best Juice . Ever . <p> Updated : August 19 , 2016 <p> by <p> LAURYN <p> Meet Annie . She is the gorgeous , fit co-owner of Suja , an amazing company that produces the most fresh , delicious veggie/fruit juice available . Quite frankly , I 'm leaving Michael because I.am.in.love.with.Suja . <p> Since discovering the product , I 've been chugging them on the reg . Oh ! And for all of your who are annoyed with the juice cleanse because you do n't  have the time or patience like me to actually buy the ingredients &amp; then juice them at homefab news : Suja does a pre-made , 3-day juice cleanse that is INSANE ! In fact , its so amaze , that I 'll be completing it after the holidays . Whos with me ? ! Check out Sujas three day cleanse here : ) . <p> Ok , so let me introduce you to the goddess of organic juice , Annie Lawless <p> <p> + Give us all the deets on Suja. - <p> AL : The word Suja means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Suja juices facilitate a lifestyle that encompass that meaning . Our raw , organic , local , and cold-pressed juices are available + la carte , as a cleanse , or as a monthly home delivery package . They are extremely nutritious and promote looking , feeling , and performing your best ! <p> + Let 's talk cold-pressingwhy is it better than using regular juicers ? <p> AL : - Cold-pressing is a two-step process that grinds the produce and presses it with a hydraulic press . This is done at a very low temperature , preventing nutrient loss through heat &amp; oxidation . This method also yields more juice from the produce we use . <p> + Are n't  you supposed to drink juice immediately after its made ? <p> AL : - Yes , you are . Nutrient loss begins as soon as the juice is exposed to oxygen and light . That 's why we immediately bring our juice to a very cold temperature and employ a method called HPP , or high pressure pascalization . This method applies large amounts of pressure to the bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles while killing any pathogenic activity that may be inside . This effectively pasteurizes the product while keeping it raw and preserving all of the vital nutrition . It also extends the shelf life , so you can buy Suja juice &amp; consume it up to three weeks after press while receiving the same amount of nutrition as if it were just juiced . <p> + Do I have to drink only juice on a cleanse ? <p> AL : - Definitely not ! We recommend consuming enough nutrition to support your lifestyle and make your cleanse sustainable . The purpose of a cleanse is to give your body a break , eliminate toxins , and re-set bad habits you may have fallen into . You can do all of this while still consuming food . When you do a Suja cleanse , we offer recommendations like raw fruits/vegetables , avocado , &amp; a steamed sweet potato that will sustain you while still helping you reach your goals . <p> + Benefits to including juice in your daily life when you 're not cleansing ? <p> AL : - Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juices can help support a number of processes in the body while providing a concentrated source of many nutrients . This manifests in more energy , increased concentration , better moods , &amp; less inflammation , to name a few things . Juices are extremely hydrating to the hair , skin , &amp; nails leaving you feeling lighter and brighter with every sip ! <p> + How did Suja start ? <p> AL : - Suja started from a shared lifelong passion for health , wellness , and nutrition . Eric &amp; I met in San Diego last year at a yoga studio over a conversation about our love for the cold-press . We had both been interested in the correlation between nutrition and health since childhood . I dealt with a skin disorder eczema for years and saw it clear up when I altered my diet and lifestyle . Eric had a background as a natural and raw foods chef . We quickly realized we needed to collaborate and share this passion with others . Before we knew it , people were going crazy for our delicious blends ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heck can we find it ? ! <p> AL : - All of our juices are made locally , in San Diego using southern CA. grown produce . Suja is currently sold in Whole Foods Markets &amp; Jimbos stores throughout southern CA , as well as online for home delivery . <p> + Tips for detoxing quickly after an indulgent weekend ? <p> AL : - We all have them , so my first tip is to avoid toxic thinking and being hard on yourself . Appreciate the good time you had being less vigilant about your regimen , and focus on making the next decision a healthy one . I like to wake up and get a good gym session or beach run in ! This gets my blood pumping and makes me feel alert . Then , I like to hop in an infrared sauna and sweat out the gunk . Throughout the next couple days , I focus on hydrating , hydrating , hydrating ! I consume ample amounts of green juices &amp; green veggies . I try to stay away from heavier foods like animal proteins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salads , avocados , coconut , &amp; sprouted nuts/seeds . Before I know it , I am back in my groove &amp; feeling fantastic . <p> + Go-to healthy eats ? <p> AL : - My favorite meal of all time is kale salad with a whole avocado , cherry tomatoes , red onion , &amp; dulse . I consume this at least five times a week ! I also love wild salmon for its healthy fats &amp; satiating protein , dark chocolate for its antioxidants + its pleasure factor , &amp; yerba mate tea for its kick ! Oh&amp; did I mention Suja juices ? ! I like to have two-three per day first thing in the morning &amp; between meals to curb my hunger and keep me hydrated . <p> I just got a juicer for my birthday and am enjoying a concoction right now ! These juices do look amazing though and the bottles are so beautifully packaged ! I will definitely be trying some SUJA ! Looks like a great option when I do n't  have time to whip out my juicer . Thanks for sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Question 1 I have read up on your site and would like to know with the Juice , is it in fact true that a certain food intake is required in order to achieve weight loss ? My intentions are to begin Suja juices for a month in hopes to reduce my current weight but yet re-energize my energy levels and gain benefits . <p> Hello ! I 'm graduating next year with a food science degree . Companies like these are my dream job after graduating . If Suja needs a food scientist , I 'd love to chat with them if at all possible for an internship ! <p> Hi Lauryn ! Great article I actually just bought the 6 juices for the one day cleanse from Whole Foods , but there are no instructions on when to drink them . I 've tried googling it , and nothing really comes up . Do I drink 1-6 throughout the day for three days every couple of hours ? Sorry for the confusion but I just want the best results possible thanks ! <p> Hello ! I have been eye-ing this cleanse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coupon code earlier !

@@3098316 <p> She has presented a way for bloggers to monetize in a way that works well for the consumer , brand , &amp; blogger . So basically a win/win/win business plan . <p> I have been watching her growth because what can I say ? I 'm kind of obsessed with any woman entrepreneur who 's paved the way &amp; created something that 's fresh , new , &amp; avant-garde . AKA rewardStyle. rewardStyle works like this : " after registering with rewardStyle , bloggers receive a commission when a reader purchases an item they post ; similarly , companies that sign up with rewardStyle see higher traffic and online sales " ( source ) . <p> AV : Baxter ( &lt;&lt; Ambers husband ) and I founded the company together &amp; when I founded my blog it was really just something for my jewelry company. - I always found myself needing to style the jewelry to show people how to wear it . I wanted to sell my jewelry but I also was doing personal shopping on the site so I wanted to document that while- having a portfolio . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy was still pretty rough , so my thought was " okay well for the customers that can no longer afford for me to do the personal shopping , I 'll do this so whenever the economy comes back I 'll still be on top of mine and still be very relevant so Ill document this . <p> So everyday when I started my blog , I had a business plan for it . I took my jewelry company very seriously. - I had an eCommerce website &amp; everything was very professional . When I started my blog I thought that everything had to match that level of professionalism , to supplement each other , so I did three posts a day . I had an outfit post , a sale finder , etc . <p> Then I realized that all the clients that had still been able to afford me were just going to my blog , because I was really documenting everything that was crossing my mind involving styling &amp;- clothing- so they would text and say " oh yeah I got that dress , that was so cool how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items I was showcasing . <p> I thought " oh my gosh I 'm spending so much time , I 'm hiring photographers , working all day doing this blog , I 'm cutting myself out of my own business . Because now they 're just going to my blog and not booking me . Baxter helped me start the blog , so we started looking into ways to make money from the blog more than just a supplement to sell the jewelry . <p> Were affiliate programs for blogger happening- at this time ? <p> AV : Affiliates have been around for over a decade . Most of us do n't  even realize were doing it . So like Shazzam for example , you 're in a restaurant , you hear a song , Shazzam takes you right to iTunesthats an affiliate link . iTunes is paying for that . <p> That kind of tracking had existed but no one had the style space , so the concept really got to Baxter one day . He was wondering ideally how you make money on sites/blogs. - Because it was personal shopping but I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start tracking it . <p> So he started looking into the technology that could track that , so I had started working with about twelve stores over the course ( &lt;&lt; by the way , now rewardStyle has thousands of stores they work with ! Impressive ! ) . <p> - How did you guys start this when you were so young ? Its crazy inspiring ! <p> AV : I was 23 I think Baxter &amp; I were a perfect match for this . I do n't  get technology , I 'm constantly thinking my computer is breaking . So when we designed rewardStyle I thought , this is what I want to push &amp; this is what I want to see . <p> And so I wanted to make it affiliates for dummies so we do n't  call things their official names , we only call them things that make sense ( to me ) when you read it . So I had that side of the puzzle and he had the side of it that was engineering- &amp; tech products . <p> He used to build products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl who was like , " I need this or I want it to do this " and he just made it happen ! <p> Who- was the first top blogger who approached you ? <p> AV : I had recently gone to a conference in NYC &amp; I met Karen Blanchard . I did n't  know any bloggers &amp; at the time I did n't  consider myself a blogger . <p> I mean , the platform Blogger had totally existed &amp; people were- blogging long before me . So Karen wanted a picture of my coat . She then Tweeted- a picture of my coat &amp; we became friends through that . <p> rewardStyle- at that time was so basic , like nothing on the scene . So i emailed her &amp; said- " hey there is this thing that I 'm starting and I wanted to see if you like it if you want to try it . " Then she told another friend &amp;- another &amp; so on . So it was basically this little web our first ten users were superstar bloggers . <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend started laughing because she was a full time blogger and we pulled her into our social media . She was one of the first employees in our marketing team , now she 's back to full time blogging . We were just talking about how when we first started &amp; I was handling all client relations and was n't really thinking about it becoming biggerBaxter was the one thinking about it becoming more . <p> He pushes it that way . <p> Ok , so I think youre- the next NastyGal phenom. - What makes you turn a blogger away ? <p> AV : So we give our retailers dedication from a paid account service &amp; they 're actively combing through your site on a daily basis . They record how many blog post you do , they track everything , &amp; make frequent suggestions . So for us to turn someone away , we have to make sure its worth someones time combing through their site . So in order for this to work it needs to be taken very seriously . <p> We take our publishers very seriously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously . <p> - How many bloggers are on rewardStyle ? <p> AV : I think its about sixty countries &amp; we started with just bloggers now were working with celebrities &amp; Instagramers . Different people use it different ways , so all together there is about 13,000 across the countries . The US is the top country . <p> How do you eat healthy when you 're running this empire ? <p> AV : Youre going to hate my answers , my family all has this body type . I am very blessed in that way . I love my queso and cheese . At first I wore sweats everyday to the office&amp; then when you start hiring people you want them to dress up everyday so I started to get dressed everyday . I also started to make it a point to take care of my body . <p> When I am home in Dallas I have two set meals . I eat a lot of protein that 's like my turn . Ill order a salad with chicken- &amp; Ill- try to stay away from carbs . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Remember when I wrote about vagina steaming ? <p> For those of you who need an update a V-STEAM is a relaxing , detoxifying , spa treatment for your- nether regions . Fun fact : it can also increase your libido. - <p> We gave away coupons to VSPOT- &amp; they use a festive formulation of herbs like basil , calendula , mugwort , marshmallow root , wormwood , &amp; rose petals and place them in the tube on the v-steamer which contains purified water . The herb infused steam dilates the blood vessels to increase blood circulation by providing oxygen to the area , and in turn , relaxes the pelvic floor muscles . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in COOLA SPF 30 to keep it on brand , organic Brazilian Bronze Soho Tan coupons ( I did a custom anti-aging tan while I was in NYC &amp; LOVED IT ) , Kind Snacks , &amp; more !

@@3098320 <h> Mini DeLites : ASPEN&amp; A Weed Massage <h> YUM YUM , YES PLZ <p> We decided to take a quick trip to one of our favorite cities to SKI . The weather is ideal right now &amp; its also incredibly romantic . Of course Michael went crazy last November &amp; bought too much snow gear so at last its being put to good use ? <p> If you follow along on Snapchat you know we 've been skiing , eating , exploring the snow&amp; EATING . <p> Since Michael is a way better skier ( do n't  worry he reminds me every 10 seconds if I forget ) I decided to have a spa day yesterday &amp; kind of shut off of social media while he hit the black diamonds . <p> No problem there because there 's really nothing better than a spa day . <p> Now here 's the thing about spa days : they come with different experiences . <p> Ok , ok I 'm good with that because I LIKE A ROUGH , DEEP , INTENSE MASSAGE . <p> None of that fufu shit . <p> So he starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kind of whimper &amp; cringe whenever he rubs the cranial area of my neck . <h> our hotel : The Little Nell <h> Aspen , showing off <p> I asked him , " what 's wrong ? Everything ok ? " <p> He then informs me that he is a synesthete . The type of healer who can feel the pain on his own body when someone else has pain . He told me accidentally discovered this ability while in massage school . He was assigned to sit with each of his classmates practicing intuitive massage &amp; when he sat with the first student , he suddenly had a horrible pain in his throat . Turns out she has horrible acid reflux . The next student , his knee began to throb . Well the man was in need of two knee replacements . Lastly he worked with a woman who had horrific back pain . Immediately his back started killing him . <p> So he discovered he had this ability &amp; went full force into the career of massage . <p> The masseuse- told me this ability ONLY happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who has cancer wont resonate with him . He does n't  feel the cancer because he can not cure cancer . <p> Interesting stuff . <p> He then told me he did n't  blame me if I did n't  believe him , he would n't believe himself either . <p> I will say though : he REALLY HIT the spots on my neck that bug me from a lateral whiplash car accident . <p> So there 's that . <p> Anyway , you know me- I 'm so intrigued &amp; need to ask 100 questions to report back to you guys . Also I needed a good dinner story for Michael , apres-ski . <p> here 's the thing : I do n't  like smoking weed- it makes me lazy , hungry AF , &amp; anxious . Also I 'm not a fan of smoking in general- no judgement if you 're a smoker- I just do n't  like it personally ( I 'm more of a tequila girl ) . HOWEVER I know a lot of people who have really benefited from weed ( that 's a whole other post ) . I think if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as putting weed oil on my body , what do I have to lose ? Nothing wrong with trying it . <p> He tells me that weed oil will kill all pain in my neck for 6 hours , that the benefits are endless , &amp; this particular kind is fantastic for pain &amp; all-natural . <p> So I tell the guy , " sure- lather me up ! ! " <p> Again , I 'm thinking of mainly of my dinner story &amp; TSC . <p> He proceeds to rub this magical weed oil all over my neck &amp; back . <p> Nothing really happened other than I felt relief . <p> So of course , I took a picture of the tiny canister ( its kind of expensive for a few- ounces ! ! ) &amp; e-mailed it to myself to buy . I plan on using it on my neck when I 'm in pain or on my wrists ( sometimes when I 'm on the computer too much I get kind of carpel tunnel ) . Also I think Michael will love a sexy weed massage . Debating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Anyway , when I came back to the hotel I researched the benefits for you guys. - Check out this post ( &lt;&lt; a great breakdown ) . <p> Interesting stuff , right ? <p> I 'm feeling a follow-up post ? <p> Before I go ! ! Some of you have Snapped me about these Aspen looks . Quick breakdown : <p> OK that 's all . Have you guys tried weed oil ( apparently its actually called CND Oil ) ? Have you heard of it ? This was news to me . I have to say I liked it . I would use it &amp; recommend it to someone in pain . Stay tuned for when my shipment gets inIll just be over here experimenting . <p> Those pictures are beautiful ! I 've always wanted to go to Aspen . Your massage sounds wonderful . I HATE when I get a massage and the girl is afraid to go too deep or hard . I almost always request a man because I feel like they really get in there . Never heard of weed oil but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wonderful benefits of weed oil ! I have massive neck and back issues do to an accident 7 years ago and weed oil is theee only thing helping me relax ! But not the " hemp cream " crap but the CBD oil , basically you have 2 different kinds of weed oil . 1 . Weed oil with THC ( you will get high as fuck ) 2 . Weed oil without THC but with CBD I use number 2 , off course CBD has the following benefits : Anti convulsant Antipsychotic Anti-inflammatory Anti-oxidant Anti-tumoral/Anti-cancer Anti-depressant There are thouuusands of stories all around the world about the benefits of CBD , it has cured cancer , some children with epilepsy started taking it and are seizure free ! There are people with severe pain that do n't  need any medication anymore , just the cbd oil I just do n't  know if its legal in America .. I live in the Netherlands so everything with the ingredient weed in it is a celebration over here .. You should most definitely write a post about it ! xo ries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edibles with high CBD concentration are also amazingly effective for your body as we have our own endocannabinoid system to metabolize it CBD is an anti-inflammatory and pain reliever , also helps you sleep well . I know my dad who has bad back issues has benefitted a lot from topical treatments .

@@3098321 <p> Here 's the thing about ponytails : they can be effortless while being oh-so-sexy at the same time . I am a fan of covering the band ( definitely go for a- nude toned holder always ) with a little bit of the hair . <p> Since some of you guys Snapped me asking about achieving the perfect pony , I figured LET 'S DO A POST ON IT ! It 's so easy really anyone can do it . <p> First things first , we washed Lauryn 's hair . Next up , drying the hair : I used Lauryn 's favorite blow dryer ( she loves it because it 's whitehaha , I love it because it 's quick &amp; does n't damage the hair ) . After her hair was dry , - I flat ironed Lauryns hair to make it very , VERY sleek . We decided on a middle part to give it a more severe , intense look . <p> You can do a high pony , a low pony or what we decided on was something kinda between the two . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can really secure the pony . Keep the hair tie nude . If your hair is on the finer side then maybe do a thinner one to avoid it from sliding . <p> Before you wrap the rubber band around the pony , take a comb to really make sure the top is sleek and you do n't  have any random hairs popping up . Once you have the ponytail secure with the band , spray with a good hold hairspray to avoid any flyaway hairs . <p> OK ! Now to hide the rubber bandbecause let 's face it , it looks so much more chic when it 's hidden . Lauryn &amp; I definitely prefer the illusion that the ponytail is wrapped by the hair . Its super easy . Take a strand from the outside of the pony . Wrap that strand clockwise until you 've covered the rubber band . Once that 's done , take a bobby pin where the end of that strand is and try to pin it into the ponytail ( where the rubber band is ) to try to hide the pin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil ( you know how Lauryn loves her oils , lol ) to smooth the pony to prevent fly-aways . We used Ghost Oil , a restorative oil that hydrates the hair . For shine , we did a dime-size amount of Living Proof Nourishing Oil ( this is great for color damaged hair too ) . Lastly , Lauryn wanted to smell good so we did a few drops of Madam C.J. Walker 's Coconut Oil&amp; VOILA ! A perfect pony . <h> Steps simplified : <p> 1 . ) Wash &amp; dry hair . <p> 2 . ) Straighten hair . Keep it sleek . <p> 3 . ) Part down the middle , secure a ponytail , not too high , not too low . <p> 4 . ) Take a strand from the outside of the pony . Wrap that strand clockwise until you 've covered the rubber band . <p> The best part ? MY MAGICAL OILS made me smell delicious . A real plus when you 're not the biggest deodorant fan . But you guys know how obsessed I am with OILS . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everything . <p> Like I said , all of these products used are free of parabens , sulfates , &amp; phthalates which is just the way to go if possible . I found them all at Sephora . There is nothing better than a good Sephora run . I always ask the girls that work there 6 million questions &amp; they always have the BEST beauty products . This medley will be on repeat in Mexico . In fact , these are the only three oils I 'm bringing . <p> Wow , I love those pearl earrings . Very snazzy ! I am too jealous of your ponytail to even comment . I have bought a few of the beauty boxes from Sephora that come with different things perfumes , Korean beauty , hair masks . They are nice ! <p> Wow , I love your ponytail . So simple yet super clean and beautiful look . I will bookmark your blog here . This could be my ponytail for this coming Christmas party .

This does n't  mean prepping 5 nights of meals on Sunday ( although if that works for you- do you ! ) . <p> What it means is that with- the right tools , healthy choices are much , MUCH easier &amp; accessible . These are the items that I use every day- &amp;- are a must for anyone looking to incorporate healthier habits into their life . <p> ( Yes , yes , you know these three usual suspects if you follow along on Snapchat ! ) . <p> Love pasta but trying to limit your carbs ? Enter the spiralizer . This tool is AMAZING. - - I use a spiralizer to make zucchini noodles- regularly . Top them with spicy marinara , lemon &amp; arugula and you honestly wo n't miss the pasta at all . You can also use a spiralizer to make curly sweet potato fries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many possibilities with this . <p> I 'm always on the move which means I- eat- on the go A LOT . I 'll eat in the car , when I 'm on the phone , during a brow wax sesh .. you get it . Eating on the go is not an excuse to eat unhealthy foods . Prepare your food ahead of time so you know EXACTLY what you 're eating . <p> These glass containers are perfect for storing your lunch &amp; fruit to bring to the office . I even use- glass bottles- to bring my blended coffee around town. - Please , whatever you do , stay away from- BPA- and use glass / BPA free plastic whenever possible . Balance this part like your checkbook- do what you can do . <p> G - G - G - G <p> Always keep- smoothie ingredients in your freezer &amp; snacks- in your purse . Youll be thankful when you 're stuck in traffic for two hours and all you can find is a gas station . Hope you guys are having a fun &amp; relaxing weekend ! - Share any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x <p> +- have you listened to the- latest podcast ? We reached ONE YEAR baby ! Thank you for all of the support as always. - <p> Love Love zucchini noodles ! I think they actually taste better then your every day dry pasta and they also make you feel better after you eat them no heavy feeling like you get after eating pasta . I love pasta , but since switching to zucchini noodles I only eat pasta if it freshly made like at a really good Italian restaurant . That does n't  happen very often tho. -http : //www.telleapp.com <p> These are great tips . I 'm obsessed with my nutri-bullet , too . I recently got my boyfriend hooked on zucchini noodles and although they 're not a substitute for real spaghetti , they definitely do the trick . <p> One of my best tips for staying healthy on the go is to always move . Unfortunately ( hopefully not for much longer ? ) I have a terrible 8-5 desk job and I make sure to get up every hour and just walk around for at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I usually would . My fitbit is obviously really useful for tracking steps and making sure I move enough throughout the day . <p> Weve been meaning to get on the zoodle train for a while ( my daughter has celiac disease ) but really are n't  fans of zucchini Have you tried making other " veggie noodles " and could the Spiralizer handle it ? If so we might need to look into buying one !

@@3098331 <h> Charcoal Toothpaste Exists , Guys&amp; Its Magical <h> These recommendations sounded like the smartest thing on the planet because activated charcoal whitens things AND its natural . <p> Screw chemical filled toothpaste , right ? I feel like I got over the Crest , Colgate , Aquafresh thing years ago when I switched to Toms all-natural toothpaste . BUT to be dead honest , Toms was n't really keeping my teeth the whitest of white . <p> So after reading some of your charcoal recommendations I figured I 'd have to be the guinea pig &amp; see how the whole charcoal toothpaste thing went . <p> Anyway , I 've tried three different charcoal toothpastes &amp; this one is by far my favorite ( not sponsored , just realness ) . If you are looking for charcoal pills for these awesome benefits , check out this brand . Its my fav . <p> here 's the deal : my teeth are SO much whiter . NO JOKE . Need some research on why ? here 's a little story for yaaccording to this source : <p> " No chemical teeth whitening solution or product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action and power of Carbon. - I remember a friend of mine , a Native American woman , told me one day how her teeth became and stayed so white . She told me accounts of when she was a little girl growing up , her father used to burn plant matter and after the plant burned to black ashes or became charred , the father would take the ash residue and give to his family and they would take a little on their finger and brush against their teeth. - I used to always wonder how ancient people took care of their teeth without toothbrushes . But these people had Carbon , Miswak ( or Peelu ) and licorice sticks to use for oral hygiene. - To use Carbon for your teeth , all you have to do is put a little toothpaste ( a good brand of toothpaste , i.e. , Peelu , Ayurveda , Natures Gate , Toms of Maine ) on your toothbrush , then dip it in some Carbon , add just a little bit of water , and begin to brush . Your mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may get messy , but one thing I can assure you , your teeth will get a good cleansing and a good shining. - You would be wise to avoid using any and all commercial brands of toothpaste as they are all poisonous and toxic and contain harmful ingredients such as sodium fluoride ( a major ingredient in rat poison ) , propylene glycol ( used in engine degreaser ) , sodium laurel sulfate , saccharin ( a known carcinogen ) , and harmful petroleum-based dyes ( red lake &amp; blue lake ) , also reported to be carcinogenic . " <h> No substance removes acidic plaque from the teeth like Carbon . It will greatly clean your teeth and help to remove stains on the teeth ( especially stains derived from drinking coffee ) . <p> " I did some research and found out that even though it temporarily makes the mouth look extremely black ( see picture ! ) it has the same effect as it does when ingested : it pulls toxins from the mouth and removes stains . ( Fair warning : when you open your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Right after I did this the first time I was intensely worried that it would stain my teeth ! ) - To my surprise , all of the black washes away and it makes your teeth feel extremely clean and smooth . After a few uses , my teeth were noticeably whiter too ( you can sort of tell in the picture- the lighting did n't do it justice ! ) . - Further research I 've done on this showed that activated charcoal can actually be helpful in changing the pH and health of the mouth , and as such is effective in preventing cavities and killing the bad bacteria present in tooth decay and gingivitis . For this reason , I now suggest and use it as part of my remineralizing protocol for teeth , along with my remineralizing toothpaste . " <p> I use it for two minutes when I brush my teeth &amp; gums , twice a day . I like to brush my teeth in the shower so it does n't  stain the sink too . Is that weird ? Afterwards my mouth feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If any of you have been using charcoal toothpaste for a while , weigh in ! What 's your experience been like ?

I have been using toms for years , but beig a heavy coffee and tea drinker , my teeth need a little brightening every so often . Ive been using capsules of activated charcoal sprinkled on my Toothbrush or finger and its a MESS ! Like , almost not worth it . I have to stub the sink and my hands afterward and its hard to come clean ! SO buying this and possibly even brushing in the shower now too But I hate cleaning the shower even more so well see haha Thanks for the tip ! <p> THANK YOU , for this post ! I eat healthy , mostly vegan , organic and non-GMO , and I am very aware of what goes into my body as well as on it .

Flashback Friday <p> Hmmm I was super intrigued by your charcoal post and am going to seriously order this right now ! I also tried switching my Crest toothpaste for something simpler but it just was n't worth sacrificing the white-ness ( so glad to have found someone equally obsessed with it ! ) . Do you have any red wine tooth stain tricks ? <p> Be VERY careful with Charcoal pills and toothpaste ! ! People do n't  realize how dangerous it is ! Charcoal binds to everything in its path including all the good things fighting in your body to protect itself . The tooth whitening market is a billion dollar industry , so if it was fully safe and effective , the big brands would be using it . <p> I recently got prescribed a high percentage of fluoride toothpaste from my dentist to prevent cavities . Its a prescription Colgate toothpaste from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you but she says its good for your teeth . Maybe I 'll incorporate charcoal tooth paste as well for whitening . I hope the fluoride is n't too bad for the body ! <p> Im interested to try this but a little worried about the taste . I do n't  like using whitening toothpaste but like the overall whitening effects , so I think this could be a good alternative for me though . Thanks ! Tricia @ A Couple of Dashes recently posted .. How To Be An Awesome Race Spectator : Part 2 <p> Hi Lauren , I absolutely love charcoal toothpaste , however I have to disagree with you on using one without flouride . Credentials dentist graduated from the university of birmingham in 2013 . The enamel in your teeth is made up of crystals called hydroxyapatite , and you get tooth decay by dietary sugar acids dissolving those crystals . Flouride from toothpaste is incorporated into the hydroxyapatite to create a new larger , more stable crystal called flourohydroxyapatite . This larger crystal is harder and stronger , and is much more resistant to acid attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decay . <p> Obviously just my two cents , feel free to make your own decisions though ! <p> Although the toothpaste does not contain " abrasive baking soda or salt " it DOES contain abrasive charcoal . The way its working to whiten your teeth is literally sanding away layers of enamel to reveal whiter teeth underneath . Not worth it ! ! <p> Lauryn , I am going to try this immediately ! ! I need some serious tooth whitening help , since I have n't done it since high school when I used the white strips . Also I just wanted to say CONGRATULATIONS on the launch of the bombshell body plan ! ! It has always been my dream to organize everything I know about fitness into something people can use everydaywith a spin on protecting your joints etc . I 'm beyond excited for you ! ! XOXJill @ Champagne for Everyday recently posted .. Healthy Dinner Hacks : Low Calorie Seaweed ( Nori ) Wraps <p> I live in Japan and had been importing my toothpaste . I just ran out though so I went shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many charcoal toothpastes are sold here ! The one I bought is n't as concentrated as this , it looks more like cookies and cream with chunks of charcoal instead of black paste . It has a floral mint flavor and I am enjoying it . I 'm so excited about it I actually have been brushing my teeth more often than normal ! Even if it brightens my smile just a little , I 'll be happy . <p> When I first saw the title of this post I thought what is this about ! Straight away I was picturing black toothpaste and that was before I scrolled down and saw the imnage you had put . Its a great post and good that you have included the ingredients that is in the paste . I think I can vouch for everyone who has commented or reads this post we all want pearly white teeth and we have all tried and still use toothpaste with added teeth whitening in it and we never get results . When I was reading through and I read the part when you said it does make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did stay like that for a while and evetually wore off , its a good job you did mention that it does n't  stay . Does it have a bad taste ? Can you still use orginary tooth paste with this ? <p> I will give it ago see how I like it . It probably does n't  taste bad but I just thought I would ask . I know some toothpastes I hate the taste of and they are strong and feel like they are burning my tongue . <p> I have heard of using activated charcoal as a method of whitening teeth but did not know that a charcoal toothpaste existed . This is definitely new to me but it sounds like a great idea because it whitens teeth without toxic ingredients . We will have to give it a try . Thanks . <p> I know this post is a little dated now , but I was curious if you 're still using the Twin Lotus toothpaste . I do n't  know if the ingredients have changed , but looking at the packaging on the Amazon link , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you listed : bentonite clay , organic orris root powder , myrrh gum powder , organic hibiscus petal powder , organic stevia leaf powder , or organic cinnamon extract , and it DOES indeed contain sodium saccharin . Just an FYI for anyone else who stumbles on this post looking for toothpaste reviews ! <p> I ordered this off of eBay for around $10 . About a year ago I trued the charcoal powder and that was a MESS ! It did seem to work some , but hardly worth turning everything black ! ! Now this Twin Lotus is AMAZING . It tastes fresh and absolutely whitens and brightens my smile ! I use about 3x a week ! <p> Does anyone have any recommendations for HOW to use it ? I have the Sumigaki Japanese Charcoal Toothpaste arriving in a couple days via Amazon and I 'm trying to know *everything* about how to use it correctly to get optimal cleany-freshy-whitey for my teeth ! <p> I have read that over time the activated charcoal ends up destroying tooth enamel . Several dentists have written about this . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started using a charcoal activated toothpaste and my teeth feel so much cleaner and smoother . But I am concerned with long term use . Are you able to confirm either way . <p> Sounds impressive and they sell something like it in my town . However will the whitening effect work on teeth stained by medicine taken as a young child . My experience no matter what products I 've used could not whiten my teeth . They are permanently a yellow grey . If this product can go into the enamel and lighten the teeth I would buy a case of it ! <p> I started using the charcoal toothpaste from Japan the other day . It has a lot of fake stuff in it . I can tell . I am careful not to swallow it and I always brush with Toms after I brush with it ( if only to remove the nasty taste from my mouth ) . I am going to try this kind next as it is far more natural .

Once it turns in to more of a paste form instead of a powered form I rub it on my teeth with my ( clean ) finger . Let it sit on my teeth for 10-15 minutes , but I cant close my lips , LOL .

A Little Wednesday Wisdom : Run The Day <p> YES when I was in India , I noticed that everyone I came in contact with , even the least fortunate people I met had THE most gleaming white teeth , like sparkling . When I asked a woman how her teeth were so damn sparkly she showed me this little pot of charcoal powder that you get from the chemist out there that apparently they ALL use literally everyone even the old people , explaining how they have the most amazing pearly whites . So obviously I run and get some and dumb old Western me did n't  think to ask how they used it so I just dug into it with my finger and rubbed away on my teeth with my finger , did n't  think much of it and never used it again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

I have been taking activated charcoal for the past few years ! I originally found out about its amazing benefits when my body was rejecting a lot of foods and I was n't able to digest certain things and would get absolutely horrible acid reflux . I did n't  want to take icky prescription medication so I found out about charcoal . I keep some in a little plastic baggy in my purse at all times in case I eat something my body struggles with .

But it is definitely great if you are getting ready for an event/pictures and want that extra whiteness boost ! <p> You are hilarious , and this article made me laugh out loud . I read somewhere that vagina steaming might be relaxing to some , but the special blend of herbs &amp; spices ( Johnnys Seasoning Salt , anyone ? ) does n't  even come close to making it inside your body . You 're steaming your vagina , not your uterus . You vag has lips , just like your face . They do n't  just spread open willy-nilly and let everything in , no matter how relaxed you are . If they did , you 'd have water pouring out of your vagina every time you got out of a swimming pool . Imagine closing your mouth , and then blasting steam at it . The steam hits your lips , it might feel good , but its not making it into your mouth . So unless you have the same kind of control over your JJ lips that you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide on demand , the steam is just hitting the outer part of your female anatomy . I can get behind that it might help fight the nasty little bacteria that grow there , and could be helpful in that regard . But as for healing steam wafting around my womb ? Not gon na happen .

@@3098335 <h> GIRLBOSS 101 : The Importance of Positive Affirmations <p> I have been thinking about this post for a lonnnnnnnnnnnnnnng ( long , long , like a year ) time . <p> For a while there , I did n't  know why I had to think for so damn long &amp; then I kind of had an AHA ! moment . <p> The reason this particular post required so much thought is because its something I do everyday that 's kind of er , maybe personal&amp; even a little weird ? Also , it has a huge impact my- business , friendships , relationships , &amp; day to day life . <h> Basically its about a little thing called- positive reinforcement . <p> Instead of looking for reinforcement from other people , I look for the positive reinforcement from within by surrounding myself with constant , daily reminders . <p> Listen- like I said , this is a personal thing that works well for me . It may not work for you , but I wanted to share a piece of something special that 's helped me keep going in business/life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of- positive affirmations until one random day , I just sort of did realize it , ya know ? I was probably 19 years old. - That sounds confusing ? &amp; maybe I 'm not making any sense ? but practicing positive affirmations- was something I always just kinda did unintentionally . <p> I remember being 9 or 10- &amp; having tiny little stickers in hidden spots that said quotes like you go , girl or success is the sum of small efforts , repeated day in and day out " . And I remember having pictures of how I envisioned my dream- room to look when I was 12 or 16 , and having some serious quotes on the front of my binder with pictures of how I envisioned life after high school . Almost like a vision board , I guess . <p> I mean , I never realized that displaying certain words/pictures/etc. - were to ultimately appease my subconscious &amp; serve as motivational reminders when things- got tough , boring , or when life did n't  go as planned . <p> ( I 've said it before &amp; I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life . Some of the stories are not mine to tell &amp; some are ones I prefer to keep personal , but the point is : having positive reminders around my house/workspace/bedroom have provided a sense of comfort &amp; positivity ) . <p> Are you lost yet ? Hope not . Ok so , what is positive affirmation ? What EXACTLY do I mean ? <p> This is my definition ( feel free to form your own- ) : having positive reminders around everyday that help you to manifest &amp; create a happy life . <p> This may mean quotes around your house , candles burning with comforting phrases , business cards proudly on display to remind you of your goals , a tiny locket with a little picture or word , a painting that represents something to you ( for instance if your goal is travel the world , maybe its a map ) , an inspiring book that 's highlighted and bookmarked , - &amp;/or a phrase that you quietly repeat to yourself each morning during a yoga class . <p> Tiny positive life quotes are kept around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open spots . <p> Each time I leave my house there 's a print that says HUSTLE ( remember this post ? ) . Reminding me &amp; Michael to HUSTLE . Again , maybe we do n't  acknowledge itbut we see it when we come home &amp; when we leave . Every . Single . Day . <p> I blog , obviously . Sometimes I blog positive affirmations so its in front of an audience &amp; it feels more real . Like this post about my wedding . Its out in the open now , my measly list , but at least its a start you know ? And sometimes I post inspiration on Instagram- to share a specific quote that really resonated . <p> If this method is something you 're interested in exploring , I guess what I would suggest is to look around . What 's surrounding you ? Are you surrounded by positive affirmations ? If you 're trying to build a business , what 's your daily positive reinforcement ? Is your vision laid out in front of you so you can see it ? If you 're working on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are there little reminders around to remind you of what to work on ? If you 're trying to adapt a healthier lifestyle , is that lifestyle the one that 's surrounding you ? If you have a set goal , is there motivation around reminding you to stay focused ? <p> A- lot of you have asked me how I find motivation to blog everyday and a huge part comes from positive intention . And no one sets it for me . I do it for myself , a little everyday . <p> Do any of you guys do this ? If so , what 's a positive affirmation that makes your day brighter &amp; encourages you to attain your goals ? As always , I would love to hear ! <p> This is so key I actually have an 8am reminder in my phone for " Positive Affirmations " . In the notes , I affirm things that I doubt myself on the most or think I am bad at . I listed a time when someone told me the opposite . It really helps ! xxJill @ Champagne for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From Start-up to Corporate <p> This is a FANTASTIC post that I can totally relate to . I really do do this in my daily life as well . It makes such a difference in your attitude and performance ! Love this post girl , thanks for sharing &lt;3 <p> Love this so much !

Cheers ! <p> I 100% cosign this post ! I 'm at work right now and I am literally surrounded at my cubicle by quotes that I find **31;803;TOOLONG . Under my computer screen I have fortune cookie fortunes lined up that spoke to me specifically . <p> I have a folder in my email inbox that is just labeled as an asterisk so its at the top and I file positive emails Ive received from coworkers and funny email chains or memes we send around to look at to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ive recently started leaving a post-it with a different quote on it every day for my boyfriend . I feel like he s been in a work rut and is feeling dispassionate and I wanted to help turn his mindset around . He started moving the collection around his mirror . <p> Also on the boyfriend note , I started writing down in Notes on my phone whenever he said or did something particularly sweet or loving and I look back on it often . I feel like even that helped me be more mindful and appreciative of him . Versus focusing on some negative experience from years prior ( I used to have this habit of only remembering the bad things ) . <p> 3 years ago I started working really hard at being happier and shedding people and things in my life that overwhelmed me with negativity and stress . It was LIFECHANGING . I firmly believe positive thinking and positive reinforcement reaps positive experiences and people . Once I started that I became a more positive person and my life seemed to trend upwards lol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmations too ! There is nothing like an uplifting quote to energize and inspire me to get sh** done . Lately , I 've been repeating " Victory " over and over to myself . I feel like it changes my whole vibe , makes me more proactive , and confident to take chances . I 'm with you on banning negativity . It simply is n't productive or helpful . <p> I 'm so happy you shared that you use vision boards and positive affirmations . Its like when athletes say that they visualized making the goal , or holding the trophy and to help them keep their head in the game . Its not weird , because it works ! <p> Love this post !

The part I really , really love is your perspective on how we might not always acknowledge the sign or journal or positive affirmation we have out but perhaps we ARE still seeing those things on a subconscious level .

On a personal note , like you said , there are real stories , and things to keep private that are n't  instagram pretty if you will and I strongly believe the power of positivity through those . If you believe something , it WILL come true , so that 's why positivity is so so so important ( thinking negatively/neutral always yields negative/no results ) .

@@3098337 <p> Firstly , instead of just bee pollen &amp; coconut oil , I 'm using a couple other secret ingreds like raw hemp hearts , flaxseed , &amp; chia seeds ( &lt;&lt; I know make fun of me all day long for chia seed habit , sorry not sorry ) . <p> Obviously I 'm very specific about this TSC concoction . here 's why each component matters : <p> BEE POLLEN : is known to increase energy &amp; help with allergies ( especially if its local ) . <p> Also note that this little spoonful of energy promotes weight loss . Let 's just say it gets everything flowing . Many supermodels/models have told me their number one trick to weight loss is bee pollen. - The amount of vitamins in bee pollen is RIDICjust check out this list . The superfood has been used for centuries &amp; contains my favorite ever : magnesium ( &lt;&lt; best everremember this post , guys ? ) . <p> This site states that " bee pollen can aid in weight loss . According to Carson Wade , " bee pollen is a natural way to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is said that bee pollen improves metabolism by correcting a chemical imbalance and by " supplying the missing factors other foods can not supply . " - Bee pollen supposedly speeds the process of converting sugar into energy providing oxygen that fat can use to speed their conversion into energy . 130mg of bee pollen helps digest 3 pounds of food. - <p> Lecithin is another component of bee pollen that supposedly speeds the rate at which calories are burned . It also " aids in the digestive process and assimilation of nutrients. - Bee pollen also has diuretic qualities and is said to reduce cravings and hunger . For weight reduction , take pollen 30 minutes before meals with a glass of water . " <p> Also , I got ta say it : according to this source Taylor Swift recently lost 10 pounds &amp; stated that it had to do with adding an abundant amount of these chia seeds to her diet . Supposedly she love them " because the seeds swell in your stomach , reduce hunger , and fill her up for hours . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home if ya do n't  believe me . <p> This is n't necessarily ENERGY but you mentioned skin/hair benefits Have you heard about cod liver oil ? Ive been reading that it totally changes your skin , helps with acne and just gives it an all around glow . I just started taking it so I cant comment yet , but anyone else tried it ? ? <p> I 'm really lazy in the morning and I usually put all the ingredient together before going to bed and in the morning I only add Greek yogurt to the mix = My skin looks so good since I eat this every morning <p> Lauren , do n't  forget that if you 're consuming the whole flax seed you 're mostly likely just going to poop it out without reaping the benefits ! Flax needs to be ground for our bodies to break it down ( Because the shell is too tough for our bodies ! ) Look it up ? <p> I totally need to try Bee pollen though . A girl I went to University with swears by it , ( AND the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on that train . <p> Hi Lauryn ! Could you tell me the measurements of how much of the seed mixture you take and how you take it ? I saw in the video you had a spoonful of coconut oil and the seed mixture on top . And how much should you consume in a day ? Thanks ! <p> I 've never tried bee pollen before , but I 'm a huge fan of hulled hemp seeds especially in smoothies . It makes them extra creamy , total bonus ! I 'm going to have to give this pollen a try ! I love anything natural that add a little boost to my energy . <p> Ive been loving Genuine Healths greens + extra energy in cappuccino for added energy . The ingredients are balanced , the science behind each one was thoroughly researched and it really does work . Now I skip dehydrating coffee in the morning in favour of this esp pre-workout ! <p> Love my Divacup ! There is definitely a learning curve so have a back-up ready the first few times . But once you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste , no worry about clogging the toilet/ funkiness in the bathroom trashcan . Ca n't wait to hear your thoughts ! <p> Yay ! ! You will love the Diva Cup , hopefully ! Just be sure that you bought the correct model ( there is one for those who have given birth and one for those who have not ) . Also , it is WAY cheaper on Amazon . I paid , like , forty bucks for mine at whole foods . But , its still going strong multiple years later so the cost was worth it . I definitely need to buy some bee pollen . I have been interested in it since you last posted about it ! S recently posted .. Happy Honeymooners in Grand Cayman <p> I 'm really lazy in the morning and I usually put all the ingredient together before going to bed and in the morning I only add Greek yogurt to the mix = My skin looks so good since I eat this every morning ! <p> I use coconut oil for cooking constantly , however I 'm watching and rewatching your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablespoon of it raw . Is that weird ? Do you feel its a necessary part of the " energy in a spoon " ? I 'm not sure I could get past it . <p> Shannon , if you need to lose weight for your wedding , I would recommend the 5:2 diet . I have been on it for a year and have lost about 20 kgs . The first 10 kgs came off at about 2 kgs a month , then it has slowed to about 1 a month . <p> Soooo TMI , but I have been using the " instead " cups since 2005 and I will NEVER use a tampon again ! The instead are disposable , you can get them in packs of like 18 , which should last 3 months ( these can stay in 24 hours since no risk of TSS , unless you have HEAVY flow and need to change it ) . The Divacup I believe is reusable , but it is also way differently shaped , so I never went with that . No complaints about the instead cups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was 20 , and after using tampons for the first 3 years of my period ( late bloomer , first period at 17 ) , I 've never gone back . <p> And they work in any situation . As luck would have it , I did both my half ironman and full ironman while on my period last year ( thanks , mother nature , that was awesome ) . So these babies held up under a 2.4 mile river swim , 112 mile bike ride , and 26.2 mile run like a champ <p> I SWEAR by the Diva Cup " I 've used it for 7 years and during that time have only purchased two boxes of tampons for extreme traveling situations . I love the Diva Cup because its chemical-free , will not give you toxic shock syndrome , helps save the environment , does n't  have that annoying string that always gets in the way and can save you a TON of money throughout the years . Everyone has their own special tricks with the Diva Cup " I prefer to rinse mine out and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a designated pot that I boil it in at the end of my cycle and I use toothpicks to clean out the little ventilation holes I hope you end up loving it as much as I do ! ! <p> cant wait to hear about your diva cup experience- I am mildly freaked out about the thought and am glad you are going to be our tester ! Bee pollen is great for allergies too FYI I take all of these things but all separately I love the idea of taking everything together . <p> I buy large amounts of all of those seeds and bee pollen and coconut oil . They are great in smoothies , chia frescas and many raw vegan deserts . As far as the Diva Cup goes I have used mine for years now . Definitely recommend .

Its interesting to see it everywhere now but I 'm down ! I 'm not sure if you 've posted about CLA or not ? But that Ive been on for years and really like how its non-stimulant for fat loss etc . <p> Also when the bee pollen came in the mail my boyfriend was like , wtf , haha <p> I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis a month ago and I 've decided to try Paleo diet for 90 days and I start my day with a cup of green smoothie so I was wondering if it 's safe To add spirulina powder , chia seeds , flaxseeds , hemp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much !

@@3098340 <p> For starters , bee pollen &amp; royal jelly " are two different things . Royal jelly is what bees eat and feed to their queen . It is a very high nutrient-rich food . Bee pollen is produced by flowers and is attached to the feet of bees when they extract nectar from flowers/plants . Essentially , bees do not produce pollen flowers and plants do . But bees use pollen &amp; other substances to create royal jelly for their food . Royal jelly is full of bee vitamins . " <p> OMG I WANT WHAT BEES FEED TO THEIR QUEEN . <p> But really , bees feed the queen the cream of the cropsoooooo gim me . ( Also , bee vitamins ? I cant with that ) . <h> Basically the queen bee bitch gets hooked up <p> " When bee larvae are first born , they 're fed royal jelly directly from the workers in order to get a healthy , nutritious boost so they survive their first few days of life . However , after 3-4 days , larvae no longer consume royal jelly . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important . In fact , queen larvae are put into these special queen cells and are surrounded by royal jelly . This is what helps them to develop their queen morphology . " <p> &lt; I 'm jealous . &gt; <p> " Theres a single protein , royalactin , that causes the phenotypic change in the queen larvae . It causes them to develop ovaries and grow to a far larger size than normal bees . Furthermore , royal jelly has been known to extend the life span of a queen more than 20 times longer than that of a normal bee ( via ) . " <p> I 'll take it ! <p> Also , the stuff is REALLY GOOD for skin guys . It essentially heals you from the inside out . My favorite wellness tip ever : healing the system through clean eating to produce outward healing . <h> Royal jelly is anti-aging , healing , vitamin filled goodness .. YES . <p> SO how do you eat it ? Easy . Just take a teaspoon under the tongue. - The recommended usage is simple : one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empty stomach with a small amount of water . <p> Ultimately the main reason Ive been royal jelly-ing it up after surgery is because one of the main benefits : its a total anti-inflammatory which I REALLY NEED because I literally look like Quasimodo slept with Sloth from The Goonies . Its not pretty . <p> This brand is my favorite because its no bullshit . Just 100% royal jelly . Plus Y.S. Beekeepers are known for how serious they are about true , honest , healthy bee products . LOVE it . If you want a quick fix , royal jelly is- available in capsule form- as well . <p> Really interesting post . About inflammation get a high dose of fish oil , in particular omega-3 , because actually right now I 'm looking into this as a nutritional cure for inflammatory skin conditions . However it also reduces inflammation in all of the bodys systems ( I work in a biomedical company so I 'm currently researching this in the lab ) . Sorry if this gets too sciency now but , basically the body needs omega-3 PUFAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signalling molecules that regulate inflammatory pathways . Also its worth mentioning that yes eicosanoids from omega-3 PUFAs have inflammatory properties BUT eicosanoids derived from an omega-6 PUFA ( particularly , the one called Arachidonic acid ) actually aggravates inflammation . <p> Yasmina , this comment is not too sciency ! !

Reading your last lines about how desperately you are in need of cooling down the inflammation reallly touched my heart- its why I want to help people so desperately . I guess first things first , and that 's your mind/heart . Youve got to have faith that this too shall pass , and believe in the incredible healing capabilities within your body . Its not broken , its just struggling , and needs a good friend and leader to help it pull through and survive . Work with your body , not against it . Number two , hows your gut ? Immunity , inflammation , everything , connects right to your gut . Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , fiber from vegetables and some fruit ? Prebiotics/resistant starch- squash , potatoes/sweet , yams , plantains ? Good prebiotics include garlic , onions , asparagus , and dandelion greens . Also , do n't  forget about probiotic foods/drinks ! Fermented veggies , kombucha , miso , pickles , kefir ( preferably coconut water kefir ) , yogurt ? That will help your immune system so much , especially in regards to inflammation . This also goes for nutrient-rich foods- leafy greens , cruciferous vegetables , a bit of starchy carbs here and there alongside fruit , fats ( especially omega 3s and coconut/oil ) , and herbs ( basil , oregano , cilantro , etc ) . Do n't  forget fish or chicken and eggs , too ! Bone broth can also really help ( Ive seen you blog about it , so you already know ) . The last thing would be supplements . The number one that comes to my mind in regards to inflammation is TURMERIC . Seriously . There are legitimate studies going on about this super root ! Its INSANE- just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that turmeric is a holistic ingredient that works its way all across the spectrum of the entire body , so you 're not just receiving its anti-inflammatory properties . A great supplement to buy is Gaias Turmeric SUPREME ; unline most supplements , Gaias comes paired with black pepper , which enhances the absorption of curcumin , the superpower substance derived from turmeric . It also is a mega potent extract of turmeric , and is free of any synthetic crap that will do more harm than good in the long run . I just want to note that I am NOT associated with Gaia , therefore I 'm receiving NO benefit from applauding their products . They 're just really potent and amazing ; I 'm a fan . Ginger too is another great anti-inflammatory to pair with turmeric as well . You may have to take multiple servings depending on the severity of your inflammation , but trust me when I say that turmeric can help , just give it time . Best of luck , Lauryn ! I pray you 'll make it out fine . <p> Sam , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you just gave sooo much info and I 'm loving it ! Turmeric has been a staple in my diet lately , so healing !

Many different strains of probiotic organisms are in use , which have different but overlapping benefits . Probiotic organisms work through several interrelated mechanisms to promote health at the molecular level. - They conquer potentially dangerous organisms in the intestine , reducing the risk of infection or toxin-mediated diseases .

I lot of people I know swer by probiotics when they are on antibiotics to prevent yeast infections and also to help regulate their bowels . Just be sure that if you are taking probiotics while on antibiotics that you space the two at least 2 hours apart . Antibiotics will kill all the bad bacteria that are causing your infection , but they may also kill all the good bacteria in your probiotic !

I 've I just started taking it with water before bed a few times a week after doing a bunch of research on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan , like vitamin C is to the US . I 'd love your opinion . <p> I love that you talk about things that other bloggers do n't  ! It makes you so real &amp; informative . As for probiotics , I 'm obsessed . I think they even help my anxiety . I read an article saying your gut is like your second brain &amp; it affects your mental health ( among other things ) . It makes sense . I definitely feel less stressed since I started taking 70 billion CFU a day . <p> Yesssss . Love this article . I actually was just prescribed heavy dose probiotics ( 100 billion ) from my Naturopath because of recurrent utis and I 'm noticing such a difference in my overall health . Can not recommend it enough . <p> Hey Lauryn . I 'm an Irish pharmacist , and a huge fan of your blog . I just wanted to thank you so much for taking the time to share so many amazing health and beauty tips ! PS : I do take a daily probiotic and find it makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU for being the 1% of bloggers ! It is a huge reason why I have followed you for so long , eventually will work with your company , and honestly a huge role model/inspiration for me . So neat to see how as much as your brand as developed and evolved , you are still so refreshingly real . Like , this stuff happens and I 'd rather hear you talk about it than some macarons or something ! OKAY so anyways , this post was SO INTERESTING ! I love that you really go into depth , and I love these posts . I will absolutely pick up that brand you linked . Sometimes I can get overwhelmed with everything on the market , especially when it comes to pills . Thank you for sharing ! ! I have been using the inner-eco coconut water probiotic which I liked because I could drink it , make chia pudding with it in advance and I might or might not have been known to make some cocktails with it ! = x <p> I was just standing in the vitamin isle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so funny ! Anyways I bought cinnamon pills because I am addicted to sugar and trying to help curb it . I love probiotics but I will def have to try this brand . I bought the leggings you swear by from Nordys , and even ordered a pair for my sisters birthday . I 'm loving the snap chats ! xox <p> Lauryn ! ! We were totally in the same brain wave in posting about probiotics on the same day ! No joke . I just started taking one last week and did a post about it and posted it last night I 'm ALL for the healthy bacteria , my gut needs it bad ! ! PS your post is way more thorough ! ! I like it ! ! Amanda Waltman recently posted .. Probiotics and My Mission to Have a Healthy Gut <p> I take acidophilus as well as jarrodophilus at a high count . I have a chronic , debilitating autoimmune disorder and yes , to an otherwise healthy person , 4 or 5 weeks may seem like an extended period of time to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off for years . So trust me when I say probiotics do n't  just help someone who is dealing with a temporary thing ( even if it is still very serious ! ) but also with something long-term . Stomach issues could be a huge ordeal for me , but because I take care of my gut , I rarely have problems , and I have n't had a yeast infection in years . One of my first specialists also suggested I take probiotics for my immune system , like you mentioned . So its nice to find something out there that can work for a variety of purposes and that is really well-known in the chronic illness community becauseit works !

I 've heard about kimchi and fermented foods a LOT lately and I know you 're a huge fan , but I do n't  think Ive ever had it ( although it might have been thrown into some dish Ive eaten at an Asian restaurant ) . Also , where do you find it ? More specifically , what aisle/what other food would it be near in a grocery store ? A full post on kimchi would be awesome ! Thanks again for all your tips <p> Long time reader , but I normally do n't  comment . If you have problems with yeast infections , you HAVE to try the product yeast guard . You can get it at any drugstore , and its basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weird , but honest to god it work so so well and is way more holistic than monistat ! I hope you give it a try ! <p> In case you have n't heard of LabDoor I thought I would point it out . They are a very helpful resource when it comes to researching supplements . Basically they pull supps off retail shelves and run them through a battery of tests then rate the supps so that the non-scientist consumers have a better understanding of the product . Anyway , here is their link for probiotic rankings : https : **33;865;TOOLONG . I am going to order this supp : LONG ... as it seems most effective in terms of quality and value . <p> Also , I always love reading your blog , it is seriously my most favorite . Keep doing what you do ! <p> I just love your blog ! I 'm just now finding it but better late than never ! I love my probiotic ! I recently started taking ProBio5 its a Plexus product . It contains 5 extra strength probiotics , added enzymes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Its great ! ! I 'm actually taking a few of the Plexus products to get my health in check !

I have been receiving some messages via email and snap asking about gifts for this holiday season . I thought I would put together a quick list to help give you all some gift ideas for the men in your life . I use all of these items on a regular , if not daily , basis . I tried to recommend things that get daily or weekly use , or things that would help the men in your life be more productive . Happy Holidays ! <p> I carry one of these in my briefcase every time I travel or go into the office . I like to keep my crazy ideas and thoughts in here . It 's also therapeutic to write notes in it when I read or need to get something off my chest . <p> I would have a hard time not including a book in my holiday gift guide . Tools of the Titans by Tim Ferriss is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , routines , and habits of some of the world 's most successful performers . There is so much value in this book . <p> Sometimes women can go a little crazy in relationships . Sometimes that crazy comes out in a big confusing way . Get your man a nice rocks glass so he can wash away the pain and confusion with a nice warm glass of whiskey . <p> This might be the best purchase I made in 2016 . I use it every day , I never run out of battery , ( even with the constant snapping ) it lasts hours and hours . Now he can never make the excuse that his phone was off ! <p> Lauryn got me really into tea over the last year and I drink it throughout the day in the office . I keep this kettle in my office and constantly use it to drink my tea . It gives me an excuse to stay hydrated and caffeinated ! I like this one because there are different temperatures based on the tea you want to drink . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year with the best results . The sandalwood scent smells like you just fought a grizzly bear after tearing down a tree with your bare hands . Masculine . <p> Ok I may be biased here . Background , I started wearing this exact boot 3-4 years ago , and loved them so much that I contacted the guys at Broken Homme to invest in their brand . I have now been an investor and advisor to the Broken Homme team for the last 3 years . The boots will not disappoint . I still have my same first pair and wear them everywhere !

Very fun to enjoy a little brunch , do some window shopping &amp; hang out with some inspiring- influencers . The trip was a whirlwind- &amp; now I 'm getting ready for Bostonat 6 am tomorrow . My voice sounds like a breathy smoker who ate a frog . Really my voice is shot- I am attributing this to podcasting for 5 hours straight on Friday ? Who knows . Maybe I just talk too much in general . Anyway , I need to shut up clearly . <p> Ive been living in these jeans recently- LOL can you tell ? I wear them every second . They 're the 2017 version of the classic ripped skinny jeans . The staggered hem is edgy &amp;- they 're SO comfortable . I love how they 're longer in the back &amp; shorter in the front . Its a real facade because it elongates the leg . Fun . <p> Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALWAYS be in style- a real classic . Plus these are a lifesaver anytime you drink . The dark tint is perfect for hiding a hangover . The bigger the better please . <p> I 've said it once &amp; I 'll probably keep saying it . A bodysuit is a closet staple . You can take them from day-to-night &amp; they always give off a pulled together vibe . This is such a must when traveling because its so versatile . <p> These black pumps are the perfect daytime Vegas shoe . They add some height but are still super comfortable . I wore them on the plane &amp; walked like 138470238 miles in them ( eer , ok RAN because we were late for our flight ? ) . If you can run in heels you know they belong in your closet . <p> The detailing on this- bomber jacket is INSANE . Its embroidered with pearls , rhinestones , &amp; beads in such an ornate &amp; intricate way . Really reminds me of The Nanz too . &amp;- just so- festive to rock to Vegas . <h> FOR NIGHT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop of black . I opted for OPIs Black Onyx so my dress would really be able to shine . After getting your nails done check out- my tips for- keeping your manicure fresh &amp; pristine . <p> If you 're going to Vegas you have to bring a little flash . This dress is super sexy with the thigh high slit &amp; really shines because of- the sequins . Sequins in Vegas are usually not my fav but for some reason this dress like , spoke to me . HA . <p> A little body jewelry is always fun . A little body jewelry in Vegas is a must . This body chain is the best for adding some glimmer to your look . Wear it with- a plunging neckline , a red lip &amp; a high pony . I designed it with CAM Jewelry for my wedding babes so I know you 'll LOVE . I slept in mine- not recommended but what can you do ? We were in Sin City . <p> Alright we leave early tomorrow morning for Boston so PLEASE comment below with any suggestions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never been so we need all of your advice ! <p> You HAVE to go to Yvonnes . Amazing cocktails and food . I recommend making a reservation . My favorite Oyster Bar is Island Creek . Russell House Tavern is amazing also ! Empire is chic for cocktails and high end Asian cuisine . ALSO , Eataly opened recently , so you have to go there ! Waypoint , Alden and Harlow , Frenchie and Mida ! I clearly love food , and Boston . Have fun !

@@3098363 <h> Pomegranate , Goat Cheese Spaghetti Squash <p> Updated : May 4 , 2017 <p> by <p> LAURYN <p> So I 'm feeling very pomegranate-y for Thanksgiving this year . <p> Really though , pomegranate seeds have just been a real theme around my house lately . I 'm on sort of pomegranate kick . Like its weird though : been adding them to salad , smoothies , pasta , yogurtchampagne ; ) . <p> Firstly , we 've talked about how the seeds are full ( FULL ) of benefits but I wanted to show you guys one of my favorite ways to eat them . Wait FOR IT <p> in spaghetti squash ! ! <h> Um , hello THANKSGIVING RECIPE right . <p> Basically when you 're too busy to cook a full-on Thanksgiving meal ? I got you covered . This ones for you , procrastinators . <p> As we know I 'm the Queen of Procrastination . So its no surprise that I 'm UB-SESSED with spaghetti squash . <p> + Directions : to cook my spaghetti squash I just cut the squash in half , vertically down the middle , &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch of water at 375 degrees . Make sure the squash is facing downward , not upward . Usually I leave it in the oven for about 20 minutes . ( Another more detailed way to cook spaghetti squash ) . <p> For the pomegranate seeds , I buy seeds that are ready to go at Whole Foods . If you 're de-seeding a pomegranate , check out this EASYYYY method ( rad , right ? ) . <p> After your squash is cooked , simply take a fork &amp; sort of comb ( think Ariel combing her hair at the table , kind of comb ) through the squash in a downward motion . Add all the pasta-like pieces to a big bowl . <p> Throw in 3 heaping handfuls of pomegranate seeds to the mixture . Sprinkle as much goat cheese as your little heart desires over the squash &amp; seeds . I personally look for raw goat cheese at the market ( I LOVE goat cheese ) . Add pine nuts ( option to toast them if you 're not a procrastinator like me ) . From there sprinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Meyer lemon on top , &amp; add pink salt/pepper to taste . If you like it spicy ( HI , I DO ) , add chilli flakes ! Honestly I did n't  measure this recipe , so just do what works for you. - Heres a little video : <p> G- G- G <p> Sometimes I cook a squash on Monday &amp; the whole thing lasts me for three lunches . They 're a HUGE vegetable so have fun with it . Remember when I made it with pesto sauce &amp; arrabiata- sauce ? YUM . <p> By the way , if you 're feeling this recipe with pasta ? Go for it . You do you , boo . <p> This looks like such a good combination ! Too bad they do n't  sell a lot of spaghetti squash here in Belgium . I have been dying to try it . I will have to take your suggestion and make it with pasta then . = <p> I love pomegranate seeds too ! I have been adding them to salads lately too . I never thought of this recipe though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently posted .. Hot chocolate is good for your soul ! <p> Yum ! ! Looks delicious !

You guys may laugh but I swear it allows me to sort of meditate . This one is favorite lately . Its pink &amp; frilly &amp; girly but totally gets the job done , ya know ? Kind of like a black out shadefor my eyes . <h> 2 . ) Invest in a quality mattress/pillows . <p> here 's the deal : you 're sleeping on this for 7 to 9 ( or 10 ) hours a night , every night , for years . So it really does n't  make sense to me how girls will invest in a pair of $500 dollar shoes , but skimp on the mattress . I like my mattresses quality ! Recently Michael &amp; I moved in together &amp; got a- mattress- from Sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same mattress because we are opposite . He likes cold , I like hot . He likes black , I like white . I like hard pillows , he like soft ( ew ) . So when we found a mattress we both liked ? JAZZ HANDS ! This one works well because when its delivered its rolled up ( sooooo- convenient ! ) . You simply unroll it &amp; VOILA ! <p> I have such bad allergies &amp; I swear my allergies have gotten sooooo much better after investing in this mattress . Plus the chihuahuas love it because its not too firm , but not too soft . I 'm also big on mattress toppers . They seriously make all the difference. - This one is my favorite because you feel like you 're sleeping in a cloudheaven ! <p> Also PILLOWS . I 've slept on uncomfortable pillows way too many nights throughout my life . Since sleep is such a priority now , I stepped up my pillow game. - These ones- are AH-MAZING . They align the head so there 's no strain ( perfect for someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how you sleep . <h> 3 . ) Reading before bed . <p> Instead of watching TV or going on Instagram ( heyyyy blue light ) , I have been reading . I find reading with the light on works better than reading off my iPad . Because iPad light is just hard on my eyes . My latest book is : - The Japanese Art of Tidying . Reading is my way to relax and shut my brain off ( aka take my mind off work ) . <h> 4 . ) Tea &amp; Melatonin . <p> I am a HUGE tea drinker before bed . Obviously something calming is best . Lately Ive been all about organic decaf lemongrass tea . YUM . Also , for the past six months I take one melatonin ( obsessed with this one ) before bed and I find it helps me sleep better . Some benefits of melatonin are : a better sleep , its natural , a potent antioxidant , - governs the bodys circadian rhythms , &amp; its very calming ( will do a full post on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oils . <p> I will do a full post on this because its like a book but lavender oil is everything for sleep ! !

Perfect before sleep . <h> 57 comments Leave a Comment + <p> I agree with you . I also sleep for about 9 hours every day and still have enough time to do everything that I need that day .

Michael ? Not so much . <p> Which is why its so incredibly fun to screw with him every second . <p> My next plan is to make 20 pounds of it , wrap it up , &amp; give him it for our wedding gift . #GOALS . <p> First off , the credit entirely goes to Sakara Life . The girl bosses sent me this snack &amp; immediately I was HOOKED .

I do n't  know . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewy&amp; just really RIGHT . <p> Have you guys ever had a food that just GETS YOU ? <p> ( Oddly , this also happens to me with spicy margaritas ) . <p> Anyway , since I 'm a watermelon jerky ADDICT , I figured why not make it myself ? <p> Sure , its not going to be as perfect as the Sakara Life jerky but a girl can try , right . <p> Before I share the recipe , so you do n't  think I 'm a total psycho , let me explain the whole concept . here 's how the girls explain their jerky : " the watermelon snack is made with just one ingredient : organic watermelon . We kept it super simple , and this stuff is pure " no added sugar , no wacky chemicals , no artificial anything .

Usually they 're like 5 million dollars , but the one I found is $49.95 , &amp; it works FAB . Ive been dehydrating up a storm . Old bananas ? No problem , slice them &amp; throw them in the dehydrator ! Blueberries , veggies , pumpkin , coconut meat , you name it . <h> G Save space : <p> Yes , the machine itself takes up room , but it shrinks food significantly , allowing you to fit a lot of - preserves into a small area . This is ideal for camping , large families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> G Make bad food obvious : <p> Unlike with canning , which can harbor invisible bacteria , when dried food is compromised you can easily see the mold . <h> G Create versatile results : <p> Not only can you dehydrate fruits , vegetables , herbs , &amp; more , you can eat them dried or rehydrate them for anything from cobblers to pizza sauce . <h> G Are cost effective : <p> Dehydrators are not outrageously expensive and allow you to save the harvest when it 's least expensive . <h> G Create healthy food : <p> Dehydrated fruits and vegetables require no added sugar or salt or preservatives . Plus you get all the fibre of the whole fruit and all the minerals . <p> Eeek ! Let me know what you think when you try it Alexis ! I 'm obsessed I hope you like it too .

I know I 've talked about B12 shots before but recently I posted an Instagram- of my weekly shot &amp; you guys asked me a bunch of questions sohere we go : <p> This site states " B12 is a great energy boosters . It works through the red blood cells , by enabling them to carry oxygen more efficiently . An oxygenated cell is a cell that is at its optimum , full of energy and wo n't tire easily . B12 is also great for the skin . These are just some of the benefits overall , it 's an essential vitamin that the body must have to stay in balance . The only problem is that it is not that easily found in food very few foods are B12 rich and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look for sources elsewhere , in fortified foods , supplements or vitamin B12 shots . Shots are a preferred option because of their direct and immediate absorption into the bloodstream .

With regular B12 injections and a combination of other weight loss regimens , people have reported to lose weight much faster and they attribute it to the shot . " <p> G It boosts energy &amp; delivers an energy booster straight to the bloodstream . <p> G YOU RETAIN ALMOST ALLLLL THE B12 ! ! This sourcestates " none of it gets lost in the digestive process .

Xo <p> So cool that you get weekly B12 shots , I would definitely be interested in doing something like that but I never have . I take a daily B12 slow-release vitamin , but I do n't  think I really feel the added energy , which is probably because my body is n't absorbing all of it , as you mention above .

The only downside of the shots is most of them cyanocobalamin which is the synthetic version . As another poster mentioned , its not easily used by the body . The super downside to it tho is that it has a cyanide molecule attached to it . If you have to get it for health reasons that 's one thing but to voluntarily inject yourself with poision almost every day or bi-weekly is probably not the best idea . Small amounts of cyanide are safe to the body but I would worry about using it multiple times a month . Ps . Be careful with the supplements as well . Make sure you 're getting methylcobalamin !

But the downside is that its been causing a shortage for the people who really do have to inject it . If your doctor does n't  find a big problem with your levels but you still want to try out supplementing , please please use the oral or sublingual forms .

@@3098378 <h> SO I 'VE BEEN TAKING MY VITAMINS LATELY <p> I went through a phase where I did n't take any &amp; then I experimented &amp; then finally , I found some I actually really likeEnter HUM . <p> Firstly , do you blame me for liking these vitamins ? They 're very aesthetically pleasing . Not the kind of vitamins that you want to hide under the sink because they 're crusty looking . You know the type . These- ones happen to be pretty guys ! So pretty , in fact , I wanted to display them in my bathroom . <h> Yes- HUM is cute . It 's youthful . It 's FRESH . <p> Ok enough about the chic packaging : what about the actual vitamins ? <p> Well before we get into it , here 's the thing : vitamins are personal . I , being the human guinea pig that I am , tried these all-natural supplements for a few months &amp; I loved them . So on that note , I 'm simply sharing what 's worked for me . Everyone is different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background you should know that HUM Nutrition 's line of supplements is sustainably sourced &amp; contains NO soy , gluten , GMO 's , artificial colors , or preservatives . Many are organic AND they even have vegan options that are encapsulated in algae instead of gelatin . Kind of on brand for all us TSC readers . <p> Yes all that 's fab but here 's what really got me : their mission is to holistically approach outer-beauty concerns from within . AND they 're all about PREVENTION . Prevention is key is in my opinion when it comes to beauty . But you know this already . <h> Here are some of the standout stars ( in my opinion ) : <p> I 'm all about that glowing skin &amp; fuller hair . These mini packets are easy to throw in a smoothie ( green please ! ) &amp; really step up the hair &amp; nail growth . Plus I 've been feeling extra dewy lately on my face &amp; neck . If you 're in a hurry you can throw this into water with ice ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> No surprise here : when Aunt Flow is in town I can be a real bitch . I took these especially around my period to balance hormones , help relieve PMS symptoms , &amp; rid hormonal breakouts . I mean this is kind of a no brainer in my opinion . This bottle is light purple &amp; just looks so cheeky on my night standNO SHAME . AND HOW CUTE IS THE NAME ? <p> Lastly , this one is most important because after getting my blood tested at Spark Health I found out I am low on Vitamin D. WAIT , before you say it 's because I never go in the sun it 's NOT . It 's actually that I need to absorb more of the vitamin . Did you know Vitamin D can boost elasticity &amp; collagen production in the skin while also reducing the appearance of lines &amp; dark spots ? UMMMM sign me up ! This one I 've been popping daily . Seriously it 's in my purse . AND with this supplement , you can enjoy all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ONE TIP HERE : for Vitamin D to take its full effect make sure you take it with healthy fat . I like to take mine after I eat an avocado or a scoop of raw coconut oil . <p> SO ! Since vitamins are personal , make sure you take a quick 3-minute evaluationbefore choosing what 's right for you . Also , you even get your own personal registered dietitian who will review your data &amp; send you a personal profile and nutrient recommendation . <p> YESSSS . <p> Do your research as always . &amp; if you 're wondering , I found my stash through Sephora. <h> 17 comments Leave a Comment + <p> Your hair in this post !

It has helped my anxiety levels soooo much , so I take two pills a night . I must mention something to you though . I was looking at that " Wing Man " vitamin you 've been taking , and it contains milk thistle . I have read in many places that milk thistle ( and some other detox vitamins/ juice cleanses ) can make your birth control pills not work . It will detox them out of your system . So proceed with caution on anything with milk thistle !

I 'm slowly becoming a vitamin girl I read about HUM in W+G and currently I take their OMG ! , Gut Instinct Probiotic and Daily Cleanse along with SUN Spirulina and Magnesium/Calcium from Trader Joes and Moon Juice Mushroom Protien . I 've noticed a really positive difference in my skin and digestion no more hormonal breakouts and overall my skin just looks brighter , plumper and glowy . The results are subtle and it took a couple weeks to start to notice but I totally agree that supplementation is a great insurance policy against all the other work/$$$ I invest in my beauty/wellness routine . <p> Ill def look into Moody Bird to help with PMS ( such a b ! tch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Also tried your Super Elixir and the collagen powder recipes and really liked both but for me pills are just more convenient and help me keep a consistent routine so I see results . <p> I saw you taking photos for this post on Snapchat and could n't wait for you to share your review ! I am obsessed HUMs Daily Cleanse . I can see such a difference in my skin if I forget to take it for a few days . Thanks for your insight Lauryn ! <p> Moody Bird will be a must try for me ! I 'm always on the hunt for good vitamins that are actually made with quality ingredients . B12 is another one on my list , I 'll have to check if they have a supplement for that ! <p> I am so glad that you did a post on this ! I had heard of them , but was always a little wary of vitamins and if they actually worked . And I always felt like my stomach would do crazy things when I took vitamins from the drug store . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose into working out etc , about HUM and found out she uses them too , so it really pushed me to try them ! I got the Red Carpet ( because my poor hair is so damaged ) , I received them about 2 weeks ago , and Ive already noticed a huge difference in my hair ! Also the nutritionist said to get OMG ! and Gut Instinct , they 've been working miracles , havent noticed a huge different from the OMG ! one yet , but I think that comes with more time . <p> I saw these on your Insta and Snaps and after reading all the reviews I rushed out to try them its been almost 2 months and Ive already noticed my PMS is n't as terrible ( especially the headaches , cramps and breakouts ) and my vitamin D levels are back within the normal range ! I ; m less consistent with their powder but its a nice pre-workout or rotate it into smoothies now that its so hot . These and the magnesium and hang-over cure you recommended have been kinda life-changing . Thanks xoxo

@@3098400 <p> Lemme tell ya , this interview is ON POINT because the investigator of all food investigators , Vani Hari , knows her crap . <p> Literally though . <p> She knows which foods/food brands are CRAP &amp; which food are not CRAP . <p> Anyway , I found interviewing Vani reallllllly informative . Shes done the research on specific restaurant chains/gross brands &amp; calls them on their shady shit . <p> I do n't  know about you but I 'm not a fan of shadiness . Especially when it comes to my food . <p> SO . Ive been an avid reader of Food Babe ever since Vani launched her site&amp; since her book- The Food Babe Way- came out today , I figured it would be perfect timing to get her on TSC . <p> Read on to find out what the hell is in our food ( remember ignorance is not BLISS ! ) : <p> Introduce yourself <p> Vani Hari : My name is Vani Hari . I am the author of my new book The Food Babe Way , passionate food activist and the creator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> VH : FoodBabe.com was born in April 2011 from my years of learning , investigating and researching how to live a healthy lifestyle in this overly processed world . When I first began investigating the food I was eating , I stumbled upon groundbreaking information that changed my choices forever . I really wanted to help my friends and family , so I started to share this information with them . As I began to apply this knowledge , my personal health improved dramatically . I lost over 30 pounds , my skin cleared and I stopped taking the several prescription drugs I was on . My friends and family begged me to start a blog in order to share everything I had uncovered . My first blog investigation was into my favorite yogurt chain . After the CEO responded to my writings by yanking some of the misleading marketing , I got my first taste of what it was like to be an activist . I continued researching and writing about the injustices and corrupt practices of the food industry . Over the past three and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 4 million inspired individuals who are seeking to lead heather lives and rid our food system of deadly ingredients . It is through the help of the entire Food Babe Army ( amazing activist readers ) that the investigations and petitions on FoodBabe.com have been able to force some of the largest food corporations to change , including Kraft , Chick-fil-A , Chipotle , Subway , Anheuser-Busch , &amp; Starbucks . <p> Describe GMOs in simple terms <p> VH : - " Genetically modified organisms " ( GMOs ) are in 90% of our processed food . GMOs are foods biologically manufactured in laboratories " injected with new DNA , viruses , herbicides , insecticides and/or other chemicals " to be resistant to synthetic chemicals and are completely different than hybridizing techniques allowed by nature . These foods have only been in our food supply since 1996 and long-term independent health studies were not conducted before they were approved . The companies that create GMOs want us to believe that they are no different than conventional crops . Yet , GMOs receive patents by the U.S. Patent Office because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over 64 countries around the world require GMOs to be labeled or regulated . The U.S. does not . This is one of the most un-American policies that exist . We have the right to know what 's in our food just like people in countries like China and Russia do " especially when some studies have linked the chemicals used in conjunction with GMOs to a wide variety of diseases like infertility and cancer ( &lt;&lt; more on my GMO post here ) . <p> What 's the biggest misconception about food in general ? <p> VH : - That eating healthy is hard . <h> Eating healthy is a commitment , but it does not have to be difficult . Just like anything in life you have to take it step by step and one day at a time . <p> This is why I wrote The Food Babe Way : - to give readers a day by day approach to breaking free from the hidden toxins in their food . This was the book I wish I had when I initially set out to lose weight , started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how corrupt it has gotten . <p> If you had to eat one food for the rest of your life , what would it be and why ? <p> VH : - That 's easy ! It would definitely be kale . I love kale . <p> What are five healthy snacks that are always in your refrigerator ? <p> Name the top five companies that are the absolute worst when it comes to chemicals ( Call them out ! Call them out ! PLEASE ! ! ) <p> 1 . ) Kraft As an American staple in most houses , Kraft 's iconic products are full of some of the worst food additives ( including all of the sickening 15 I discuss in The Food Babe Way ) . <p> 2 . ) Monsanto Monsanto is one of the companies behind the increased use of pesticides in farming . I always choose organic produce to ensure that the food I am eating has not been doused with a loosely regulated chemical cocktail . <p> 3 . ) Kellogg 's " Their cereals are dead food . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 5 . ) McDonalds- Antibiotic filled meat is just one of the many problems on McDonalds list . Avoid McDonalds if you want to feel and look good . <p> Describe life before Food Babe <p> VH : - I began my food journey , like most people , by following the standard American diet . As a successful management consultant , I was either in the office eating whatever take-out was available , or I was on the road eating every meal out . Although this lifestyle allowed me to fit in with my peers and work crazy hours , it also took a huge toll on my body and I became very i 'll . Over the holiday season over ten years ago , I found myself in a hospital bed . I was sick , overweight , &amp; I was ready to change ! I made health my number one priority from that point forward . <p> Give us a day of eating for you <p> VH : - I wake up and start my day with warm lemon water and cayenne pepper . I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of following this one simple habit . After my lemon water , I have a green juice or a green smoothie . If I have a juice in the morning I make sure to follow it with a more substantial breakfast later . Fruit , coconut milk , chia seeds , &amp;- hempseeds has been a favorite combo of mine recently . <p> For lunch , I usually have a salad and soup . I do n't do snacks that often , but I do have afternoon tea with something sweet " usually some golden berries ( they taste just like sour patch kids ) or a piece of raw chocolate . <p> Before dinner I eat another huge salad with unlimited veggies and a homemade dressing . Making dressing at home is so easy and it will keep you from literally pouring food additives and GMOs over your fresh greens . <p> I try to make dinner as simple as possible . My go-to is a simple piece of grilled fish , broccoli and a sweet potato . Each month I share a months worth of Food Babe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Food Babe Eating Guide . You can learn more about my Eating Guide here . <p> What 's something simple that someone could do to increase their energy level ? <p> VH : - Nix the processed food ! It 's often loaded with sugar and additives that can zap your energy and brainpower . Instead , start each day with a green drink either a green smoothie or green juice made with dark leafy green vegetables . Consuming green drinks is the best way to get a ton of nutrition in your body at once , which naturally gives you a lot of energy . I have several delicious green drink recipes on my website to get you started . <p> Tell us about your book ! Why does everyone need a copy ? <p> VH : - There 's a way to look good and feel great without always needing to be on a diet . The Food Babe Way contains the 21 essential habits that I taught myself to take control of my health . <h> I take someone through the simple changes they can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being exposed to the food system we have today . <p> I share the life changing habits that have allowed me to maintain my weight for over a decade after losing the extra pounds I had been holding onto including how to eat out , travel for work , and snack effectively . <p> After learning to maintain these habits I have never had to diet again , despite the challenging environment we live in with an abundance of tricky marketing and addictive additives in our food that make us eat more than we should . This book is for anyone who is tired of the food industry hijacking their taste buds and wants to take matters into their own hands and become their own food investigator , nutritionist and food activist . <p> We have the power to change our health faster than anyone else and I wrote this book to show people how to do just that . <h> 43 comments Leave a Comment + <p> That 's so awesome that you have Vani on TSC ! !

I totally believe in eating healthy , but my close friend ( who has a phd in chemistry ) gave me a huge lecture about how Food Babe is doing more harm than good and a lot of what she promotes is just completely not true , scientifically speaking . Anyone with any kind of real scientific background is aware of this , but people who do n't  study science ( aka most people ) are easily duped into believing whatever she says . Just eat as healthy as you can and do n't  pay attention to the overhyped nonsense ! ! xx <p> Lane , I agree with you 100% . Food Babe , while her intentions may have started off good , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a huge stigma around GMOs and this is exactly why it is so difficult for researchers to be able to study them properly .

Go to the source . UCbiotech.org is a great resource for those who want to learn more about GMOs , pesticides and etc.Alice @ Honestly Fitness recently posted .. Gift Guide : Valentine 's Day <p> Yes yes yes . I was hoping someone would mention this ! She has no formal education to back up her claims . Which would be sort of okay , except she truly acts like an authority . She rarely provides links or citations for legitimate , peer reviewed , research to back up what she says .

There are endless benefits to name a few : it stabilizes blood sugar , promotes a healthy heart , enhances the sense of fullness &amp; contains a lot of fiber . This delicious- recipe- is adapted from blogger Laury , from- The Fitness Dish- she 's a personal trainer , mom &amp;- certified fitness nutritionist . <p> Like I said : I love oatmeal . In fact , I love it so much I will now take the extra ten minutes &amp; whip up Laurys dish on a weekly basis it needs no artificial sweeteners or added sugars either . Everyone who had a bit of the spicy apple mix approved too . <p> Preheat oven to- 375 degrees. - Peel and dice up an apple- - the smaller the chunks , the faster it will cook- . Place in a baking pan with- cinnamon , a dash of nutmeg , raisins &amp; some water to fill the bottom of the pan.Bake for about 10 minutes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Add rolled oats for 5 to 7 minutes . When finished , combine baked apples , rolled oats &amp; - 2 tablespoons of almond , peanut or soy butter for protein .

What can you do ? <p> This post has been a long time coming because DENIM IS IT RIGHT NOW . <p> here 's the thing about denim : its not overly trendy where you 'll be turned off from it in a year . I prefer to go oversized but you do you here . Some people like their denim a bit tighter . Denim is fun to wear with an oversized hoodie underneath or just over a tee with some HIGH boots . <p> Regardless of how you wear it- EVERYYYYYYONE needs a good denim jacket . <p> Not just saying thisits a necessity . Like if you do n't  have a denim , you need one . Michael even does denim on denim jeans which I love too . <p> If you can , try to get your hands on a vintage Levi moment . If you cant , I gotcha covered- on all ends BECAUSE I have a rich girl/poor girl option ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fashionlush . She has so many good rich girl/poor girl posts ) . <h> I feel like I can really recommend jean jackets because I am a denim snob . <p> It has to be flattering . Some give off an overly boxy vibe I do n't  love . Also it has to be the right shade of denim , you know ? Right now I like LIGHT . There 's something perfect about a buttery , lighter shade of denim . So ya , that 's important . And then lastly , the feel of the denim- its got ta feel good . As for sizing I got a small , usually I go bigger but for a jean jacket a small was perfect . <p> Plot twist for one second : I just found this new mascara ( that I 'm wearing above ) &amp; I LOVE IT SOOOOO MUCH . Its called Better Than Sex by Too Faced . Just had to let you know this side tip because its that good . <p> Ok what else do I need to add this denim list ? Any additions ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Snapping along the way . The New York meet-up was incredible , meeting you guys in person is such a game-changer .

Just sat on my last pair ( fail ) and am having a hard time find ones that are really oversized .

@@3098404 <p> Because typically ( &amp; definitely if you live in San Diego ) , you 're rocking a lil bikini . This means a week or two before I stock my house with super , super clean foods , lots of water , &amp; I really bust ass in the gym . <p> Anyway , getting ready for the Fourth is no joke so here are some prep tips : <p> 1 . ) Kick your workout up a notch . Two weeks before Fourth of July , I start incorporating a lot of squats , push-ups , &amp; ab bikes . Cardio also becomes my bestie . Instead of doing it three to four days a week , I take it up to six days . Boo . I know , I know . Not fun . But hey , you know what 's not fun ? Not feeling your best . <p> In these pictures , I 'm wearing a workout get up that 's perfect for my lifestyle . Why ? Because when Im done working out I want to transition into errands/real life without having to rush home &amp; change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( its super soft &amp; lightweight ) and these black pants are my favorite errand pants . Perf for an errand psycho , like myself . <p> Splits59 just really understands a womans bod . So if you 're in the market for an errand outfit , check them out &amp; thank me later . <p> 2 . ) If you ca n't tone it , spray tan it . I 'm gon na say ittanning makes everything look tighterespecially your abs and ass ( #notsorry ) . So its the perfect pre-fourth errand . I like to spray tan two days before the fourth . And I ALWAYS , I repeat ALWAYS , dry brush before I spray tan . I 'm so obsessed with dry brushing lately that I think my brush has seen me naked more than Michael . <p> 3 . ) Get your work done . This is something I really need to remember . Its no fun answering e-mails on the Fourth of July , so try to get all your work out of the way before the holiday so you relax all day without the stress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead . Just saying . <p> 5 . ) Antioxidants/water/sleep : To look your best take antioxidants a few weeks before , drink as much water as possible ( seriously though , do n't  just say " OMG she 's so annoying about water " actually drink it ! ! The more , the better ) , &amp; SLEEP . Sleep is healing so getting enough sleep before a party/event is really important in my book . <p> &amp; of course , on the Fourth of July , PLEASE do n't  forget tons of SPF , a huge-ass hat , &amp; a really cool pool toy like this huge swan I just boughtLOL . <p> x le <p> P.S. Splits59 is offering a 25% off discount , site wide until 6/30/14 at midnight .

I do n't  have a ton of time ( or money ) for the gym , but I always try to take the stairs , eat healthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can ! <p> Wah love this outfit so chic !

One day I completely forgot about them . <p> Until three weeks ago , when they came back into my life ( thx God ! ) . <p> Fitness guru , - Kayla Itness &amp; The Hills vixen , Kristin Cavallari Instagrammed them &amp; the thought of ankle weights hit me like a bat- out of hell . <p> Oh-M-gee . Lightbulb ! <p> I immediately went on Amazon to buy a pair .

So hellllooo , ankle weights . <p> This source says that ankle weights have several advantages : " extra exercise is provided to the hamstrings , quadriceps and glutes , which have to exert more energy . This can also lead to an increased heart rate over what you normally experience when walking , making for a cardiovascular benefit .

After you 've strengthened up your ankles , feet and calves a bit with the initial walking around with ankle weights , you should consider wearing them without shoes , if you have n't already . In fact , I just wrote a post about the benefit of working out without shoes and how it helps up revisit our bodys natural alignment : LONG ... @ A Lady Goes West recently posted ..

Do you think theyd help with strengthening my muscles for my knees ?

@@3098418 <p> This source explains the whole thing very , VERY clearly : " its a rather old practice , and many younger women may not be aware of what it actually is . <h> Basically , it 's a bath for your vagina . <p> The vagina is always putting out something . During your period , it is obviously blood , but during your fertile time , you will also have discharge that is clear . It is designed to aid the sperm in making their way up the vaginal canal . Even on normal days , the vagina secretes small amounts of discharge . If you have an STD , this discharge may smell or look greenish . However , it is normal to have a small amount of vaginal discharge every day . <p> Douching is a way to essentially stop this discharge . You have a plastic bag full of fluid with a nozzle on the end . You sit on the toilet , insert the nozzle like a tampon , and squeeze the bag . The technical term for this is irrigating the vagina. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemicals and deodorants that make the area smell nice and clean . It depends on your preference which one you use . <p> Although shooting water up your vajayjay may not sound like fun , many women swear by it as a method to control odor . " <p> Eer ? <p> First off , here 's a couple of vintage ads I found online that showcase " internal cleansing . " <p> So proper , back in the day , right . I probably wouldt have fit in very well <p> Let 's go deeper ( maybe deeper is n't the right word for this post ? ) though . Why do women feel the need to douche in the first place ? <p> EASY : to clean out the vagina &amp; prevent odor . <p> Innocent enough . <p> Side note : in my opinion ( again , this is my opinion you do YOU ) , - you should look into consulting a gynecologist if there 's a very strong odor down there . And nothing to be embarrassed about . Gynos have seen it all . LITERALLY . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get the infection nipped in the bud ( HA ! ) . Usually the doctor will prescribe some antibiotics &amp; ODOR BE GONE . <h> So back to douching , is it BAD for you ? <p> Firstly , it can cause infections in the vagina which makes the odor WORSE . <p> Think of it like this : you know how important good bacteria is to your gut right ? ( Remember this ! ! Weve talked about the importance of probiotics . There 's good &amp; bad bacteria ) . You want good bacteria in your vagina like you want the good bacteria in your gut . &amp; when you douche , it sort of sucks all the good/bad bacterial ( flora ) from the V-Jay . Removing all the bacteria is not healthy . According to this source , " the bacteria- that resides there is good for you , and when you wash it away , the vagina is then susceptible to infections that the body would otherwise protect against . " <p> Many studies have even linked douching to cervical cancer . There 's still ongoing research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Summers Eve/Vagasil route either . <p> Listen , I did the whole Summers Eve dance in high school because well , I was in high school &amp; did n't  do the proper research like the care-free , whatevs tenth grader in a Juicy velour tracksuit that I was ( for those of you who do n't  know what SE is , its a body wash that supposedly freshens &amp; cleans your vagina ) . <p> Unrelated to my lady parts haha , I am OBSESSED with ask him and her ! I have a 40 minute commute each day and it just lead me to 40 min of stressful thoughts so I was a real shit show when I arrived at work/ home at night- even if I had great music playing the whole car ride . I already love you and Michael and the podcast is informative and makes me laugh , its been such a blessing to discover . I have to force myself not to listen outside of my commute so I wont run out of episodes as fast . Wish you were cranking them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago by my gyno that unless you have an issue with an STI or something , just leave it alone ! The human body is amazing and is able to regulate itself as needed so there 's no need for any soap or anything going up in there ! Also , harsh soaps that a lot of people use like Irish Spring and Dove ( scented ones ) can strip all that natural bacteria and actually give you a yeast infection ! <p> I love this post , and is honestly such an important topic ! ! I think its crazy how much money and advertising went into ( and probably still does ) promoting douching only to reveal later on that not only is it not necessary , but its also not really even good/healthy for vaginas . I really like the throwback advertisements you included . Thanks for sharing ! xx SaraSara Hadar recently posted .. Weekend Moments : Relax <p> So glad you talked about this ! I hear about douching all the time &amp; I just cringe knowing how bad it is for you . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel like its just an example of sexist thinking &amp; advertising .. Like oh , the way your vagina NATURALLY IS is n't good enough . Ya know ? <p> Ok seriously Every teenage girl needs to know how to wash properly . This is the best post to share with anyone who has a daughter . I 'm so excited to hear about the steaming and I will be running to get it done because I 'm into weird holistic stuff like that lol . So by far this is the best and most informative post Ive seen written so far . What great thing for you to address what no one wants to talk about . You 're Awesome ! <p> Thanks for the topic ! So , it NEVER occurred to me to use these products my mom never had them under the sink , my friends never talked about it . And I always saw them in the grocery aisle &amp; thought they were for odor ( either to cover up a bad order or for some reason you want to smell like a fern meadow ) but something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it to remove the natural little .. uh , " drips " ! Since that area is a lubricated membrane and gravity being what it is I just wear those little Carefree liners and it has never bothered me . One interesting thing , I read the book Waiting to Exhale ( which has 4 black women as the characters if you 've seen the movie , too ) , and it seemed the women were CONSTANTLY using various sprays and things to get ready if the men in their life were coming over . And I think I 've read that its more popular in the black community . But I 've also seen a billion articles by doctors saying they are unnecessary . Honestly if a man was like " you know what , your odor is super offensive to me ! " I would be like " well , let 's just agree to disagree &amp; you can let yourself out . " Ha ! <p> Thank you Lauryn , for putting it out there . I found out early on not to mess around down there , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more thrush , no more " smells " except the one which is all my own , and the men who have been down there are quite happy with it . If there was any issue around that it would be a case of being free to find someone else that " smells " better to them ! By the way , have you heard of the practice of dipping into the v-jay mucus and putting it on natural pulse points as a natural perfume to " attract " men ? I read about it somewhere but have not seen/heard about it since . I wondered how usual or widespread this might be ? <p> Hi , new reader here , and thank you for posting this ! Many years ago , I shattered my femur and wore a full leg cast . When I went potty , I could not wipe back to front because the cast was so high . I had always done so before . For some reason , I forgot WHY we do it that way , so I kept on doing it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not knowing , I gave it to my boyfriend . He was a real jerk about it . Yelling at me that I should douche . I cleaned the vajayjay very good , dammit . I did n't  see the need for one . He kept on pushing it . When we went out with a group of friends , hed ask all the women if they douched . In private , hed say , " See . They douche and so should you . " <p> By the way , I never told him that he should use a bottle brush on his dick . <p> Dr Oz says women have 2 self cleaning body parts . Your eyes and your vagina . If you do n't  believe OZ what can I say . Douching was designed for prostitutes who hmmm had several deposits a day . It was thought to prevent STDs and pregnancy .

I 'm so fussy about this that my husband makes sure there is some kind of way I can " bidet " before he books us into a hotel or weekend escapeie an attachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bidets are common in Europe but still not in SASO . For all the young girls out there yes ! Only douch when the doc tells you too but please learn how to bidet ! ! ! Once you 're used to the clean confident feeling you will wonder how you lived so long not doing it ! Besides , being fresh &amp; confident for some fun with your husband is thrilling too ! =

All of a sudden a dashing , young stud walks in- holding a- faux croc briefcase &amp; wearing a white , crisp collared shirt . Yumso naturally , you give him the once over while thinking heyyyyy hottie. And just as he s pressing the 15th floor button , you start to seriously gag ( like a gnarly , nasty gag ) . Its totally too early for this &amp; all you can think now is : " WTFs that smell ? " <p> &amp; let 's be real , first things first : the bottle is to-die cute . Its this dainty bottle with white ( you guys know I lovvvvve white ) flowers on the cap . Since its so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duh , a spritz of floral mid-day is- kinda- a necessity if you really think about it . <p> Secondly , the scent is crispy &amp; girly , but not 7th-grade , frilly girly ; its more grown-up girly . <p> Love the baseball style top !

I know most people love them , but I feel my lashes look the same when I use Maybellines " The Falsies Volume Express " mascara . With 3D they do get longer , but no volume really , so you just get long stick lashes if you do n't  have dense lashes to begin with .

Castor oil is also known to draw excess oil from your pores . I have been using this mixture on my face for over a year and my lashes are thick but my face is n't hairy . = <p> Yay ! ! !

Details make up the bigger picture . <p> Its kind of like you guys came on my bachelorette party at this point . You just do n't  have a hangover , which is cool . <p> OK SO . <p> Let 's start from the beginning , shall we ? <h> Arrival , HEY HEY : <p> G Location : Airbnb , of course . Airbnb is just the best . Really , I 've used them so many times &amp; every time , its a win . I highly recommend looking into Airbnb as opposed to a hotelfor anything . Parties , weddings , vacationsAirbnb is the way to go . When we arrived at the house , there was a huge basket full of all my favorite things . Literally , they had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included kale chips , champagne , hot pink flamingo floats , &amp; sparkling grapefruit water . Their attention to detail did not go unnoticed &amp; I will DEFINITELY use them again . Ok so you can also book the exact house we stayed in ( also the owner of the house , Jessica , was a gem ) . The house was in perfect condition &amp; I will for SURE be back ! <p> G Private chef : so this is a fun story ! I did a meet up at Whole Foods in LA and I met the sweetest TSC reader named Grecia who also happened to be a private chef AND blogger . Grecia was kind enough to drive up for the night &amp; make me and my friends some of my grandmas favorite dishes . We wanted a touch of The Nanz so she put together an insane- Gruy+re- ( a traditional , creamy , unpasteurized , semi-soft cheese ) - plate with grapes , crackers , &amp; cornishions . The next appetizer was very TSC-ish : super spicy guacamole . Dinner was street tacos with delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog , Salt &amp; Leisure- for the spicy guac recipe . YUM . <h> Next Day&amp; A Little Hungover : <p> G Eight4Nine : MIMOSA HANGOVER BRUNCH of course . AND JUST THE CUTEST RESTAURANT . On brand , so on brand . Hot pink chairs , super white , bright , great drinks , AND they made the best bun-less burger with heaps of jalape+o , avocado , &amp; sweet potato fries . I highly recommend Eight4Nine- if you 're in Palm Springs . They were even nice enough to play Bossanova for us ! ! - This is really the ideal venue for a hangover brunch . You will LOVE . <p> G Manservant : a Manservant is so much yes . Basically , you tell them your type , his duties , &amp; his name ( ours was named SUSAN of course ) . Then he comes over &amp; treats you like a queen . He built my sisters baby swing ( my nephew , Dax was there ! ) , fed me grapes , made skinny margaritas , &amp; gave us foot rubs . He also took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Manservant can also speak French , fan you with a banana leaf , &amp; propose to you in public . Who cares about strippers when you can have this ?

If you have n't tried pesto fries , you have n't lived . I had to find out the hard way guys . Trust me . Try them . My friends were talking about them for days . SO good . F10 Creative Catering was kind enough to come &amp; set up everything in the most beautiful way ! They also come &amp; break it down which is a huge plus . AND they made me prosciutto &amp; melon which I love more than life . Really wanted to bring those St. Tropez vibes to Palm Springs . Anyway , the food was all from Cheekys- &amp; F10 Creative crushed it on the catering . This couldnt have fit the vibe better ! <p> G Green Ribbon Parties : huge thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my friends . If you 're looking for someone to help you plan your party , Nicole is your girl ! She really is in tune with excellent service &amp; a flawless design that COMPLETELY reflects the client ( which I LOVE , ha ! ) . Nicole was a joy to work with while planning my bachelorette party . Highly recommend . Stalk her on Instagram or at Green Ribbon Parties . <p> For champagne , Piper Heidsieck . Again its not too sweet . I am not a sweet person . Personally I prefer dry , crisp , lightnothing heavy . Especially if I 'm outside . Piper is perfection in a chilled glass with some pomegranate seeds . <p> G Suja Juices : you 're not surprised here . Suja has been a favorite sinceI started blogging ? So long ago in fact that I remember trying their juices before they were sold in stores ! Their juices are non-GMO , organic , &amp; cold pressured . Suja is really the best juice ever if you 're hungoveror if you want a mixer . It could go either way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorites . Its a lemon-y , spicy cayenne juice that tastes insane with tequila . Spark ( a strawberry/cherry medley ) is also fun with champagne . We stocked the fridge full &amp; they were gone VERY QUICK . If you 're more of a detox person , check out their charcoal lemonade . I may or may not- have needed 100 of them after all these shenanigans . All the girls drank the charcoal lemonades- ( a natural detoxifier- with activated charcoal ) in the AM to flush the alcohol out . YES PLZ . <h> Its All In The Details , BABY : <p> G Desserts : we kept desserts simple but with a twist ( what 's new here ? ) . Bliss &amp; Baker made the sweetest little boxes with pink and black stickers on them . Inside each box were the most delicious rice crispie treats- with colorful sprinkles . I love this company because everything they do is personalized . From the boxes to the stickers . CUTE . <p> Since we knew there was an outdoor fire pit we stocked up on marshmallows &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made sure the roasting sticks were cute too , LOL . Details ! <p> Anyway , nostalgic desserts , just how I like them . <p> G Table Decor/Random Details : so many of you guys have asked about the white wine glasses . They kind of were the partys claim to fame . <p> So when I was in St. Tropez I found these white goblet glasses &amp; NEEDED- TO HAVE THEM IN MY LIFE . They were gorgeous . I looked all over the Internet . NOTHING . Finally after 204574305 hours of looking , I found some random-ass site that sold 12 of them . Hope that helps . <p> My GF , Erica , made a DIY clothesline with tiny pink clothes pins . She had all the girls bring the sexiest lingerie . From there she hung all the lingerie up across the clothesline . It was SO CUTE and SO easy . It was fun to have out at the pool all week too . <p> This was such a cheeky idea .

Definitely one of the best- online flower delivery services . You know this if you 've read this post featuring my favorite person ever . Basically the stunning flowers arrive to your door in a box . Once removed , they 're fresher than fresh , in a vase , ready to go . The flowers- are the most vibrant colors- EVER . I 'd love fresh BOUQS in my house weeklyjust saying . But who would n't ?

Lastly , - kombucha . Better Booch has a Goodnight Rose flavor that we put by everyones bed .

Sleep ready ! <p> G Snapchat geo filters : for the four-day party we did four geo filters . You can see one of them on my Instagram here . I worked with the talented artist , Kelcey Vossen ( @knicolevossen ) . Kelcey is amazing you guys ( remember her here ? ) .

You are right- it takes maturity to see that you have the power ! ! ! Last year I had to " break up " with a very close friend . I realized that after nine years , she was continuing to put herself in negative situations , and even though I offered all the help in the world throughout our friendship , she continued to make the decision to NOT better herself .

Its sad and I still miss a lot of things about her , but my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . <p> So no , IMO you are not being a brat ! Just keep doin you , girrrrrl ! xoxo <p> I think when you are younger you say yes to everything because you feel like you should or you might hurt somebodys feelings .

It is so relevant to so many aspects in life . I especially have found lately that the power of " no " has made it possible for me to reach my health , fitness , and happiness goals ! Saying " no " to staying out too late and getting the sleep I need , saying " no " to unneccessary calorie splurges and getting the right amounts of nutrients I need , saying " no " to being lazy and getting the exercise ( regularly ! ) that I need ETC !

Maybe that person should learn the power of NO , that 's a little inappropriate .

I 'm hitting that age where saying NO is becoming easier and easier . At this point in my life I know who I am , who my friends are , and what is important to me . So the majority of the time I 'm a YES girl , but it feels good to say NO and not feel guilty about it ! <p> I think the moment you start saying Yes to anything good , you start saying Yes to happiness . And when you say Yes to anything good , you 're saying Yes to more of the same good things coming into your life . Same applies to people . Say Yes to being/making friends with positive people , and you wo n't even have to say No to negative people being in your life , they will just automatically fall out when you focus on the positives that you do want in your life . <p> This post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just said no to a friends daughters Bday party because someone has special plans for my bday . I have always struggled with saying no to people . Thank you for this post , really made my day . <p> Oh I completely agree with you ! Life is to be enjoyed , and why would you waste it on things you do n't  want to do and people who add nothing to it ? Of course that does not include actual responsibilities , and sometimes we should do something we do n't  necessarily want to if it means helping someone out . There are exceptions for everything , but in the whole I agree with you completely ! <p> It can be mega scary to say no to people , events , and things that are n't  really helping you or your life at all , for reasons I still do n't  understand ! I 've had to work on being okay with letting some negative people go and counting on having fewer , better quality friends than a big group of girls who just wanted to bring other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people as or more driven , ambitious , positive , and successful as you are . Its rad to hear that other people are facing the same thing , and obviously coming out on top ! <p> I recently lost a friend of mine , who was pretty well known . I did a friend detox after that . Everyone was so concerned with why she did what she did . I realized its not the quantity , but the quality of the people in your life .

@@3098434 <p> Agave syrup is now sold in stores everywhere &amp; its processed , nasty-ass shit . <p> Do n't  believe me ? <p> Whelp , here 's the unfortunate , oh-so-real , boo hoo facts : <p> According to Food Renegade , " agave nectar is not made from the sap of the yucca or agave plant but from the starch of the giant pineapple-like , root bulb . The principal constituent of the agave root is starch , similar to the starch in corn or rice , and a complex carbohydrate called inulin , which is made up of chains of fructose molecules.Technically a highly indigestible fiber , inulin , which does not taste sweet , comprises about half of the carbohydrate content of agave . <p> The process by which agave glucose and inulin are converted into nectar is similar to the process by which corn starch is converted into HFCS . The agave starch is subject to an enzymatic and chemical process that converts the starch into a fructose-rich syrup " anywhere from 70 percent fructose and higher according to the agave nectar chemical profiles posted on agave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using a highly chemical process with genetically modified enzymes . They are also using caustic acids , clarifiers , filtration chemicals and so forth in the conversion of agave starches into highly refined fructose inulin that is even higher in fructose content than high fructose corn syrup . <p> So there you have it . Agave nectar is not traditional , highly refined , and actually has- more- concentrated fructose than high-fructose corn syrup . It is not a natural sweetener . Thus far , the evidence definitely points toward the conclusion : agave nectar is bad .

None the less that does n't  shape my personality , I was brought up in a small beach town called Newcastle , &amp; enjoy the simpler things in life .

Especially when it peels off in one pull . Like OMG YES ORGASMIC KIND OF YES PLZ . A single sheet style , one pull . <h> ANOTHER plus , is it is silver . <p> Ok so I have a few comments here on the perfect silver color . It brightens your eyes which is fine- especially when you 're like me &amp; leave the mask on for an hour and a half . ( Which is slightly psycho because the directions say to leave it on for 20 minutes . But that 's neither here nor there ) . But it is fun to have super bright eyes &amp; teeth for 75 minutes . You feel like the Tin Man . <p> At $70 bucks its a bit pricey buttttt worth every penny in my opinion . Plus its a cute purple jar that looks chic on a vanity . Its honestly the best mask so I feel like I have to do what I have to do here . <p> As Sephora says : " An instant firming and tightening silver peel off treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treatment is an innovative formula that changes color from white to a brilliant chrome and peels off to leave skin feeling tighter and more lifted .

Pixy is loving her rug on her patio because she does n't  like to get her paws dirty ; #patioprincess . Pixys patio is blocked from the rain so a rug was the natural choice to bring the whole place together . I also added this rad rug to the front of my doorstep outside . <p> More little touches : my sister bought me this gold wind chime for Christmas that sounds so calming &amp; therapeutic ! - Also , when I have friends over its always fun to put Marvin Gaye tunes on outside on a JamBox. &amp; lastly , you can never go wrong with fake flowers ! <p> Stay tuned because I just ordered a hand painted- garden margarita cart to match the small patio table &amp; I cant wait to showcase it on the blog ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suja Juice is doing a free shipping promo on their 3 day fresh start cleanse with promo code : summerfresh Its going on now through Friday .

Its a great eye opener that when you fill your body with junk/ It performs junky . <p> Random girly question : I am looking for a dress to wear for graduation in 2 weeks ! ! = I have looked everywhere but cant find something I LOVE ! What are some of you girls favorite places to shop for something like that ? <p> When you did the workouts were you able to find the how to of each move and how many of each in a set ?

@@3098483 <h> SOM : Playmate of the Year Jayde Nicole <p> Updated : August 19 , 2016 <p> by <p> LAURYN <p> When I met Jayde Nicole at her birthday party last year , I was completely motivated . Let me tell you , her figure is just as toned &amp; fit in person , as you see in the pictures . I am so excited for her to be Marchs Skinnista of the Month . Not only has she been named a Playmate of the Year , she also just launched a healthy-living website , Jayde Nicole Fitness- and was on the hit MTV show " The Hills . " Thanks to Jayde for sharing her skinny secrets ! <p> + Describe your fitness background . <p> I have always been a health &amp; fitness fanatic ! I have been a vegetarian since I was about four years old . No one else in my family was , so as a child my diet was not great . When I turned about twelve I was told by my doctor I was malnourished &amp; anemic . I started reading books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body and what it needed to be completely healthy . Since then I have been a complete health &amp; fitness junkie . I love learning about foods that can make your hair grow , clear up your skin , reduce stress , reduce the chances of cancer . Pretty much anything you need can be done through a proper diet and fitness program . Last year I made it official by becoming a Certified Personl Trainer and Fitness Nutritionist certified by the International Sports and Science Association . <p> + Tell us about your Jayde Nicole fitness products : <p> JNF has an amazing line of supplements ! We carry everything from fat burners , cellulite killers to fat free proteins , cleanses &amp; multi- vitamins . Its a one stop shop for anybody that is trying to loss weight , get in shape , and/or start a healthier life style . There are also all natural &amp; actually work ! <p> + Favorite product from your store ? <p> I take &amp; love all of them ! The most popular supplement is The Supermodel Skinny . The Supermodel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger , - and it promotes weight loss . <p> All my favorite exercises are on my DVD found on her website . I like a workout you can do anywhere . I am not a huge fan of machines and I love to make my muscles multi-task by working several at the same time . <p> + Healthy go-to snack ? <p> I really focus on eating lots of fruits and vegetables &amp; NO fast food or junk , just some dark chocolate for dessert . I also try to only drink green tea &amp; water . I think people drink a lot of their daily calories and that adds to their weigh gain . I make my own healthy 100 calories packs and keep them on hand for when hunger hits . <p> + Motivation to stay in shape ? <p> The beach ! My boyfriend has a nighclub called Pink Kitty in Cabo . I 'm there offen so I have to be in bikini shape year round , it is a big motivation for me . <p> + Natural beauty product recommendation ? <p> Most of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Clarisonic , tone , and use antioxidant vitamin serum . Then I use Eminence Mango Night Cream , a little nighttime eye cream , &amp; then I get as much beauty sleep as possible ! In the morning , I make sure I take my vitamins , eat healthy throughout the day , and drink plenty of water . <p> I admire Jayde for wanting to have a healthier lifestyle , however , she was in my Barrys Bootcamp class a couple months ago and could barely keep up . She never ran , always walked , and had to take a break every 15 minutes outside . I question how fit she really is and if she 's using her newfound title as a way to leave her Playboy image behind to make money . I do n't  think we need another naturally thin " celebrity " endorsing products and saying how hard they work on their bodies and how theyve always been healthy , especially when on The Hills , her diet was never anything but Jager or Tequila . But Lauren , I love your site and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jayde should be anyones role model for fitness . Jamie Eason is that <p> While I respect your opinion , I believe you may be mis-informed . I 'm sure it is n't a surprise to anyone that all reality shows are about editting , and not reality , but even if you would like to stick to that story , The Hills were years ago . I do know Jayde and she often trains whether or not she is under the weather , so perhaps that may have been the case on that particular day . Jayde really does practise what she preaches and regurgitating a single incident may be a little myopic of you . 
@@3098484 <p> First things first : if you read my previous dry brushing post , you 'll remember I 'm enthralled with the lymph system ( I walk around hitting myself daily ) . I find it so interesting because there 's so many different elements &amp; it seems like people forget about their poor , little lymph system . <p> This post- also provided more of an explanation stating : " waking up the lymph system gets rid of excess fluid , bacteria , viruses , and cell waste . The lymphs act as check points along the passways of the vessels . And when they 're working well , we feel strong , healthy , and energized . " <p> &amp; dry brushing stimulates the lymph system . <p> Cool , right ? <p> But wait . <p> Let 's also explore what- Mind Body Green says , " what is the largest organ in the body ? What is one of the most important elimination organs in the body , playing a large role in daily detoxification ? What organ receives a third of all the blood that is circulated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what organ will reflect this with problems ? What organ is the last to receive nutrients in the body , yet the first to shows signs of imbalance or deficiency ? " <p> 1 . Start on dry skin before bathing &amp; work in gentle circular , upward motions , then longer , smoother strokes . You can use an exfoliate too ( I like this one ) . <p> 2 . Always begin at the ankles in upwards movements towards the heart the lymphatic fluid flows through the body towards the heart , so its important that you brush in the same direction . <p> 3 . Your back is the only exception to the preceding rule ; brush from the neck down to the lower back . <p> 4 . After you 've finished with the ankles , move up to the lower legs , thighs , stomach , back and arms . Be cautious of softer and sensitive skin around the chest &amp; breasts , and never brush over inflamed skin , sores , sun-burnt skin , or skin cancer . ( Also : ensure you shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Tip : alternating temperatures in the shower from hot to cold will further invigorate the skin and stimulate blood circulation , bring more blood to the outer layers of the skin . <p> Then follow it up with a slick moisturizer to nourish the skin coconut oil works great ! <p> Anyway , in America , ESP , most peoples circulation needs improvement . <p> Like realllll bad . <p> Many of us sit at desks for hours &amp; hours without enough movement ; circulation is key ! <p> So on that note , start brushing your body , k ? <p> Oh , &amp; have no fear- this is def NOT my last post on the lymph system . I will research this until I 'm dead . <h> 69 comments Leave a Comment + <p> I 'd read somewhere that European girls start drybrushing around 12 when their moms pass this health tid-bit down . Why am I now 36 and just learning this ? ! ? ! I 've also read that dry brushing is like exercise for your skin . It simply makes sense ! And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post ! <p> Yessss ! ! Ive been dry brushing for the past few months after reading that Miranda Kerr swears by it to keep her body smooth and cellulite free . My skin is unbelievable lately ! Its a must in your daily routine and does n't  take long at all . <p> Thanks so much for the info ! I bought a dry brush about a year ago from the Body Shop and the girl knew nothing about it so I still bought it and have yet to use it ! ! I shall dig it out and start brushing ! ! ! ! <p> This sounds like a terrible idea Because I 'm 1000000000% sure I 'll get super addicted and never be able to swim out of dry brushing religiously for the rest of my life . But if it keeps me cellulite-free and keeps my body super smooth , I 'm totally willing to take the risk ! = <p> Thanks for spreading the word . Ive been skin brushing every day for 2 weeks nowand WOWI will testify that everything is that is true . Also its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste . So yes it can help you lose weight . Also my skin looks so freaking incredible I just get compliments from everybody <p> Hi , which dry brush do you specifically use and from where ? There 's so many options . The one from Bliss World ( elemis body detox brush ) did n't  look like the same one you were using so I was curious . Ca n't wait to try this !

@@3098487 <p> So I 've said it before &amp; I 'll say it again : merging two stylesis rather difficult . Especially when Michael legit thinks he s the male version of Martha Stewart ( between us ) . I learned very , VERY quickly to lead the horse to waterbut let him/Martha think he led himself there . <p> You know , let him think like it was HIS idea we were going with the purple rug .. <p> When let 's be real , it was mine . <p> That 's the trick with guys , you let them think its their idea . When its just NOT . <p> There 's nothing I hate more than living in a space that looks like its all from one store . <p> Does that make sense ? I love mixing highs/lows/flea market finds/travel **26;1336;TOOLONG . Putting a home together takes time . Besides going to one store in one day is , wellkind of boring do n't  you think ? <p> A home is a sanctuary &amp; an experience . It should depict who you are so you can feel as comfortable as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . <p> Each section is an experience . <p> So back to the art , the art is from everywhere . Places that are so fucking random that its maybe a bit bizarre . <p> Michael is very difficult to shop for . Impossible , really . I have to get very creative . You know , with like threesome cakes ? Anyway two birthdays ago I found a fourteen year old artist who was a painter . <p> I asked him to paint a black &amp; white cartoon-ish , demon drawing of Pixy . <p> the 14-year-old artist blew me away <p> Basically I wanted a painting of Pixy stabbing Michaels heart with a long black dewclaw- &amp; black blood squirting- everywhere . <p> As you can see , he delivered . <p> Yes , - we are weird . YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED . <p> Anyway the random piece of art ended up being one of our favorites . And it was 160 bucks . Cool , right . <p> Some is sentimental , some pieces are found at flea markets , some from young artists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On Instagram you can find pictures of our black &amp; white wall . HONESTLY this wall was so inexpensive to create guys ! Literally though . I just went on Etsy &amp; Society6 and found some cheap black &amp; white photos and framed them myself at Aaron Brothers . <p> One of my favorite finds is a naked woman from Home Goods . I 've said it before &amp; I 'll say it again : its just so ON vibe . It was 10 dollars but every single time I look at it , I 'm immediately happy . The naked women is just black &amp; plain but pulls the whole living room together . Loveeeee using things like this as paperweights or to add on top of books . Home Goods is just the shit . Especially if you 're styling your home . <p> You cant go wrong . <p> Let 's talk about the furniture for a sec : the furniture around our home is from everywhere . No really , everywhere . We found A LOT of the mid-century furniture at estate sales in Palm Springs . Again , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture shopping . Most of the pieces are unique , which clearly I love ! <p> Also , Julie , my stepmom is VERY talented when it comes to taking an antique piece &amp; making it look fresh . She helped bring a lot of pieces to life . On a similar note , our friend , Courtland , revamped an OLD gothic , vintage vanity for me . We painted it a shiny black &amp; it really is the sexiest piece of furniture we own . I like to keep acrylic- makeup organizers on the vanity &amp; because they 're clear they do n't  take away from the beauty of the piece . Julie &amp; Courtlands contact info is below . <p> his &amp; her bathroom <p> favorite find x light-up table <p> Michael designed our living room table with our best friend , Westin . He- owns the most amazing design company called Westin Mitchell . Together they created a black table that lights up with bulbs INSIDE the table ! Crazy , right ? Its fun to open a bottle of pinot noir , play some Bossanova , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michaels quite the designer apparently ? ) . <p> Clearly I 'm a fan of trays , basic but they sure do the trick when it comes to styling tables . <p> Underneath the table is a purple Turkish rug that completes the whole room . Color is fun when its not overwhelming , you know ? <p> I like all the vibes ! And I love having eclectic pieces from different areas , it does tell a story ! So beautiful !

So , this time around I have come to talk airbrush tansthe good , the bad , &amp; the oh-so-orangey-ugly. - <p> Ive been airbrush tanning people for going on six years now , &amp; I think its safe to say that I 've seen it all . <p> Lucky for you I 've compiled a list , &amp; I want to spill out all my secrets , tips/tricks , &amp; knowledge I have right here , right now . <p> Drum rollGet ready <p> - +- THE 10 GOLDEN RULES for Airbrush Tanning <p> 1 . Choose your location carefully . <p> - Only go somewhere that uses professional airbrush tanning solution . Call up the spa , tanning place , or person you are going to get tanned by , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then google it . Yes , I 'm serious . Google it . If its not a professional solution do not get sprayed by them . A professional solution=golden brown tan , while an un-professional solutions= Oopma Loopma orange . I am extremely picky with the solution I use so I only use Norvell solution in the color Dark . Its perfect every time , on every skin tone . <p> 2 . Schedule . <p> Once you 've found the perfect person to get spray tanned by , schedule the tan in advance . This may seem silly &amp; obvious , but its a crucial part of the success of your tan . A lot of people get spray tanned for an event , right ? Well , depending on the event , and if they have or have not ever gotten spray tanned before , they do n't  know how their skin will react . So , get a pre-event spray tan . I would try it one month before your event , vacation , wedding , or pictures , etcand then monitor yourself each day after you get tanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your skin . On my skin , my tan looks the best 2 days after I get sprayed . Some people like it best the very next day , and some people like it best four days out.you simply wo n't know until you try . <p> 3 . Be a Night owla tan one . <p> Get spray tanned at night . I 'll say it againget spray tanned at night ! I schedule all my clients from eight to ten pm , that way they can get airbrushed and go directly home , hop into bed &amp; let the TiVo binge begin . I do n't  let them : bathe kids , wash dishes , go dancing , get drinks , nothing ! WHY ? This is the only way to prevent water damage . Time , and time again , Ive seen clients leave my house golden brown , then come back two hours later a splotch-fest because their teething 1 year old drooled all over their arm , or the snack lady at their kids soccer game accidentally spilled Gatorade all down their back , or even me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enchilada after getting spray tanned .. I dropped my plate right down the front me I know , I knowI should know better . But , I was hungry ! . You have to allow six to eight hours for your tan to set before getting it wet or it will be uneven . So , eliminate some of your have-tos during the day , &amp; tan at night . <p> 4 . Prepare . <p> Prep your skin by exfoliating &amp; shaving in the shower before you get sprayed . <p> 5 . Naked Skin . <p> Make sure you show up to your appointment with completely clean skin . This means no lotion , no oils , no deodorant , no make-up , no moisturizer , &amp; no perfumenothin , nada , zilche . Get it ? Got it ? Good . <p> 6 . Clothing . <p> Have you thought about what your going to wear , or not wear , while getting airbrushed ? An old swim suit is great , old underwear works , too naked ? Sure , why not ! ? Its up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise . Wear , or not wear , whatever makes you most comfortable . My favorite to get tanned in ( sense I 'm sure your all dying to know ) is little underwearthong or booty shortswith nothing up top . I like having a line that no one , but me , can see . Also , I like my clients to see the immediate difference too . Instant gratification ! <p> 7 . Post Clothing . <p> Bring looser fitting clothes to your appointment for after you get tanned . <p> 8. - Barrier Cream . <p> - Now that you 're prepped and at your appointment , its time to lube up . The tanning technician will have some sort of barrier cream , or lotion , for you to apply liberally to your hand , wrists , feet , &amp; ankles . And by liberally , I mean apply liberally . Remember your nail beds , too , folks . If you 're questioning if you have enough , ask your technician to help out . We do n't  mind ! <p> 9 . Sticky Feet . <p> Pet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their clients with the client standing on a towel , or even nothing at all . DO NOT DO THIS ! The soles of your feet will pick up the tanning solution that has fallen on the towel/floor and your soles will get very dark . You should be wearing something called Sticky Feet . These are little insole shaped sticky pads that stick directly onto your foot , so when you move around while getting tanned , the soles of your feet never come in contact with any solution . If the tanning salon does n't  use Sticky Feet , ask them for two paper towels . This is an easy fix ! Slather the bottom of your feet in lotion then step on the paper towels.theyll stick ! Problem solved . <p> 10 . After care &amp; upkeep . <p> After you 've waited six to eight hours to shower , its important that when you do shower to use mild soaps and stay away from scrubby brushes and exfoliates . When you get out , pat dry and slather up with baby oil or any other heavy moisturizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tan will be prettier &amp; surely last longer . <p> I always see how to prepare for spray tan and the up keep after . So if you 're trying to stay tan after your initail spray tan how often should you go back and get another spray tan . most of the time I start seeing my chest area splotchy and get too scared to spray over because I do n't  want a " tan bulid up " . help ! ? <p> Thank you for this . I just started spray tanning my clients and so far so good . Its hard to find good reviews on solutions and machines . I am trying out Sjolie 9% right now . Pretty brown color but light . Some of my clients are going to want something darker . I will try Norvelle dark . I have read a couple of blogs that said Norvelle turns them orange but Ive read good things as well . Any tips to avoiding Norvelle going orange ? I love their barrier cream . <p> Thanks for the information . This is exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times asking questions and I do n't  want to seem like an idiot calling a fourth . This covered everything . Great article ! megan recently posted .. Spray Tan Tips <p> At the tanning salon I currently spray for we do not use a blocker and have seen fantastic results with out clients . With a few very light sweeps over the hands we loose the glove effect on the hand and see a very nice even tan all the way around . Also using oil type lotions or moisturizers can cause blotchy-ness with some solutions ( such as south dead , used by dancing with the stars ) , but I 'm assuming that all depends on the ingredients and amounts of DHA . Love this entry its super helpful for people who do n't  know what they 're looking for in an airbrush <p> Can I ask all you who work with spraytanning , if people sweat during the night and had a spraytan done earlier during the night , do you have any tips , cos it can get uneven if you sweat at lot while sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night and your tan being uneven . Just get your tan a little earlier in the day to allow it to set before bed . I have been custom airbrushing people for 15 years now . If I only sprayed in the late evening I could never fit in all my clients . Yes you do have to plan ahead to stay dry so get your day organized and then get your tan on ! ! ! Hope that helps . <p> I have been using the same girl for custom spray tan and I like her a lot- shes sort of new to the business , but she uses Norvell which is a great product , however- I find that every time , something is " off " . Either its not dark enough one time , then next time its perfectly dark enough , but the tops of my feet are white , or the inside of my arms near my wrists look splotchy and dark and gross- its like very inconsistent ! I want to keep going to her but I 'm wondering is it HER ? Or am I doing something wrong with prep ?

I 'm addition to local raw honey , I take a nettle tincture . I was n't sure it was really working until I ran out and shit got real . I also use my neti pot daily . It uses a saline solution to wash that pollen crap outta your nose . That plus eye drops seems to make it tolerable . I also make a point to wash sunglasses more often as well as face/hands if I 'm gardening or working out outside . Hope that helps ! This too shall pass ! <p> Nettie pot with distiller water . DO NOT share it with anyone ever and make sure you clean it thoroughly after each use . Its like magic and provides instant relief . Also you can talk to an acupuncturist or herbalist about Chinese herbs like Yu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not verify it works for everyone . <p> My allergies are pretty atrocious this fall as well ( cats and pollen , among others , as well ) . I 've only had success with prescription meds during allergy season , especially since they get so bad all I want to do is get rid of the symptoms so I can get out of bed . <p> Have you tried essential oils as a natural remedy for allergies . My boyfriend is completely off all allergy meds and shots . Just three simple oils worked like MAGIC . instantly . Check out my website and do a little research on the oils ! They will definitely help . I would love to send you some to try <p> I swear by taking heavy doses of Vitamin C throughout the day . Its a natural anti-histamine . I make smoothies with baobab and goji powder and oranges in the morning ( any other high vita-C thing you can think to throw in ) and then throughout the day I take vitamin C ( amazon has these tablets that taste like orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area you live is supposed to help as well . So my smoothies will have some local honey and bee pollen in them . <p> Another thing I always have running in my house is an air purifier . Its made a world of difference with my allergies . Hope you find an end to your suffering ! <p> So as someone who suffers from severe allergies , as in I carry my Auvi-Q ( modern epi-pen ) with me everywhere , I can say the best thing to do is get the test done . There are two types of ways to test of allergies , they can draw copious vials of blood and test each vial or you can do the scratch test on your back . Also being someone who is deathly afraid of needles and pain in general ( like I 'm in pain getting my hair done lol ) , I did the blood test first . Well that was dumb because they used a needle and I almost fainted and the results were inaccurate . So then I did the scratch test , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one happens to be on the back of my neck . The nurse basically told me , " you have ink done ? this is going to be nothing . " It literally felt like nothing , like water on my back ! They use this tiny little poking contraption to deposit possible allergens in your back and wait a couple minutes to measure the results . Its the most accurate test you can do and I highly suggest it ! And honestly , I am such an allergic person that I am allergic to Benadryl .. the best/most natural thing I do to manage my crazzzy allergies is avoidance therapy . Which basically just means staying the heck away from anything I am known to be allergic too . <p> I 've suffered from horrific year-round allergies my whole life , and nothing seems to keep them off for good . I 've taken Zyrtec every day ( sometimes 2 ) for probably almost 10 years now . It seems to help a little bit . I 've also tried numerous prescription nasal sprays and eye drops with varying successes . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , AFRIN IS A LIFE SAVER . Its over the counter and literally amazing . Cleared me up completely in about an hour after literally 2 months of not being able to breathe through my nose . <p> Also , I have heard that cat allergies come from something in their saliva , not their fur . So even hairless cats lick themselves aka have saliva all over them . Yuck . <p> For allergies or sinus headaches , try Loratadine 10mg , cheapest place to buy it is at Target , their brand , in a bottle is about $4 for 30 . If its really bad , you can get the 24hour generic claritin from the pharmacist , after you show your license to proof you 're not a drug dealer =

I 've never thought of adding seeds before , cant wait to try it ! <p> This recipe sounds delish ! I am obviously a huge champs freak , but after spilling it all over my laptop last week , I 'm on a sober streak ! Have you tried La Croix flavored sparkling waters ? They are divine ! !

Just kind of off the beaten path YouTube foundation tutorial . <p> For some reason , I was intrigued . I 'd link the video , but it was so damn random that I do n't  even know where to begin to search for it . <p> Anyway , immediately I bought a bottle in light. <p> Ok so here 's the deal , try it make sure you 're priming you face with a very good primer before application ! ! A primer sets the canvas &amp; makes all the difference in the world . Right now I like Hourglass primer or a good caffeinated sunscreen- ( &lt;&lt; been using this everyday , every second lately because the caffeine tightens my skin BIG TIME- love a quick facelift , LOL ) . <p> Every time I apply this CC Cream I blot it with a beautyblender , my ride or die beauty companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not rub . TRUST ME on this ! It looks more natural . <p> ALSO , I just recently discovered to wet my beautyblender before applying foundation . SUCH a game changer . Try it &amp; be prepared to JUST DIE . <p> The wet beautyblender &amp; CC Cream together make for this dewy , glowy , Snapchat-filter finish that you will become addicted too . To be real , I 'd rather not do my makeup without this CC Cream honestly . Its that good . <p> You should know I apply my caffeinated sunscreen first with beautyblender , then eye brightener concealer- ( if you get this get #2 ) , then CC cream , &amp; then a little powder when I 'm going out ! <p> Hands down the- BEST CC Cream Ive ever tried . I actually do n't  know how I ever lived without it . Its REALLY INSANE for people with hyperpigmentation ( me ! ) AND DID I MENTION there 's 50 SPF in this ! ! ! YES I KNOW . Sounds like it was made for me ? <p> Also , I 've recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me with RAVE reviews ! ! <p> Lastly if you follow along on Instagram you know we 've been on a work/play trip in NYC &amp; LondonAND these products ( again , especially the CC cream ) have saved- my travel , haggard skins ass . <p> I 'm feeling a beauty tutorial ? maybe in the New Year though because this year has been fucking nuts &amp; I very much need to get my ass into gear on these wedding posts . <p> Alright , alright- I 'm off to read . Reading SUCH a good book right now : What Remains : A Memoir of Fate , Friendship , And Love- by Carol- Radziwill- ( she was best friends with- John F. Kennedy Jr . &amp; his wife , Carolyn- Bessette , wife of JFK Jr.s cousin , - Anthony Radziwill , &amp; star of RHONY ) . - Very deep , raw as can be , beautifully written&amp; tragic , all in one . Highly recommend . I started a few days ago &amp; I 'm already on page 542so that should tell you something ? <p> I also just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i ended up looking darker than usual . LOL . But i still love the coverage , the smell and i believe it has a bit of a glitter thing going which gives me the extra glow . <p> What Remains is becoming one of my favorite books ! I am reading it now and I 'm obsessed ! ! If you 're into any AMAZING biographies definitely pick up Rose Kennedys its called , Rose Kennedy : The life and times of a political monarch by Barbara Perry . Such a great read . Also , After Camelot is so good its like reading US Weekly about all the secrets of their past I HIGHLY recommend both ! <p> THIS STUFF IS THE BEST THING THATS EVER ENTERED MY LIFE . You cant get it in Canada yet . So Ive been wanting to get it forever since you started talking about it last year .

It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foundation for day to day things but my skin is on the paler side which makes it uneven and my cheeks are always rosy ( especially during the winter ) this stuff lasts so long and just gives the most beautiful natural , dewy , finish to your skin . I cant thank you enough for the recommendation . Also , for anyone that 's put off by the price , I have been using a travel size one 5x/week for the past three months and I still have some left . <p> OMGGGGGG I have been obsessed with this for a little over a year now . 1 . SPF 50 ! ! ! 2 . Its so light with the coverage I do n't  feel weighted down at all . 3 . Your skin is pure perfection with it on , no need for anything else . 4 . Its cruelty free which is one of my top priorities with skincare and makeup . If i do need a little extra coverage , I mix Bye Bye Undereye with it and blot with my beauty blender over whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! <p> I have to tell you.I just bought this and tried it for the first time over the weekend and absolutely love it ! It just makes your skin look amazing ! I got so many compliments . Thanks for the amazing recommendation , as always <p> I totally have tech neck so I am definitely buying this as we speak , as if Ulta does n't  already get enough of my money haha . I was wondering if you had a suggestion for an all natural daily face sunscreen that is good for combo skin . Texas head and humidity melt my face in the summer . At the end of the work day I look like a grease boxnot cute . I also have fair skin and do n't  want to look like the lady in Theres Something About Mary so I need suggestions . <p> Hi Lauryn , I just got the CC cream and I 'm in LOVE !

@@3098523 <h> Puberty is just annoying &amp; so is toe hair . <p> If you have time to wax your toe hair , well then I 'll just call you #GOALS , but if you 're like every other girl on the planet : thoughts on this ? <p> Unfortunately , with the horrific tiny toe hairs popping up , I have no option here you know ? They got ta go . <p> So for pesky toe hairs , I shave UP towards the heel of my foot . &amp; no , it 's never grown back darker or more coarse . <p> Which by the way , I feel like people just say that . Personally , I 've shaved my whole life &amp; I still do n't see the " darker , thicker hair " people are talking about . Old wives tale ?

Start from the wrist &amp; go up towards the elbow . Afterwards , I throw some of my all-time favorite , coconut oil , on my arms &amp; I 'm good to go . <p> Obviously it 's very important to shave last so the warm water can kind of seep into the skin . I 'm a HOT water girl , which is good for shaving , thank God . HOWEVER , when I end my shower , I turn on the FREEZING cold water to kind of seal my shave . This may sound strange but after a 15-minute shower / dry brush / shave , a good freezing cold minute really finishes it off . <p> As I said , I 've been using BIC- Soleil Shine- lately because I like my razors how- I like my men : STRONG .

You need some to create a balance in your body . Like any supplementtoo much is a bad thing . You are better off just eating healthy foods full of antioxidants instead of taking the easy way out and popping a pill . Just sayin . <p> I was just reading about that recently . I ca n't remember where I was reading this article but they basically concluded that most people should get enough from a healthy diet and there 's a very real risk in overdoing it with the supplements . I 'm sure though that if you do your research , like Lauryn , then you can find a healthy dose of supplements that works for you which also takes into account what you are or are n't getting through diet alone .

@@3098544 <h> The Lowest Calorie Dressing Ever @qwx15350 <p> by <p> LAURYN <p> I rarely am a fan of salad dressings . The markets selection normally consists of too much sodium , an overload of hidden sugars or a dominating taste that ruins the salad . Michaels grandmother , Michiko , passed this recipe along to us , making it nearly impossible not to whip up at least four times a week . Since its so light and refreshing , the taste never gets old . No one wants to eat their calories in dressing ( or in a salad , for that matter ) ; try this super low-calorie concoction- your taste buds &amp; butt will thank you later . <p> Shake up . I use a martini shaker to mix my dressing ! Depending on your taste buds , garlic salt and Italian seasoning could be one , two or three dashes . Mix EVOO , red wine vinegar , half a lemon just the juice , seasoning and garlic salt together ; shake well . This dressing works well on any type of veggies . Pairs well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my salad tonight and it was delicious ! ! However , I know EVOO contains heart healthy fats , but the kind I used tonight had 120 calories per 1 tbsp serving . Did I completely defeat the purpose of the low calorie dressing ? ! <p> I agree with you LIndsay . I was kind of wondering what the point of this article is . The title is " The Lowest Calorie Salad Dressing Ever . " But , 2 Tablespoons of EVOO is 220 calories ! ! ! It is a healthy fat . But , I was searching for a low calorie salad dressing . You can buy many prepackaged organic store bought dressing for that . I occasionally do put EVOO on my salad . But , I hate using up daily calories just for salad dressing . Within the last few years , I lost more than 100 pounds counting calories . I know some people say they do n't  do it . And that is fine , but it is the only weight loss technique that worked for me . When I was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeeze fresh lemon juice on my salad or put a lot of tomatoes in the salad . The juiciness of the tomatoes gives it a salad dressing-like feel and has flavor . Currently , I very rarely use salad dressing and just load up my salad with many veggies and healthy additions like dried cranberries , apple slices , walnuts , etc . These things do contain calories , but at least they are more filling than EVOO . I have also used fresh herbs such as basil , dill and parsley to give it flavor . <p> I count calories too . Its the only thing that works for me . Actually , you really ca n't call this low calorie unless a serving is half a tablespoon . I love the low sodium , but this is not low on calories . Nature of the beast when you 're working with oil . It does sound good , though . <p> Looking into a three day cleanse I ran into your blog/website and I instantly fell in love with it . it is awesome ! You have changed my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information love it ! ! ! How often do update the blog ? <p> I 'm just imagining you with the martini shaker ! We get meyer lemons here but they are prohibitively expensive . I 'll try this but probably with normal ones ! Fiona Maclean recently posted .. 5-2 Diet Tips Part One <p> I love homemade salad dressing ! It changes everything . I bought a huge white bowl just for making fresh salads for lunch with my own dressing . The bowl is big enough I can put just a tad of dressing on and mix it all around . Its delish . I like to mix up the flavors for the olive oil and vinegar sometimes using champagne vinegar , sometimes a dash of walnut oil Its fun to get creative . Thanks for sharing your recipe ! Ill have to try it . <p> I am trying out your low cal dressing as we speak and I would just like to say that I am impressed . I thought I might not like it as I 'm not a huge fan of red wine vinegar , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> I did n't  make it much differently than you . Although I did stir the mix in a glass , used a regular store bought lemon , and I made my own garlic salt by mixing 3 parts salt with 1 part garlic powder . <p> Another stellar recipe ! I 'm so excited to be making my own vs buying pre-made . You are helping me to eat whole foods . I never thought that would be possible for me to pull off . Thanks sooo much Lauryn ! ! 
@@3098546 <p> The girls behind the killer brand , Laura Hall &amp; Gillian Rose Kern- are best friends who had a lemonade stand when they were little &amp; now design the line together ( hence the cute name : For Love &amp; Lemons ) . This interview kinda rocks because- they share the whole evolution of their brand &amp; how it came about . I love the realness . <p> Ok , ready ? <p> Here ya go : <p> Introduce yourselves &amp; your brand <p> Laura Hall : - I 'm originally from Minnesota &amp; I- moved to Wyoming at the age of twelve where I met my partner in crime , Gillian- Rose Kern . Years later , I- traveled off to college &amp;- obtained my- business degree at the University Of Colorado Boulder . After college , I decided- to head off to Australia . I ended up interning- at One Teaspoon . After eight months of falling in love with Australias unique style , I decided it was time to pack up &amp; head home . Ultimately I joined forces with my BFF &amp; travel companion Gillian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised- in Wyoming- and I always- knew I was destined for the fashion industry . I made my- first garment at the age of five &amp; was voted Most Unique Style in high school . I ended up getting my- fashion design degree at FIDM . After completing college , I went to the- land down under &amp; interned for the popular brand Bec &amp; Bridge . <p> After being completely inspired by Australian fashion , I- packed up &amp; headed to Los Angeles . From then on it was history in the making as For Love &amp; Lemons was born <p> Our collection is anything but conventional it rebels against societal standards . The line taunts the customers by creating lustful intrigue . A clash of colors and patterns are evoked by chic separates and devious dresses . <h> For Love &amp; Lemons is a brand to relate to , for that girl that does n't  follow trends , she makes them . <p> The line is flirtatious , fun , and captivating . <p> - How did For Love &amp; Lemons come about ? <p> For Love &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a year ( doing fashion internships ) , we moved back to Jackson Hole , Wyoming &amp; got waitress jobs so we could save up money to start our line . We were making patterns and sewing samples after work . When we completed enough pieces throughout the season we had a fashion show in the ski bar we worked atwhich was mostly guys wearing their ski cloths , but we did n't  care cause we were showing something we worked so hard on . <p> Surprisingly some photos from that reached a couple buyers who inquired about carrying the collection ( we did n't  even pick the name FL&amp;L by that time ) . So it was a slow &amp; steady evolution on how the whole collection became official and we knew it would become our future ! <h> We used to have lemonade stands , so we 'd joke that we have been in business since the lemon days , and we are best friendsso we also do it for the love ! <p> How do you stay healthy while running your own business ? <p> Laura : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " The Wedding Diet . " All jokes aside I have always been an active person , so on the weekends I enjoy hikes and anything outdoors . <p> Gillian : I focus mainly on eating healthy , but recently we hired a yoga instructor to come to our office twice a week too . <p> Quick skinny healthy tip ? <p> Laura : Drinking a liter of so every morning is a great way to wake up . And most mornings I add lemon and cayenne pepper to my water . It also jump starts your metabolism , hydrates you , flushes our toxins in your body , gets your brain going , and my favorite benefit : it- makes you less hungry . 
@@3098547 <p> I recommend adding the whiskey last , after you boil all the other ingredients . Alcohol boils at a much lower temperature than water so if you bring the whole pot to a boil you 'll burn off alot of the alcohol and just be left with whiskey taste . Looks delicious otherwise though ! <p> Its better if you heat the apple juice with a couple of cinnamon siticks already in it . By the time it nears boiling your whole home will smell wonderful . By the way you can easily get away with off brand whiskey . Just remember it needs to be Canadian ( rye ) whiskey . Scotch is bad . Bourbon is awful .

Last year I started asking flight attendants , seeing their tiny bags , and got the best advice about packing light : buy a smaller bag and force yourself to use it , roll up eeeevrything while you pack it , stuff your purse in a bigger personal item bag ( my favorite cheat ) and plan to use hotel laundry . My last trip was 3 weeks and I had only carry on ! <p> OMG ! ! that is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack but .. what if I NEED it ? Oh my ! Interested in letting go of all that neediness and packing lighter too ! Hope this blog post brings lots of good tips and suggestions ! <p> This ! A million times this ! It is my life ! I am the worst overpacker .. especially when I go to the beach . I bring like 12 pairs of shorts ( for a 4 day vacay ) and like 16 tops because what if I want casual versus dressy and then like 10 pairs of shoes . Then we get to the beach and I literally wear a bathingsuit and I 'm lucky to put one of the 4 cover ups on when we go out to eat ! I am definitely in need of a lesson in lightweight packing . <p> I 'm constantly purging my closet and instead of buying trendy things ( which tends to fill up peoples closets ) I buy classic pieces that can be layered like a white button up or a cute flirty flowy tank that i can throw a cardigan over and wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think some spring cleaning is definitely in order ! <p> First of all thank you for blogging in real time ! I love that ! And secondly , I just have to tell you that I went to Europe for 25 days last year with like 6 outfits and ONE PAIR OF BOOTS and I was totally fine ! It almost felt good not to have so many choices , and not to mention lugging it all around . But , I did pitch those boots right when I got home . I could never look at them again lol . <p> I used to be SO bad for overpacking but through a of travelling Ive gotten much better . Mostly because of what you described , I get home and realize I did n't  need half of what I brought . Now its all about bringing things that can be worn in multiple different ways.Jen @ Pretty Little Grub recently posted .. 3 lessons from 3 years of marriage <p> you are going to love it once you go for it and pack light . i travel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and pack only a carry on . there is something so freeing about knowing that everything i need i can pick up and place in an overhead bin . it takes practice and editing , but you can absolutely do it ! kristin W H A T C H recently posted .. LONG RUN : VIETNAM <p> I always overpack . My friends call my giant suitcase " The Body Bag " because you can fit a few people in there . I even been known to bring that bag on weekenders . <p> But I 've tried to cut down recently and I have found that planning outfits around a few key pieces and sticking to them is essential . Bring one jacket and plan all of your outfits to go with it in case you need it , do n't  bring one for every outfit . No need to bring ALL OF THE SHOES when if you just plan ahead you can bring 2 pairs that will go with everything . Bring as few pants a possible and repeat them once or twice . <p> I love having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have to sacrifice that if you want to pack light . <p> Oh girl , I hear you . NOTHING gives me more anxiety than packing ! ! When we moved to SF from NY , I had to deal with the " packers " because my bf was grinding away at his finance joband even them doing it for me made me want to have a nervous breakdown . I love your revelation about minimizing I HAD to with the move and it has been the best thing ever . A " capsule " wardrobe would help with trip packing too but I am really just not able to stick with that lol. xxJill @ Champagne for Everyday recently posted ..

I hope you have a wonderful time and I hope we both find ways to pack lighter ! <p> Hey Lauryn , I think its great that you have a post on this ! Perhaps i will do a similar one on my blog as " how to pack light " . I use to pack heavy but as to your point you never use it all ! My trick is , if i am packing anything i havent used recently why would i use it on the vacation . Seems logical right ? Plus when i travel normally its lots of moving around and forgive me if i am lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not my cup of tea , so then it forces me to pack light ! The other thing , is when i was living in Thailand , i brought bare essentials and then figured if i need something else , i will simply buy it there Happy Traveling ! oxox Annikahttp : //www.fernwehsociety.com <p> I usually pick three pieces and make 2-3 outfits around them . Casual , fancy , and workout shoe . I wear my biggest pieces to the airport ( makes me look cute and keeps me warm in the a.c . ) . I over pack underwear . I take quick drying workout clothes shorts w liner/sports tanks with shelf bra . Travel size toiletries or samples that I can throw away . There are other things but this post will get out of hand.Melissa recently posted .. Home Essentials <p> Totally with you on living lighter !

I need to start using them up before I buy more ! <p> Honestly , the more I travel , the lighter I pack but packing light has really been a process . My first trip to Europe , I was twelve and my mom told me we were each just taking a backpack .

Its only because I HATE checking luggage with a passion . I do n't  like getting to the airport extra early and I 'm always worried they will lose it . So the outcome is even on longggg vacations I pack a carry on . Roll everything , carefully consider shoes , and pick your favorite cleanser cuz you only have a ziplock bag to fill . Best of luck !

Booty Workout in the Park <p> Seriously read " The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up " by Marie Kondo . Its written by this Japanese organizational guru and is a super quick read that 's also insanely inspirational . Maaaaybe two chapters in I went on this purging rampage through my house and I swear my body felt lighter after I got rid of all the stuff I never wear/use . <p> Okay , I do n't  mean to brag or anything BUT I kind of consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a ski trip or somewhere for an extended period of time , I almost ALWAYS only bring a carry on . First off , finding the perfect size carry on is key . I have a Samsonite rolling bag with 4 wheels that is literally the perfect size ( it also has an expander in case of over shopping ! ) . My secret is to pack all the same color scheme that way you can bring a variety of clothes and still have lots of options ! Definitely roll the clothes and utilize every bit of space you have . I will only bring 1-3 pairs of shoes and make sure they are each for very different occasions . Usually I 'll bring my black Steve Madden sneaker wedges , a nice black bootie for going out , and some flats/sneakers , etc. ( clearly I 'm still in winter mode here in New England lol ) All staple pieces . I also will stuff socks/underwear/bras into and around my shoes to save room . The socks/underwear/bras that do n't  fit around the shoes get pushed into ANY open space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toiletries go , I only bring the essentials shampoo , conditioner , face wash , face/body lotion , makeup removing wipes , eye cream . I pack all of my toiletries and makeup and hair care in the flap of the suitcase that shuts closed ( does that make sense ? lol ! ) Boom , bag is packed and then I carry a back pack or some type of bigger bag and put an extra small purse/clutch , electronics , fragile makeup , chargers , etc. in that . I definitely still tend to over pack at times but I think what helps most is sticking with one color scheme . Enjoy the rest of your time in Asia ! ! ! <p> I recently moved and while moving I could n't help but notice how much stuff I had , basically just everywhere , and how much of it I really did not need . So I did a MAJOR purge and let me tell you it is liberating . It is just so much easier to live when you 're not weighed down . Good luck with your purge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted .. CHEERS TO THE WEEKEND <p> 2 ) when i travel i tend to expect that I 'm going to wear repeat outfits so i pack more smaller items like accessories or tank tops so I can layer to change up the look <p> 3 ) I do know what you mean with wanting to purge . My girlfriends always give me skin/bath products as gifts , you get free samples when you buy that type of stuff and then before you know it you have a bucket full of crap you never use . I took all the unused products and gave them to the people at the homeless shelter I work at . Now my skin products drawer in my bathroom are just : coconut oil , one clay face mask , turmeric , rice flour , apple cider vinegar , sunscreen and a bar of soap <p> I 've done a fair share of traveling myself , through Thailand as well as Europe ..

Once I was in Thailand , I pretty much wore elephant pants and my swimsuit the whole time anyways ! Plus a few cute dresses , obvi !

But , its hard when I follow such fun blogs , and want to keep up with latest trends .. Constant struggle to find that moderation ! But , its good to reflect on it , and to purge and donate ! Good luck ! <p> This post pretty much sums me up ! I will always overpack , and the worst part is , I feel like I 'm packing lightly but its still ten times more than everyone else brings .

The metallic blue brush goes right through my hair in one swipe , even if its a huge rats nest . AND ! ! ! It does n't  pull my hair out . A real life-changer : <p> 3. - Moroccanoil : this scent is amaze ! I use a dab of this when I get out of the shower &amp; a dab after my hair is dry . <p> 4. - Biolage Hair Sunscreen : yeeeeuppp- protecting your hair for the sun should be done daily . I spray two or three sprays of this hair sunscreen on my hair- every- morning . Oh , &amp; it smells like coconuts . <p> I loooove these tips ! Now I 'm going to have to spend all of my money and buy the products you love . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusting , but I swear that not washing my hair is the reason that it has n't  fallen out with all of the bleaching and heat it goes through . Dry shampoo and conditioner are what save me . <p> Lauryn ! ! ! ! ! I 'm so glad that you blogged about your amazing hair ! I put my hair through so much abuse this year that I just had to chop 5 inches off : ( I will definitely be following your hair guidelines ; ) I love coconut oil , but never thought to use it as a hair masque ! Ca n't wait to try that .. You have gorgeous hair , thank you for sharing : ) : ) xoxo <p> We are similar on a lot of the hair care tricks ! However , I bought the tresemme dry and loved it but after about the 4th time I used it the nozzle clogged , even with all my shaking it , and I cant use it Do you have that problem ? Its the only brand I 've found that does that . Makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me all the time , just take the sprayer nossle off and run it under hot water for a minute or two and itll unclog . It just gets stopped up from the shaking and spraying at different angles . Love that stuff , its definitely the best dry shampoo for the price ! <p> mmm . I do coconut oil masks and leave it on for the whole night with a shower cap . Its not a pretty site , but does wonders on my brittle ends ! I also use it on my skin at night- works wonders at preventing wrinkles <p> Who washes there hair anyways ? I did today and I hate how it looks right after it is washed . Now that they sell dry conditioner , people really will just stop washing there hair all together . <p> Other tips : only wash the scalp ( its all you need to clean your hair ) . I also use one of those claw looking head massagers at night , scalp stimulation promotes hair growth so give yourself a head massage or better- make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insty Love @Fashionlushxx <p> great ! I know what you mean about no washing it , fresh hair is soft and flat so hard to do anything with it ! If you like the dry shampoo would recommend volume powder ! ! That means you can wash it but than you put this shit on and its dirty again ! perfect ! Oh and Moroccan oil is good but its pure argan oil so buy that instead as much cheaper ! ! ! You can also use almond oil ! I put mine in a bun , rub that in , leave over the night and wash in the morning ( u can put a towel on your pillow to protect it ) ! Justina recently posted .. Wear it off shoulder <p> I got my hair cut today , and they were actually commenting on how soft my hair is , even though I colour/bleach it all the time .

Overusing sulfate shampoos also causes oily hair , because they are so drying your hair overproduces oil to compensate . I use a lighter , watery conditioner to wash my scalp and scrub the strands squeaky clean lol , a cheap brand like vo5 is fine . Then I use a thicker nicer conditioner from mid length of my hair to ends , comb out with a wide tooth comb , and rinse in cool water . Then I apply product after shower while its still damp .

I moved to Chicago from Ottumwa , Iowa last year &amp; it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the balance of healthy food , finding love for fitness , &amp; maintaining a healthy social life . You will also see some of my personal thoughts in a blog post every now &amp; then , a bit of fashion , &amp; occasionally a post on my passion for art . <p> + Inspiration to start blogging ? - <p> TM : - I posted my before &amp; after picture on Spark People- about three years ago ; my inbox filled up with over a hundred messages in five days asking numerous questions . I had messages from all kinds of people telling me how inspired they were &amp; that they needed the motivation to keep going . I thought if I could make a small difference in peoples lives through my accomplishments , then more people would be passionate &amp; serious about health . <p> I failed at the healthy lifestyle over &amp; over again , so I was constantly looking for motivation . That 's why I started my blog . To put my story up . Honestly I did n't  think it would get popular . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boyfriend until last summer . I had people I grew up with messaging me , so I finally decided to be more open about it . <p> + Advice for new bloggers ? <p> TM : - I wish I could have read some advice before becoming a blogger , but I just took a jump at it without reading the warning sign . Blogging is an amazing hobby to pursue ; it can eventually become a career if you are passionate enough about it . It allows you to express anything &amp; everything without having to fight your boss to get content published . <p> Things you should never do as a blogger : read things that you know will make you mad hate comments , emails , etc. and post anything you would n't want someone to see . I have tons of horrible comments &amp;/or mail but I have to remember not to take it personal or let it bother me . Write what you want &amp; do n't  let the fear of bad comments/rude people hold you back . You may have two bad comments but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> If you want to become a successful blogger I 'd recommend finding what you are passionate about , use that as the base of your blog , &amp; branch out with other topics you 're interested in . Partner up with other bloggers &amp; host on each others blogs to grab their audience while sharing yours . Use social media sites to get your story out there . It took me about a year to get the hang of blogging &amp; to organize my site . <p> Honestly , I 'm still trying to figure out the whole blogging world . Do n't  be intimidating by a beautiful blog- its all about the content . <p> + Love it ! Let 's talk quick skinny tips &amp;/or tricks ? <p> TM : - Stay busy . Never skip meals . The more you have to do the less you worry about snacking &amp; eating giant meals . Find little ways to be on your feet sixty percent of you day : cleaning , mall-walking , cooking , walking your dog , folding laundry , etc . Do n't  let your friends &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a restaurant , &amp; all your friends order pizza do n't  be embarrassed to order a salad . That 's the willpower they would kill to have ! <p> Also , treat yourself daily with a small dessert so you do n't  end up depriving yourself . Oh ! And dressings/sauces on the side ! <p> + Weekly workout schedule ? <p> TM : - I try to balance my workouts through out the week with cardio &amp; strength training . Sometimes I 'm too lazy to work out so I do little things to make up for it like mall-walking or golfing . I try to run at least four to six miles at least four times a week , yoga twice a week , &amp; maybe Zumba twice a week . If I 'm bored - I 'll do a fun , ten minute , YouTube workout video . Fitness has to be fun &amp; different or I 'll never find the motivation to do it ! <p> + Favie go-to healthy food ? <p> TM : - Soup &amp; salad . I try to order soup with a salad from every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutritious . My favorite places for soup and salad are : Olive Garden , Panera Bread , &amp;/or Potbelly and Charlottes . <p> + Cocktail of choice ? <p> TM : - I may be twenty-one , but I 'm not much of a drinker . My drinking/party days ended senior year of high school . I have had maybe four drink since being twenty-one , which some people may call sad but I 'm perfectly fine with it . I would n't say I have a favorite cocktail but if I 'm going to have a drink its usually vodka with vanilla diet or a Baileys . <p> + Motivation to stay in shape ? <p> TM : - Staying in shape makes me feel confident and happy , which is a great motivation to keep moving forward . I also want a healthy body &amp; do n't  want to be at risk for any diseases that come along with an unhealthy weight/bad eating habits . <p> TM : - For hair : I mix up 1/2 cup full fat mayo , 2 tablespoons of olive oil , &amp; three eggs . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a plastic bag for three hours . This moisturizes your hair &amp; builds protein . For skin : I make my own mask with three tablespoons of smashed avocado , one tablespoon of lemon peal , three tablespoons of oats , two tablespoons of mashed cucumber without peel , &amp; three tablespoons of sea salt . I leave it on for twenty minutes &amp; then rinse with warm water . <p> + Quick , easy recipe ? <p> TM : - Breakfast is one of the most important meals of the day ! here 's a fast recipe that 's perfect for the days you 're running out the door ! <p> I love her ! ! Her blog is amazing and I 'm constantly sharing it with people , I cant imagine anyone saying anything bad about/to her , but jealousy can make people turn ugly !

I did n't  want to go on it for religious reasons Thennnn I found out I have this lovely thing called PCOS . Which of course taking BC is n't , and should n't be the answer Hormones are n't  pumping throughout my body in a natural way . And BC are just synthetic So until someone solves this and finds an actual cure/solution to my issue I suppose that I 'm on BC until I 'm ready to start TTC ( scary thought ) . <p> Hi Samantha , I saw your comment here and I too have been diagnosed with PCOS . I started on birth control when I was 16 , just for the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 pounds in 3 months and I was miserable . I went on and of the pill for a couple of years . Then , in college my doctor decided to try me on a different pill to help regulate my hormones and give me regular cycles . The short of that experience is , I bled non-stop for the 3 months I was on the pill . <p> I have found that a low carb diet has done more for me than any of the hormones or medications my doctors have ever put me on . For the first time in a long time , my cycle is regular , I am at a good weight , and THANK GOD I 'm not bleeding continually . I have done a lot of reading on the topic and diet really has a great effect on everything in you body . Maybe try going low-carb , it changed my life ! <p> Thx . Love advice . I am wondering what I want my girls to do when they are teens . Sadly I lean twds .. No pill nowadays . .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pill .. And any big pharma.jizz irritate me .

And def teach my girls to use that . <p> Couple of quick things because I overall enjoy reading this blog and I 'm inspired by recipes etcbut wanted to comment on this post because I feel like a lot of young girls that read your material could use a little extra information . <p> The BCP is of course not for everyone out there . Second of all , it can get expensive . Third , it is user dependent . Forget to take the pill and you can get pregnant . <p> By far , the IUD ( intrauterine device which delivers local hormones-not systemic which causes the brown spots you talk about ) is by far the best form of BC I have come across . That said , I did go to medical school and EVERYONE who was female or their partner had an IUD in- this was now 5 years ago . I have heard of only 2 cases ( one female physician in my class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth to healthy kids ) while the IUD was in place . That said , it is overall one of the best methods out there such as the pill . It is WAY more common to get pregnant on the pill . <p> That said , I have had the IUD for a long time . It hurts to have put in ( ow , not going to lie ) but it has been wonderful . Once you leave the office , you can have sex and are protected . Likewise , once you take it out , you can get pregnant immediately . Lighter periods ( 7 days to 3 ) and the cost is much better than the pill . Also , people do n't  realize that when they have diarrhea one evening from food poisoning etc , this could impact your BCP effectiveness . Hence why the IUD eliminates user error . You can go on a 3 week vacation and not even think about it ! <p> Those are my 2 cents and I hope it helps someone out there . Get Mirena ( not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who uses numbing medicine . I have met male physicians who do not use it , and let me tell you- I would n't go for that at all . The biggest problem is when the IUD is not placed correctly and do it with someone who has one themselves . <p> Hi Sophia . Glad it was informative . It is just information . You should decide what is best for you of course ! An IUD might work great for you or it might not . Same with the pill . My biggest suggestion is to always try different things- including doctors- and figure out what the best fit for you is . If you do n't  like one doctor , go to another for a consult . I find it funny that people just go to one physician without shopping around a little . For example , I personally will only go to this one OBGYN who I know puts in 100s of IUDs . You can ask her if she has ever had a patient with a problem . Personally , I got back acne when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell if it was from the IUD or just aging etc . The biggest issue I have heard was having inexperienced people put the IUD in . Yes , it will hurt a lot especially if you have never had a child . This is because the cervix must be dilated to implant the IUD . The strings hang out of the cervix . The person who places the IUD can impact its effectiveness . Taking out the IUD is n't painful . Another note on peoples comments about " feeling " the IUD . This is wrong . What the boyfriend is " feeling " is the strings to the IUD that are sharp or are cut weird ( my hubby will tell me he feels them , and I just reach in and move them around-voila ! ) . I also had mine cut shorter so it does n't  wrap around things , but long enough so I can check it is in place . This is one thing girls do n't  think about- I know its gross , but take a glove if you want and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strings- it should be working A-ok . If you do n't  feel the strings- it could have gotten lost- or traveled up the cervix into the uterus which is a very bad thing- it could cause you to become infertile worst case scenario . <p> That said ( probably too much TMI anyway ) , I would personally recommend an IUD as well as condoms to my daughter on her way out to college . This is for two reasons : IUD=protects from pregnancy and condoms prevent HPV and herpes etc . HPV ( and cervical cancer ) is worse than herpes , but herpes will HURT badly in many cases . Note that most people will not ever show signs of HPV or Herpes so be careful and protect yourself ! If you have a partner tell you they are " clean of STDs and do n't  want to use a condom " remember that we only test for gonorrhea or chlamydia etc . We do n't  ever check for herpes or hpv ( unless you have an outbreak of some sort ) . You ca n't check for HPV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the time they wo n't know they have it either . <p> That said , I 'd much rather have gonorrhea or chlamydia because they are treatable with antibiotics than have a strain of HPV that causes cancer ( go vaccinate yourself asap if you have n't ! ) Remind yourself that you are worth it always ! No guy is worth your health = Also , my last gem of information is do n't  ever give/have oral sex with someone with mouth sores . This seems obvious , but if they have oral herpes , they can transfer it to your genitals ( ew , gross , yes , I know I went there , but thank me later in life ) . I had a patient come in and I was like , yah , you should have not done that oh well . Life goes on . <p> Of course , if you are in a very trusting LTR , that is different of course with condoms etc , but health is priceless . <p> OK- hopefully this has been informative ! Sorry for the book of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good info and have a healthy , happy life ! ! = <p> I 've used the pill for 9 years , I started on Desogen which cured me of my awful acne . I stayed on that and its generic version Orthocept til recently . I did n't  experience weight gain and have nothing but positive things to say . I have clear skin , no cramps , minimal bloating and short , light periods . My doctor switched me to Chanteal but that one gave me awful pms ( lots of crying ) then Microgestin ( cystic acne side effect ) and then finally I was put on Reclipsen which is another version of my favorite Desogen . You just have to find what works for you . My sister had the IUD put in and it actually fell out , now she suffers from two periods a month and is on the pill . I use an app on my phone that reminds me to take my pill daily . I have had friends tell me their pill gives them constant yeast infections or causes weight gain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 2011 <p> When I was in high school I used the nuva ring It was gross though , so I switched to the pill . Funny thing is , I got a sinus infection and took antibiotics I did n't  realize that they cancel out the pill . That 's how baby #1 came to be . Five months after I had baby #1 , I was breast feeding and on the super low dose pill . I felt odd Took a test , and vwala Baby #2 was on his way . After that I chose the IUD . I swear to you Every single horrible side effect that they say is like a one in 100 chance of getting ( other than getting pregnant ) I got . I was extremely depressed , I was gaining weight but barely eating , I ended up in the hospital with rupturing ovarian cysts . So I told the ER doc I wanted the damn thing out . She said she did n't  feel qualified to do it , and that I 'd need to see my OB . I said screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing out . Monday I followed up with my dr , and she said that unfortunately the side effects wont go away right away . My depression is gone , and I 'm currently losing weight But I 'm still having pain from the cysts . Its been 2 months , and after all the mishaps I 've had with BC I think we will stick with condoms ! Goodluck though , this is a sticky topic for everyone ! <p> Thanks for sharing ! I did the pill for a while , but I ended up not liking the side effects and the thought of ingesting a drug on a daily basis . I also want to be able to get pregnant whenever I decide to do so ( without have to get something out of my system ) . I support each womans personal choice , but for me I use condoms and my long-term partner is fine with it . That 's my choice for now <p> My gyno told me that I have a higher chance of getting pregnant once I stop taking birth control for the first few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said when you 're ready to have children start taking prenatal vitamins a few months before going off of the pill . <p> I too gained a lot of weight from the pill in the past and also went on an emotional rollercoaster on some pills , but also switched to a very low dose option , which has been much better in my experience ! <p> This is a very common thing for physicians to say . let me just say this ( my doctor told me this but asked me not to share ) . it can take MONTHS or even years depending on how long you have been on the pill to get pregnant . ( eg. for me with my son straight away , then with our second- 8 months ) and i was only taking the pill for a year . Pre natals are expensive and can cost up to $50.00 for 3 months . If you are actively " trying " take the prenatals if you must for the two week wait ( the two weeks between when you ovulate and hopefully find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get pregnant and if you eat a healthy enough diet you will already have all of the vitamins in your system anyway . Trying is stressful enough , trust me lol . <p> I took the pill for 7+ years and never had any problems . When I was ready for a ba y , I just did n't  refill my prescription and stopped taking it . I got pregnant 2 weeks later . ( I know that is n't how it works for everyone . ) <p> After giving birth , and of course when I was done breast feeding , I had the Mirena IUD placed . It hurt , but was not intolerable . The doctor told me I would bleed anywhere from 2 week to 3 months time , and you better believe I bled every single bit of 3 months . ( Which was annoying to me because I had just finished bleeding from giving birth a few months before that . ) The Mirena IUD was nice and very convenient , but I have " a very small cervix " according to my doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes it even poked him pretty hard . I figured it would just be something we needed to get used to . <p> A few months after it was placed , ( approx. 6 months ) I started to notice I was getting two full periods a month . After 3 months in a row with no change , I went to have it checked and it had moved . The doctor told me my cervix was probably just too small which caused it to not stay in place . I had to have it removed at that very same visit ( which hurt worse than putting it in ) and came with a hefty $200 bill of what the insurance did n't  cover . Boo ! <p> So , now I am on the Nuva Ring . I have been on it for 3 months now and I love it ! I do n't  have to remember to put it in every day , which is great ! I put it in on a Monday , using a tampon applicator . Then I set an alarm in the calendar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When my alarm goes off , I pull out the ring and throw it away . I get my period on Wednesday and on Monday I put a new one In . My period stops within a few hours ( which is already very light by this point , and you are able to wear a tampon with the ring in you just have to be careful to not pull it out when you remove the tampon . ) In 3 weeks the process starts over ! Pretty easy if you ask me ! <p> I have n't tried the Depo shot or the implant because , well , why put a needle in your arm if you do n't  have to ! Haha I hate needles ! However , my sisters both do the Depo shot and seem to love it . <p> My experience with BC has been a little crazy . I went on the pill when I went to college and after the first 3 months ( the amount of time it takes for your body to fully adjust to the meds ) I got super depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said this was from the BC so I switched to a low estrogen bc pill and loved it and was back to my happy self . No weight gain , no side effects or anything . Then I stopped taking it last February because I was living in London for a semester abroad and it was really hard to get over there . I was fine until May when i got home I started getting terrible break outs . ( Quick side note , I am so lucky because I have had great skin my whole life and only ever get a small pimple every once in a while around my period , so clearly something was wrong ) It turns out that because I stopped taking my BC my hormones went crazy and after 3 months of not having it my face broke out . I went back on and my face started to clear up in just 4 days and now it is fine again . Bottom line , I 'll be sticking to this pill for a while . <p> Just a warning if you ever stop taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I knew this so I could have done something to prevent the breakouts ! I personally think the pill is the best way to go , it is so easy , and I take vitamins ( i just started Magnesium thanks to you Lauryn ) every day anyway so one extra pill is no biggie ! <p> It is not my habit to leave comments but I care about this subject because it takes me a very long time to find what works the best for me an I had a lot of issues with BC pills . <p> I was afraid of UID because of pain ( yeah , I 'm a sissy ) so the doctor advise me to take a vaginal ring . I never heard about it but its a great alternative to the UID , its only local hormones ( I did n't  like the fact that pills sent " fake messages " to my brain ) and I only think about it every 3 weeks . Very easy to use . <p> Here is my small contribution ! Wish you a very nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My OBGYN put me on the pill due to fibroids which were causing heavy bleeding during periods and anemia . I was also put on iron pills . The first month i started on the pill ( July , last month ) i had 2 periods both were 7 day periods but a much lighter flow than before the pill . My question is should i have started a new pill pack when i started the 2nd period that month ? The 2nd period was 7 days after i ended the 1st period . Also , since starting the pill Ive been having hot flashes at night and in morning after i drink coffee or take a warm shower . I 'm 46 so I 'm wondering if the pill has kicked in mentapause ! ! ! It sucks getting old ! ! ! ! <p> I have tried shots and pills and even the weird ring that does n't  stay in place in my vagina . I loved the freedom of the shot . Especially the point in my life in college when it caused me to not have a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems healthy to not have a period for 2 years . It was awesome though . And yes it really helped my acnewhich at age 38 I still have a problem with and still see a dermatologist-icky . <p> The worst result of bc was my bilateral pulmonary embolisms ( blood clots in my lungs ) . I almost diedit feels like you certainly will . I spent 3 days in the hospital on pain killers and heparin by IV . And then I had blood thinners by shots and by pill for a year afterlovely . I do n't  smoke I weighed 135 lbs and I 'm 56 ? so not overweight . I exercised regularly and after 3-4 years of testing I have no blood condition . However on the other hand this does n't  happen to everyone so something undetectable must be different about my blood . I was 32 when this happened . My current partner has a vasectomy . That works out nicely for us . If ever that changes I will need to do condoms . Never again not any hormones for me and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the therapy of choice for cancer , menopause , I 'm sure other stuff that I do n't  know aboutbut for some reason ? ? BC are n't  my friends . <p> I never had a baby when I was on them and I have two beautiful kids that I intended to have when I stopped taking them at 26 took me two years ( age 28 ) to have baby one and 30 took me a few months to have baby two . With baby one I was on the depo shot and I guess it took a couple of years before my periods were back to regular and able to conceive and with baby two I was on some kind of pill . I 'm not sure what to suggest to my girl when she grows up . Our blood may not allow her to take bc forever . I took them for 12 years before there was a very serious problem . <p> I was on the pill for 3 years and then I stopped because I wanted my body to be .. well in its natural state I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since even with a lot of exercise and healthy eating those last few pounds did n't  seem to come off . So this is what happened : I went off and my body just went crazy . I gained 6 pounds almost immediately , got migraines and I am extremely emotional all the time ( like crying after seeing cat videos on youtube .. ) . Oh and my period which was almost nonexistent on the pill lasts now for 6-7 days . So that 's to natural body hormones . Everything has its pros and cons but for me the cons of taking the pill are definitely easier to handle than those of natural hormones . I will probably go back on the pill in the sometime in the next few months . <p> Thank you for being so open with this topic ! Personally , the pill did n't  work for me . I was a raging b all the time and cried at the drop of a hat ( no matter what dosage my doc put me on ) . So I stopped taking it . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pill and a few that need it to help regulate their periods . I 'm 31 now , and while I 'm not actively trying to get preg , I figure at my age , if I get pregnant with my boyfriend , itll be a blessing . <p> Having been on BC for 7 years straight I stopped because I started to get really bad mood swings and completely lost my libido and wondered whether BC affected either . Turns out it did My mood swings decreased quickly , until I decided to start again ( different pill , less hormones as possible ) after which they were back within the week . I got an IUD ( mirena ) , but this had the same effect . <p> After my boyfriend at the time and I broke up I decided to get rid of it all . The mood swings were gone quickly , but it took ages before my libido was back and over TWO YEARS before my hormones functioned properly again and I got a regular period ( had one that lasted nearly 3 weeks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter shows how much impact it can have on your body , and something I never realised while I was on it . Im convinced that , at least for me , it has more impact than we think it has and would never ever consider the pill again . <p> As im in a relationship again I got a copper coil fitted . No hormones , I do n't  have to think about anything anymore , I 'm good for 10 years and even though my period was a bit heavier in the beginning it now actually seems to have decreased ! Marijn recently posted .. Hello August <p> I never wanted to take the pill but gave in at 25 for the obvious reasons . I wanted to take it for 5 years max and i 'm way beyond that now and it bothers me . I had no sideeffects but i find my libido is dwindling . As you , Lauryn , I have the lowest of the low and would not take anything stronger . <p> I 'm so forgetful that I knew going on the pill would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gyno about every option available , I set my sights on the NuvaRing . Two of my sisters have been on it before , and one of them hated it and the other liked it . I personally love the ease of simply inserting it like a tampon and forgetting about it for three weeks ! I never feel it ( unless I want to stick a finger up there ) and its shortened my periods . <p> I was on the pill for over 15 years with very little break . I first went on the pill to treat acne as a teen and it did the job . I was on Dianne ( not sure if that 's what its called outside of Aus ) which is a really old fashioned one and probably has the worst side effects . I was fine on it but every time I tried to come off of it I would get serious acne . As I entered my 30s I just did n't  want it in my system . I read more and more awful things about it . I really wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided on my 34th birthday that I wanted to just suck it up and stop taking it even if my acne returned , which it did . But I wanted to have kids one day and my age was already a disadvantage so did n't  want to create more issues . I was lucky that my period returned straight away . So many stories of women waiting a year for their period to get back to normal . BUT I have spent a year now dealing with adult acne . I mean serious acne , not a few spots ! Its pretty awful to go on dates at my age and have to worry about them touching my face because of my acne ! Anyhoo after trying everything imaginable its now starting to disappear and there is light at end of tunnel . I get that for some people find it the best option for birth control but just remember it was never intended for women to stay on it as long as we do . With women having children later in life they are on the pill for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different stage of my life then many of your readers , I do n't  think falling pregnant is a huge concern of mine so I get that its necessary . All I am saying is have a break every so often ! Lyn recently posted .. Fuck Logic " How to Follow your heart even when it sounds crazy ! <p> It took my body an ENTIRE YEAR after getting of BC to get it fully out of my system and I 'm still not totally back to normal . I was on it since HS too ( so almost 10 years ) and decided to go off of it after my wedding to give my body some time to adjust . Well 12 months and a lot of tears later , I 'm finally getting my hormones to regulate on their own . The issue with BC is that its synthetic so your body forgets how to make hormones on its own . If you can consider other options please do , its not worth the hell you go through when you get off . i think I had more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a difficult time with their hormones after too . You just never know . <p> OrthoTricyclin made me hemorrhage and i had to take the highest BC pill TWO times a day to make it stop . Was so NUTS . i battled a few others that also made me cray cray and then after baby I said so long to BC pills . And depends on the person for waiting to get pregnant after the pill . Some friends got pregs right away while it took us 8 months . you never know ! <p> I almost did n't  post . But then I saw someone above post about mirena . You leave it in for five years , which is great . So hassle-free . And a lot of women report completely losing their period for that time period . Also , a plus . ( If your into that ; but a lot of people would argue this is a bit too unnatural to be okay ) <p> HOWEVER . I would not recommend this IUD without serious research and weighing the consequences against the benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my daughter in November . I thought it sounded like a miracle . I hate the pill because I forget to take it ( obvs , I now have a daughter ) and I thought this was the answer . <p> here 's some TMI . Because you need to know the not so glamorous side of mirena . <p> Have fun fighting off constant BV or candida ; whichever lovely condition your body decides to serve up to you . Then , have yourself some acne , migraines , weight gain , initial bleeding for two months , random bleeding after that , abdominal cramping that feels like terrible PMS , back cramping that feels like back labor , and I cant even describe the hormones . Forget what it feels like to be pregnant and emotional , this is an entirely different level . <p> Also , your IUD can fall out without you knowing it ( helllloooo babies ) , it can perforate your uterus ( how fun ! ) , and it can cause ectopic pregnancy if you do happen to get pregnant on it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some people claim it actually ruined their lives . Do your research , know the consequences , and just like Lauryn said , listen to your body . <p> I still have my IUD in place since removal will be $300 . I 'm just hoping I can find some way to cope with the effects . The things we go through ! <p> Hey ! I was wondering if you could tell me which birth control you are on specifically ? If you do n't  want to post it I 'd love it if you could shoot me an email because I am looking for a new super low dose pill . <p> Ortho-Tri-cyclen.hated that stuff as well . Quick note about body adjusting when ready to get pregnant.Im 29 and had been on the pill since I was 14 . My Doc told me it would " take time to adjust " as well , but the first month off the pill , my husband and I got pregnantwhich has been amazing ( due in 3 weeks ) but like you said everyones body is so different so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could take longer ! Again , every woman reacts so differently ! Thanks for the post ! <p> Good thoughts . They 're certainly not for everyone . I 've never been on BC ( I 'm a " True Love Waits " gal that 's never had a boyfriend , which makes it easier ) , but I have a friend who , when she first got off BC , she suffered several miscarriages , because she got pregnant while most of the hormones werent out of her system , and the surplus is what caused it . After her levels evened out , though , shes taken five children to term , and one of the best mothers I know . I think the best thing you can do is to be open and honest with your Doc , and listen to your body.Beks recently posted .. Moving with an anxious cat <p> Its so true that BC is very personal and everyone has a different experience . I started taking the pill in HS half because I had a bf and half because I had really , horribly painful cramps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I once got physically sick and had to go home from school . Since I went on BC I have barely got cramps at all , and if I do they are very minor . <p> About 2 years ago I swtiched from the pill to the NuvaRing because one of my friends recommended it to me . I always hated taking a pill every day and would sometimes forget and being in a long term relationship I did n't  want to worry about getting pregnant . I have had a great experience with the NuvaRing I seriously do n't  even know its in at all and my boyfriend does n't  notice it either . I highly recommend it as an option for people who do n't  want to take the pill ! Obviously though it might not work for everyone so its always good to consult your OBGYN . <p> Interesting post , I continually keep going back to whether to get the pill or just continue to ensure I have regular old fashioned child prevention , and there 's just so many horror stories on the internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view ( as always ) aarti xaarti recently posted .. Birthday Bumf ! <p> Hi Danielle , just wanted to mention that there is a new IUD on the market called Skyla that is smaller and specifically made for women who have n't had children yet . I 'm not sure what your doctor means by your hips being too narrow , I know plenty of women of small stature who have IUDs and it is n't a problem . It might be worth a second opinion lots of older docs are still of the mindset that IUDs are only for women who have already had children , which is definitely not the case ! <p> I have PCOS , I found out my senior year of high school so I have been on BC ever since . Because of that I have done my homework and found other health reasons that people go on BC . I get sad when I hear people have PCOS and wont go on BC for one reason or another . It helps ! A lot ! No more ovarian cysts or mood swings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I very strongly believe BC should n't be called BIRTH control . Its more hormone control since it has not much to do with the actual birth . It scares people off , makes them think its for one thing only when in reality a good portion of people using it is not for sex . <p> Ive been on the pill since I was 15 off and on ( I am 25 now ) I have PCOS , and sophomore year in science class my ovary had a cyst the size of a softball that exploded . well , that was painful ! I had to have my ovary and the cyst removed and was put on yasmin . <p> I loved yasmin but then all those weird commercials came on about blood clots and I switched over to something else that made me basically cry all day every day . I then switched to something lower dose that worked pretty alright . <p> sometimes I get the urge to be more " natural " so I have gone off it for about a year here and there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so its just not worth it to me ! <p> now I 'm on nuva ring and it is the bomb.com for me. my skin is reasonably clear , no ovarian cysts , and I cant feel it and neither can my husband ! <p> Ive been screened several times for blood clots and I 've been good so far ! I had a college friend die from one so I am sure to be aware of it . <p> Lauren ! Check out the Fertility Awareness Method ! I was on the pill for 11 years and just could n't deal with the melasma but mostly just feeling like I was in a cloud . I feel so much better . You can do the Fertility Awareness Method alone but I also do a diaphragm on my fertile days . I HIGHLY recommend the book Taking Charge of Your Fertility . Its amazing ! Lacy recently posted .. Lacy Lately G <p> If you really do n't  want to get pregnant , the fertility awareness method is definitely not your best bet . I am all for being knowledgable about your cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two off in their calculations and got pregnant . <p> I also started on the pill in high school , when I was 16 I loved it ! My skin was always flawless , my periods were only 4 days and really light . It was a dream ! I 've quit about 18 months ago , after being on the pill for more than 15 years . That 's when I saw the horrible withdrawal effects : I did n't  have a period for about 5 months . After six months off pill , my face got full of acne I was a teen again ! Horrible ! Never thought I would have to go through that on my 30s . I will say my body is still adjusting . My acne is lower proactive helps I also started taking a supplement called vitex , which helps your body with hormones ( 100% natural ) . But no signs of a baby yet So , the pill can be great But get ready for all the side effects once you 're off it . <p> I have been on the pill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked wonders ! My acne was out of control and it honestly did n't  matter what I did , my skin just got worse . My doctor explained that my acne was not related to diet , exercise , the types of products I was using .. it was strictly hormonal which felt so good to hear because people always tried to tell me otherwise . At first I was n't excited about it b/c I 'm not a pill girl butttt now no complaints : ) <p> I had an OK experience with BCuntil I did n't  . I went to the doc last year and found out that my BC was causing me to have very elevated blood pressure and I needed to be taken off immediately . Oh boycoming off of it has been a nightmare . The first month off , I gained 20 lbs with no change to diet/workout/lifestyle anything ( It actually helped me keep weight off when I was on it- weird , I know ) , my acne came blaring back with rage , emotionally I went off the deep end , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year now , and I 've managed to get my blood pressure down which was the most important thing but the weight gain &amp; mental part of it havent been easy . I 've made my diet ultra , ultra clean and drink a gallon+ of water a day to keep my acne away and weight down but its been a struggle . I know I got the short end of the stick but in the end , I 'm glad I do n't  have any pharmaceuticals going into my body at any time and I 'm out of the woods with the possibility of hypertension . In the end , its made me a way healthier person for it and I 'm now getting into Ayurvedic techniques to bring my body and mind in balance . <p> Ive been on the pill for almost 2 full months now . And all I want is to NOT be on it . I was hesitant from the beginning because of horror stories Ive heard &amp; I hate the idea of altering my bodys natural hormones . DAILY . Unfortunately , I 've noticed weight gain ( 6-10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would n't have upset me before have made me cry . I 've looked into natural alternatives to BC , &amp; they all involve the woman just monitoring her body closely , not having sex on certain days , &amp; hoping She get it right . So , for now , I 'll stick with the pill . <p> Thank for chatting about this ! I was nervous to write about it on my own site . I recently went back on BC to help with acne and opted to give the nuvaring a try instead of the pills . I was fine in HS on the pills , but when I tried again in Dec , I gained 10 visible lbs and freaked so after I composed myself , months later , I opted for the ring and its not bad ! I do n't  even feel it and I love that I can take it out if I do n't  feel good and I will " return to normal " since the hormones are n't  flowing through my body.Kimberly ( Manifest Yourself ) recently posted ..

I 'm personally anti-pill and have been off any form for about 6 months . <p> Long story short , I 've been on pretty much every pill in the book since HS , when I started because I was put on accutane . Over 10 years later , I have serious side effects that are likely linked to the pill . I have almost no sex drive , my internal hormones are completely messed up , Ive developed thyroid issues ( hormones ! ) , and most recently ( I was on seasonique ) an ultra sound discovered a built up of blood just outside my uterus . I decided to call it quits . My hormones and sex drive are still out of whack but the pill causes hormone damage , so I will need to spend time reversing this . <p> Sometimes you just have to buck up and take responsibility . I 'm in a 3+ year relationship and I would rather stop harming my body and try to be responsible in other ways . So far so good ! *knock on wood* <p> Keep in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better on an oral contraceptive . Talk to your doctor , run tests , and see what works for you . This is just MY personal experience . <p> So glad you post about the real stuff us girls need to hear it ! I had no idea brown spots can be caused by BC I was on for several years ( also in the sun allll the time : / ) but I did notice I was starting to get brown spots on my face . Once I got off BC I noticed they had gone away for the most part . Downside I had perrrrfect skin while on the pill , and now that I have been off for a year my body is still adjusting and unfortunately my clear skin has taken the slack I do however , feel more balanced now that my hormones are not all over the place . I am like you I absolutely had to have the lowest hormone level or I was hating life ! <p> I originally got on BC in high school tot help with acne ( sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was on Ortho-Tri-Cyclen and it made me CHUBBY ! I stayed on it because it worked miracles on my actions . Years later , a doctor switched me to a lower dose because she thought it would have less side effects ( in addition to the weight gain , I was also emotionally labile and had Melissa in my face ! ) the brand she switched me to was all over the news for causing blood clots and strokes , and working in healthcare and seeing patients whod been affected , I was not okay with that so I switched again to another low dose hormone pill . I lost weight , my melasma improved ( it also helped thst I avoid the sun like the plague nowit makes it so much worse ) , and I was only super emotional when I first started the new pill . I just realized that I 've been on BC for 15 yearshope it does n't  have any long term effects : / It works for me right now <p> Birth control wrecked i mean W-R-E-C-K-E-D , my body . My homeopathic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , but when I was in college , I thought it would be the safest thing to prevent a premature pregnancy with my long-term boyfriend . <p> TERRIBLE idea . <p> I started with the Nuva Ring . That made me get a rash all around my belly button . It was literally a ring , almost mimicking the one inside of me , and it would go though states of being really dry , then really wet and itchy ( mimicking the hormone dosage releases I 'm sure ) . I would have trouble sleeping at night , because my arms would go all tingly and numb . I was moody . Only benefit my acne cleared up . <p> I went off of the Nuva Ring when I could no longer deal with the rash . I tried a pill version , but that increased my candida giving me perpetual yeast infections . Yeast is a BEAST let 's get real on that later . <p> Finally I quit . I gave into my homeopath . She was so upset , and said I did lots of damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reset my body and its still not back to a state of complete wholeness . <p> Birth control is no joke . You are putting chemicals into your body to prevent it from operating as it is supposed to . Its almost like consuming food with GMOs . Its a foreign body your introducing into a very delicate system one that can be tipped off balance so easily . If you 're taking care of your body through a healthy lifestyle , why would you work against it by telling it to operate synthetically ? <p> I know it did n't  work for me but I know others who have n't experienced hardly any side effects ( but I do wonder if theyll unveil later in life ) . To each their own ; I 'm not passing judgement . I just encourage everyone to educate themselves and pay attention to what their bodies are telling them ! <p> So . Every single woman I know who took the pill for longer than ten years was unable to ovulate when she wanted to get pregnant . Your ob will tell you there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask how many of those women took the pill long term . The pill stops your body also does not stop you from catching disease . Not just AIDS , and some of those diseases will also affect your fertility or endanger the babies you want to have someday . <p> I am sooo anti-IUD &amp; the pill works great for me ! My IUD ( Mirena ) made me gain weight , was totally uncomfortable during sex for both me/husband ( we could both feel it ) , made my skin break out &amp; it was waaay more expensive than the pill . After having my IUD for three years I decided to get it removed &amp; get back on the pill . The weight has fallen off and my skin looks awesome ! Now of course you have to remember to take it everyday but this is not a big issue for me , they sit right on my nightstand . <p> I have such a love/hate relationship with the pill ! Ive been on it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle pill for me . I think my hormones where pretty out of whack when i started it and all of a sudden i felt like a normal person again ( and I was actually able to control my weight all of a sudden . MAJOR bonus ! ) With that being saidI do n't  love the idea of pumping hormones through my body on a daily basis . I would rather find a natural way to even out my hormones . But for now , the pill is what makes me feel like a normal person so that 's what ill continue to do <p> Paragaurd ! ! ! ! ! It is an all natural copper IUD . It is made completely of copper .. which creates a hazardous environment for sperm . It is 99.99% successful BC ( LITERALLY the number one most successful form of BC other then not having sex .. look it up ) It last for 10 years .. and can be taken out any time and get pregnant immediately . This is clearly not the BC that drug companies advertise because there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if doctors put a $100 extremely successful 10 year BC in millions of women ? <p> Incursion is definitely not comfortable .. periods are heavier for about 6 months after . But you get to be on your natural cycle , understand your periods , and not be f*cked up on hormones <p> There a reason for your post . Hundreds of girls and women are struggling with synthetic hormones and what its doing to their bodies . Its horrible and there are other amazing natural options . <p> I do n't  normally comment , but I have a very VERY strong opinion on this matter . <p> I have to 100% disagree with Alliwalli and give a very stern warning AGAINST the IUD , as I am the 1 in 1000 who got pregnant on it , and given the side effects of the IUD , had no idea I was pregnant until I was 27 weeks in ( I still had spotting , and I barely showed even at 27 weeks , I had only gained a total of 8 pounds ) . <p> I also have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they actually came back NEGATIVE ( even though I KNEW I was pregnant ) . I ended up having to go to the doctor to take a more sensitive test to finally figure out : 1 . That I was pregnant and 2 . That I was about 7 months along . <p> My IUD had worked for 4 years prior to getting pregnant , and then migrated to the wrong place ( they do n't  work unless they are exactly in the right position ) . <p> The IUD is great if you are extremely regular on your period , but you DO still need to check that its in place- people say , " You do n't  have to think about it . " -UHM YES YOU ABSOLUTELY DO ! <p> On the bright side , I am not 37 weeks pregnant and it all looks like I will be giving birth to a healthy baby , but this is definitely not the way I ever planned to bring new life into the world . <p> The IUD is great if you regularly get your period and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have it . <p> However , if you are irregular and you think you can " just forget " that its there , think again . NOTHING is 100% and you should always read the fine print . <p> Recently came across some info stating that BC pills are linked to breast cancer in young women . Scary ( if true ? ) . Plus those " if you or a loved one have taken the drug " Commercials are always fun to hear . Ahh . <p> Thank you for this post ! It makes so much sense , I knew your body could have different reactions to BC , but I did n't  know they could be so extreme . It is good to know , because I will be going on it soon and now what to look out for ! Cielo recently posted .. Drugs and Hidden Chick Flicks ? <p> So I asked my doctor recently about having to be off birth control for a bit to adjust before getting pregnant its a myth ! I 'm sure there are some women who need time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the norm . My best friend went off birth control in January and was pregnant the next month ! She was planning to have at least 6 months before that happened ! <p> Ah , birth control . I totally over thought mine . I am crazy type A , and I agonized over making the right decision . I was n't great at remembering to take the pills every day , the pain of the IUD scared me , and I knew that condoms werent super reliable . In the end , I went with the Implant . Honestly , I am TERRIFIED of needles , but they numb your arm , you do n't  see the doctor insert it , and it was painless for me . It is good for three years , and I do n't  have to worry about taking something every day . My doc told me it was as effective if not slightly more effective that the IUD . I do n't  love the idea of the hormones and the face that it screws with your bodies natural cycle , but my husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I am at right now . I hope this helps someone . A post like this would have been so helpful a few months ago when I was trying to figure all this out.Sydney recently posted .. Basil Peach Cream Cheese Spread <p> I have been on birth control for almost 7 years and havent had any major side effects . I have used the Nuva Ring , but switched to Desogen because it was so expensive . I decided to go off the pill last October after my long term boyfriend and I broke up . BIG MISTAKE ! My face broke out SO bad ! It was like the Rocky Mountains had formed all over my face . I immediately went to the doctors and got back on it . They also put me on Spiro to help with my hormonal acne . This is my story , nothing too bad . <p> However , my sister was on Ortho-Tri-Cycline ( guessing at the spelling ) and she had a terrible reaction . Developed two blood clots in her legs . Her legs swelled up so bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital and was taken care of ( not sure what they put her on ) . Fast forward a few weeks when she got a bruise on her leg . Went to the ER and they drew a line around the small bruise to see if it grew . Well it not only grew , her leg started to swell so bad it looked like her foot was going to explode ( no joke ! ) . She ended up getting blood pockets on her leg and they have since left her permanently scarred . I did n't  think anything like this could ever happen , so please be careful when considering BC . I would NOT recommend Ortho-tri .. to anyone . Consult your doctor ! <p> I just started the pill ( 2 and a half weeks ago ) after going to my doc bc I hardly got my period for the past 3 years . The doctor said my hormones were imbalance and if left I could possibly get cancer in by late 40s but now i 'm a little worried bc 2 and a half weeks later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? : / <p> In my experience , the pill caused me to gain weight and I hated taking a pill with hormones every day . So , I opted for an IUD because its more effective than the pill and ( for me ) did not cause any weight gain . Plus , you do n't  have to even think about it once its in place ( and , no , you cant feel it in your vajayjay and neither can your partner ) . My friends are all doing their residencies now and all of them use IUDs as their primary BC option beacause of the high rate of effectiveness , it literally eliminates user error which is the primary reason for pregnancies while on the pill . However , I do think the pill is an appropriate choice for someone who is really good about taking it on time and every day . I have a crazy schedule and would rather not have to think about BC every day lol . I highly recommend the IUD , it hurts when its put in ( a lot ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine and its effective as soon as its put in . Does n't  really get any better than that <p> I was on BC pills for 13 years .. I started taking it for obvious reasons but also because I had PCOS and had very irregular periods ( like 2-3 months in between and even longer ) and acne . It all resolved with the pills . 13 years of bliss . Thankfully , beside just a little weight gain , I did n't  have any issues . Until I stopped the pills and started trying to get a baby My hormones were so messed up after the pills ! I did n't  get my period for months , and could n't get pregnant . Damn you PCOS ! After 1.5 years of trying I went on a low-dosage pill to help ovulate , and BAM ! I got pregnant the next month . So , if you are taking BC pills and have PCOS , chances are your hormones will be so messed up after you stop taking pills , that you might need time ( or a little help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for posting on this topic since every woman at one point has gone through the issue of finding a contraceptive that works for her . I was on the pill for a year and a half and it made me really moody . I wanted hormones out of my body also considering that breast cancer runs in my family , I did n't  want the hormones acting like carcinogens running through me . <p> After months of dealing with condoms and nerve-racking pulling out , I got the paragard IUDa non-hormonal copper IUD with the only symptoms being heavier periods and more cramping the first few cramps . Insertion hurt for a few seconds but it is definitely worth it for a .6% failure rate for the next 10-12 years . I 'm only 20 but I would definitely recommend it for women who are looking to get away from hormones ! <p> My body has been through so many pills due to different side effects or insurance issues , but overall , my body does better on low estrogen pills . If it is n't too much to ask , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> I got the copper IUD . After being for a couple years on the pill , now with the IUD I can safely say pill nevermore ! ! Not only is the IUD completely hormone free , but I do n't  need to remember to take something every day . Also , as soon as you want to have ze babies , you can take it out and get preggers without having to wait . Of course , to each their own , but I can not imagine putting pills and hormones into my body anymore . <p> Have you considered the LadyComp ? Its an all natural method of birth control that measures your basal body temperature and keeps track of your cycle daily via a device . Ive used mine for about a year and I swear by it . <p> I love Nuvaring , I only have to change it once a month . Its no different than using a tampon , which honestly you should forget that too and switch to the Divacup then you only have to change it 2x a day morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So i have been on the pill since i was roughly 14-15 ? due to irregular periods , mood swings , crazy bad cramping , migraines ect . Other than the fact of having to try a new one every so many years it really is n't that bad and makes my PMDD 20 Xs better . <p> I was on the pill for about 10 years , and then when I was 26 , I switched to a 3rd generation pill . I do not even really know why . I went to the doc and she said hey let 's try this , so I did . I had never had a single complication from birth control up until this point . About 5 weeks later , I was in the hospital and had 6 blood clots in my lungs . Now , I can never take birth control again- which is inconvenient to say the least . Also , I have to take blood thinners and regulate my diet so that it does not effect my medication . Further , I will have a complicated pregnancy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice is if you find something working for you , do n't  switch . And read up on the risks of 3rd generation birth controls before starting to take them . <p> I had the IUD for about a year- the concept is great but the side effects not so much ! ! ! Hair loss , I could feel it pull every time I bent over ! ( I work at a vet hospital so every time I picked up a dog I could feel it , which was multiple times a day ! ) , depression , probably gained about 15 pounds also . It was probably the worst thing I have ever done ! I had it taken out and it took almost 6 months for me to start getting back to normal . If I could , I would n't use any birth control but for now I have gone back to the ring . It makes things a lot funky down there but better than gaining weight , mood swings , and hair loss ! <p> I love the Nuvaring ! I have been taking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for 4 weeks and then immediately put in another one , I do this for 3 months at a time , then on the 4th month I take it out after 3 weeks , get my period for 5 days then I start the process overthis way I only have my period every 4 months . I started doing this cycle about 3 years ago when I found out I was going to be on my period for our honeymoon . Best advise the dr. has ever given me <p> Ahhhh I love you for posting this ! ! I was on the pill but hated how it made me feel . So I did n't  take it everyday . I was horrible a lout remembering . Then , I got prego . With twins ! Now I 'm a happy mama of two , but I got an IUD ! I needed something that I would n't forget and had a lesser chance of pregnancy . When I first got it , I did n't  like what it was reacting with my body . But after two weeks , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chels recently posted .. WHATS IN MY DIAPER BAG + FRIDAY FREEBIE + GIVEAWAY ! ! <p> I am extremely health-conscious and am personally against taking/using anything that comes from a pharmaceutical company . I want to be in my best physical form without using something that will alter my bodys natural state . I use a natural method of birth control . This requires me to observe , chart and interpret my waking body temperature to understand when I am fertile and when I am not . Of course it also includes withdrawal . During days of high fertility , I know I have to either avoid or be extremely careful with intercourse . For this method to be truly effective , a woman must have a typical pattern with her cycle . This method is 95%-98% effective when followed strictly . I am in a long-term relationship and my boyfriend is extremely supportive of this method ! It allows me to be more in tune with my body . <p> LOVE that you 're discussing this . Most women I know have been on bc for 10-15 years ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say hmmmm. maybe a bc detox would be good , or just going off it all together . Seems scary right ? welp ! make HIM wrap it up ! <p> I think a lot of women feel bad about asking their guy to do this , personally , I think being on anything for years and years ca n't be good for your body . <p> I went off a few years ago , and just told my boyfriend ( now husband ) too bad so sad , I cant hang with the side effects . <p> I totally agree with Kat . It is worth at least considering condoms as an option ! That is all I have used for the past 10 years ( during most of which I have been in long term relationships ) . I know some people worry that the failure rate is high , but you can mitigate that by being diligent . And my partners have always been understanding when I explain that I do n't  want to pump my body with hormones <p> I used to be on a birth control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period ever , and I got a zit maybe twice a year . Then the drug company stopped making it , so I was switched to a slightly different one , which had artificial sweetener in it ( gross ) and a variety of unpleasant side effects . At this point I was feeling a little hypocritical because I was trying to avoid hormones in foods yet was getting a daily dose of artificial hormones , so I stopped taking it . It took about 3 months to get my period back , but I have heard of women who get pregnant the month after they stop taking it . Currently this works for me thank you for pointing out the hyper pigmentation because I recently noticed that the random spots I used to have on my leg were gone and wondered why duh no more BC ! Thank you for sharing your story and like you said were all different and shouldnt judge each other for what works for them personally ! Tory @ tory of my life recently posted .. Friday Favorites- 8/8/14 All the Foods <p> LONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( polycystic ovarian syndrome ) and my doc said , sorry Charlie we are gon na need to give you some shit to get you knocked up . <p> Nope . Would not take the hormones after losing my period for MORE THAN a year after stopping years of birth control . I was done with hormones . <p> This is becoming a long story long but I fixed all my ailments thru food ( paleo/primal ) and discovered FAM fertility awareness method of birth control . This is now my go to so that I can stay away from all hormones and pills . I find it is incredibly accurate and if you are interested I suggest this book Taking Charge of your Fertility http : //amzn.to/1lIyBLx <p> I have never been comfortable with the idea of ingesting so much synthetic crap ( I do n't  even like taking ibuprofen ! ) , so birth control is not an option for me . Sometimes I feel like the only person in the world who does n't  use birth control . We do n't  use any at all . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage with financial stability , so if we get pregnant it wont be the end of the world ! Julie recently posted .. Road trip so far <p> Ive been on the pill for several years , switched a few times just due to insurance purposes . Never gained weight bc of the pill or had acne problems bc of the pill . ( I did however have just regular ol teenage acne but it was n't caused by the pill ) I now take the seasonel or something its called . I 'm only supposed to get a period every 3 months and usually that ends up being every 6 months . Sometimes I forget to take the pill but have never had any surprise babies and sometimes if I forget for a few days I will start to spot but that 's about it . So overall the pill has worked great for me and no issues . Guess I 'm pretty lucky <p> A couple of things a post earlier by a doctor ? About the mirena iud it does have hormones and a lot of them . The copper iud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not take any kind of birth control , I started with the depo provera shot at 17 gained 30 pounds and lost a lot of hair . I switched to the pill and went crazy emotionally . I have since been diagnosed with pcos and chronic migraines which takes birth control completely out for me . The hard part for me is most women with pcos use the pill to get regular and help with fertility and that is out of the question for me . Birth control and being a woman and wanting to be a mom is very hard . <p> From my own experiences , Ive become very disenchanted with the birth control pill . I 'm not against girls using it , but I know that I will never take it again . When I was seventeen , I dropped a lot of weight in a short period of time , and as a result I lost my period . My doctor induced my period with the BC pill ( even though I was n't having sex yet ) , which brought it back . Never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later I decided to go off of it , and now I have n't had a period in almost a year . My hormones are completely out of whack . Of course , this is n't necessarily the pills fault . Obviously I have a lot of health issues that are playing part here . What I 'm against is using the pill for reasons other than contraception ( like inducing a period with it ) , or using it solely to regulate a period even though a young girl may not be sexually active . I find artificial hormones extremely freaky now , and I think the dangers of the pill are underrated . Our hormonal system is very delicate , and I believe the BC pill messes with a process that simply does not want to be messed with . That being said , we all pick our battles . There are definitely worse things in the world for our health . Plus , taking the birth control pill is far better than getting accidentally pregs . Its a responsible thing to take if you 're regularly having sex and are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle ; the birth control pill is definitely not going to kill that . So overall , I guess I have mixed opinions about the BC pill . I 'm personally not a fan , but that does n't  mean its not a good choice for someone else.Jenni recently posted .. Paleo Baking <p> I was on birth control from the time I was 18 until I turned 33 . I figured I shouldnt be on something that long so I went off . After I went off I was a complete mess . I break out like crazy now on my back , this never happened before the pill . I also notice that I sweat a LOT more . Ive been off for a year and a half now and it has n't  changed . Still have the breakouts and sweat . The only upside is that I noticed my eye lashes are longer now which is odd ! <p> I decided Im done with birth control other than condoms . Ive tried pills and they gave bad side effects . I had the Mirena IUD for 6 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day . After I got it taken out , my cramps disappeared and I have less digestive problems . Also I was getting bad face breakouts and that mostly went away . I probably will not go on birth control again because of what its done to my body . Also I get migraines/headaches frequently and the pills I 'm on would basically render BC useless . : / <p> Also I gained weight on the IUD and could n't lose it until I got it taken out . I saw multiple doctors and the only people who dared say the symptoms could be caused by the IUD are a chiropractor and acupuncturist . Its like the actual doctors I saw refused to see a connection or did n't  want to say anything against Mirena <p> I have been on the pill , the DEPO shot and finally on the ParaGard IUD . Like you said , we all have different reactions , and mine were HORRENDOUS with the BCP and the depo shot . The best one for me has been the IUD because it has NO hormones , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off anytime ) , and you do n't  have to remember anything . HA ! Downside : I used to NEVER have me atrual cramps , but now I do with the IUD . My diet change helped me decrease the pain , but they 're there . I 'd rather suffer a little bit once/month than to put hormones in my body that I already know they 're horrible on me . <p> I 'm against copper IUD , because the egg still gets fertilized , so it is a living organism still . Also the way IUD works is by not letting the fertilized egg stick to the wall of uterus by creating a strong irritation in the uterus . I think hormones are super bad , but I do n't  think any kind of irritation is good either . <p> Ive been on birth control pills ( Alesse ) for about 10 years now , with pretty much no side effects . I started taking it actually because of hormone issues in high school . It seemed like I would get the flu or a really bad cold once a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bcps I was fine ! I also found that it really cleared up my acne . <p> When my husband and I decided to start our family , I was only off them for about a month before I got pregnant so it did n't  take long . I had tried the patch as well and hated it because it got so much sticky residue on my clothes . I do n't  want to stick anything up there because my mom had uterus issues when she was younger so I do n't  want to risk anything there , and I hate needles so I wont do that either . I might try the ring since a lot of you seem to like it though . <p> Honestly I feel a lot worse when I 'm not taking them , because I always get so sick otherwise . Plus I live in Canada so I do n't  know what you guys pay , but its pretty cheap here . <p> I was on the Pill on and off throughout high school and college . Once I reached 35 , I realized I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do take Synthroid for Hypothyroidism but I do n't  have a choice in that . I decided to get the Paragard Copper T IUD . Its hormone free and has a less than 1% failure rate . My husband and I do n't  want children . Were happy being child-free . Soon enough he will get the snip snip . But even once he does , I keeping my IUD . Up to 12 years of pregnancy protection . You cant beat that . But whatever works for the individual . I was on Yaz a few years ago and it made me borderline suicidal . The Pill is a tricky thing . But thank God woman have a choice nowadays . <p> I went off the pill 7 months ago . Ive been doing so many other things to stay clean and healthy in my life and felt that switching to a non-hormonal birth control ( my friends rave about the copper IUD ) would be the best option . I wanted to give myself a few months off the pill just to see what my body was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 years . <p> Well , fast forward 7 months later and I 've only has about 2 normal periods and my skin has completely broken out . My doc is n't concerned and said in can take your body a long time to start menstruating on its own again . I give this advice though because what if I was wanting to have kids ? I have a long term bf btw , so we are using other contraceptives for now But I do n't  think I ever want to go back on hormones seeing how much it had thrown by body off to where it still is n't if functioning properly so many months later . The skin issue sucks , but I realized I 'll have to deal with finding a natural solution now OR when I want to have kids down the road , so might as well not have the last 7 months be for nothing and try to get to the root of it now . I 'm finding things that help , and its definitely a journey but I feel good that I know I 'm working on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have had friends that got pregnant the first month they went off the pill , so everyones body is different . I 'm sharing my experience though because I would hate for anyone to be in a hurry to get pregnant and then have to wait a year to even get a normal period again , let alone pregnant . For reference , I 'm 27 years old and I was on reclipsen , which was a low dose BC . <p> So glad you posted this and it is reassuring ( ? Unfortunately so ) reading through the comments and seeing that so many other women like me have had such bad issues . In high school I started getting super heavy , irregular periods when I went to boarding school ( had been normal before that ) so I went on the pill . Super depressed and othe bad side effects that I did n't  tie to the pill at the time . Moved back to the US for college and tried a series of pills , all gave me had side effects . Had the depo shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and I was still a virgin then Ouch ) . Tried a few more pills and the ring in college once I was in a relationship . The doctors tested me for all sorts of things but could n't figure out why my periods were so heavy and so irregular . I also got terrible migraines ( had been since about age 8 ) . I eventually went off the pill and when I met my boyfriend after college ( now hubby ! ) I started the pill again . Basically it made me a crazy bitch and super emotional . It was so bad that he made me promise no more hormonal birth control . We did comdems but once we got married and werent quite ready for kids I got the Mirena . Had all the same hormonal issues ( moods / lethargic / depressed / no libido ) . So I got that out and less than three months later Preggo ! My daughter is now 2.5 yrs ( I am almost 31 ) . I got the copper iud in about 2 months after she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of itself , it is not BUT it can cause hormonal reactions . I breastfed / pumped milk for 14 months so I thought that a lot of symptoms ( moody / no libido / SO TIRED / bloated fupa even though i was at pre pregnancy weight On and on the list goes ) were related to that . Finally earlier this year I just knew something was n't right and started googling Tons of women have posted their stories online about these exact same effects of copper iud ( paragard ) . I had it removed in April and almost immediately energy levels were better , but hormones can take months and even years to balance out . I think I had copper toxicity so now I am dealing with those detox symptoms . Of course , this is not everyones experience and as you said Lauryn , do what works for you ! I wish I had know that paragard is not exactly side effect free . <p> I recently went off bc bc I was working hard to become active , had just gotten out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking my meds and lost about 5-10 lbs with diet and exercise , my boobs significantly shrank ( that was the upside to taking that pill each day ) and I noticed acne come back after many many years of never having a problem with it . Overall , I 'm happy . I feel good ! Granted , the cramps came back and my " girls " disappeared back to what they were in high school ( thanks to my flat-chested genes ) , but my body looks great and I just overall feel great ! It took my body quite some time to adjust back to a monthly cycle . I get smaller periods in between my monthly cycle . I liked having the peace of mind taking bc due to the fact that I knew I could n't get pregnant , but my body took quite a transformation over those years . Now , I 'm all natural and taking care of myself . It feels great ! <p> When someone asks my opinion on BC , now I say a big NO ! I think its madness , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought it was unnatural , so it made me think of it badly , but also I started to have strange headaches when getting up , I 've heard it can have something to do with the pill . <p> Also , did you know that the " period " you get when on the pill is not actually a real period ? Its withdrawal bleeding , BC tricks your body into thinking its pregnant . I think its sick ! <p> I first got on BC for regulating my extremely painful periods , but now I get to know that it did n't  actually regulate anything &gt;. &lt; <p> Also , right when I got off BC my skin got better ! ! ! No more chin breakouts/acne after going off ! ! ! YAY ! <p> Anyway , if you 're thinking of doing BC , just do n't , it screws with your system , your body can not get enough nutrients , it 's just plain bad ! <p> I was on the pill for 15 years and got pregnant 3 months after I stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , but not the case for me . I was also in extremely low dose pills . They are my bc of choice . <p> I was on the pill from 15 until 19 years old . I could n't handle itMade me so moody . One time I went to a male doctor to discuss it and he said there is no possible way that the pill would change my hormones LOL serious right ? ! <p> I went off it and then had the copper IUD for 5 years . It was brilliant ! No hormones , but made me bleed way to much . So out that comes ! haha <p> I am now 25 and my husband and I only use condoms and natural pull out methods . cant stand hormonal contraception so this is the way to go with us . LOVE IT <p> My soon to be husband and I use condoms . In the past I have been on all kinds of pills , patches , the Nuvaring and even Mirena ( IUD ) . All included weight gain , mood swings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their partners use condoms as well and it works for us ! <p> The day this post went up , I was due in for an MRI . My dr told me to immediately stop taking the pill . I had a migraine , with stroke like symptoms . If I stay on the pill , I will have a stroke . There are non hormonal iuds as an option . Luckily , I 'm married , 30 , otherwise healthy , so I can afford to roll the dice . Its tricky ladies . Stay safe and listen to your body ! ! ! <p> I always like to read about other peoples experiences taking birth control . I took the pill for maybe a total of 2 or 3 years . I first went on it to control my acne because I had been taking antibiotics for about 3 years to control it and as I became more health conscious I decided its probably not a good idea to keep taking them and saw my doctor to get the pill . Whilst on the pill I developed high blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and control this but still suffered with it and noticed my heart would start racing for no reason . After suffering for a short while I gave up on birth control . A year ago I was diagnosed with lupus and it is suggested that excess estrogen in your system can bring on a flare of your symptoms . As its been a struggle to control my symptoms I choose not to go back on the pill because I have worked too hard by getting control of my diet and body to not have it be put out of whack again . So for me its condoms all the way , lucky I have a partner who understands my choice . You can only do what feels right for you ! ! ! <p> I tried everything from the shot ( hello 3 months of heavy bleeding ! Like I had to go back and be like YO . I 'm going through a pack of heavys a week kind of bleeding ) . I tried the patch ( hello violent crazy moodswings ! ) I 'm on Alesse , one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like crazy ( I went from 4 a month to 1-2 now ) . I hate taking pills but I cant get preggers either ( I have a heart condition that could kill both me and the child so there 's NO way I 'm taking a chance on that ) . I do n't  want the Mirena because A ) OW . B ) I dislike that I 'll have string just dangling in my bits ( sorry , but I 'm pretty grossed out by the thought ) and C ) I think I have to get that approved by my cardiologist first . I take my birth control straight through , ie I do n't  take a break from the pill . My Dr approved this . I cant/shouldnt/will die if I get pregnant , there 's basically no reason for me to have a period . I 'm turning 30 in november and will be pushing for a partial hysterectomy. ( where they take the uterus but keep the ovaries so I do n't  go into pre-menopause , though Im certain Im already going through that ) . I still get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even my gyno said women do n't  have to unless they 're trying to get pregnant . So yeah . That 's my spiel ! <p> After 2 kids , an IUD , and a divorce , the pill is my favored choice . I did have a little problem taking the pill in my early 20s , did I mention my oldest son is 10 , I 'm 31 , you do the math : ) Do n't  skip your pill ! Beyond not wanting to have a child , I take the pill for my skin and hair . My IUD had some pretty horrible side effects toward the end of the 5 years ( acne , hair loss ) and the pill has helped a ton with clearing my skin and my hair is thicker . My only problem , now I 'm terrified to ever stop taking the pill ! Thanks for bringing this topic up , its popular with my girlfriends . <p> i take loestrin a very low dosage BC pill . It took a few tries to find the pill that was right for me but i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i was having sex plus since being on the pill i do n't  really get a period anymore , just two days of spotting . Ive been taking allergy medication since i was five so taking a pill everyday is not a problem for me. i was told i was to small for an IUD and I know 7 people who are IUD babies so that was checked off the list , i would n't mind the implant but i 'm worried it will be too strong of a dose for my body to handle . Although i did n't  realize that many people here have seen an decrease in libido kind of explains why i do n't  have any , i 'm okay with that <p> Thank you for sharing this fantastic post . Clearly , this is a subject that hits home with so many women , speaking from personal experience and after reading the thorough feedback . <p> I have been on BC on and off since I was 18 . I was always worried about taking hormones and doing something that was so unnatural . I was also concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , but my gyno said that that was a huge myth . She said that I can take the same brand of BC for up to 4 years , then take a break 2 months and start the 4-year cycle over again.I Showed Up In Boots recently posted .. Contrast <p> Hi Lauryn , I am sure this is mentioned in the comments above , but figured I would add my two cents anyway <p> I got pregnant as SOON as I went off the pill , like right away .. I had been on the pill since I was 17 years old and never went off until this past April when my husband and I were baby-ready ( I am now 27 ) . I did n't  even get a period ! <p> I think the thought of " giving your body time to adjust when you 're ready to get pregnant for a few months " is a myth ; it really depends on your own body . <p> Make sure you 're ready to get pregnant because it really can happen right away ! lol . <p> LOVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seriously needs to be talked about more ! I started on BC when I was in early HS because of cramp pain , I literally passed out because of the pain . Then I started again when I got with my boyfriend , because babies ? Ew . No . I 've had the pill , ring , and patch . The patch was great except that when I took it off it left a sticky spot on my body and ripped skin away . Nope . The ring was great the first time , but every two years while on BC I cleanse my body of the toxins for 3 months ( sorry boyfriend ) , while I was cleansing they upped and changed the ingredients/recipe so I gained 10 lbs and broke out BAD and turned into , as my man calls is , a crazy person . Then I tried about 4 different pills . The last one was FAB ! I did n't  get too crazy , no weight gain , clear-ish face , and no babies ! ! ! Then I ran out for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got into the doc , he told me that the pill brand was bought out , re-labled , and probably had the chemical quantities/qualities changed . <p> So I , honestly , quit . Like . My body cant handle it . My cramps are better now that I have ways to deal with them naturally , my face is clearer than EVER , my weight has been manageable and dropping . I 'm still with the same boyfriend , with no outside partners on either side . A baby would be devastating , but with all of the warnings on birth control and all of the health problems I 've had because of it , Ive written it off . My man supports me and he is in charge of his side of the birth control . <p> I stopped taking BC because I was on it for 8 years and wanted to give my body a break ! Weird thing is , when I stopped , I stopped getting my period for a year ! ! ! ! I got checked by 2 docs and they could n't find anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pill because I NEED to have a periodI got back on the pill and now I get my period every month . Has this happened to anyone ? ? ! ! <p> Hey Lauryn , I honestly cant tell you how much this has helped me . Ever since I moved to San Diego about 4 1/2 months ago I have been having crazy skin problems . Like I have never broken out this much in my life ! ! It is all around my chin area , which after some research I found out is a result of a hormone imbalance . I never really thought twice about maybe my birth control I take could be the problem . Recent changes in life with moving and in a new climate may have had some effects of my hormones ( or my body is just changing , who knows ) Anyways , I just called my gyno to set up an appointment to hopefully switch my birth control and see if it works with clearing up my skin . Thank you for this post and the idea ! ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my job is helping to improve access to family planning in developing countries . Women today , especially in America , have so many choices now and there really is a method that works for everyone . Talk to your gyn about your options , and if one method is n't working for whatever reason tell your doctor . If your doctor is n't willing to help you find a birth control method that works for you , then find a new doctor . <p> I was on the pill for 15 yearsI went on long before I started having sex because of heavy and irregular periodsand I ended up going off of it because I had a sudden work trip that came up and I did n't  get my mail order refills in time . <p> I have been resistant to using any kind of hormonal birth control since going off the pill 3 years ago because I have been managing depression since my early 20s and I felt way better mood-wise off the pill . Over the last few years my periods have been getting heavier , but in April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life . I bled through 12 ( seriously ) super-mega tampons + super maxi pads before noon . It was horrible . I went to the doctor and had a ton of tests and there was nothing wrong , apparently it can happen as you get older . My OBGYN friend suggested a Mirena , which I got immediately after the vacation and it has been amazing . <p> The insertion was not as bad as I expected it to be , but I definitely had cramps for a while after . My cramps were off and on for about a month , but were bearable with Advil . The OBGYN friend suggests that anyone who gets an IUD stick with it for a full 3 months , because it does get better . It definitely got better for me . <p> I was worried about hormones , but the Mirena is incredibly low dose and the hormones are essentially localized within your uterus ; I have n't felt any negative side effects at all . The Mirena did have an instant effect on my periods now only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotting and about a half day using a regular tampon . No cramps , no PMS , my Costco sized box of tampons will last me for years , and I wont get pregnant . Life is good . The pill worked for me for a long time , but for a multitude of reasons the Mirena is a way better method for me at this point in my life . <p> As a public health professional I would be remiss to not throw in a reminder to USE CONDOMS to protect yourself from STIs . Unless you 100% trust that your partner is monogamous AND you have both been tested for the full range of STIs and come out clean , you should wrap it up to keep you both healthy . Way too many of my friends have gotten HPV and a lot of that could have been prevented if they had n't  assumed their partner was safe or felt too awkward to talk about condoms . <p> I was on the pill for about a year , but now I have an IUD . I personally think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about taking it every night and what if you miss a dose . There are two different types , one that is a hormone ( Mirena ) and one that is a copper one without hormones ( ParaGuard ) Also , in the long run its the cheapest ! It did hurt to put it in , and you do have cramping the first few weeks , but to me it was worth the 5-7 years of protection that I will get from it . Obviously , an IUD might not be the right choice for some people , but you would have to research and make the best decision for your body . <p> I had been on one form of the pill for nearly a decade and last year I began to really think about what I was putting into my body . After A LOT of research , I came off the pill and have been monitering my body as my own form of birth control . <p> I use the basal body temperature method and just make note of any physical and physiological changes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We just use condoms for the 5ish days when fertile . Maybe not the best method if you 're not in a long term relationship , as it is definitely something you both need to be cool with , but let me tell you , I feel so good being off the pill ! I feel happier , a lot more in tune and in control of my body and I have far fewer mood swings . Would totally recommend to anyone who feels a bit blahhh on the pill.Eleanor recently posted .. Mint Green Dreams <p> Personally went off Bc thinking it would be nice to not have hormones . Well this made my once perfectly clear skin into acne face . Which made me go back on BC . I have the copper IUD with no hormones and love it and I take the BC pills for my skin . it has done wonders . Thanks for sharing fellow SD blogger ! <p> I am having the same problem with hyper pigmentation recently popping up on my face : ( . I 'm wondering if this is linked to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recently become even more aware of the time I spend in the sun and making sure I reapply and wear a hat ! Did you use any products to help fade the dark spots ? What worked for you ? This one spot on my forehead is driving me crazy . <p> Since I became a holistic health coach and changed my lifestyle to be healthier , I decided to go all-natural , pretty much . I went off birth control about 2 years ago ( went on it because 1 ) I had horrible , horrible , HORRIBLE cramps , 2 ) I had irregular periods &amp; 3 ) I also did n't  want to get preggers in HS . ) I forgot what brand I took , but it was good to me for being on it for over 2 years . It seriously took my over 8+ months for my period to regulate when I got off of it . It was pretty awesome , but scary . But ever since I 've been off of it and I 've been healthier , my cramps have been almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to last over a week ) . As for birth control , we simply use good-quality condoms . <p> So I 'm trying to figure out what a more NATURAL way for BC . I really do n't  like taking the pill , as I also have been on it for like 10 years , no 12 actually . I 've actually missed a pill a got pregoo this one time . ( I say it relaxed but it was 7 years ago and NOT chill at all . ) Fast forward to now , I have had some " irregular " cells down town V town . It really really scary . I 'm like 99% positive its from my BC ! SO , to combat this Ive been eating parsley by the bunch and also taking turmeric because both combat cervial cancer cells ! Great but at the same time , I still need to not get pregs . There has to be some sort of natural way . I 'm already cray about what I put in my body no thanks pesticides . Does anyone know of natural BC alternatives ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now for the lowest of low ? I hate having to be on it , but without it ( EVEN WITH the most healthy diet Ive ever had in my life ) i have acne in my adult years . so i use it for skin . which are you on ? Curious . x <p> Very long story short , I had a horrible time with the Mirena IUD . I began getting yeast infections regularly always the week before my period . When I had the damn thing removed it took over a year for the infections to stop and my periods to normalize . The removal also gave me adult acne that is just now finally letting up after aggressive treatment . <p> I know this is an old post but I 've been trolling ! After taking Ortho Tri Cyclen for about 5 years , I stopped 7 months ago in the hopes of getting pregnant . I have not had a period since The doctors tell me to give it time but it is very discouraging . Plus I have spent a small fortune on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a period because I 'm preg-o or because my body is still out of whack . Thanks for bringing this topic to the table for discussion ! You are theee best <p> I had a tubal after my 4th kid , I 'm 38 and I thought great ! no more pill ! Then came the acne ( cystic on the jawline ) and the " off the pill " periods which were heavy . So back on the pill I went , I am exercising a lot more now and I noticed on the pill I have less endurance and my legs feel more tired when I run , I also seem to have minor injuries more often . Ive been on several pills and have not found the " right " one yet . I considered and IUD but I 'm not sure that 's what I want . Periods are annoying but if I could get the acne figured out I could deal with the periods . <p> i am in neeeeeeeeeed , i have been on the pill for about two weeks and my acne has just been getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ( i have never had bad acne just little spots and recently alot of little sports gathering on my forehead causing a heavy breakout for a month ) i have looked everywhere and cant seem to find anyone saying acne got worse while on the pill , i am currently on one of the lowest doses and i have no idea what to do . <p> Lauryn thanks for talking about this topic . I was on and off the pill during HS mostly because my periods were super irregular and when I would have them , theyd last forever . I took a break from it in college then got back on the pill and that time around I definitely felt the weight gain and felt like my circulation got bad . Then while I was living with my best friend during an exchange program , she told me about her IUD ( I had previously thought you could only get it if you had had a child ) . After almost 2 years debating it , I finally got it and while it hurt getting it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IUD . I do n't  feel the weight gain or the other issues I had and I 'm glad I have protection . But not sure if I 'll get it again cuz it really did hurt . On top of all this , I 'm also currently starting a program from Alisa Vitti which deals with addressing hormone balance naturally and through food . Its great for people with PCOs ( which thankfully I do n't  have ) as well as preventing hormones from getting unbalanced as I get older . <p> I am also a big fan of the pill . I do n't  want a shot , or some weird shit in my vajay ! Lol , just sayin ! Anyways , I was off of my BC for a little over a year when I got pregnant . Granted we werent exactly trying , but if it happened we would embrace it . Basically we wanted a baby , but werent sure exactly when a " good time " was . Even though there is no right time . Point being , they say to give it around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get pregnant . I think my timeline was pretty on point with that ! <p> Thank you for sharing ! I was put on birth control about 8 years ago because I was diagnosed with endometriosis and was told it would help ( which it has- no horrible periods/passing out/throwing up since I started ) . I recently switched to the lowest low dose as well and I am loving it ! I had been put on a higher dose by my former gyn because I would occasionally start a period early from stress . One year later , I had gained 20 pounds ! I thought maybe I had just been lazy but no amount of exercise would make any difference ! I did some research and decided to see a different gyn and explain my concerns ( I also would get super nauseous when I would start my pack ) . She told me there was no need to go to a higher dose of estrogen because its normal for a woman to sometimes start her period a little early due to stress . I agreed to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the pack but the difference is amazing . My pants actually fit now and my mood has improved dramatically ( apparently I was a little depressed and just did n't  realize it ) ! Long story but if you 're ignoring the side effects of your birth control pill- do n't  ! Its worth asking about even if its a different doctor ! ! I only wish I had asked sooner ! Thank you for starting a conversation on this subject ! <p> I went on the pill when I was about 18 and was fine on it for years , literally no problems whatsoever . Then my doctor claimed my pill had been discontinued on the NHS ( I 'm from the UK ) and they put me on another at the age of 24 . Needless to say my hormones went crazy and my body had no idea what was going on , cue extreme period pain , bleeding for months on end , bleeding during sex , severe eczema all over my face etc etc I could go on . Long story short , the pill ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through months of invasive investigations and biopsies to find out the cause . Surprise surprise , BC . I stopped taking the pill nearly a year ago , around the same time my relationship came to an end so contraception has n't  really been as necessary , but I 'm now concerned about what I would do when I next enter a relationship . It angers me a bit now when I hear my guy friends complain about condoms , to be honest , I 'm not a mega fan of them myself ! Who is ? But whatever reason they have for not wanting to use condoms cant possibly be worse than my reason for not wanting to go back on the pill ! Now my body has had a break , perhaps it will be possible for me to go back on BC one day and be fine again like I was before they messed me around , but the question is , am I willing to potentially put myself through all that again just to find out ? <p> I 'm like you , I prefer the pills instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticker you put on your lower stomach or butt cheek but after awhile I got tired of the adhesive it would leave behind on my skin . I 'm now on Lo-Loestrin and its pretty good to me so far . I love how it clears up my acne and my periods are lighter . So I 'll always be a pill taker person . Recently , I downloaded an app that sends you reminders for when to take your pill . I cant think of the name right now but its convenient that apps do that now . <p> Old post I know , but you should look into this thing called Daysy . Its a device that uses your BBT ( basal body temperature ) to predict your day of ovulation and gives you green days and red days based on your fertility . I 've used it for almost a year now and LOVE it . The device has been around under different names ( LadyComp ) for years , and is 99% effective in preventing pregnancy ( backed by research , I literally had them send me all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeptical ) . No pills , no insertions , no hormones . I feel like a new person on it . Honestly I tried SO many different kinds of BC pills and always had the weirdest side effects ( acne , hair loss , depression , like generally feeling disoriented ) . That has ALL gone away . <p> The 2 major drawbacks to it are you have to get a good amount of sleep ( at least 4 hours I believe ) and take your temp every morning IMMEDIATELY after you wake up ( temps can be affected if you drank heavily the night before ) and when you have red days it means either no sex or using a backup form of contraception . I definitely would n't say its for everyone . You have to be very responsible and disciplined ( do n't  have sex on red days ! Or use backup ! ) and I probably would n't use it if I was n't in a serious relationship . <p> BUT if you 're relatively responsible and in a committed relationship , I think its PERFECT . Ive been trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They said theyd wait and see how I do for a year first , lol . Ca n't blame them . You should look into it ! I 'd be interested to hear your take on it . <p> Ugh THE PILL . I think your description of " tricky little fucker " is so accurate . The pill was a miracle acne-clearer for me at 14 . ( Fun fact : I got on the pill before I even kissed a boy late-ish bloomer , I know ) but also made me gain 25 pounds . Part of that was good since I 'd been 107 lbs at my height of 510 and everyone thought I was anorexic even though I was just pre-pubescent . I worked hard to lose some of the weight and stayed around 125 ( give or take ) for most of high school and college . Minus a weight gain phase sophomore year when my now-hubs and I got together we had a ton of pizza , wine , and netflix nights . <p> Then when I got off the pill at age 24 to lose weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " level of skinny , my acne came roaring back ( even though I 'd done accutane at 16 ) . After 8 months of trying acne treatments that did n't  work , I got back on the pill to do accutane again . And I 'm DEFINITELY finding it harder to maintain my weight . My skin looks bomb though and now even though Im done with accutane Im scared to get back off the pill . But then again , I 'm so annoyed by the extra " fluff " on my thighs . I now model in Florida and being a size 4 as opposed to 00 is fine , but I just find it annoying that I work so hard on my body and still have that jiggle that sticks like elmers . Maybe I should try the super low estrogen stuff ! !

For those of you that are unfamiliar with Coachella its a multi-day annual event full of incredible music- some of my favorites ? Madeon , Radiohead , Afrojack , &amp; Kaskade - in Indio , California . Since the weekend is one big party , do n't  forget to keep yourself healthy &amp; include these items in your fanny pack : <p> + All-natural coconut water : it is hydrating , does not have to be refrigerated , &amp; has tons of potassium . <p> + Emergen-C packets : these are quick easy substitutes for vitamins . The Electro Mix contains electrolytes which are especially important for when you 're in the desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrolytes . This mix will restore your cells &amp; keep you energized . The Vitamin D &amp; Calicum mix is perfect to throw in a water bottle for extra vitamins . <p> + Metroelectro water : this water contains zinc , antioxidants , and electrolytes . All of which promote a healthy immune system . <p> + Evolution Veggie Juice : these veggie drinks are fab to throw in a backpack or handbag for a quick snack to keep your blood sugar stable . <p> Great info and thanks for the tips ! I attend an annual festival up here in N. Cal in the high sierra and even though were in the mountains for 5 days , it can get really hot . You can get heatstroke even w/o any alcohol consumption b/c of the heat and elevation . I will for sure be taking some of this stuff with me this year ! 
@@3098590 <h> Laying LowBut Actually Really Laying Low <p> Updated : August 8 , 2015 <p> by <p> LAURYN <p> I have experienced some new terrain in the last 2 months . <p> Let me begin by saying I really do n't  want to go on &amp; on about my jaw surgery on the blog , but at the same time its- what I 'm authentically going through right now . So its kind of a catch 22 , ya know ? <p> Obviously I have n't shared every single detail but its hard to not share certain parts of the process &amp; recovery . <p> I 'm very much struggling right now with laying low . <p> I 've discovered in these last two months that I AM VERY , VERY HORRIBLE at just healing , resting , being . <p> And guys , its BAD . <p> I can not take an hour of rest without some kind of stimulation . <p> Do n't  kill me but I remember being an hour out of surgery &amp; returning e-mails . <p> Right out of surgery I was scheduling vet appointments , walking on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working , working more , cleaning the house , making plans , etc. etc. etc . <p> Never letting my body heal , you know ? <p> And then we went to Mexico , which was super fun BUT I am simply not healed enough yet . <p> Waking up early , airplane , travel , working in between , being somewhere other than home , pool , you get it . <p> And if were being honestI got an infection . <p> I got an infection on the right side of my face before Mexico . <p> Its no ones fault , sometimes the body just rejects parts of the metal used for jaw surgery . So my healing process has been a lot longer than normal . I 'm very , very , extra swollen . So long story short , I needed another surgery . <p> Last Wednesday I went into another surgery to remove two screws &amp; get rid of the infection . <p> FUN TIMES ( ! ! ! ) . <p> The surgery went well ( my doctor is awesome ! ! ) - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful there but its very humid which caused the swelling to become worse . <p> Straight from Mexico , I filmed &amp; shot footage for TSC for 8 hours &amp; then worked on my computer for another 4 to 5 hours ( I 'm not complaining , just sharing a peak into what a full blogging day can be like ) . <p> Again , sticking with the theme of being unable to just lay low . Constantly , I have to be on the go , moving , working , going , doing , calling , emailing , reading , cooking , etc . <p> Now I am back from Ixtapa &amp; the infection still is n't healed and I am on antibiotics ( 8 weeks strong ! ) . <p> I am very swollen . I am very tired . I am very fed up . Theres been a lot of frustration tears ( &amp; once I screamed at Michael because he did n't  cut my scrambled eggs up right ) . <p> Anyway , this morning I woke up to a dear , sweet reader named Sam , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reading your last lines about how desperately you are in need of cooling down the inflammation really touched my heart- it 's why I want to help people so desperately . <p> I guess first things first , and that 's your mind/heart . <p> You 've got to have faith that this too shall pass , and believe in the incredible healing capabilities within your body . It 's not broken , it 's just struggling , and needs a good friend and leader to help it pull through and survive . <p> Work with your body , not against it . <p> WOW . WELL SHIT . That resonated . <p> I have been working against my body . <p> Ive been trying to push myself to do too much . If Im tired , I say to myself " push through it . " My blogging schedule has n't  changed because I have n't let it , even if I 'm feeling a little off . My travel schedule happened two days after surgery when maybe I should have RESTED at home . My appointments , meetings , work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am tired . <p> And now look where I 'm at . <p> I have delayed my healing . <h> So now its time for me to : work with my- body , not against it . <p> I should be : resting , sleeping in , getting off the computer at 5 PM instead of 1 AM , taking a break from house chores , being kind on myself , doing VERY light workouts , &amp; JUST CHILLING . <p> Let 's go even deeper : why cant I let myself relax ? <p> I guess I feel guilty ? Which is weird ? <p> I have a lot of responsibilities- with work . I also have a lot of responsibilities that you guys do n't  see with my family , friends , &amp; deadlines . So perhaps I feel guilty to just take care of myself&amp; just do nothing . <p> ( I 've been told this is how it feels to be a motherthoughts Moms ? ) . <h> I just feel guilty to rest &amp; heal . <p> But here 's the deal now : I have no choice BUT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body , my body is going to start working against me . <p> On that note : this weekend I 'm literally doing NOTHING ( I might make Rice Krispy treats though , because does n't  that- sound good ? I feel like they could melt in my mouth since I cant really chew ) . <p> Doing nothing for me has always been doing a million things normally , but this weekend , I really am going to try to do ABSOLUTELY nothing . <p> Will let you know how it goes . <p> Another thing : I have to cancel speaking at Create &amp; Cultivate in Chicago . I AM LITERALLY SO , SO BUMMED but I do n't  think my body can handle traveling in 10 days , speaking at a 3 day conference , socializing , do a blogger meet up , &amp; being away from home with an infection . Physically I feel 60% , not 100% . I 'm SO sorry to any of you that booked tickets &amp; if you did , please e-mail me ! I have a little sorry gift . AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the next Create &amp; Cultivate event . <p> But only when I 'm 100%- healed &amp; feeling like a normal person. - Deal ? <p> If anyone out there has any tips on how to CHILL THE F OUT , please share ! I need help with this one . A lot of help . HA ! <p> Ok , going to bed now : ) . For reals . <p> lauryn <p> PS. my dogs have been the most healing , relaxing lovers on the planet . It makes me cry when I think about how much they 've helped me through the process . Little angels ! <p> Thanks Linda ! You are so sweet ! AH , I really want to be better at taking time to relax . But its hard ! Plus I love what I do ! I love talking to you guys and sharing what I 'm up to . I 'm such a go go go person its soo hard to turn it off ! How do you turn it off ? ? <p> Oh sweetie that really seems horrible ! You need to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know its hard , I 've been sick for the last few months and we finally found out why and I need to rest , but never really do <p> Hi Rosie ! Oh no ! Why were you sick for a few months ? ? Are you okay ? Was it rest related ? I hope you 're doing better . Do you have any tips for learning to rest and take time for yourself ? Help ! Either way , I 'm glad you 're feeling better . <p> Wow Lauren ! ! I always secretly follow you and never leave a comment , but this time I felt like I had to ! So sorry you 're having such a hard time with recovery but i 'm glad you finally figured out what it is that you need . I 'm sure you 'll feel better in no time , just listen to your body and start caring more about yourself and less about us . X <p> LOL no worries ! ! Hi Richelle ! I am so glad you decided to comment , thank you ! But eek ! I could never not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I love sharing my life with you . Thank you so much for being so sweet , seriously you guys have been so supportive . Surgery is a BITCH . &lt;3Lauryn recently posted .. Laying LowBut Actually Really Laying Low <p> Think about Michael , him having had invasive surgery , being very weak , tired , cranky , and needing to heal , how you would make chicken noodle soup for him , keep him in bed , keep him entertained by read a book to him , pamper him , cuddle him , protect him from work and other people , so that he heals and comes back to health gently and quickly . You sit guard and protect him . Now , do that for yourself . <p> Silva omg soooo good . Thank you for the advice . So true . I would def make sure Michael is comfortable and has everything he needs . He would have bone broth any time of day ! LOL . Thank you for the tip , and thank you for the support &lt;3 xxLauryn recently posted .. Laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ! About 2 years ago I had to have emergency surgery at the worst possible time in my life ( or so it feltis there ever a good time for emergency surgery ? ) . The best way I can describe an effective healing process is to just ride the wave . Let your body dictate what you can and cant do , not your mind . Its hard and totally goes against everything we have learned to thrive as adults ( we cant say we did n't  feel like paying our bills , going to work , etc because we werent feeling 100% percent ) . But that 's the best way I can describe how I healed so quick- I gave up controlling and thinking and let my body do the talking . Believe it or not , it knows best during times of physical stress . Tons of love and good vibes your way &lt;3 <p> Mackenzie , first of all , sorry you had emergency surgery . That must have been GNARLY . I at least was able to somewhat plan for my surgery . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to do that ! Do you have any specific tips ? I always just push through , learning to chill is def a struggle . Sometimes I get in work mode , sooo focused , and do n't  realize how tired my body is until I 'm getting ready for bed . Did this happen to you ? Thanks for reading ! xx &lt;3Lauryn recently posted .. Laying LowBut Actually Really Laying Low <p> I can imagine your struggle . I 'm a mother and blogger/you tuber . I do n't  do it consistently enough for that very fact . There is SO much to do ALL the time and I literally cant keep up . I do n't  even know what it feels like to be bored , go to bed early , or have nothing to do . On top of all of that I 'm a Beachbody coach so I 'm always working extra long hours to help others and be available to them most any time . But sometimes you just have to give into it . Rest . Take a bath ( without your phone. ) watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &lt;3 . I 'll send positivity and healing your way ! Tara creel recently posted .. The #1 Way You Are Sabotaging Your Self-Confidence <p> Thank you Tara , ahhh so glad someone gets where I am coming from . Its hard to just TURN . IT . OFF . Do you have any tips for turning it off ? Do you take time for yourself ? I am so interested to find out how people do it ! I need help ! Thanks for reading &lt;3 xxLauryn recently posted .. Laying LowBut Actually Really Laying Low <p> Another notoriously bad relaxer here ! I 'm constantly having to do SOMETHING . Heres what works for me when I absolutely have to heal : <p> I tell myself that right now , healing is my job . Resting is my job . And its the most important job , because until I 'm back on my feet , everything I do is not going to be my best . Another thing is to put serious effort into it , like you 're used to doing with everything else ! Wear the comfiest clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour , etc . <p> Let yourself relax ! Stay at home and watch movies with an ice pack on your face . Stay away from sugar since it creates an inflammatory state in the body , which wont make your infection any better . Do n't  force your body to divide its energy between healing and a million other things . Your readers want the best for you and will still be here when you get back ! Alexa Hampton recently posted .. The Best Gluten Free Banana Bread EVER &amp; Everyday Detox Review <p> Thank you Alexa , you have no idea how much I appreciate your comment . Its so hard ! I cant believe how long its taking to heal Im working on it , learning to relax is definitely a work in progress . LOL <p> I have the same problem . I am ALWAYS doing something but those rare weekends ( 1-2 a year ) where I do just mellow Pillow/blanket forts , records , books , tea and some movies . Documentaries help because you can do nothing and LEARN which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have n't listened to in a long time gets your brain moving and reminiscing but your body stays calm . Anything nostalgic really , old photos , old movies . <p> I think its time Michael takes your computer away ! = I think hot baths , spa music and lots of lemon water with lavender help me chill the eff out . I am that can not absolutely NO person who has to do everything myself , so its hard but I find that if I mentally prepare myself to say no and chill I will . The mind is a powerful thing ! <p> Thank you so much for writing this post Lauryn ! I 'm going through a similar thing- I have tendinitis in my knee and since I am always moving and going a million miles a day , I have delayed my recovery for months now and its been so frustrating . I do n't  know how to rest ! ! I need to work WITH my body too . Enjoy your restful weekend . You look so beautiful and I know this all will pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephanie ! You are so sweet . I hope you recover quickly as well . Maybe we both need to commit to a restful weekend ? Sounds like we both need to take time for ourselves . Be careful with your knee ! Walking is something you definitely do n't  want to be painful through out your life . Feel better babe &lt;3 xxLauryn recently posted .. Laying LowBut Actually Really Laying Low <p> Way to have that revelation and kudos to the reader who gave it to you . When I had surgery , I was literally in bed for a week straight doing nothing but drinking homemade chicken noodle soup but I 'm a PR girl and it was hard to turn off . This may sound silly , but I got myself to relax by doing pretty boring stuff balancing my budget , binging on netflix series , pinning recipes and interior decor . And I did NOT work out , for at least 4 weeks . Did not lift a weight or go above a light jog for more than 30 seconds . Your body is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra stress on it for some time . When it is ready , it will come back to you with so much energy and ready to tackle anything . <p> Thank you for the tips Meg . Sounds like you really took time to recover and your body appreciated it . I 'm taking a page from your book and going for it . Getting in full on zen mode this weekend Thanks for reading babe &lt;3 xxLauryn recently posted .. Laying LowBut Actually Really Laying Low <p> I too have a problem with reminding myself to chill . I have found that meditating works really well for me . I need guided meditation because I alone can not simply turn off my brain . I use this AMAZING app simply called calm . It has TONS of different guided meditations ( everything from energy , confidence , gratitude , anxiety release , sleep and more ) and its FREE ! Hope that helpsit certainly ca n't hurt . Get well soon ! <p> Thanks Brittan ! Def going to check out calm , thank you for rec . Meditation is def @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly . The benefits are endless ! How did you get into it ? Was it hard to clear your mind in the beginning ? I would LOVE meditation tips . Let me know , and thanks for reading ! xx &lt;3Lauryn recently posted .. Laying LowBut Actually Really Laying Low <p> I have been following your blog for years now ( pretty much my entire university days ) and you have been so influential to me and my family as I have passed down tips and sent them countless times your pages of amazing recipes and life hacks . Just like I and my family CAN NOT sit still , I have read that neither can you in this time of healing ! That is what hard work is all about ! I could not even imagine what you are going through and the frustration you feel but please do n't  look at it as guilt or that you 're falling behind ! You are such an inspiration to so many people and guess what ! ? Everyone will be patient with you ( trust me ) ! I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell yourself you are growing stronger and actually believe you feel more and more like yourself each day ! If I could offer any other advice , I am obsessed with essential oils and my nebulizer , here in Canada we have a store called Saje and its my one true love , everything is natural and pure in quality . I 'm sure you have a store just as great back home , but aromatherapy might give you the boost you are craving for , but on the other hand you can used essential oils that can completely calm down your entire nervous system and any built up stress to really help you relax to your fullest . And as you mentioned , keeping your poochies close by ! The power of animals is actually astounding and they are doing more for you than you can possibly imagine ! <p> I 'm done rambling now , but know that this is your time , no ones judging , everyones supporting , so slow down and believe you are healing and the sooner you can identify with the the progression ( even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner you will feel like you ! <p> Thank you SO much for your thoughtful comment . You have no idea how much I appreciate it ! Its been so hard to put my computer /phone / tablet down and just take time for myself , but like I said I am working on it ! <p> Thank you for your support ! And thank you for reading . It means a lot you like the blog . <p> I 'm glad to hear the second surgery went well &amp; that you 're going to ( attempt ) to rest this weekend and work with your body and not against it ! I 'm kind of the opposite . If I 'm doing too much I always need to just rest and reset . I cant always just go go go although most of the time I have to . I feel bad for Michael though , getting yelled at while trying to help .. I 'm not even sure what the right way is to cut up scrambled eggs ? ! ? ! lol . Feel better ! ! ! Sara Hadar recently posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M ! He s been so great through this whole thing . Eeeek Sara , how do you do it ? Do you have any tips for relaxing ? Do you just know that it works so you crave it ? I am in some serious need of R&amp;R . Send your tips , I will be so grateful ! Thanks for reading &lt;3 xxLauryn recently posted .. Laying LowBut Actually Really Laying Low <p> Lauryn , I can completely relate to feeling guilty about taking time for yourself . It always feels like we should be " doing something " . But I truly hope you can now focus on yourself 100% and speed up the healing process for me , even turning off my iPhone and all other devices and just reading or listening to calm music is like a mini vacation for the mind- which will in turn help your physical healing . We are all here supporting you ! Wishing you all the best ! Xoxo <p> Erin , thanks for reading and thank you for your tips . Turning off my phone oh man ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that one LOL . Thanks for your support , and keep the tips coming if you having any more ! Thank you for your support . Surgery sucks xx &lt;3Lauryn recently posted .. Laying LowBut Actually Really Laying Low <p> Thank you for being so honest throughout this whole process . I know something that helps me , is to watch documentaries , where I actually feel like I am learning something while still relaxing . All of us readers are here to support you ! You will feel better in no time ! <p> So sorry to hear you are struggling ! The best advice I can offer is make lists ! Whenever I am physically incapable of doing something I make a list for later . It is simple &amp; silly but it helps me feel like I have a plan and not to be so anxious to " do " it right now . Hope that helps ! <p> I 'm a huge fan of your blog and always get excited about updates and cool little tips you happily share . This time I finally have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " Stop , Breathe and Think " and I know it sounds hella lame but its actually not that bad . You 're probably like " How the F is meditating going to help me ? " I know . Believe me I know it sounds silly . <p> There is a list of meditations you can choose from or you can check in ( rate how you feel physically and mentally and they suggest which meditations might be best ) and they make you feel SO relaxed ! I think when you 're itching to get things done and jump out of bed you might want to try the " body scan " , " gratitude , " " commonality of suffering " or " change " meditations . I 'm not a huge meditator and it sounds super over the top metaphysical sometimes but it has worked for me and some friends so you might want to give it a try . <p> just take a rest , you deserve it , we ( your readers ) will still be here when you are better . take a day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly an amazing and inspiring woman . sending you so many good thoughts and wishes . ( also just got the TSC bombshell body guide and LOVE IT ! ) <p> House work is always my downfall when I need to relax or need to heal from being sick . There seems to be always something to clean or put away , especially when you 're looking all of your own meals to stay on a strict plan ! I would say hire a cleaning crew and do a deep deep clean so you do n't  have to do any chores . If everything is organized and clean , I can attempt to shut off my brain ! Books are always a great distraction , and for some reason reading makes me sleepy and more sleep is always GREAT for healing ! One of my favs is The Night Circus beautifully imagery and totally takes you out of this world with all our lists &amp; commitments ! <p> I am nervous for you being on antibiotics this long . I think you 're doing great with probiotics and clean eating , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar ( even honey , maple ) , alcohol &amp; caffeine . When you 're able to be off of those once your infection is long gone , you might want to look into herbal anti-fungals and following an anti-yeast &amp; anti-sugar diet to reset your gut health . I was on antibiotics for 3 months for my skin ( when they did n't  even help my rosacea turned out to be stress induced ) and it wreaked havoc on my system . Do your very best to eat super clean while healing so you do n't  like the candida get out of control ! <p> Sorry so long ! If you have any more questions about the gut health situ , you can email me ! <p> Short and simple : ditch the phone and computer . I did it once for a week ( honeymoon ) and Ive never felt better . Its hard the first day or two , but then you 're forced to detach from everything . Highly recommend it <p> Lauryn , you NEED to relax . You just had two major sugeries for crying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need some time to relax . Its not the end of the world if you wont be able to blog for a week . We know you , and we know its not what you normally do . Take care of yourself . &amp; I am sure that your friends and family understand too ! We ALL want you to relax , heal , and get well . So take some time to just heal . Do n't  exercise , do n't  make any plans , do n't  clean etc . Just read books , watch movies , cuddle with your dogs and Michael , and just enjoy some well earned relaxing and healing time.Heidi Kokborg recently posted .. Goals for August <p> I am seriously obsessed with you ! I follow many other blogs , but yoursyours is different , anytime I read through your posts I feel like I just had a catch up session with my girls . You have been the inspiration for me starting my own blog So thank you for that ! Anyway.I feel sooooooo bad for you ! ! ! But can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing nothing , so I am just gon na share one thing that helps me . Whenever I need to do nothing but still want to feel productive I watch TED talks . They have so many topics to choose from and they are educational and inspirational . Sometimes I wo n't even watch the screen on my laptop but just put them on and lay back and listen ( not to tire my eyes . ) So even if I spend hours watching them , I still feel productive because I always learn something new and interesting . <p> I used to have the same mentality for years until I met my boyfriend who taught me the art of doing nothing ( sometimes ) . One thing we do is start watching old hit TV shows like Californication , Dexter , and most recentlyEntourage . We watch them from the very beginning to the end . Since the shows are so addicting , its easy to get strapped to the couch for hours , which is good for someone who should be resting on the couch . Try this at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time for yourself . Make is 9 PM . Find a show you want to start from the beginning . It will probably take you a few weeks to get through all the season , but by then , you will probably have gotten the rest your body needs ! <p> I was thinking through the surgeries how you 've managed to continually put out amazing content and material , it was incredible ! But I see now with this its been pushing your body too far : ( . I 'm sorry to hear about the infection , it sounds pretty horrible . <p> Its interesting how our body speaks to us in weird ways , asking for us to notice it and take into consideration what its saying . I think too , when do you actually listen , it speaks to you more clearly and acts more in tune with you than before . <p> Now whenever I hear my body saying something , I say I hear you , I 'm listening and try to acknowledge and respect it for what its saying . <p> I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If i do n't  have something to do I honestly freak out ( and then find something ) . Let me know how you get on with it . <p> I 'd love to know other peoples experiences with always having something to do ? How do you turn off ? <p> First and most importantly , keep your ass in bed/couch and turn the dang computer off = I know it seems like the world will crash down on you , but let 's be real , it wo n't . I am a mom of a 2 1/2 year old ( you actually gave me some advice on food and working out , after I had her ) . ( Prepping for a competition now , just to let you know *lol* ) I am the same way If I get a minute to myself , I am either mopping the floor , folding a load of laundry , check my work schedule or chase behind my dog . Even after I had surgery , I was n't supposed to lift or do anything and what did I do , I carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Needless to say , recovery took longer than it had to . You got some serious work done on your body and this is not the time to push your limits . I wish you the best and a speedy recovery . &lt;3 Jen <p> R.E.S.T . I work in a very busy , high-stress advanced molecular cancer research lab as a research technician . I took 4 full weeks off of work . Did not reply to any emails . Turned my work phone completely OFF . My boss was very very very very VERY annoyed , buuuuut I healed up like a champ after my jaw surgery . Do n't  regret one second of the time I took for me . REST ! <p> I 'm so glad to hear that everything is going well and you 've approached this whole thing with such an open mind . I 'm learning too that just chilling can actually be quite difficult but on the other hand , hey , at least it mean you much love what you do ! &lt;3 xx , Pia <p> Trying to listen to your body over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow yourself to heal . I also have a hard time relaxing and being still . My husband always jokes that when I finally do make it to bed , he can still hear the gears in my brain turning . Meditation is a hint I get a lot but has never worked for me . The one thing that has helped me is to figure out engaging but calm activities that I genuinely enjoy so that when I do need to lay low but know my brain is going to make me crazy , I can break out one of those activities . I think the key is finding things that still engage your brain so you do n't  get the opportunity to be too much " in your head . " For me , I enjoy things like reading , painting , and sewing . Its nice because it feels productive but was not strenuous or frustrating . Hope that helps and that you find your calming activity ! <p> Yikes ! Sorry to hear about all the complications ! ! It is so hard to just sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're used to being such an on the go person . I 'm working through my own injury so this post couldnt have come at a better time . Get better soon ! <p> Can I just say that , based on the time stamps on these comments , none of us are very good " relaxers " as well ? haha ! Its apparently go-time as early as 1:58am ! But seriously , we will all still be here when you 're healed up and there 's nothing at all to feel guilty about . Just know that we love you , were not going to stop reading your blog , and we hope you give yourself some grace . Because we could all use a little grace these days , right ? <p> You poor thing ! I got really sick in highscool and college and had to relax , heal and rest . It was hard having all my friends out at parties , doing highscool things and even having my family go along with their daily routine I learned to love my bed haha . Get some good books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , take an online class . Also there is nothing wrong with working on blog posts or other work obligations just do n't  put time frames on anything . Listen to your body . Also , I know you like watermelon and cinnamon from reading your blog but pomegranates , kiwi and tomatoes actually help with builing your immunity and promotes healing as well . Oh also Honey ! hope that helps a little . Good luck and do n't  feel guilty the people that matter will understand and be there to pick up the pieces . <p> Oh my goodness Lauryn I 'm so sorry Thanks for sharing your struggles and healing process with us . I do n't  think its been too much because it is what your going through and I definitely think it draws us ( your readers ) closer to you ! So its just awesome for us to get a real glimpse into your personal life . I really really hope that you feel better soon and that your body goes into uber healing mode .

Blogspiration : Vision Boards <p> So , I can 100% relate on a different level . After giving birth to Teddy 5 weeks ago I was like ready to conquer the world . I figured , I had given birth naturally so my body kicks ass and I am ready to go . But , I was n't . I did not rest at all and literally got an infection in my boob , which is the most miserable thing I have ever experienced . Since then I have tried my best to rest . I find if you give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there between naps , rest , movies whatever , that helps . <p> Keep doing you . But yes , take a break . Get a few friends to guest post ? Keep on the royal jelly and bone broth and maybe add some grapefruit seed extract ! ! ! xoxoxo <p> You know , I started listening to Joel Ostends latest book because my MIL gifted it to me a few months back and it is just SO inspiring . Here is one tidbit that you can totally take with you on your healing process : <p> You 're going to go through tough times that 's life . But I say , Nothing happens to you , it happens for you. See the positive in negative events . <p> Lauryn , I completely know what you are talkng about ! ! ! When my second child was born and contracted group b strep , it hit me that my best would never be what I wanted it to be . I was used to being on top of everything and putting in the extra time as needed . Time split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NICU , with my husband working fourteen days on with one day off I had to let go . I was a wreck and ended up with mastitis ( breast infection 104 fever , chills , headache etc ) driving to and from home and hospital to visit my little ones , eating in the car and sleeping maybe three hrs a night , relying on friends and family I felt completely defeated . Once I looked at my situation and realized I could n't maintain my usual standards , rather had to be simply what I was needed to be , things got easier and I was able to embrace my temporary situation . Sometimes we can not maintain our usual standards and need to simply be where it is we need to be ! Not easy for me ! Wishing you peace and healing ! <p> Hi Lauryn ! I am so sorry to hear about the recovery process . I cant imagine all the emotions , pain , and struggles involved in the healing probably overwhelming is n't even the right term to describe it . First , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are beyond inspiring to many . And , I just want to let you know Im praying for your healing and recovery . When I know people are praying for me it gives me great comfort the thought of people taking the time to pray for me in the midst of my pain somehow makes me feel a little stronger . With that being said , I 'm so proud of you for resting ! ! Have a blessed weekend sweet one . <p> Hi Lauryn , Please trust in the work you have put into this empire and have faith to " shelf it " for a week or so . It is necessary to be selfish sometimes in life . Your body is telling you to turn off and heal . I promise you will still be beautiful and successful when you return . You will have even more of an appreciation for what you have and what you do . All good things ! But it might be time to actually be bored ! ! = Soon it will all be in the past . I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire me . Lauren <p> I had these same thoughts and situations when I had my nose surgery and I was so depressed not doing something it drove me insane ! I did however read a lot and take time to relax and rest and just realize its ok to do me ! I learned a lot about myself and learned to just be lazy and know its ok ! Reading really helped me pass the time and kept me engaged ! Sending you lots of love and healing vibes xoxo CCourtney bentley recently posted .. Healthy Cinnamon Rolls Recipe <p> Ive been a silent reader of your blog for a long time but when I read this post ( and the one about your surgery , ugh ! ) , I had to comment ! <p> I 've never had such badass surgery ( except from getting all four wisdom teeth removed at one time looked like a hamster and had an infection after that , too ! ) but ive struggled with colds during the beginning of the year . And with struggling I mean : ive been sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cold once in a year but this one started in December ( I 'm a hairdresser and ya know , its Christmas and everyones getting crazy ) and since I could n't rest it would n't get better until March ! ! I just couldnt let my body rest , I had exams and workshops and literally wanted " to get through this shit " which brought me to a serious bronchitis . I was close to pneumonia when I finally decided to rest . It took me two weeks but thanks to healthy food , a loooot of sleep and netflix I cured it . <p> So Lauryn , I know its hard and I 'm definitely not a resting-type-of-girl as well , but your right : listen to your body and you will see how incredible its healing powers are and how SOON you will feel better ! <p> Hi Lauryn ! I 'm a long time reader , first time commenter to your blog , but I just want to say hang in there ! You 're body will recover , and come out stronger than before once its healed Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My little Jack Russel used to curl up and sleep with me all day when I was i 'll . They 're so intuitive &lt;3 Anyway , sending you love and well wishes here from Ireland X <p> My one little bit of advice that I used when I had to take 6 weeks off post surgery was to give myself permission to rest . Once I had given myself that permission it helped me relax and not feel guilty going to work because like you said , I have to work with my body and not against it . Our bodies know best Also I write lists down of things that stress me so its out of my head and so it stops repeating in my head and for some of them I write a solution to further help me relax and to again help me to allow myself to give myself permission to rest ! Youve got this ! <p> In my opinion this time for you is a blessing in disguise . Consider it not only a means of " growing pains " but more importantly a time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilize correctly , is a way to grow your brand in means youve never even imagined . <p> Because chances are , you have n't really slowed down to think where you want you next chapter ( or better yet , your next book ) to take you . <p> As a pioneer intern at FabFitFun , I 've been following you from the beginning and I 'm here to remind you to open your eyes to the beauty of life you have created for yourself ! You have taken TSC into a straight up #GIRLBOSS blog . You are able to make a living off of your very own lifestyle , you have written a well recognized book , and you are about to marry your very best friend ! <p> That is the shit girls dream of ! <p> Just take this time as a sign from the universe to slow the f*ck down and simply enjoy what you have , right now , in this very moment ! You have been working so hard for nearly six years making a name for yourself in this millennial generation and you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the beauty of mexican sunshine , shading palm trees , jalape+o margaritas and precious ass chihuahuas that this life of yours has blessed you with . <p> I may not be your #1 follow but I definitely consider myself a top 10 , and allow me to reassure you " do n't  worry about us , we will continue to follow your fabulously swollen self and TSC all the way down the aisle of your marriage and straight into the beauty of your " happily ever after . " <p> The only thing you should worry about right now is your health ! The true challenge of this experience is to savor the shitty circumstance as a monumental moment of time and just slow your shit down so you can revel in all you have accomplished for yourself ! <p> And if there is one this we can learn from Mr. Kanye West himself ( other than how to dress fly as f*ck and interrupt a tween star during her most monumental moment in life ) its that jaw surgery is the best thing that can happen to anyones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lauryn what you are saying totally resonates . When I had eyelid surgery to correct asymmetric ptosis , I was expectedly swollen for weeks and getting antsy after forcing myself to practically hole up for awhile to allow myself to heal . Pre- and post-surgery I took VitaMedica quercetin and arnica tablets . Post-op I ate as healthy as I could ( lots of omega-3 fish , salads , NO refined sugar or processed foods ) , and plenty of probiotics especially since I had to take antibiotics for infection prevention . Also took fermented cod liver oil/butter oil ( love the Blue Ice brand capsules ! ) . Had plenty of rest and also walked every day ( was not allowed to do more vigorous workouts for at least 2 weeks postop ) . Tried to create a low-stress environment , essentially . All of this helped with the inflammation rapidly and I was told that I healed faster than others . <p> It was hard for me as well to " unhook " myself from the phone , laptop , internet , etc. until I placed scheduled times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps give that a try if not already ? BTW , you sincerely look fabulous both pre and post jaw surgery ! ! Treat your body well and it will thank you back ! I do n't  think anyone would be ( or should be ) offended if you took a week off from blogging or answering peoples emails for a few days or a week for your much needed recovery time ! Wishing you speedy healing ! ! <p> Let me start by saying I am so insanely jealous that you have the ability to lay low . Yesterday I was driving home from dinner with my husband and our kids and I said to him , " Honey , you know this blog I read the girl had major corrective jaw surgery and has spent her summer recovering I am so physically and emotionally exhausted I wish I could have a surgery or something to pause life and recover . " Now , the issue of learning how is another element and I know I would struggle with it insanely as well . <p> here 's the thing : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , a full-time job , a grad certificate program at NYU in progress , I 'm starting a real estate development firm , and I have a husband ( he is super important so I cant forget him occasionally I even get the chance to go on a date and be nothing but his wife for a couple hours ) . I balance a lot . Too much honestly . **fighting tears from exhaustion** <p> When I was completing my undergrad 8 years ago I had a horrible case of pleurisy and pneumonia for 3 months . I never slowed and allowed my body to heal properly . I was young and healthy and had total FOMO ( fear of missing out ) . I jumped straight into grad school , an engagement , marriage , kids , and building a house . AKA Life happens fast really fast . I never properly healed by body and I have a chronic muscle spasm in my back from the pleurisy . I live in constant pain . I do n't  know what life is like without it at this point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still have to figure out how I 'm going to schedule in physical therapy again . <p> And I never stop . I haul two kids , I work , I study , I take care of my home Oh and I 'm still exclusively breastfeeding a baby so I hold the adorable little parasite that he is and give him all the nutrition he needs . My body is soooo depleted . I wish I wish I wish I had slowed down all those years ago and healed . I honestly have so much going on that I cant . I work on my recovery in one hour slots here and there . An acupuncture appointment one day , a yoga class when possible . If I had the ability to pause my life and recover I would do it . <p> My point is , please please please , take the time you need to heal . If you do n't  it could cost you so much pain and heartache later . We do n't  have many opportunities as adults to be selfish , but when they arrive you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Cancel all non-essential activities . Settle into your home . Decorate the new LA house . Heal . <p> Try finding . A yoga studio that does gentle , restorative yoga . I healed from depression that way ! And make sure they know your health issues , you may even be able to get a private session . I highly recommend it . <p> Oh man I feel for you Lauryn ! ! I had pneumonia earlier this year and then I came down with an infection after being on so many antibiotics ( and I HATE antibiotics ! ! ) . I am a full time naturopathic medical student and blogger and always under a TON of stress with school . <p> One thing I have done that helps calm my mind and allows me to rest is floating . Have you ever tried it ? There are tons of float houses popping up these days . It allows for total sensory deprivation and your mind cant help but produce theta waves ( the relaxing kind of brain waves ) when sensory deprived for over 20 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is so so worth it ! ! ! <p> Rest up girl ! When I 'm on overload ( I 'm a 2nd grade teaching during the day , blogger at night ) I take a bubble bath with my favorite Lush products , sip some green tea , and relax with my pup . Good luck with the rest of your recovery , you 'll be back swinging at 100% soon enough ! ! xo <p> I think feeling guilty about doing nothis is super normal , sadly . I saw something I Pinterest a while back that said " stop the glorification of busy " . It really resonated with me and I Remind myself of that frequently . I also recomend a little pot sometimes ! It really helps put things in perspective and helps me chill out . Plus it WAY healthier that alcohol ( especially if you eat it ) . Just my 2 cents , take what you will ! ? ? <p> I 'm incapable of articulating what I feel/have to say ! Because , well , I did n't  think anyone would listen . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . <p> For relaxation , and actually medicine , nothing beats a good laugh , warm hugs , and some creativity . There 's a new trend of relaxation meditation through coloring ; being a kid again , I suppose ! I can not name the specific product , but I 'm seeing some Mandala Coloring Books ( but for adults ) on the market these days ; there was one at my local Vromans book store . Or , just drawing , painting , etcetera . On a technical level , you 're stimulating those ellusive two sides of the brain- both the creative , and the logical . But then you 're reconnecting to your younger years by coloring . Its like someone has taken a load off your shoulders with the drawing part , and letting you roam free with the colors . Writing can be carthartic , too . Or making vision boards , dream journals , etcetera ; power of visualization and affirmations help ! As does gratitude . For laughter , there 's Cards Against Hummanity or Apples to Apples if you 've got friends . Another side game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 players ) is Mexican Train Dominoes . Its a bit complex , but once you get a hang of it , say goodbye to all sense of time . My family will play this game for HOURS . We have yet to complete a full game ; we can start as early as 6 in the evening and not even be done by 3 in the morning . But , well , a good movie does help ! If you 're interested in British humor , may I please recommend Monty Python ? Whether it be the original television show or movies ( Holy Grail is the best , imo ) , its insane yet witty enough to entertain you . There 's also Death At a Funeral , too ! If you like classic films , there 's Its A Mad , Mad , Mad World ( for its time , it was an all star smash comedy hit ; the Three Stooges cameo in it , alongside Jerry Lewis and Bustor Keaton ) . Otherwise , you cant beat the Office ( American ) ! Hmm . Just prepare yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good form of medicine , and you might just get a core workout in , too boot ! I am a cat owner ; we have 2 cats we adopted from the Humane Society , and they have helped me during my health journey as well ( psychological studies have proven that pets can have a positive impact on mental wellness ) . They 're both 4 years old , but are still just as loving and adorable as the day we first brought them home . So animal companions definitely make a difference ! I also think that taking care of them in turn encourages me to pause and take care of myself , too . OK , OK , another one ( boy am I talkative all of a sudden ) is YIN yoga ! Especially when you 're stressed , tired , but want to do some sort of unwinding exercise , look no further than YIN . Its a prescription I write as a yoga instructor to ANYONE looking to give yoga a try . To the seasoned athlete to the newcomer seeking to open up their stiffness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice ; there 's no beginning and end , you simply practice a small handful of poses at time . The catch ? You hold them for long periods of time . Beginners : 1-3 minutes . Intermediate : 5-8 minutes . Advanced : 10-16 minutes . Yogi Nora on Youtube has a great sequence . Modify each position to your current physicality . When holding the pose , surrender into the first sensation of a stretch . Little by little , you 'll find yourself loosening up and easing even deeper . Always focus on the breath and alignment . With Yin , you focus even more on the pose and your entire state of being because you are not distracted by transitions , pacing , or order . Soon enough , you can even multi-task in Yin ! Set up a mat and a comfy spot in front of the TV or your bedroom . I 'm addicted to reading books in certain positions , and am also guilty of checking my phone . But I try to at least invest a little bit of time in the beginning to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are my tips ! Relaxation depends on the person , of course , but getting into the zone where time has no meaning and you are just so involved in the task at hand makes a difference . Get well soon , Lauryn ! <p> You definitely need to get some rest girl ! For someone as driven as you I 'm sure its hard to take a work break , but people will understand , and what 's one week over the course of your whole career ? I 'm sure you 're restless , but one of my favourite things to do when I know my body needs some chill time is to listen to an audiobook and then do something small with my hands , whether that 's playing a brainless game , giving them a massage , or scrolling through insta ( mindlessly ! ) Laura @ Lauras Best Life recently posted .. 5 Tips for Your Best At-Home Spa Night Friday Five <p> Happy for you that you 're finally laying low ! I 'm with you and absolutely hate sitting still ( that 's why I 'm a terrible sick person too ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going on ) . I 'll miss you and Create + Cultivate though ! I live in Chicago and have been SO excited about the conference and *maybe* meeting or hearing you speak ( b/c you 're a serious #GirlBoss when it comes to branding and growing a blog , obvii ) . But hopefully some other time b/c you 're for sure doing the right thing by just hanging back . Hope you have a uber speedy recovery ! <p> You need some ganja goodies to relax ( depending on how you react to miss MJ ) , sleep to heal ! You 're doing everything else right ! I look up to your work ethic though ! To keep you sane maybe give yourself 1-2 small " work " tasks to keep moving forward and feeling accomplished ! Xoxoxo feel sososo much better soon ! PS also reading through the comments , I agree with the readers that talk about mind over matter . It can heal ANYTHING to just believe that you will be healed and that your body IS healing . Just believe ! ! Maybe get funky with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? ! LOL might lead to some good vibes ; ) ; ) love you Lauryn ! <p> Oh dear , infection is no joke babe ! I know what you mean though , as I read this post I 'm currently feeling pretty i 'll but I cant not work on the blog ! <p> I 'm already a really chill person ( I think growing up in Brasil helped with that ) , so usually I have no problem laying low and relaxing if I need to . Watching a movie , reading a book , taking a nap , going to the beach I love it all ! <p> Hope you feel better , with lots of snuggles from Michael and your chihuahuas ! <p> Hi Lauryn , love your blog ! I have learned so many cool and informative info from it . That said I 'm sorry to hear of your hard time laying low . I have a couple of tips for you , the first is ( one I do n't  know if I got from your blog , but I love ) . Try the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( its on Amazon ) I love it to message and debloat my face , after workouts , or on my back when it is giving me fits . Its so refreshing , a little cold at first but the results are immediate . Second one is that I suspect your inability to lay low has alot to do with anxiety , I know you struggle with it ( I do too ! boo : -() anyways as you know anxiety takes a lot of energy , your healing takes a lot of energy , and trying to live your " norm " sounds like it takes extra energy . Your poor body does n't  have enough to heal up . I know you are not big on pharmaceuticals , but a very small dose of anti-anxiety meds could do wonders for you . You would not have to be on it long , just long enough to relax and let your body heal . You already take such good care of yourself , your body just needs to chillax and do its thing . I only say this because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so much anxiety from not being able to do much , that I was making myself crazy , that little dose helped me to relax and heal ( plus I got feel like what it was like to live with out any anxiety for awhile ) . Just a suggestion about the meds , but the ice roller is the bomb ! Feel better soon ! Love your pups ! I have 3 Chihuahuas , they 're the best ! <p> Oh Lauryn Ive just read this now and wanted to reach down the line and give you a big hug . Give yourself as much love as you give to us , your readers . When I had massive surgery , I found New Zealand Manuka Honey ( make sure its the 10+ HMF active plus ) to be awesome for swelling and healing . That and sleep and yep , sorry to say , lying around not doing much . And yes , meditation is the bomb . Most if all be kind to yourself . Xxx <p> I have to admit I definitely teared up a tad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference this weekend . May or may not have been the reason I wanted to go Lol . But you 're so inspiring and such a hard worker that it only makes sense for you to need your rest . The fact that you want to keep working after having such major surgery(x3) is incredible . I hope your recovery is speedy . Just know that were all praying for you ! xoxOlivia recently posted .. August Picks <p> I definitely have the same problem . Even when I have leisure time , my mind is usually racing and planning/organizing . Its pretty bad and it affects my sleep sometimes . I discovered an app called Buddhify that guides you through meditations . I cant just meditate in silence because I 'll inevitably start having racing thoughts . This app actually helps me though , and just trying to enjoy the present moment and surroundings instead of being glued to my phone . Its hard but its worth it . I know you 're in a shitty place right now , but when I am ( physically/mentally ) , I try to just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the mind is everything and you will surpass this soon enough . &lt;3 <p> I 'm so glad to hear you 're feeling better and getting back in the swing of things . I was wondering if now that you 're starting to feel better you have any tips for someone now facing your position ? I have pretty much the exact same personality type as you and my doctor yesterday told me I need to quit exercising completely and reduce my stress drastically or I could be at risk for a heart attack or my organs shutting down ( long story ) due to my health problems . I have n't missed a day of working out in a year and the thought gives me so much anxiety , plus I do n't  even know how to reduce my stress drastically when my life is always on the go and I do n't  even remember the last time I had free time . I am having such a hard time with the thought of doing less but the doctor ordered itAny tips for not going insane ? : / I 'm a college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I just got ta get my health in order before all that stress sets in again !

@@3098592 <p> Basically according to this source , " caramel coloring is manufactured by heating ammonia and sulfites under high pressure , which is what creates the carcinogenic compounds. - Animal testing has resulted in liver , lung , and thyroid tumors in mice. - Coke and Pepsi changed their formulas when it was discovered that caramel coloring could be contributing to thousands of cancer deaths every year because they were using dangerous amounts of it in their sodas . They figured it could be bad for business if they had to include a cancer warning label on the can or bottle . And do n't expect the FDA to protect you because caramel coloring is still on their list of approved additives .

First , no more crushed bugs in the strawberry juice . Within two weeks of that being brought to light , they changed the formula . The red coloring is now extracted from tomatoes . Second , no more caramel coloring in the oatmeal . They switched from processed crap to stone ground oats . Both changes happened relatively recently , though within the last 18 months . <p> That said , I hate that we even sell frappuccinos and other disgusting syrups .

And its pretty damn inspiring . <p> Niki Connor : My name is Niki Connor , I 'm originally from San Diego and moved to New York from Los Angeles a few years ago to start my business and continue my education . I 'm a Holistic Health &amp; Nutritional Counselor and Plant-Based Personal Chef specializing in gluten-free vegan cuisine . Ive been into health and fitness all my life and am a former professional athlete ( nationally competitive show jumping &amp; American football ) , so I absolutely love what I do , though there 's still much to learn ! <p> I 'm starting my studies in Ayurveda this fall and am saving for culinary school right now to become certified there as well . I 'm a self-taught chef ! It all started when some of my clients came to me complaining that the food options at their offices were terrible or they did n't  have time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that I 'm a health and nutrition practitioner and my family and friends love my dishes , I decided to start preparing food for clients as well . I now make portion-controlled meals ranging from snacks and office lunches , home-cooked dinners for families and catering small events . <p> Though I only prepare gluten-free vegan meals , many of my clients are not vegan , so I let them do what they want with the dishes once I 'm done with them , though most end up enjoying them as they are because they do n't  taste healthy or vegan , including their kids ! I 'm currently working on creating a site to share some of my recipes , so stay tuned ! The reason my company is called TheH3 ( Healthy * Happy * Hot ) is because my whole message for my work is becoming beautiful from the inside out physically , mentally , &amp; emotionally . <p> Health and fitness is just as mental as it is physical , so I spend 6 months to a year with each client because its about making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To get that glow you do n't  just need to look good , you need to feel good too ! <p> +- Ok so what 's the deal with the mushroom powder ? - I tried it &amp; I 'm obsessed ( &lt;&lt; post to come ! ) : <p> NC : Aside from my own business , I also work for the company Matrix Healthwerks . We grow certified organic medicinal mushrooms in North County San Diego to create the products &amp;- theyre- improved my health &amp; overall well-being dramatically . We take different species and turn them into powder form so that we can package them on their own as well as blend different species together to provide a range of nutritional benefits . <p> The Lions Mane and Cordyceps helped me get off of medication completely , and with the Beauty Matrix blend , I have to cut my nails every week and my hair is growing like crazy ! Since I started taking the Mushroom Matrix products , I 've only been sick once in three years because mushrooms are a true superfood &amp;- boost your immune system like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-GMO , vegan , kosher , raw , &amp;- full of powerful antioxidants to help reduce free-radical damage . Taking a scoop of NRG Matrix or Fit Matrix in a bottle of water or juice prior to a workout is an absolute must , and I like to follow that with a post-workout smoothie containing Beauty Matrix . <p> + Favorite ways to get- healthy proteins ? <p> NC : I do n't  usually call myself a vegan because I cant give up my precious leather pants , but I do eat vegan and though I have n't been diagnosed as gluten-intolerant , I avoid it as often as possible because I feel much better without it and know that 's the healthier way to go for everyone . The first thing people ask me when they find out that I eat vegan is " how do you get your protein ? ! " <p> How do you think gorillas get their protein ? Plants ! <p> Wow , I just compared myself to a gorilla.great . Anyways , I 'm obsessed with E3Live , a blue-green algae that is the most protein-rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than animal protein , over 65 vitamins and minerals , and nearly five times more chlorophyll than a shot of wheatgrass . It must be kept frozen , so I like to freeze mine in ice trays so that I can pop a cube into my daily juices and smoothies . I can assure you that it does n't  taste bad and will make you feel full and energized every day . <p> I 'm also a fan of protein-rich hemp , chia seeds , flaxseeds ( its better to get them ground so that your body does n't  have to break them down ) , veggies , nut butters , &amp; legumes . <p> + Got ta know : what 's your favorite healthy fats ? <p> NC : Clients often ask me if they should go on a " low-fat diet . " Hell no ! <p> That word " diet " alone makes me shudder . Just like there are good carbs and bad carbs , there are good fats &amp;- bad fats . I make my own nut butters ( almond , cashew , peanut ) &amp;- I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I avoid soy products aside from the occasional tofu or edamame , because too much soy can cause excess estrogen exposure &amp;- over 90% of the soy in the US is genetically modified ( AKA GMOs ) . <p> The reason I 'm not a fully-raw vegan is because I 'm not meant to be , with my heritage ( White Mutt ) , my body goes out of whack if I only eat raw for over two weeks straight . Instead of doing juice cleanses , I 'll add raw dishes to stay energized , full , &amp;- active during the process . <p> I 'm not one of those hardcore vegans , because it would break my grandmothers heart if I refused to eat at least one of her cookies when I visit , and if I go to a birthday party &amp; Im- offered cake , I 'll take a bite or two . If I only ate at vegan restaurants , I would n't have much of a social life because most of my friends and family are carnivores . How I am in my everyday life alone is not always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there are times where I 'll be stuck dining at a steakhouse , so I learned how to " order smart " , a method I teach clients as well . <p> Why do we love restaurants ? Well , for one , someone else is preparing the food for you , but its also usually better than the food that you make at home . The problem is how the food is prepared in restaurants , because that egg white omelette you 're eating tastes better than the one you make at home because it was cooked in nasty , fatty butter . Yuck ! <p> I ask for all of my cooked dishes to be prepared in olive oil instead of butter and tell the waiter that there 's no need to bring bread to the table to tempt me . I also travel with my own snacks and eat at home before going out to eat , which helps a lot ! I 'll make a filling salad or green juice so that I spend less and stay fuller longer when I 'm out and about . When you live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to spend smart ! <p> Thoughts on meditation ? I know you 're big on it ! <p> NC : I 'm obviously a busy bee living in the most stressful city in the country , but I maintain a healthy balance through meditation and maintaining a positive attitude . I used to think that it would be too difficult to meditate because I have ADHD , but its so simple ! I meditate one to three times a day for at least ten to twenty- minutes each time . The best times to meditate are sunrise , noon , and sunset . I do n't  always get to do it at those times , but I try my best . Now that I meditate more often , I do n't  need as much sleep anyway ; I recently met with Tony Robbins healer in Hawaii , and he only sleeps three to four hours a night because he meditates so much yikes ! <p> I for one love sleep , but now that I 'm sober and meditate more , Ive become more of a morning person . Doing yoga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards . Sit on the ground with your back straight ( you do n't  have to sit like Buddha ) , and focus on your breathing . The way I start is by counting ten breaths in , &amp; ten breaths out . It slows down your heart rate almost immediately and gives you this beautiful feeling of floating in your body . Once you 've slowed down your breathing , you can focus on relaxing every part of your body from your toes to your eyes . By focusing on your breath , all other worries are eliminated from your mind , &amp; you come out of it with a big smile on your face . <p> Go-to green drink ? <p> NC : I 'm going to share my favorite green juice and post-workout smoothie recipes , green juice is my favorite way to start the day after consuming a cup of hot water and fresh squeezed lemon on an empty stomach . This juice gets rid of bloating and keeps you full and energized for hours ! Its important to consume a high-protein meal within thirty minutes of completing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  mean you 'll bulk up , it will just help maintain a fit physique and keep you fuller longer . I name my juices and smoothies after my favorite albums and songs because Im weird like that . All ingredients are certified organic , of course ! <p> NC : As far as workouts go , I am an absolute beast in the gym . Not one of those bodybuilders who grunts and struts around barely clothed , but I take it very seriously . I have a trainer who I see once or twice a week , and other than that I do workouts on my own . Friends think its ridiculous that I have a trainer because I practically grew up in a gym , but for me its important to maintain proper form and avoid injury . <p> I did CrossFit back when I lived in LA , and it totally ruined my body . Luckily my trainer specializes in physical therapy as well , so he helped " fix me " . Ive been working out with trainers since I was twelve years old and Dariusz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh Jackman how to use Kettle Bells and taught me how to get strong without getting buff by using my entire body in workouts &amp; also writes me workout plans for me to use while traveling . <p> Ive been doing yoga for about fourteen years , but I have no desire to do a headstand , I do it at my own pace and use it as my time to stretch and focus on my breathing . I do bikram yoga two to three- times a week , weights three times a week , and cardio for thirty to forty five- minutes four to five days a week . I always allow a few- days of rest . <p> I absolutely love Pilates , but unfortunately its very expensive in New York , so I have n't done much here . I 'm planning on starting a weekly fitness boot camp for friends in the city using workouts that I learned from football that blast fat &amp;- get lean muscle faster . I do n't  do them by myself because its a group effort , but it can be done on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup I love Josie Maran , Tartes Amazonian Clay collection , &amp; RMS Beauty . I have very sensitive skin and suffered from cystic acne as a teenager , so these products work great for anyone ! I have naturally wavy hair and am lazy with it , so I usually air-dry my hair , but sometimes its fun to blow-dry it straight or throw it up in a top knot . <p> My daily beauty routine is facial oil , eye cream , sunscreen , curled lashes , mascara , under-eye and spot concealer , tinted moisturizer , blush , and a loose setting powder that wont dry out my skin . I learned recently that applying concealer before foundation or tinted moisturizer helps it last longer too ! I have some of the worst eyebrows ever , though they look full in photos , most of that is from makeup ! Ever since childhood , my eyebrows did n't  grow much past the midpoint and get blonde easily , so I use makeup and have them tinted .

@@3098614 <p> Today I am talking hair my hair that is , &amp; I seem to take a different approach than most when it comes to my mop top . Ive been reluctant to openly share about my hair habits , but Lauryn asked , &amp; when Lauryn asks- she receives ! <p> So , Ive broken my hair have-tos down into five basic categories : <p> 1 . Washing <p> 2 . Conditioning <p> 3 . Hot tools <p> 4 . Weekly moisture masks <p> 5 . Styling <p> Why have I been a bit reluctant to dish all my hair secrets ? Truthfully , because Im scared to have you guys running for the hills once you find out about #1but here it is . <p> 1 . The dirty secret when it comes to my hair ? <p> I do n't  shampoo it . <p> Ever . <p> I try stay away from shampoo like the plague . <p> This idea to stop washing my hair came to me over months of hair envy of my husband . He decided to grow out his hair and he noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poofier So he simply stopped using shampoo . <p> I hinted , then urged , then I was vocally grossed out by thisbut , after time his hair just kept getting more and more awesome . I could n't deny what I was seeing everyday . It was shiny , thick , and never ever greasy or smelly . In fact , it smelled good . How ? ! ! <p> I hopped on the inter-web and found a whole community of no-poo shampooers ( no-poo shampooers are people who choose to not use shampooyou think they could have come up with a better name , right ? ) &amp; I was astounded by the mass amount of information out there that points to shampoo being the culprit of a lot of modern day hair issues . <p> In short , it all boils down to this : the detergent in shampoo strips your hair of its precious natural oilslike the ones were paying an arm and a leg to put back in ( i.e. : MoroccanOil &amp; Argan Oil ) . The more you wash with shampoo , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more oil your scalp has to produce to fill the oil deficiency you 're creating each day . <p> So I stopped . I just stopped shampooing . I found a product called Wen , which is a cleansing conditioner , and replaced my shampoo with that . It cleans your hair while simultaneously conditioning , and it uses no detergents , sulfates or harsh chemicals . In fact , Wen does n't  even lather while its in your hair . <p> Immediately I noticed results . And even better- I found that after using Wen for a few weeks I could go longer in between washes . My hair was n't producing too much oil anymore , thus , no need to wash it as often , so I went from every other day washings to once a week over the span of two months . <p> After this , it was only natural that I started to tap into other forms of no-pooing shampooing and I found the baking soda method . I tried that &amp; loved it , too ! <p> The deets : <p> SHAMPOO : <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one week , let 's say on Thursday , then the following Thursday I would wash using the baking soda method . The Thursday after that , I would go back to washing with Wen . I like to switch it up to keep my hair guessing . <p> 2 . CONDITIONING : <p> Wen is an awesome conditioner on its own , but when I feel like I need to repair any damage I 've created to my hair by bleaching , or by using hot tools then I use Kerastase Nutritive Masque Nutri-Thermique . Its the best restorative conditioner I 've found yet . I apply it after I wash and let it sit for 10 minutes , then rinse . <p> Leave-in Conditioners are a must , &amp; ITs A 10 Leave-In is my favorite because it does ten things in one . I put this in my hair after each shower whether I no-poo shampoo or not . <p> 3 . HOT TOOLS : <p> Its so , so important to invest it quality hot tools . I fought this for a long time , but when I finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow-dryer .. GUYS , it was LIFE CHANGING ! Ok , so that might be slightly dramatic , but it takes me half the time to dry my hair and when Im finished drying , my hair feels silkier and healthier than before . <p> Once a week I make one of two different homemade masks to restore and moisturize my hair . I switch off between a Raw Coconut Oil Mask &amp; an Avocado/Mayo Mask. <p> 1 . Organic Raw Coconut Oil Mask <p> What does coconut oil do ? Well , because of its chemical structure , coconut oil can actually penetrate the cortex ( the inner part of hair ) which can help improve its strength and flexibility . I buy mine from Trader Joes . <p> * The coconut oil is solid at room temp , so I run the jar of it under warm water to soften it up and make the application process easy-peasy . When the oil is softened , I slather it from root to tip of my dry or damp hair , then massage it in . From here , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then go on a cleaning frenzy in my house . After sixty minutes , I rinse the coconut oil out in the shower with hot water and the Wen method of washing . Sometime I will have to do two rounds of washings to get all the oil out . Dry as usual . <p> * Mix the above ingredients together until it is in a smooth , creamy consistency , then apply it from root to tip of your dry or damp hair using an old paint brush . Wrap your hair tightly up in Saran Wrap , or use a shower cap , then leave this mask on for thirty-sixty minutes to reach maximum moisture benefits . Rinse with hot water in the shower and the Wen method of washing . Dry as usual . <p> ** I suggest investing in a removable shower head if your ready to embark on the no-poo shampooing/home made hair mask journey . With a removable shower head , you can get the water right to your scalp with great water pressure which helps a lot when rinsing out heavy masks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick up is cornstarch . <p> I use good ole regular cornstarch in place of dry shampoo and styling products . It works better , trust meAnd I know , I knowright now you 're saying , " But ! I have dark hair-that wo n't work for me . " Im hear to tell you YES IT WILL ! <p> If you have dark hair , just add a little cocoa powder to the corn starch before you toss it around your roots and you have will the world best dry shampoo/volumizer/ texturizer out that matches your hair . The cornstarch helps to hold your style while soaking up any excessive oil throughout the day . <p> Styling trick numero dos : Bellami clip-in hair extensions . <p> I recently came across these guys and they have quickly become what I consider to be the holy grail of hair styling . <p> These clip in hair extensions are not to be compared to any other beauty shop clip in extensions out-theyre truly in a league of their own . Bellami uses real hair that is so soft and actually stays that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the hair holds it style so well . You see , I have learned my lesson the hard way when it comes to non-clip in hair extensions , and never will I ever have any form of hair semi-permanently attached to my head againand you should n't either . <p> Why ? <p> Because they 're too damaging ( plus annoying ) , and to me , its not worth six weeks of long , luscious , awesome hair for one whole year of repairing the damage semi-permanent extensions create.So , thank the good lord above for Bellami coming out with theeeee most amazing clip in extensions everrrr . Guys , everI mean it , ever . <p> And to be clear , they are not paying me to say a this .. in fact , no brand I have named is .

Being a technician of Ondamed I often see programs like adrenals , thyroid , pituitary come up for clients . and So far here is what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the air traffic control tower that orchestrates 9 different hormones besides the other hundreds of functions it does . So needless to say it is a super important gland and a sluggish pituitary gland can create the inability to lose weight , heavy periods , headaches , and depression . The answer is for women , particularly menstruating women , is not to be prescribed progesterone creams and such . This approach does not take into account the reason for the deficiency which most often stems form pituitary and factors that lead to poor pituitary function , include addrenal fatigue , taking oral contraceptives ( and who would have thought ) , or even postpartum hormonal changes . For Menopausal women for whom he pitutary fuction may never be rebound biodentical hormones should be taken , so this is when you have to do all that Suzanne Sommer stuff . If she had found out what she knows now when she was your age she could have prevented it . Supporting the integerity of addrenals is importnat for both mensrtating and menopausal women . That 's a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and lay off the caffine , alcahole , and keep physical and mental body stress to a minimum , I do a pitutary practice , chant , Kundilini yoga has a few . xoxo come see me soon . <p> Dr. Christiane Northrup has an *amazing* book called " Womens Bodies , Womens Wisdom " . My friends , acquaintances and myself refer to this book as The Womans Handbook . In her discussion of hormones , she talks about vitamins and minerals that help and explains why . A year ago I used her book to put together a set of daily vitamins to take and my PMS symptoms have decreased considerably ! The one pill I take that makes the biggest difference is the Magnesium . Take a look at this book and work at a personal answer that your body responds to . <p> I 'm going to have to be really boring on this one and say that this is something you should talk to a doctor about . There are all kinds of less direct ways to combat hormone imbalances , and messing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , dangerous . <p> Artificial hormones and creams not prescribed by a doctor are also pretty sketchy and can have really bad effects on your pets even if you 're doing something as seemingly benign as petting your dog after using the creams . I 've seen spayed dogs get cut open again because they looked pregnant , only to find that they had been having hormonal troubles because of human hormone creams . <p> Totally agree with you Lauren . My husband is in the medical field , but definitely not an endocrinologist . We know enough to not trust all of this random stuff out there about hormones . The best thing to do is talk to a doctor , either gyno for womens hormone issues , or an endocrinologist for more advanced issues . Hormones and the endocrine system are the probably the least understood in the body . Therefore , doctors even have trouble with diagnosing and treating &amp; they have all those years of training to back it up . However , it does n't  hurt to cut down on caffeine or alcohol because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very fascinating . They also end up in the liver , so if you 're liver is out of whack , your hormones can keep circulating around and around , which can mess a person up ! I have a friend who went to see her naturopath and started taking bioidentical hormones and said they 're amazing ! Definitely worth considering if going through menopause or after pregnancy ( I 've heard ) . I read a great book called The Hormone Diet a few years ago . It helps you get all your hormones back in check through foods ! Hilary recently posted .. A Happy Home For Your Leftover Quinoa <p> I always had a regular period cycle and pretty clear skin . I PMSs a little but in all honesty I 'm kind of just a moody person so PMS is n't really an excuse when its happening all the time for me haha <p> Anyways , In the past 6 months Ive gone through a little transformation where I work out every day now and eat very healthy foods mostly vegis , fish , chicken , and fruit . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 30 lbs and in general lead a much more active/healthy lifestyle . WellthankfullyIve accomplished that . Exercising is now a normal daily habit just like eating for me and I eat extremely healthily &lt;is that a word ! ? Anyways I have n't gotten my period now for 4 months . For obvious reasons this made me very concerned . <p> Thankfully , I 've gone to my Gyno and had test done etc .. and they say it 's all good and that it 's just because my hormones are probably in shock . <p> Funny how when I regularly get my period I 'm annoyed with it and now that I have n't gotten it , I 'm even annoyed at the absence of it because of worry . Dr 's assure me it 's all good but it 's still an annoyance . Oh and no , I 'm not pregnant . <p> My skin on my face has also started to become a little acne prone thank goodness for apple cider vinegar which I regularly use as a toner or else I 'd really be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks for the article .. feels like I may not be the only one with fluctuations ! <p> I 've had similar issues since I 've been training for a marathonall the sudden my period is all out of whack and my skin is terrible ! You would think it would be the opposite ! ? But I 'm hoping its only temporary and my body is just adjusting to some major changes . Congrats to you though on the healthy lifestyle ! Lindsay recently posted .. Would You ? Wednesday <p> I started taking Laminine about 6 weeks ago , along with the bioidentical hormones I have been using for the past 4 years . I wonder if I should go off the hormones as you did . I am a little worried about coming off them cold turkey . Any thoughts ? <p> I 'm about to read The Mood Cure , about balancing your hormones and I also started taking Grass Fed Gelatin which helps with removing excesss estrogen from you body which a lot of femals have . I hope to gain some wisdom from the book b/c like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the month&gt;&gt; Peace n Love <p> You may consider getting your thyroid checked . A thyroid imbalance can effect you in so many ways ! <p> FWIW , I did notice a difference for me , especially around that time of the month , that I had less mood swings after I had gone off the pill and once I was working out more frequently.Kelly recently posted .. Another weekend in the books <p> Hahaha Lauryn- this post could not be more perfect for the week I am currently having . I would love to learn more on this topic to help manage the inner b***h that has come out almost every month around this time . Its exhausting ! haha <p> I 've learned that a lot of what we think are hormone problems are actually lymphatic ones . When I went to Mayo and complained of seemingly hormonal issues anxiety , hot flashes ( I 'm 19 what the hell ! ) , breakouts , bloating , etc. -I found out that my lymphatic system was severely blocked . Super scary . Anyways , my amazing doctor at Mayo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to switch their focus to the lymphatic system , as its often the most ignored yet also the most important system in our body . Food for thought . <p> Love this post ! I have PCOS so my hormones are all out of whack Its literally the most frustrating/confusing thing ever ! When I first went on the Pill my moods would go from zero to mega bitch in 2.7 seconds flat . Oh the joys of being a girl <p> I disagree with hormone replacement , especially for menopause . Our bodies are naturally supposed to go through it , so we should n't fight it . Plus , if we take care of our hormone glands now , we wont have those common menopause symptoms . I am 24 and was experiencing menopause-like symptoms including hot flashes . I was extremely tired all the time and could not even function at work . I researched for weeks and found out about adrenal fatigue . My symptoms matched so I decided to try the diet that would get them back into shapelots of veggies , protein , no carbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cookies , etc . I thought it would be really hard . After 2 days , I was 200 times better . I ate only veggies and protein for another week and when I decided to eat a piece of bread , all my symptoms came back . From one piece of bread . That 's how I found out I was gluten intolerant . The adrenal glands become fatigued from all kinds of stress , mental and physical and that includes food allergies . Most people have fatigued adrenals and that can throw off a lot of hormonal processes in the body . When you go through menopause , your ovaries stop providing hormones and your adrenal glands take over , but if they are not functioning properly , then they cant really do their job properly.hence awful menopause symptoms . <p> I believe in fixing the source of the problem , not just treating symptoms . <p> Hormone Replacement Junkie here ! ! ( A little Late on this post clearly ) Two years ago I was rushed to the hospital for what they though was an annurism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After several testings they found a tumor the size of a cherry on my Pituitary Gland . ( a gland that is only the size of a Cherry Pit- and also the gland that regulates all of the hormones produced in your body ) . After my surgery I lost all of my Hormone function and by all i mean ALL ! I no longer produce , Adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( ACTH ) Thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) Prolactin ( PRL ) Growth hormone ( GH ) Melanocyte-stimulating hormone ( MSH ) Anti-diuretic hormone ( ADH ) Oxytocin <p> ( in normal terms : my thyroid , adreanal , kidney , testosterone , estrogen , Human Growth , and many others are dead ) I entered menopause at the ripe age of 21 and have been working to reverse what has happened to my body . <p> Human growth hormone is a fat burning hormone that is produced in the pituitary gland which is located in the brain . It is an important complex hormone that is involved in the building of lean muscle , cartilage , and collagen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent upon growth hormone .

@@3098618 <h> Why I Hate Tadpoles ! ! ! + Brow 101 <p> My tadpole definition : when a women goes Tweezerman-crazy &amp; over-plucks her brows to the point of almost no return . Its when the brow is shaped exactly like a little , tiny tadpole &amp; it sucks ass . <p> This weirdo description came to me circa 2009 , while watching The Bachelor . Half the girls who were desperately vying/drooling/bawling for the final rose ( naturally it was the most shocking season yet- GASP ! ) had tadpole shaped brows . <p> I mean , hello ? ! ! ! I searched the show , frantically , for more of a groomed caterpillar brow . And to my dismay , it was slimmmmm pickings ! <p> I literally ca n't stand tadpoles . They take away from the beauty of every girls face ; usually they 're over-done , over-plucked , &amp; just sick ! <p> Brows are my thing . I get them done at least once a month by one of the above two ladies ( Claire and Lindsay ) &amp; lemme tell ya- these babes know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best brow secrets : <p> + I get them tinted at least once a month ( sometimes two if Im lucky ) . <p> + I 'm seriously obsessed ( like , in a I-cant-live-without-it type of way ) with this brow kit . It comes everywhere with me . <p> + Cautionyou may think I 'm a total freak , but I brush my brows every day ( ESP after I apply brow powder on them ) . My favorite clear mascara AKA brow brush can be found here . Its a real life changer . <p> Claire Long : I 've been an esthetician for thirteen years now &amp; brow shaping has always been one of my favorites ! I had a bad brow experience in high school followed by a few years of over-tweezing . I finally figured it out &amp; just let them grow in ! <p> Lindsay Gowen Merrell : My brow background begins with the great Anastasia Soare ( brow guru to the stars ) . I was an esthetician before I met her , but as most of us know , that does n't  mean jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my world upside down with her knowledge of brow beauty . Now , I follow her theory &amp; mix my esthetic . It works beautifully for meand my clients : ) . <p> + WTF does the perfect brow look like ? ! <p> Claire : We can only work with what we 've got , so I try to make the brows as perfect as they can be for that persons face . I work in all straight lines when creating the shape of the brow . I think a strong high arch &amp; keeping as much length on the ends is super important . I also give them a good trim ( not too short ) it gives a much more polished look . I have clients of all ages so I keep younger girls brows age appropriate . <p> Lindsay : A perfect brow ? There 's no such thing . There are so many . Its kind of " a what 's perfect for you " type thing . Were all genetically blessed with different strengths BUT . full and sexy are my ideals . <p> + Any DIY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the DIY method , but if necessary tweeze only the obvious strays . Its really hard to have a good perspective on your own brows &amp; to keep them even when that set of tweezers is in hand .. <p> Lindsay : DIY= less is more . If you 're growing out , fill the brows in before tweeting . That way you are n't  tempted to tweeze team players . <p> Claire : I 'm obsessed too ! ! Thank god for brow tint ! I searched high and low for the best brow tint around . I use a brand called refectocil . I find that it lasts a lot longer than its competitors . The more often that you get your brows tinted , the longer it lasts .. If you let it all fade out its harder for your brows to hold the color than if you retint them sooner . If some like super dark brows I usually double tint them . Tint them once , remove , then immediately tint again . This helps to saturate that brow with color . In order to preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what you are putting on your brow area . Check your cleansers , serums and moisturizers- a lot of ingredients can lighten your brows quicker , so can chlorine ! <p> Lindsay : Tinting is a must if your hair is a different shade than your brows . For example : warm hair + ashy brows= ewww . Other an that , its up to personal taste . I love a hot blonde that can go bold with her brows . Just think , " Scar Jo . " <p> Hahah tadpole brows , Thats hilarious and I so know what you mean ! I know plenty of people guilty , and I know I can go nuts with my tweezers ! I lost them last week though and was forced to not touch them ( like the lady always tells me when she waxes me ) so we shall see if I can get them how I want them with patience <p> My brows are so thin and I have such issues growing them ! I use a pencil but am always so afraid they will look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just ai n't  happening for me ! The best mine ever looked was about 10 years ago but the chick who did them moved to NYC and they have never looked as good since <p> For thicker brows , just use this eyebrow enhancer serum and you 'll notice a QUICK difference . Also , a reader below recommended using Castor Oil to grow them : ) . I would just never touch my eyebrows with tweezers- try to go to a professional waxer once a month . <p> I have noticed so many girls in Sydney have amazing brows these days and it makes me a tad jealous as I do n't  know how to fix mine ! I went crazy in my late teens and went from having thick brows ( which I hated ) to too thin . I went into the no return zone and cant for the life of me grow them back . I just powder them in to make them slightly better . Is it possible to grow them back ? Eick I do n't  know what to do ! ( first world problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this eyebrow enhancer serum and you 'll notice a HUGE difference . Also , a reader below recommended using Castor Oil to grow them : ) . I would just never touch my eyebrows with tweezers- try to go to a professional waxer once a month . <p> This is friggin hilarious . You need to lay claims on the tadpole description , I mean , best ever . I cant wait to call my sisters tadpoles out . We all have em and its sad . Its not due to over plucking , we just have eyebrows that are far apart . So when I learned how to shape my browsum .. complete life changer . I know that sounds vague but it really does change and frame your look for the best . Great post ! I am going to try the brow kit , right now I use the Anastasia brow pencil . thanks for sharing babe ! xx , becky <p> Hilarious ! And so true . I was n't blessed with brows . I am naturally a dirty blonde and my brows are even lighter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  make any difference .

I am going to look into tinting ! <p> Hi Lauryn , thank you for including this humorous , informative , and very necessary post ! In high school ( way back in the late 90s ) , I had a tragic over-plucking situation that lead to what I call " dog eyebrows " ( like a half eyebrow ) that were forever immortalized in the yearbook .

The way it does this is by using the principals of DCT which use resistance to actively pull the tension out of your muscles . All you have to do is use the leverage that the ProFlex provides to overpower your own muscles contraction and pull it into an active stretch . This type of resistance stretching- is the most effective form of stretching because it builds strength &amp; range of motion at the same time . Which means you can become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like yoga &amp; Pilates combined only it works faster and the results last longer ! <p> + If someone is interested in learning more about the DCT Proflex , what should they do ? <p> NB : Were currently doing an amazing experiment with something called crowdfunding where we are building awareness around the product to spread a message about the importance of preventative health care &amp; proactive wellness programs .

Love + Shine CourtStarCourtstar @ Starsystemz recently posted .. Motivational Monday : Fitness Affirmation <p> I have Plantar Fasciitis too so I am SO glad you did this post . Basically what 's happening to us is your big tendon which runs inside the arch to all the toes , is connected to your heel bone , on us that connection is getting inflamed and tearing at the heel connection . It can be from having high arches and poor support ( flat shoes ) and it can happen to heavier people who have flat feet . Its just a poor distribution of weight none the less , due to foot shape . For me its because I have high arches and am active , my arch flattens when I step and it pulls . It can happen in one foot more so than the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Go to the foot dr , a podiatrist , you can get custom shoe insoles made . They are 40$ for cheap ones and $400 for good ones , if you have health insurance , it should be covered . I wear my insoles everyday to support my arch and I feel worlds better , stretching helps too ! But go to the foot dr for insoles not the drug store , theirs are n't  designed for this problem . Feel better , keep stretching and wear your arch support insoles !

@@3098650 <h> And before you judge hear me out . <p> First you should know the hair on my face is pretty much blonde . Like I do n't  have a beard . Not that there 's anything wrong with this- my point is that I still shave my face even though the hair is n't super prominent . ( Although Michael sometimes points out a black hair on my upper lips when the sunlight is shining directly on my face&amp; then I tell him to MIND HIS OWN BUSINESS ) . <p> Anyway , the other day I realized I needed to do part 2 of shaving my face because its evolved really . I was listening to LadyGang ( who just came on TSC HIM &amp; HER Podcast ) &amp; Kate Sommerville was the guest . <p> I shave with TINKLES- ( found on Amazon ) . I shave my whole face . I go upward . Always use a clean TINKLE . People might tell you otherwise but I think its so important to use a clean Tinkle so you 're not shaving with bacteria . Also , obviously be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , use this clay treatment a real game changer ) . <p> 1 . Does it hurt ? <p> NO NO NO . Not even . <p> 2 . But does n't  it grow back thicker &amp; darker ? <p> Nope . Not in my experience ! <p> 3 . How often ? <p> I shave once- a week- sometimes I 'll do touch-ups . <p> 4 . What do I need ? <p> You can use a TINKLE- OR sometimes I use a MENS razor I find they 're awesome for the face . <p> 5 . Does a leg razor work ? <p> I would n't use a womens leg razor . The texture on the legs is different than on the face . <p> 6 . Any other tips ? <p> Do it on dry skin . Make sure your skin is VERY clean first too . <p> 7 . Quick how-to ? <p> As Popsugar says : " Pull the skin taut , then start shaving downward on your skin in short strokes . You cant just drag the razor against your skin " it would n't do anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin . Do n't  freak when it looks like you skinned a lamb . You have more hair on your face than you think ! " <p> 8 . WTF do I do post-shave ? <p> Make sure to add oils to your skin post-shave . I am obsessed with pure rose hip oil right now because its helped with my brown spots . <p> Another FANTASTIC way to shave is- Dermaplaning . <p> Dermaplaning- " is a method of exfoliation that consists of using a 10 gauge scalpel to gently scrape off the top layer of dulling dead skin cells in order to reveal a smoother , brighter complexion . " <p> I would Dermaplane ALL the time but sometimes I get too busy or I 'm traveling to I whip out my trusty Tinkle . Follow along on Snapchat because I 'm getting Dermaplaned on Friday at 12:30 PM pst &amp; I 'll video the experience ! <p> By the way , if you have facial hair &amp; it does n't  bug you- LEAVE IT . Who cares what anyone else thinks . I 'm just not a big hair person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyelashes , or head . You do you , boo . <p> I love dermaplaning and shaving my face too ! I find its a really great way to exfoliate delicate skin . Sometimes my skin will slightly burn afterwards when I put the oil on . It usually chills out within a few hours . Love this post ! <p> Okay totally listened to the Kate Sommerville podcast and after that switched from the tinkle to a Gillette fusion and HOLY CRAP what a difference . The mens razor was SO much better . but I think ill keep the Tinkle for hard to reach spots like around eyebrows and forhead . <p> Ugh ! I LOVE reading about this when you post on it but I 'm still SO nervous about trying it . I 'm very Italian and have super dark hair ( like natural caterpillar eyebrows , dark-ish lip fuzz , etc ) so I 'm just really concerned that going full face shave will have bad end results as far as growth back goes . But the argument for exfoliation and makeup application is so tempting ! Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face for about three years now and I honestly love it ! All of my roommates think its super weird but I do n't  care because my face is as soft as a babys bottom ( not even joking ) . I also think that it helped my acne go away because shaving also acts as an exfoliator ! <p> Hi ! I bought the tinkles and shaved my lip but was too scared to shave my face so I have n't done it yet ! So you say shave upward and popsugar says downward , is there adifference ? Does the hair come off better when shaved upward ? <p> Great post ! More ladies need to know that shaving their faces is a-ok . I shave my face , I started years ago and without it I 'd have the fluffiest face on the planet . I use a lady razor , and use coconut oil as my " shaving cream " . Better skin , better makeup , and much more face confidence <p> I actually started shaving my face when you published an interview some time ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself some brow shapers and have been shaving away ever since and I can only nod my head at everything you just wrote above ! IT IS THE BEST ! ! Also the LadyGang Podcast was amazing and I immediately did listen to their episode with Kate Sommerville and now want to go have a facial at her spa So , everyone go shave your face already ! ! Keep the kick-ass tips coming , girl ! &lt;3 xoxo Martinahttp : //spunkyrella.com <p> Hi Lauryn ! So I also use the tinkle razors and love them . When you say that you used a clean one every time , do you mean a new one each time ? I also get freaked out about the thought of bacteria so I clean them with alcohol but it still lingers in the back of my mind ! Anyways , love the blog and all of your posts like this . <p> I 've really never thought about and , in all honesty , I thought it was kind of a weird thing to do . But then Ive read your post and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll try it I have very few hairs on my body in general , which makes me a very lucky gal lol I 'll let you know if I give it a try ! <p> Hi lauryn ! Quick question on your description on how to do it you say you shave upward and on the how to it says downward . Totally not trying to knit-pick just really curious if it makes a difference ? : ) <p> I actually have a mustache ( thank you Italian genes ) and I bought the Tinkle because of that video you posted with Michelle ! I 'm kind of obsessed and my roommate 100% thinks I 'm insane when I do it in front of her . I have dark , dark brown hair and it never grows back thicker . Its amazing ! ! I listened to the Ladygang and Kate Somerville podcast and loved ! ! ! After hearing her say she swears by it too , I was sold more than ever . Thanks for this awesome advice I love it ! ! ! <p> I totally shave my face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into ( very amateur and novice ) vlogging a bit . My second vlog is all about shaving my face . What-what ! ? Yes , I shave my face . Its the best , and no the hair has not come back stronger , thicker , or more black . Win win . And , when I do it , it feels so good because yes , it totally exfoliates ! <p> You totally got me hooked on these . I ordered them off of Amazon a few weeks ago and am obsessed . And hahaha I love what you said about when Michael points out a hair and you tell him to mind his own business , because I legit do the same thing to my boyfriend . If I did n't  ask for his opinion , I do n't  want it = <p> Thank you for posting this update ! I bought the razors a few weeks ago when you listed them but almost threw them out because I could n't figure out how to use them . And now I know how and it was genius ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is awesomely gross ? Or grossly awesome ? <p> Confused at one point you say you shave upwards then later you say shave downwards .. Also you asked what videos we would like to see on youtube and I would like to see you shaving your face ! ! in case I do it wrong ! &lt;3 <p> Yes yes yess ! I DO shave my face using the same little razor . Although I would be MORTIFIED if my husband walked in and I 'm a bit scared of it , I think I 'm going to start using a full on mens razor . In that Podcast you mentioned , Kate recommended using the actual razor and shaving cream as opposed to the little razors and it makes sense to me . I think I 'm just terrified to knick my face = <p> Ive been using the tinkle razors since the first time you posted about them ! For the ladies out there who DO have a dark mustache and/or chin hairs , I highly recommend getting laser hair removal . Its pricey , but 100% worth it . Especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I just use the tinkle for my light colored hair and I swear by them ! <p> Got my tinkle from Amazon this week and I freaking love it ! Totally weirded out my husband which only makes it more fun . Love the exfoliation and toodaloo to stray lip hairs I forget to pluck all the time ! Thanks for the awesome tips , you 're a Rockstar ! <p> You know , my wife has been wanting to do this for a while now but have always been worried that she might end up with stubbles . She does n't  have thick facial hair per se but she been saying something about how it affects her make up . I 'm going to forward your post to her so she can read it for herself

So important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bossanova . I 've really , really been missing my grandma lately so playing Bossanova allows me to have a little piece of her at each event .

My top ten foods are packed with nutrients , they can easily be incorporated into so many other recipes and most importantly , they 're delicious ! <p> G G G- Berries , Bananas , Yogurt , &amp; Mint : <p> Besides being absolutely delicious fresh berries are an amazing source of antioxidants . Antioxidants are what help our body to protect and repair our cells from damage made by free radicals . Our bodies are exposed to free radicals naturally through our metabolism . We can cope with SOME free radicals but an overload can cause things like arthritis , damage to the eyes , &amp; increased risk of heart disease or even certain cancers . Free radicals are often caused and increased by smoking , stress , alcohol , &amp; poor diet . <p> Bananas are the only fruit that contain the amino acid tryptophan- &amp; B6 together .

Eighty grams of turkey is equivalent to 65 grams of lean beef or lamb . Try swapping chicken breast for turkey next time ! <p> Spinach is another really versatile veggie &amp; can be eaten raw or cooked . You can add spinach into most meals or even in a smoothie . Just one cup of spinach has nearly 20% of your recommended daily requirement of fiber . Fiber helps digestion , maintain low blood sugar , &amp; curbs overeating by keeping your full for longer .

Throw on a pair of pumps , do your hair super sexy , maybe a red lip &amp; you 're good to go . MEOW . <p> SOOO stylish . Sometimes a cocktail dress is just too predictable . These pants go great with a flirty crop top , a bodysuit , or even just a casual tank . Theyre white &amp; flowy so if you 're in warm weather for the honeymoon , they 're ideal . <p> LOVING the mesh details on this bikini . Plus , who does n't  love a good push up bra ?

@@3098669 <p> Yes , that 's a thing &amp; man , um HELLO what a cool job right ? Basically , he helps CEOs gain serious control over their calendars , time , &amp; business . Steve has recently been REALLY helping me create a strategic business future by design . <p> &amp; we 've been discussing a very interesting topic that I wanted to share with YOU ! <p> The subject is one Michael- has discussed on the exclusive section of TSC App , but I wanted to- go deeper , &amp; of course , hear all of your opinions . <p> So : what 's the difference between working ON your business and- working IN your business ? <p> For me , I had to learn this the hard way . This was n't something I learned in school . I 've learned it through experience as a business owner . <p> The difference is simple : working ON your business is building a game plan , creating a strategic future , &amp; focusing energy towards main priorities . <p> Working IN your business is getting caught up in the day the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be delegated : tasks that are not essential to the growth of the business . <p> As- Mark Zuckerberg , creator of Facebook ( no big deal ? ) says : " I spend more of my time thinking about how to connect the world and serve our community better , but a lot of that time is n't in our office or meeting with people or doing what youd call real work . I take a lot of time just to read and think about things by myself . If you count the time I 'm in the office , its probably no more than 50 to 60 hours a week . But if you count all the time I 'm focused on our mission , that 's basically my whole life . " <p> BINGO . <p> For the last year , this is how I 've worked . I work when I 'm reading , I work in yoga class , I work on the treadmill , I work on a walk with a green juice . Half of my work is strategizing and thinking of creative ways to build The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always mean you 're behind a desk answering a million e-mails . <p> Of course e-mails are a HUGE part of my job , HOWEVER Ive learned to time-block &amp; answer them for only an hour &amp; a half each day . If I sat behind the computer all day , there would be no time to create or move or travel or strategize . <p> For 3 years I did every job in my company . From e-mails to contracts to creating to photography to newsletters to writing a book , etc . AND then for a year I micro-managed everyone around me . Now I am slowly learning to let go , unless of course it has to do with building the business or writing &amp; creating content . I mean , there 's no reason that I should be picking up food for a recipe post when I could be writing a blog post or making plans for the next step in the brand . <p> Time is your currency , use it wisely . <p> This article states : " As the leader of your business , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are responsible for setting goals and thinking about the future . The only person in your company who will be genuinely motivated to grow your company is you . Every minute that you spend working on tasks that can be delegated is a minute that you are not planning , strategizing and building the best business possible . " <h> Could not be more accurate , in my opinion . <p> Growth happens when you- create a strategic plan of attack . <p> I feel like there 's another post coming after this because a large part of growth happens in day-to-day habits AKA your calendar . My calendar is very gnarly &amp; color-coded down to driving time ( like from appointment to appointment ) , winding down time , &amp; even when I eat . Really , I plan it out every night like a psychooh , &amp; by the way , if I did n't  do this , I 'd be a disaster . Literally , a full-blown nightmare .

I love how you include posts that spark thinking in all of us , like a bf keeping you on track ! A lot of times I think we all forget that working IN the business is taking time away from bigger and better things . Even if you ca n't delegate these tasks to anyone , you can surely set time restrictions for these tasks ! Thank you for sharing such wonderful , helpful tips . I feel like you give such an open approach to your business life , so we can all take a peak . Most bloggers do n't  do this , and I think its a big mistake . <p> That title alone is so right . My partner and I are managers in different fields . I believe in working on and not in the business whereas he is the absolute opposite . We disagree when talking about work so often , we definitely could n't work together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to get caught up in the day to day of the business even if you are a 9-5er like myself who is trying to grind after work hours on my own personal blog , trying to build that up day by day . One thing that helps me is working out EARLY in the morning , that way when I come home from my day job I have another 4+ hours to do my own thing and work on what inspires me , whether this is actually writing content , reading , researching , etc . You only have so much time in the day so its important to spend it wisely ! <p> Thanks for this , I think you covered a lot of really great points ! I think it also ties into Tim Ferriss " Four hour work week " . I guess in his situation its for a different reason , but his points on getting real with email and meetings etc are the same and makes you realize that so much time is wasted ! It is your choice as to what you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go scuba diving ) . People waste so much time getting in the weeds ! I am going to put some of this into practice and get real with my calendar &lt;3 xoxo <p> YES this is exactly what I needed to read today ! Its so easy to become caught up in the day to day , like you said , and I think this ends up not only hurting your business but hurting how you feel about yourself within the business . Loved the post &amp; cant wait for more business posts ! Also obsessed with that dress ah . PS Have you listened to the Ready . Aim . Empire . podcast by Lise Kuecker ? I think you 'd love it ! ! xx <p> LOVED THIS POST . I am definitely IN my business more so than I am ON my business and in fact I wrote a post similar to this on the train this morning , ( coincidence ? ) but I use every ounce of my time just like an OCD freak would I write my blog posts on my morning commute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my walk to or from the office and when that 's done , I 'm thinking , strategizing and growing . But I 'm also doing those mundane tasks that could be delegated to a VA like checking email , doing social media , editing , etc . <p> What I struggle with or am trying to get better at is investing more money in my business instead of on things . I cant wait to be in a place where I can just send my videos and pictures off for someone else to edit . Ugh , have to keep reminding myself its a marathon not a sprint . Thanks for sharing love . You 're the best . <p> My struggle is just trying to create AND be effectively productive trying to build a business with a family . I do n't  let it be an excuse but I 'd be lying if I said I 've never thought it would be easier without family responsibilities haha <p> YES , girl ! So spot on . I appreciate you giving me some language around the concept . I sometimes find it hard to articulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify " how I spend my time to others who do n't  work for themselves or are n't  in a creative business . Others might find it " lazy " or " unproductive " that I go to yoga or chat with folks at a cowering space or grab drinks with a colleague but those are ALL things I do to spark my creative , strategic juices ! ALWAYS WORKING <p> This article could not have come at a better time . You inspired me to start the tedious process of training my assistant to write contracts and purchase orders scary ! But its my least favorite and most time consuming part of my business . Wish us luck ! <p> I 'm so glad you brought this up ! Working full-time and maintaining a side hustle can be SO demandingits easy to get lost in the chaos of handling it all .

I would love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can trust to handle the tasks that you delegate to them . I run an internet retailer and seriously have the hardest time finding good help . Thanks in advance ! <p> I love these posts ! So informative , and force me to get my ass in gear . Also reassuring , because half the time when I 'm working on my brand I doubt that its a " real job " . Love the TSC community and finding like minded individuals &lt;3 <p> YES SO MUCH YES ! I feel like as your brand is evolving , I am totally with you in my own way . I started my own business earlier this year and have SLOWLY been starting to delegate to others . This past week I found myself feeling frustrated that I was on so many conference calls .. I felt very unaccomplished , so today I spend the better half of the afternoon finalizing my strategy and the steps I need to take to get there . So on the same wavelength . Love that quote by MZ and love you for writing this ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Could not agree more with everything you said and that Mark Zuckerberg quote is life .

I own a small lighting design business and am looking to grow . However , I feel stuck and don ; t know how to make it to the next stage . I think hiring an employee would help but it is hard to take that initial risk of offering someone a full-time salary ( $60K ? ! 0 and still fed yourself .

@@3098670 <h> Why I 'm a Cold Brew Coffee-Whore <p> I mean , its still fun to grab a Venti iced green tea &amp;/or a protein plate ( &lt;&lt; I love eating the egg &amp; apples when I 'm on the go ) but I 'm totally over their coffee . <p> Why ? <p> Glad ya asked . <p> According to the amazing- Food Babe- it sucked . In her own words : - " you- might think it is a bit radical to suggest not drinking their most prized ingredient that makes over 85,000 different combination of drinks , but it 's also radical drinking and paying a premium for coffee that 's ridden with potential toxins . Let 's get real here , they do not actually serve organic coffee at most Starbucks locations , which means ( like all brands of conventional coffee ) it 's been sprayed with pesticides . We all know Starbucks coffee ai n't cheap , but most people do n't know that regular consumption of conventional coffee can be a serious source of pesticide exposure . <p> Starbucks coffee is grown all over the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type and amount of pesticides foreign countries use in their production of coffee beans , which makes consuming non-organic coffee on a regular basis pretty risky . You could be drinking toxins from pesticides that are in fact banned here in the United States but not else where , like the pesticide Chlorpyrifos that is a contact poison . It has caused human deaths , and has been linked to birth defects . It is extremely toxic to birds , freshwater and marine organisms , bees , and other wildlife . <p> Furthermore , we know that increased exposure to pesticides are linked to birth defects , nerve damage and cancer . The President 's Cancer Panel has urged us not to consume food sprayed with pesticides and does n't believe any amount is safe . <p> And in regards to their decaf did you know that conventional decaffeinated coffees are made decaf by soaking the beans with a chemical called ethyl acetate used in nail polish and glues and a carcinogen called methylene chloride ? " <p> So here 's the deal : I 'm not in love with coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ espresso about five days a week . It gives me a lil zing &amp; makes me ten times more productive . <p> So ya , I freaked when I read about Starbucks . <p> BUT . <p> Have no fear because Seaworth is here . <p> Seaworth is my brand new , sexy boyfriend who was introduced to me by my other boyfriend , Michael ( &lt;&lt; he s been a cold brew coffee drinker for a while so he deserves a 100% ) . <p> Its seriously amazing . I buy one jug of the cold brew coffee &amp; drink it throughout a two week duration . Every AM I 'll have about four ounces a day over ice with cinnamon &amp; nutmeg ( &lt;&lt; and a STRAW , naturally ) . <p> Some deets on Seaworth cold brew coffee via their rad website : " each cold brew batch is carefully hand-crafted and brewed in a temperature controlled environment for a full eighteen hours , then double filtered and bottled by hand in glass never plastic . We spare no expense in our ingredients either . Our signature blend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fair-trade organic coffee beans , crystal clear , cold purified water and a whole lot of sunny California love . No unnecessary ingredients ever . Its a painstaking process , but were pretty sure that this will be some of the best coffee you 've ever had . " <p> Hi ! That part , at least , is n't true at all . I was recently deployed , and Starbucks was everywhere with free coffee at the USO , gift cards , whathaveyou even the desserts at the dining hall were provided courtesy of Starbucks . ( I mean , the desserts werent healthy , but that 's a whole nother story ) . <p> I hope that does n't  sound rude or argumentative but they were quite good in that sense . <p> Arghhh !

Amazon changed the book selling business like a shot , did n't it ? Well , in fact they did n't . No matter how it may seem from the outside . The fact is that it takes many years to be an overnight success even for Internet entrepreneurs . Years of hard work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the way . " <p> YESSSS . So true . This shit does n't  just fall out of the sky randomly . All of these companies/people have busted ass to get where they are now . <p> I 'm a firm , firm believer in if you want something , make it happen&amp; to make it happen , cultivate the habit of success . <p> So WTF exactly does this mean ? <p> G- It means relying on yourself . <p> G- It means practicing small habits everyday that lead to a much bigger picture . <p> G- It means patience . <p> G- It means nurturing the right habits , not the wrong ones . <p> G- It means thinking- ahead &amp; envisioning what you want your life to look like in the future AKA visualization . <p> A lot of people say " do n't  live in the future ! Live in the present ! ! " <p> Hmmm . I disagree . <p> Personally I 'm trying to build certain things in my life &amp; make pieces of a puzzle fit together , so envisioning where I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years allows me to do what I need to do to make- my visions happen. - In the end- preparation &amp; habits , actually make that- come to life . <p> Does that make sense ? <p> Basically today- was mapped out five years ago . That sounds weird but I planned- out where I 'd be in five years &amp; fucking figured out a way to make it happen . Visualization has been such a strong tool in building TSC &amp; Blog-Doo , moving out on my own , fitness/health goals , &amp; maintaining healthy **35;2111;TOOLONG creating a happy life . <p> And while imagining what success feels like is great , ya got ta bring it into the present . Prioritize what needs to come first &amp; take real action . <p> This article by Forbes really got to me . It states : " you 'd be shocked by how easy it is to work your ass off for much of your life and still end up with nothing to show for it . This only further proves the point that achieving success requires more than just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular set of skills or talent in a field . Being successful is a- lifestyle . <p> When I say success , I do n't mean through quantitative measures like money , but rather , being the best version of myself that I can possibly be. - It means living the exact life I want to live every single day I wake up and get out of bed . My benchmark for accomplishment has always been a vivid , idyllic scene in which I have not only achieved everything I sought to do , but have done so while maintaining sanity and happiness . " <h> Working towards something everyday , even if its just a little bit , - can create an amazing end result . <p> When I sat down to write The Skinny Confidential Book , I wrote everyday for eight months . Just a little a day ( think four pages ) . Eventually it turned in to a full book . So my daily habits created the vision I mapped out . <p> ( BTW , this post is- completely fitness/health related too . Eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cultivating successful habits . This whole post can totally be applied to fitness/health/wellness goals ! ; ) ) . <p> Obviously life throws you some curveballs ( trust me , I 've had A LOT of curveballs . Just because I do n't  share each &amp; every bad situation does n't  mean I do n't  have bumps in the road . I meanI have a scroll of things that did n't  go my way ! ! ! ) , so try to dodge the curveballs &amp; focus on cultivating successful habits that get to you to the end goal . <p> Think of it as a maze . Map your maze out &amp; create priorities a long the way so you can get to the end . <p> I 'm no where NEAR my end of my maze . I have a long-ass way to go but I enjoy sharing my personal experiences with you guys . Because- who knows ? Maybe it will help one person . <p> Have you guys seen this cartoon ?

While I do try to live in the moment , I also try to live for my future ; ie developing little kickass everyday habits that will eventually get me to my goals . One thing I always try to do that Ive heard works well for people is to create a habit of doing whatever is you do , first thing in the morning no matter what ! <p> Great post ! I agree with you on so much ; I get so annoyed when people look at what people such as Beyonce or Lebron James have accomplished without taking into consideration the hard work they put in to get there . Nothing happens overnight , hard work and consistency will get everybody a long way . <p> Great inspirational post you 've got going right here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read every word and take it into account with where I 'm at in my life .

@@3098676 <h> LAVENDER / LEMON BRIDAL SHOWER : Part 2 <p> Ecstatic to report our wedding photos are FINALLY ready to showcase . But before we get to that : PART TWO of the bridal shower post . Because I could n't leave you hanging with just PART ONE . <p> The couples shower was too fun not to share . For those of you who saw in real time via Snapchat , there 's more ! <p> Anyway , we did n't  do the unwrapping of presents or any games . Instead we laughed , drank , ate , &amp; played with my cute new nephew , DAXwell Michael hoarded him the whole time . He legit thinks he s a baby whisperer . <p> Although the shower was insanely beautiful , we really missed The Nanz . She would have loved the set-up &amp; really appreciated the extensive cheese and pickle platter . We all did a toast- in her spirit which she would have loved . She would have been the center of attention for sureprobably rocking her pink jacket with white nails . Missing her more &amp; more each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Wood in San Diegowhich is my favorite because their bar is just the most Instagram-able thing Ive ever seen . Seriously . Go there &amp; order a lavender gin fizz . Garnish it with their grapes because they have PEARL TOOTHPICKS that hold each garnish . <p> If that 's not chic , I do n't  know what is ? <p> They also have pink hummus . AND their wait staff is VERY cute and VERY single ( I asked for my friends ) . So ya , run there . <p> Clearly wanted to start with a light lavender theme &amp; bring it full circle to the wedding . Even so , I still wanted the bridal invites to match with the weddings aesthetic somewhat so we opted for dark vibes with a touch of snake-skin to keep it edgy . <p> Snake-skin was a touch we used throughout the entire process &amp; I lived for the detail with the dark , DARK purple . Kind of different with a twist . Just how I like it . <h> Just so you can see the vibe we were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party invitationsI do . I really ca n't help myself . <p> Other than that though , my parents set-up the rest . My stepmom , Julie is so talented its crazy . I mean she literally handmade the decor . LIKE look at the balloon strings ! ! Seriously . The lavender streamers &amp; babys breathe details on the fireplace were completely crafted by her . I 'm jealous of her incredible talent &amp; kindness . <p> And like I said , I designed these pretty , dainty hand pieces with CAM JEWELRY &amp; gifted each girl with a bright pink TSC-ish box . Super festive idea for a bridal shower/baby shower/etc . <h> Check the hand pieces out , do you like ? ! <p> While guests were leaving they received three things : a Better Booch Kombucha , a little goodie box , &amp; an espresso shot with a sprig of lavender &amp; a thin swath of lemon peel . Keeping the theme strong all the way through guys . <p> I have to shout out my family &amp; friends . They are everything &amp; I have to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never any unnecessary- dramaor boring moments . LOL . Just good vibes all aroundlots of Bossanova , champagne , &amp; laughter . I could have had this party in a shack &amp; we would have still had a fucking ball . Okmaybe I would have micro-managed the shacks decor but you get the drift . <p> If you 're planning a party , the people are what make it ! Sometimes that 's a smaller group . Sometimes its a larger group . Do what works for you . There 's no right way. Do your thing . <p> On that note , were on to the wedding tomorrow . Again bear with me , there 's a lot of bridal content to share ! I 'm off to watch Westworld ( who 's seen it ? ) &amp; eat- apple chips- in bed . Lately the cinnamon apple chip addiction is frightening . Random , but what else is new ? Crumbs are everywhere . <p> With every blog post I feel like I 'm missing out in my life being from a small town where people do nothing but have babies , I CRAVE experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love how you went soft and feminine with the bridal shower , leading up to the dramatic wedding . Nailed it , as always ! Quick question did you have any help from a professional in planning the entire process ? Did you have a checklist you followed to be sure you tackled all the small wedding details ? I 've already married , but I 'm curious to hear about your thought process ! <p> Thanks so much Tara ! I honestly was such a procrastinator when it came to planning our wedding . I created a GIANT poster board of everything I wanted and went from there . Thank god for my amazing team and wedding planner . They really helped pull everything together . xx

Sometimes there 's something just soothing about stepping away from the day to day . Traveling re-inspired me &amp; has kicked my ass in gear to create valuable content . <p> Recently , our pantry has turned into its own experience , which I prefer . When I put effort into something like styling a pantry , I have to really go for it . <p> That being said , since these pictures have been taken , I have planned a- VERY , VERY KHLO-C-D- pantry revamp. - Basically were in the process of organizing- the shit out of iteven more . YES , I am psychobut you know that . <p> Basically the batshit- craziness was real at The Container Store &amp; Target- this weekend when I bought a bunch of organizers for my lentils , steel-cut oats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantry will be very theme oriented .

You have one awesome pantry Khloe has totally inspired me to get my ass organized . Have you seen her baking cabinet ? It is insane ( but the good kind ) . Random question but do you have the link to the container on the 2nd to bottom center shelf behind the cutie blue goblet ? Ive been looking for that style ( clear + silver ) for mine ! I would LOVE a pantry video . Also , what all do you use local honey for ? I have a container of raw honey &amp; royal jelly but sometimes run outta things to use it for ! <p> As far as jetlag I got the WORST case of it coming back from Australia this winter .

Or are you just using the term because everything is super organized ? If it is the latter , please stop using the term in this manner , it oversimplifies the disease and makes it seem like some sort of joke instead of something that can be incredibly debilitating .

@@3098679 <h> Mini DeLites : Recovery G <p> If you follow me on Snapchat you know I 've been super MIA . Actually to be honest , my head has been in a completely different space- for the past two months just being real ! <p> And wellthats because I had MAJOR , major surgery last Tuesday . I will go into more detail when I 'm feeling better , but right now I have limited energy . <p> When the body goes through surgery you have only a little bit of energy making it very difficult to run a businessso thank God for my amazing team . A couple of them sent me the prettiest flowers , see : <p> You guys know I 'm not one of those planner-aheader , organized bloggers that plans posts in advance . I write my blog through real life . I find it more authentic that way . So on that note , I did not have like 20 posts planned before the procedure . Now , I 'm just going with the flow to see- how I feel each day . <p> Anyway , enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> This post applies if you 're sick or if you ever have to undergo surgery . <p> I wanted to share a quick recap of how I 'm keeping my body nourished . <p> So ! Where shall we start ? <p> Let 's start in pictorial order , maybe ? <h> Watermelon juice ! ! ! <p> Obviously everyone around me has been juicing up a storm . Watermelon juice was my main- request because its non acidic . I like to add a TON of lime too . Lime is acidic but turns alkaline in the body . So watermelon x lime is just fucking gold . Ive been chugging it like a sorority sister chugs Jungle Juice at a frat mixer . Watermelon juice is just perfect in every way . Go for the juicy red flesh at the center of a watermelon because its the only nutrient-rich area , forget the white part . The white part sucks , kinda . Some other benefits : watermelon is great- for blood flow , its anti-inflammatory ( perfect- for surgery ) , &amp; has TONS of vitamins and minerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coconut juice . <p> I like this baby for its electrolytes . Raw coconut water is filled with electrolytes which REALLY boost hydration . Hydration is key in sickness recovery . I always search for the pink coconut waters because supposedly they contain more antioxidants . This one is my favorite brand . <h> Heyyyy Kefir , you weirdo ! <p> Since I 'm on a lot of pills right now I need something to coat my stomach . This kefir smoothie makes all the difference . Kefir is a whole different blog post but basically its " a sour-tasting drink made from cows milk fermented with certain bacteria . Also , a- great source of probiotic bacteria and yeast , and requires daily maintenance , if using milk kefir grains. - It is generally more sour in flavor and of a pourable consistency . Milk kefir may also be used in many , many recipes . " When- I take antibiotics I ALWAYS balance it out with a probiotic . This is why kefir is amaze ; it balances the antibiotic out by promoting good bacteria . This smoothie is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shock my system . My friends , Mike &amp; Jen make me this smoothie daily &amp; I LOVE it : <h> Now let 's talk about liquid gold ! <p> A full blown Vitamin C juice ! ! My **37;2181;TOOLONG . SO healing for the system when you 're in recovery ( or on any day ) . The orange relieves constipation , is full of potassium , &amp; again , turns alkaline in the system ( so its essentially NON acidic ) . - The crunchy powerfood carrot does wonders : they 're full of fiber &amp; literally flush nasty-ass toxins from the body . SO cleansing . Ginger , one of my favorites , is a real life saver because it takes away nausea . And typically surgery brings on nausea , yuck . Ginger also reduces gas , has a warming effect , &amp; stimulates circulation . Lastly turmeric- root ! ! ! My home girl . Turmeric ( like real turmeric . Ever seen it at the grocery store ? It looks like a sick bug . You can actually buy it online too ) is the shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive been like shooting it in shot glasses #rebel . <h> Oh , &amp; another one not pictured : <p> I HAVE BEEN CHUGGING BONE BROTH IN DISGUSTING AMOUNTS . Ive been told its the best thing you can put in your system BEFORE &amp; AFTER surgery . I add lemon &amp; seriously GULP , GULP , GULP . A post on the broth can be found here . <p> Life is not perfect &amp; there are bumps . And as a blogger , I 'm taking you guys along for the bumpy , sometimes fun ride . Its sort of my job right ? To share the ride ? Let 's just say its- not always macaroons , champagne , &amp; #OOTDs . <p> And I promiseeeeee I will post more of an explanation this week when I have some energy . <p> Do you guys have any post-surgery tips ? Any experiences to share ? <p> Hope you all had a MUCH BETTER week than I did . Sending good vibes , lauryn x <p> I hope you are okay ! I had surgery a year ago when cancer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me feeling depleted- so I certainly understand the lack of energy . Not sure about the details of your surgery , but I would be interested in hearing about what you are using for scars from it . I have 7 on my tummy , from the ovary removal and biopsies , which is kind of a bummer during bikini season at 24. : / I tried both Skin Medica and Bio Oil , neither of which did much . Sending you best wishes for your recovery ! xoxo <p> Boiron Arnica for inflammation and internal bruising ! I had surgery a few years back and my naturopath had me take these magical pellets . Typically you get quite a bit of bruising around the incisions I had .. I had Zero bruising ! <p> Hi Lauryn ! I hope you begin to feel better from your surgery ! Love the real posts , one can only see too much macarons , pink , #ootd , champs , that the real deal stuff can be refreshing plus we can all send our love . I 'm like you , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juicing , trenta sbux teas , and soups . If you have the energy for a bath , Dr. Singhas mustard bath is amazzzzzzzzzzinggg . Mustard powder with wintergreen , eucalyptus , rosemary , and thyme , and its my go-to when I am sick ! The mustard will help open your pores and allow you to sweat in the tub ( I like to drink aloe water while I soak for extra nourishing hydration ) , and the scents can be similar to those of a vapour rub I also like to add peppermint + a spoon of aztec secret/acv to make it even more intense . Feel better and sending good vibes your way to a speedy recovery . xx <p> Lauryn , so sorry to hear that you had to have surgery , but so happy to hear you have not been sick this long from some bizarre virus . I hope you continue to heal quickly and are able to be back to your wonderful , cheeky , blogging self . Take care of yourself my friend and thanks so much for all of the wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! Sending you healing thoughts and lots of love . xxoo debbie <p> I hope you feel better soon , Lauryn ! Your blog , Snapchat and Bombshell Body Guide keep me so motivated and inspired . Ever since I read about green tea with a splash of passion its all I get at Starbucks anymore . <p> Hi Lauryn Hope you heal quickly . I drink Ginger tea religiously and SWEAR it helps with EVERYTHINGhealing related . They sell a ginger grater ( like a mini cheese grater ) at William Sonoma and i literally grate about 3-4 inches of ginger root into my mug and add boiling water-let steep for about 10 min , its SPICY like Jalepeno spicy but i feel like its really working when your mouth is on fire lol Anyways , hope for a speedy recovery for you ! xo <p> My tips would be to keep everything by you when you are relaxing so that you do n't  have to get up all the time ! That was essential for me , especially since my recovery was from double foot surgeries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was eating a lot of greek yogurt . I have a sensitive stomach , complete with past ulcers and I was taking heavy duty meds that totally messed with my tummy . I hope you get well really soon !

I always liked fresh coconut water as a child so was disappointed when some of these boxed versions started coming out , I did n't  like them .

Crazy ! Booo that you 're sick though . Wishing you a speedy recovery <p> sorry to here that you are sick . Hope your recovery quickly , but I 'm sure its helping having these drinks to help keep you nourished . Tea is definitely one to have when you are i 'll whether its green tea , herbal teas or a normal black tea . The Kefir Probiotic Smoothie is one to have when you are i 'll . If your not eating the milk and banana of the smoothie will line your stomach and help with taking tablets , also it will help to stop you from being sick . I will give the liquid gold drink ago next time I am i 'll , packed with vitamin c and nutrients . <p> Lauryn , I 've loved reading about your healing journey . I 'm a month out for a full hip replacement and have been doing a lot of research on pre/post op nutrition to heal my body as well as possible . Your journey is much more difficult as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously hard for you to intake because you had , well , jaw surgery ! ! ! ! So I really feel for you . Hang in there girl ! <p> I wanted to thank you for your mini delights : recovery Ive already stocked my freezer with cubed watermelon and other ingredients you suggested . I had a question about the Kefir you linked to . It seems a bit intense to whip up ( I wont be very mobile ) so I was wondering if you could recommend a kefir that is ready to drink but is n't loaded with sugar ? <p> I think you 're pretty much an anti-inflammatory expert by now , but might I suggest lentils . They 're a great protein , packed with fiber and iron and are soft and come in soup form

You know what they say : every trainer needs a trainer . Even though I have TSC BBG &amp; Meal Plan ( &lt;&lt; which you can now buy separately ! ) &amp; I taught Pure Barre and Proformer Pilates for years , I 'm still constantly looking to learn . <p> I mean , I sure as shit do n't  know everything so I guess- I was just feeling like there was a lot more to learn fitness-wise . <p> Specifically , lifting . Lifting HEAVY . I 've always been curious about it &amp; wanted to explore weight lifting with a professional . <p> After a bunch of online/Instagram research , my stalking brought me to Seth . We set up a conference call &amp; instantly had a connection . He s been an awesome fitness mentor . <p> I should also note Seth is a celebrity trainer &amp; is very well-known for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With Seths help , she literally changed her body ! The whole transformation was really amazing . <p> OH , AND if you want more of Seth , listen to Episode 20 of The Skinny Confidential HIM &amp; HER Podcast . We had him as a guest to- discuss mental toughness , daily routines , carb cycling , meditation , eating healthy , &amp;- how to find a good personal trainer . Fun shit . <p> As you can see , Seths enhanced- my knowledge in health , - food , &amp; spirituality . Mind/body connection is a real thing &amp; with Seths help I have focused even more on my wellness . Weight lifting is going AMAZING by the way . My jeans are looser thanks to SB . <p> Of course every time I learn ANYTHING , I want to share it with YOU GUYS ! SO let me introduce you to Mr. hottie Seth Browing , enjoy : <p> Introduce yourself : <p> Seth Browning , Celebrity Trainer : My name is Seth Browning . I 'm the owner of Body by Browning . I do one-on-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , &amp; customized carb-cycle meal plans . Along with that , - I also have a whole media line I write blogs , articles , interviews , TV stuff . And then I also teach boot camps . Basically I do a lot in regards to fitness ! <p> How did you get into training ? : <p> SB : I have been working out since I was 15 years old and next year I turn 35 so I will be celebrating my 20 year anniversary working out . I do n't  know if it makes me sound ancient or what . I just fell in love with fitness since I was young . I got certified as a trainer when I was putting myself through college . I never really did anything about it because I just kind of went on a different path before training . Right around 28 I got really burned out on my corporate career . I wanted to follow a passion and that passion was health . I had gained a lot of weight , I was smoking cigarettes , I was drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired a trainer and then I just kind of fell back into working out and I hired more trainers and then I got a job doing memberships to a gym . I ended up selling more personal training packages than I did gym memberships and they said - " maybe we should move you to become a personal trainer . " So 24 Fitness then paid for my certification to become a trainer and the rest is history . <p> The- most important thing when you 're training someone ? : <p> SB : There are multiple things , but the most important is to keep someone safe . Making sure they have proper form and proper technique . That 's going to ensure that the experience is fruitful . I would say beyond that its giving them something that is custom to their particular goal &amp;- who they are as a person . <h> Check out Scheana Maries insane results ! <p> - I know you 're big on mind , body , - &amp; soultell us more : <p> SB : Both of my parents are PhD psychologists so I grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I believe firmly that the mind and the body are completely connected . And I actually believe that the mind controls the body and if they 're disconnected , no matter how hard you work , you will never see the results you want . <p> I do everything I can to empower people by not mindlessly going through the exercises but really helping them connect with their body through breathing , knowing why they 're doing a particular exercise , what muscle it works , getting them engaged in the process , and also helping them celebrate in the victories and being very grateful for their accomplishments . <p> If you go into a workout &amp;- you 're just kind of showing up and running through it , you have no appreciation for it . So getting people connected mentally produces- incredible results . <p> - If someone wants to lose fat , what do you recommend ? : <p> SB : The first thing they need to do is change their diet . I recommend that they eat broccoli every day . <p> Ok , so why broccoli ? : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat burning vegetables there is &amp; a very powerful superfood . Its anti-cancer , metabolic , speeds up metabolism , &amp; a GREAT superfood . <p> Recommendations- for women between the ages of 18 to 40 for fat loss when it comes to exercise ? : <p> SB : Lifting very heavy in the beginning is helpful for fat loss . So getting a personal trainer and starting with heavy weights . <h> Muscle burns fat so the more lean muscle you can stack on the better . <p> Then you also want to do cardio right after you weight train . <p> Best snack ever ? <p> SB : Almonds . They 're a healthy fat and you need fats to burn fat . They are also something that will speed up the metabolism . Eat up . <p> - I 'm busywell , shit we are ! How can we stay healthy- when time is limited : <p> SB : One of the best tips is to schedule your workouts in advance . Most people work off of a calendar so go into your calendar . Look at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and schedule that in like you would any other appointment . Do n't  let anything interfere with your workout . The only thing that could- is an immediate family issue or a humongous problem at work . <p> Let 's talk- COCKTAILS ! Tips ? Tricks ? Thoughts on wine ? Be kind : <p> SB : I wish that I could be that guy who would make this sound nicer , but I think if there 's anything that 's detrimental to fat loss in the hands of losing weight , its wine . I think its one of the worst &amp;- I do n't  recommend it if you 're trying to lose fat . <p> How has fitness evolved to where it is now ? : <p> SB : Fitness is headed in a such a great direction . Fitness in the beginning was very antiquated and it involved a lot of machines &amp;- now fitness is incorporating utilizing your core , using a lot of body weight . There 's so many different exercises that work more than one muscle group . So fitness is really now incorporating all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as opposed to just being aesthetic . <p> Any other tips/tricks ? : <p> SB : I think just do n't  judge yourself . Take it one workout at a time and just focus on today . What do you need to do today ? Do n't  step on the scale . But think , " what actions can I take right now to have the body I want " and think only in today . Numbers lie so do n't  step on the scale and worry about your weight . <p> Love that you are posting about heavy weights instead of just yoga/barre/spin . I have been heavy lifting 3 days week ( benching , squatting , and deadlifting ) , and heavy cardio 2 days a week with my personal trainer/good friend since November 2015 and I have to say the difference I have seen is incredible . I was part of a very well-known dance company for 13 years of my life , so being in shape has always been important to me . <p> Cutting out alcohol has been CRUCIAL . I have maybe 1-2 glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm 24 . But its just something I 've been committed to . Seriously , LOVE this post . I think girls are afraid to lift heavy because they " do n't  want to get bulky , " but that just does n't  happen if you train and diet right ! Thanks for sharing this Lauryn ! And great advice , Seth ! <p> Amazing advice ! I will definitely be incorporating more broccoli into my daily diet after reading this ! I 've recently begun lifting heavily and I 'm really loving it except for one thingRecovering ! ! ! Is there anything anyone recommends for fast recovery on soreness ? We all know the saying " No pain no gain " but I 'm wondering if there are any good tips on decreasing that pain . Thank you so much in advance ! <p> So glad to see a weight lifting post . So many women kill theirselves with too much cardio , which does n't  build your metabolism or burn calories like weightlifting can . Did your trainer recommend any changes in your macronutrients at all ? I definitely upped my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It-s really interesting to understand how working out and lifting works . I used to think that only cardio helped you lose weight and lose fat . But knowing that lifting also helps you lose fat is amazing because sometimes I-m just not in a cardio , yoga or barre mood . Sometimes I need something that challenges me harder and I thin that lifting can be a great option . This is great because I will be able to go workout at the gym with muy husband and have a great time ! YAYYY ! <p> I will also moderate my drinking and I will eat broccoli everyday for sure ! I will make my kids and my husband eat more broccoli too so that we are healthier . Please share more advices such as this one ! <p> I really like this post I think you are really helpful and your tips are really useful for my everyday life Thank you so much Seth and Lauryn &lt;3 <p> Great post !

@@3098683 <h> Welp , This Should Be InterestingLets Talk About BPA <p> Updated : July 8 , 2014 <p> by <p> LAURYN <p> Hiii . <p> Today I 'm teaming up with the website , - Volkalize- which was founded by my girlfriend , Jordan . Volkalize is a political , social networking site that integrates politics with pop culture . Its a super rad site that welcomes opinions from anyone , anywhere . <p> Todays topic ? <p> BPA . <p> But before I go off on a rant , just remember : I 'm not a full-on BPA expert/scientist/doctor . <p> I 've simply read up on it &amp; naturally ( shocker ) , I have a strong opinion . <p> Conclusion : <p> BPA free &gt; BPA . <p> I just do n't  understand why anyone would willingly drink water from a water bottle containing BPA when there 's a BPA free option . <p> But wait , wait . Let 's back up . <p> For anyone that 's wondering WTF BPA is : <p> The FDA ( The Food &amp; Drug Administration ) kinda does n't  want to know about BPA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though the FDAs troubled by the lack of better information about the safety of BPA , it recently denied a petition from the National Resources Defense Council to ban it ( see FDA Law Blog for details ) . - Although FDA is not persuaded by the data and information in your petition to initiate rule-making to revoke the food additive approvals for BPA , FDA will continue in its broader and more comprehensive review of emerging data and information on BPA . " <p> So its kind of like this : hey ! I 'm the FDA and I 'm so freaking worried about BPA . I wont let my kids have it &amp; I 'm not touching it with an eighty foot pole BUT I 'm not going out of my way to warn others about its effects without more evidence . Sorry , I 'm not sorry ! <p> Ignorance is bliss , ehh ? <p> Not so much . <p> BPA is used to make hard- plastics for water bottles ( &amp; FYI to all the mamas out there : baby bottles too ) . Oh , &amp; its in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper ( SICK ! ) &amp;/or paper money . Its also used for food supply . <p> A lot . <p> Like , a lot , a lot . <p> BPA was first approved by the oh-so-ever-lovely FDA in 1960s . <p> BUUUUTTTT in 2010 the see no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil- FDA issued an update with a report stating that BPA is safe at current levelsand then the FDA went on to suggest reducing exposure is recommended . <p> Hmmmm . <p> Let 's all go bury our heads in the sand with the FDA . Might be fun . <p> here 's another fun factthis is how the FDA answers questions to parents : <p> Question : Should I throw away baby bottles that contain BPA ? <p> FDA : Parents should examine bottles and discard them if worn or scratched because scratches can both harbor germs and , in BPA-containing bottles , lead to greater release of BPA . For those who want to use baby bottles and feeding cups not made with BPA , consumers should know that such products are now widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BPA debate a bit further : the US Centers for Disease Control has reported that ninety percent ( yes , you heard correctly- ninety percent ) of Americans have " detectable levels of BPA in their urine . " <p> Yuck x 10 . <p> The facts : " Approximately six pounds of BPA are produced for every American per year . Bisphenol A is a hormone-disrupting chemical , which means that it can mimic or block hormones and disrupt the bodys normal functions . Numerous studies suggest it can have health effects at extremely low exposure levels . BPA is especially of concern for vulnerable populations : pregnant women , babies and children . " <p> Personally , I drink Essential Water . I like the taste . I like how the water contains 9.5 pH , and its BPA-free . I also like People Water . And my absolute BPA-free glass bottle can be found here ( more options below ) . <p> If you get anything out of this post , just remember this : - please , please do NOT leave a water bottle &amp; any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the heat makes the nasty-ass chemicals leak into the water , beverage , &amp;/or food . <p> So . <p> Ill end with this quote : <p> " The big question is how BPA got so widespread in the products we use everyday as food containers and especially in baby bottles We can and must do better when it comes to foreseeing trouble related to the chemicals we put into our environment . Right now we have too much of a buy now and pay later approach to chemical safety . Tens of thousands of chemicals are in use and hardly any of them have been studied with any rigor for their safety . Wouldnt it make more sense to test for harms first rather than find out later ?

Lauretta **25;2220;TOOLONG on Trend recently posted .. Nine : Sugar detox <p> I think the thing about BPA free is do n't  get me wrong , I choose BPA free ( or glass when I can ) every time , but just because BPA has been listed and recognized as an endocrine disruptor , there are definitely other chemicals that have NOT been listed or recognized as harmful that manufacturers can just use instead of BPA and still get that friendly label . This is just one reason I always use glass over plastic , when I can ! <p> I 'm super glad that Wisconsin already banned BPA in bottles , but the fact that its in food pisses me off greatly . How can you let people eat that when it affects the body in horrible ways . ugh ! I make sure before I buy frozen foods ( Which is not often ) I make sure that there 's nothing with abbreviations in it . Geez . <p> Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US went along with banning BPA from a lot of products was because it made non-BPA plastics seem innocuous . In reality they 're not , they 're just as bad if not worse than BPA . So , BPA free is good , glass and metal are better .

Anyway , back to the insane Villa.the owner was there &amp; you can see the detail that went into creating the California Blonde ' collection .

@@3098688 <h> Mini DeLites : Hong Kong Is On Point <p> Hong Kong is like New York on steroids but at the same time its nothing like New York . <p> Its a big city with a lot of hustle &amp; bustle AND LOTS , AND I MEAN LOTS OF SHOPPING . Honestly guys , if I lived there Id- go broke . I 've never seen so much shopping . Seriously everywhere we turned there was a huge-ass designer store or a cute boutique filled with pretty trinketsalmost to the point of too much shopping ( shit , I never thought I 'd say those wordsHA ! ! ) . I bought this tiny Chinese coin holder ( which I 'll keep my herbs in , LOL ) , some slip-on white shoes ( weird , I know , me ? White shoes ? ) , and a little , black cross body bag ( its like a tiny , nano sized bag that crosses across the bod perfect for holding a passport ) . <p> Basically I wanted to buy all of Hong Kong because they have all the newest trends &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> BUT there is SO much more to the city than just the shopping . <p> Tea time was HUGE for me in Hong Kong . We discussed this yesterday so I 'll let ya check out that post if you 're interested . I seriously turned into a cup of mint tea , I loved it that much . <p> A real gem of a restaurant- in Hong Kong was recommended to me by my friend , Annie . Shes been to Asia &amp; RAVED about a specific restaurant-- she told us we " HAD TO GO TO SEVVA . " Sevva is pretty much like heaven . here 's how Sevva went down : we walk in &amp; music is immediately on point ( first thing I look ( or listen ) for in a restaurant if the music is off , the energy is off ) . After we got seated under flowers that were hanging from the ceiling ( literally fresh flower covering the ceiling ) , I ordered CHICKEN BONE BROTH WITH WHISKEY . <p> First of all , CHICKEN BONE BROTH rocks my life &amp; with whiskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after- we were served fresh cucumber cocktails , avocado/lemongrass ( lemongrass is everything this trip ) - salads , &amp; amazing cuts of grilled fish with truffle . And for the record , the atmosphere at Sevva was cool . Not like hipster , too cool for school , but just COOL . After dinner , the outside of the building lit up while a rad band played . Fun times. - ( The chicken bone broth with whiskey though ? That was the coolest . ) . <p> Another different- restaurant was Sushi Shikone . These master- sushi chefs whip up the most raw , delectable fresh sushi while you watch inches away . The wasabi is the freshest I 've had &amp; their raw tuna was better than sex . <p> here 's the thing though : its like seventeen courses . I can not eat if I 'm full . I just ca n't . The feeling of an over stuffed stomach makes me cringe . I do n't  like it . I eat until I 'm 90% full &amp; then I stop . <p> But Sushi Shikone ? The food keeps- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very polite . He will sit there &amp; smile &amp; stuff his face even if he s full . He s also very disciplined . Me ? Not so much , when Im full , I 'm full . So there we were- on our 6th ( or was it 8th ? ) course and I said to him " babe I 'm full , I cant eat anymore . " <p> Guys , you would have thought I told him our relationship was over . He was seriously embarrassed . So instead of letting me just tell the chef I was full , HE ATE MY PORTION TOO . I was dying . Basically he was stuffing his face full of urchin ( which definitely is n't his favorite ) . He looked like he was going to explode while I sipped my green tea . Sorry babe ! <p> Ok , so the service in Hong Kong in general , is incredible . I 've never seen anything like it in my life . Every detail is well prepared , thought out , &amp; special . The people are all so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep while taking- us to The Peak ( I woke him up by fake coughing ) , we found an amazing craft cocktail bar in Soho called Quinary ( a must try ! - ) , dim sum is everything ( YUM ) , daily fresh watermelon juice , skin care- ( I found this serum which I 'll talk more about that is like vitamins for the skin ! ! ) , Ralph Laurens underground coffee shop ( see Michael pic ) , &amp; the people ( the people are just really , really great we even made a few friends : ) ) . <p> Ive been snip snapping away on Snapchat so find snippets- of my travels under the username : laurynevarts . <p> Ahh , I am SO happy you enjoyed HK ! !

I cant date you if <p> Hands up ! I already do this . I 've always had this uneasy feeling that its totally anti-feminist to be shaving my face for cosmetic reasons , like " ooh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really really does make a huge difference to my make up application which wins the argument for me. xo <p> I never heard about this before and I believe that it actually could be a great way to exfoliate your skin and make your skin smoother . However , I personally think that a little bit of hair is perfectly okay on a girls face . Most men wo n't notice it unless its really a mustache . So I 'm one of the unfortunate girls who do have to remove hair on their upper lip , because its dark and clearly visible and I really do n't  like it . But in my opinion you should not have to remove every tiny bit of hair that is pretty much invisible . It makes your skin feel soft , while shaving it can make it appear a little bit scratchier because of the cut off hair ( you probably wont notice this at the thinner hair , but the thicker your hair is , the more you will notice it as it grows back ) .

Love it ! ! <p> Girls , you say this like its a new found thing . Unfortunately , for us gals who suffer from excessive body and facial hair ( i suffer from the latter ) its it actually a near-daily necessity to get by day to day and to not feel any more like a freak than we already do . Hair is a normal thing , but having dark , coarse obvious growth and not peach fuzz like most normal girls , is n't a normal thing for girls ( like me ) to have . Shaving might seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , it helps me get by on the daily and feel ok about myself in an otherwise looks-obsessed society ! and until laser treatment rids me of these unsightly follicles on my face , shaving helps get me through the time in-between and no Tinkles razor could combat what I suffer from . <p> I recently tried threading my brows/lip and am considering threading other of my face , but shaving ? That 's a little scarier . Does n't  it come back blunt ? I 'm not sure its a practice I 'd want to cultivate . Please let us know how this looks in a few days ! <p> I seriously doubt guys know or care about peach fuzz on girls facesbut maybe they do in California ! What do I know ? Anyhow , my friend got this done as part of her facial the other day and now her skin looks AMAZING . But my only question is does your hair feel all prickly when it comes back ?

I just use disposable razors and they have worked fine . And do n't  shave hardjust barely make contact with the skin , that should be enough to get the fuzz off ! <p> So , I was very excited to read this post which seems like a great solutions for a lot of women like me who have blonde " peach fuzz .

When I run my hand down my face , all good . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now I am super self-conscious.I think I would prefer the peach fuzz I had before . Did I do it wrong ? Has anyone else experienced this ? <p> I personally put hair cream remover all over my face and body and with years of trying to rectify it with laser to diminish the burn marks it put on my face , as well as coarser hair removed . My hair grew back in places that I did n't  even think you could grow hair , waxing stretches the skin and plucking at the face left in grown hair , so I eventually started shaving with a mans razor and I found it gave me brisk growth and a 5 oclock shadow and was more embarrassing than the hair . But now I thank you all for introducing me to the Twinkle Razor it feels more femine to do and I am in the process of controlling where I want the hair on my face to be if any , so it is more natural for me as I do not wear make-up every day . <p> Ive been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found it a good exfoliation for my skin , plus getting rid of hair . Although if you do have dark hair it will grow back thicker like anywhere else on your body ( dark haired here ) my answer was I bought an at-home laser which you go over the shaved area with after shaving . Hair grows back less and it painless plus the nice exfoliated feel of shaving . <p> if you are really interested in getting rid of facial hair , you should have it threaded , not shaven . It grows back thicker if you shave ityou guys know that right ?

The only thing that bothered me was the video and the way she makes it seem like the only reason you would want to do this is for the men in your life . If facial hair bothers you because of the way your make up looks or whatever then shave , but do n't  do it because you are worried " the men in your life secretly hate you for having facial hair " that 's ridiculous . <p> Yeah that part got on my nerves too . I 'm not interested in dating at all , I just want to not feel disgusted with myself . <p> For the record , I 've been using these for probably well over a year by now . They work well , and they are SOOO much quicker than always plucking , which I used to do and it was incredibly time-consuming since I have a lot of facial hair . I use them for my mid-brows too ( I have unibrow ) and occasionally , if I 'm feeling really lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave the shaved area a little red for a while , but nothing too bad happens . I do not use them for my entire lower face though , mostly just for my upper lip , ( moustache area as I call it ) nose and mid-brows . Once a week is not enough though . I use them at least twice a week , cause my hair is rich , thick and grows back quick . <p> By the way , these are actually supposed to be used for the brows , as they are called eyebrow razors or something like that , but it also says on the package that they are multi-use face razors . They do n't  work very well for the brows , but its still possible to use them in that way if you 're a lazy bum like me . <p> For those of you worried , I can say this : I do n't  think using this will make the hair grow back thicker . And I can say for certain that if you already shave or pluck or something like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Option : if you 're pressed for time use a blender to mix your ingredients . <p> OMG , that sounds really delicious ! I think I 'll try this recipe this weekend ! I will tell you how it was ! Thank you for your inspiring posts ! I 'm so glad that I found your blog ! And I am always happy to see a new post of you in my blogroll ! <p> I will definitely try these pancakes ! They look delicious and yet there are filled with protein and as long as they contain bananas you just cant go wrong , right ? I wil try this ASAP Heidi kokborg recently posted .. To diet or not ? <p> These were absolutely delicious ! Just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated to a high temperature in a pan , such as when making pancakes , causes the protein structure to change and that good , olive-y fat becomes a saturated fat ! In some cases oils such as vegetable oil are much better because they will not become saturated when heated ! <p> Nooooo use coconut oil although its a saturated fat , its a very different kind of saturated fat than the ones your doctor wants you to avoid and please be aware that almost all veggie oil is SO not good for you its mostly all GMO now and besides , even polyunsaturates are stored as fat in your body . Coconut oil is a medium chain fatty acid that does not get stored as fat , but is used as energy immediately it does n't  require pancreatic enzymes or bile for digestion , and breaks down differently than poly or mono saturates , making it VERY healthy for you . Do yourself a favour and Stay away from vegetable oil for frying , and only use EVOO for uncooked dressings like that used for salads . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banana flavor ? Ive been making a " protein pancake " recipe for years that is 3 ingredients : oats , cottage cheese &amp; eggs or egg whites . I thought those were to die for but maybe this is the new trick thanks for the tip ! ! Miss you , a group of us are going to try to visit you @ body rok ! ! <p> I am just wondering if perhaps I am doing something wrong . I have tried making these three times and they just come out a soggy mess ? Did anyone else have that trouble when you made them and if so have you found an adjustment to fix it ? Right now I have only tried the egg and banana . I am not adding anything to it . I have tried with vegetable oil , olive oil and canola oil and all 3 times it has been the same . Can anyone help ? <p> These were awesome ! I took your advice with the flaxseed and it really helped keep everything together . Plus it made it that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the pancakes smaller and thinner , but then again that 's just my opinion . <p> Very tasty ! I agree , EVOO is not the oil of choice here , its burning temp is too low . Also needs a pinch of salt as the flavor seemed flat without it . Otherwise a great recipe and perfect for my 10 year old who is a carb hound at breakfast . Finally a way to please him AND mehe gets his pancakes , but these pancakes provide a vehicle to get a little protein into him in the morning ! Win-win . <p> I discovered this recipe two days ago from Blogilates on YouTube . All I can say is uh-mazing . I 'm planning to incorporate these pancakes into my weekly meal plan now ! Though one tip I have is to use a non-stick frying pan instead of coconut oil , that way you can cut down on more calories . I 've also tried to re-create this recipe with steamed pumpkin , but I have to admit it taste better with banana . <p> Ermagerd ! My daughter lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were ah-mazing ! One question though , I had a problem with the consistency of the batter . I was making them for a large group so I tripled the recipe , 3 bananas to 6 eggs , which led to more of a liquid than a batter . I added 1 cup of Krusteaz pancake mix and they came out fantastic . Though I was trying to avoid the pre-made mix , any tips ? <p> I just made these and tweaked them a little ; I used one egg , one egg white , and a scoop of protein powder . They held together well and had a very nice banana flavour ( although they did have a mild eggy flavour ) . Thanks for the inspo ! <p> My son is in love with these ! He asks for pancakes just about everydayhes in that picky 3 year old slump . I tried these tonight and.told him it was a secret recipe and he got super excited . After tasting then , he told me they were the best pancakes he s ever had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch ! <p> i can not wait to get home to try these babies . . . healthy pancakes not so much when ill slather them in nutella. . . but if they taste as good as they look they may become my not-so-naughty treat when i 'm off chocolate for lent ! thanks for sharing ! purpleheartsldn hannah recently posted .. new year new blog <p> i tried these last night they were excellent ! totally changed my life SO EASY ! no weighing of anything ! and while there was a very subtle banana taste , not so overpowering as i was expecting so could easily make them savoury . though of course i counteracted the healthiness by slathering them in nutella. delish ! x <p> Absolutely delicious ! ! ! and because I 'm dieting and I need to count my calories for now ( it keeps me on track ) I checked the pancakes calories on my favorite tool CalorieCalc.net and its really low in calories : ) ! ! ! Thank You for sharing your recipe is great : ) <p> So I tried these tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking so I poured the rest of the batter ( I doubled the recipe ) into a loaf pan , added a little cinnamon , and baked it until it was firm . Cut it into strips and it almost tastes like french toast <p> So I tried this recipe out this morning . Sugars from banana scorched although I had it on low . Had trouble getting it all to stay stuck together while turning over . Likely , its because my silver dollars were about the circumference of a small coffee mugwhich is the silver dollar size you get when you order this size pancake at a restaurant . Flavor was still awesome , however . Thinking I may add a couple tablespoons of coconut flour and see if it gives the egg more to bind to ? Coconut oil is perfect for these !

I made my own version today with banana and apple blended in the blender with eggs and it was so sweetI bought honey to put on it but ended up just leaving it behindlol 5$ spent for some other time I guess.they were great and I just wanted to leave that note because if you need to watch your sugar think about it and try one without honey or syrup and you 'll see it actually needs no sweetener or anythingimo it does n't  even need spices but that 's just me happy eating guys = <p> Just tried making these with egg-whites only .. Epic fail . Added a little bit of gf flour to the second batch and awaiting results but this time I was able to flip them at least ( as opposed to the soggy mess that happened the first time around . ) <p> jz tried this yesterday ! however i found it quite difficult to flip whole pancake as there 's no flourand burn quite easily ? did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up become a pancake mixture : ( <p> Thank you Ive been seeing these posted on FB recently but could n't find the recipe . I followed your advice and included flaxseed , vanilla and cinnamon . After the first two pancakes I added a half tsp of baking powder and it made them a little fluffier . Also a tiny bit of salt . Trader Joes now has a coconut oil spray that works very well for this . The other thing I found is that you really have to keep the heat low they get really dark really fast if you do n't  . <p> These are amazing ! ! I made them the last 2 mornings before work because they are so fast and easy to make . I added some chopped walnuts to the egg-banana batter and chia seeds ( because I did not have flax around ) and they held together great . Thank you for this great , simple , delish recipe ! ! <p> Wan na make it even better ? Throw the whole mixture in a pan , do n't  mash the banana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pumkin spice etc and drizzle with caramel a banana pudding to die for ! <p> I just tried it . My banana was on the small side , so I used only 1 egg . Cooked up nicely . And ummm , I 'm hooked . No need for syrup . The banana gives it that sweetness your looking for .

Yum ! <p> So sorry to have the only negative thing to say , but I made these and each pancake was soo burned ! It was probably just me , but can you think why ? I used a thawed banana that had been in the freezer , and just added a little cinnamon . I cooked them on med , and then med-low heat , and they all were black on the bottom before they even started to bubble or get firm enough to flip any suggestions ? <p> Do you think adding some raw honey to the egg + bannana would go well ? ? ?

I wanted to like these pancakes , as I 'm trying to eat healthier , but they just did n't  do it for me . I grew up on sugary , fatty , gluten-y bisquick pancakes so its no wonder my taste buds rejected this imposter . Additionally , I was n't able to fully follow the directions . We only had fresh ripe bananas , and I ended up using 2 because the hand mixer made the batter really soupy . I added cinnamon , pumpkin spice , and a little honey . I forgot the vanilla ( oops .. Do n't  think it would have made that much of a difference though ) and we did n't  have flax seed .

He was kind enough to show us around . <p> The first time we met up we indulged in hot pot . The second night ? He took us to a hotel mansion ( if you follow me on Snapchat , you already know this ! ) called J.E . Mansion . This particular spot was INSANE . It was definitely the most beautiful house Ive ever been in . Everything was so grand .

@@3098742 <h> Mini DeLites <h> summer cocktail essentials <p> Long story , but something unfortunate happened- to a family member last week so I 've been really trying to focus a lot of energy towards that person&amp; tonight , I can not lie , I am tired . Pooped . Wiped . Not even like work / workout / did n't  sleep kind of tired . <h> " Worrying is like a rocking chair . It will give you something to do , but it wo n't get you anywhere . " <p> &amp; every time guys , EVERY TIME , I worry I remind myself of this saying . <p> Yet I still rock in the chair ? <p> Very odd . I feel like especially as women , we worry . We just do , you know ? Its almost like its ingrained in us . <p> You go around in a circle , worrying . Half the stuff were worrying about never even happens . The other half is never as bad as we anticipate . Pointless to worry , if you really think about it . <p> Ultimately though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the family members situation . In fact , its sucked my energy &amp; personality which does n't  help THEM at all . I 'd be of more use if I was n't worrying at all . <p> What Ive realized is it takes way too much energy to over-worry . Really , I can not tell you how much energy its occupied in my brain for the last week &amp; a half . BUT this week is a new week &amp; I 'm actively working on directing any worry towards something more positive . We all make the mistake of worrying- too much . Perhaps its just human nature . <h> And that , guys , is where I 'm at today . <p> How do you overcome worry ? How do you get off the rocking chair ? &amp; how , HOW do you redirect your worries into something positive ? <p> Hope I did n't  depress you , its just where I 'm at today . Tomorrows a new day ! Its all part of life really . <p> Off to get some much-needed rest . Will have something more fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really worried about something , I like to journal about it . I think writing about all of your thoughts on it kind of gets it out of your system . Then when when the thoughts arise afterward I close my eyes and concentrate on my breath for a few moments to calm my mind . I hope things workout okay for your family member . <p> Sending good vibes your way ! I completely understand as I am an over-thinker and worry a lot . But that also means we care more , like we care A LOT . Traits of passionate people . <p> When I start to worry : I write down a list , some sort of action plan and then I ACT immediately . If its a family member or friend , I meditate . I legit get on my mat and just pray . And of course , INTERVALS ( as recommended by my FAV blogger &lt;3 ) . <p> I first try to remove myself from the person/thing/environment that 's making me feel this way . The only way that you can recover is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplate on what you need to do and focus on . I 've had terrible relations with family and I had to remove myself from them and interact with them on a limited basis . <p> Usually , I try to invest myself into improving myself more , looking towards my future , blogging/writing , my dog , sleeping . After a day or so I 'm usually fresh-faced and ready to kick ass and take names . <p> I 'm sorry Lauryn : / Two weeks ago I received some awful news about a close family member as well . This post resonated so strongly for me . I too have a history of anxiety .. Its been a huge sinking weight in my stomach and on my mind . The day after I found out , I signed up for my first SoulCycle class and it was game changing . I 've gone 11 times since then . Its helped me to physically move through some of the emotions of it .. for the rest of the worry , writing down my thoughts somehow helps offload it . Not a magical solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're family member is doing okor at least better then they have been . I had/have a similar situation . Back in December , my uncle got diagnosed with terminal brain cancer , and its nothing but worrying , stressing , draining emotions to try to heal him and myself ( along with the entire family ) . It does get easier , I 'm sure you know , it just takes time . Accepting that you ca n't fix things and that you 're not in control ( wayyyy easier said than done ) is the only way that it ever seems to get a little easier for me . I deal with anxiety on a daily basis , so trust me when I say that I understand the pain you 're going through and stress . It really is like a dementor ( I 'm a HUGE HP fan ) . On top of that , my mom has had 3 surgeries this year , and is looking to have another . When life gives you lemons , make lemonade . Or try . Does n't  mean it will be sweet and delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make you feel better . Do n't  push yourself in this hard time . The best thing to do is just listen to your body . If you need sleep , then by god sleep . If you need to drink , well , start drinking . And if you just need support and friendship , surround yourself with those you love most . It will get better . Thanks for everything you do for us everyday ! We all support you ! <p> My husband is undergoing lots of testing to figure out what is going on with his health . We also have a 2year old . We adopted this saying to keep us focused on having fun with our daughter in the moment . " Live in the needs of the day . " When we narrow ourselves to the needs of our day like playing with play dough , doing tasks at work , cooking meals , tending to our home ( not wants or random musings or what ifs in the future ) then it removes our worry . <p> wow this is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I 've just been so fucking stressed and worried . we are getting married in 3 weeks and like everything is a big deal and needs to be doen RIGHT NOWon top of that work is crazy .. its like sometimes i just feel like i cant keep up , ya know ? I 'm sorry about your family memberim sending love and prayers to them . That always sucks when you cant control the situation but you 're stuck in a place of feeling like you need to try . I love that quote and will remember that one from now on . Good luck and I hope everything turns out ok ! ! ! xo <p> Oh Lauryn , I am so sorry to hear you are going through this . Worrying is so emotionally draining and its a funny thing because it takes EVERYTHING from you , including sleep . I can be quite the Alice in Wonderland white rabbit ( and if you notice in the film , his eyes get redder and more bloodshot ) . Sometimes the only thing you can do is just get outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect , send positivity ( this sounds hokey but goes a long way ) , and again , just be . I 'm all about secret places I know this sounds weird , but here in both SF and when I lived in Dallas , secret places were a place that I found soothing ( usually by water ) , where I can go with some champagne in a swell bottle ( lol .. ) , my headphones , and only bring my phone for the music . It really does wonders . I so have a few other tips feel free to message me at any time , trust me , I go through this more times than I 'd like to admit and am here for you ! I know that sounds crazy but seriously though . When I was going through just very trying times , having someone to just e-mail helpeda lot . Sending so much healing and positive vibes your way and as a long time TSC reader , I appreciate your transparency . You have so many not just readers but FRIENDS who truly are about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really enjoy more personal posts . I know you try and stay away from thembut it does make you feel more relatable and human . Sometimes the way people perceive their lives on social media and blogs is all picture perfecta highlight real of their life . I look up to people who are able to just say whatever the F is going on with their lives , good , bad , or ugly , and its a positive space , not a depressing one , when you are covering topics that are important and actually mean something deep down to people . <p> All good things your way , Lauryn ! Thanks for being honest about the fact that even though you are a beautiful , smart , talented and loving woman you are indeed a woman . Human just like the rest of us . I appreciate your honesty and send love and peaceful feelings to you and yours ! <p> Worrying all the time is really something I struggle with . I know its useless , but i have a hard time shaking it off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing they worry too . It has actually gotten worse as I have gotten older and had my daughtermaybe more stuff to worry about now . I 'm well into my 40s and I really need to get a better handle on my tendency to worry . My old boss said to me one time " 90% of what we worry about never happens and the other 10% there was nothing you could do about it anyway " <p> I struggle with worrying every single day . Its draining , exhausting and as you say , completely pointless ! I love to hear really REAL posts like this from you . Keep em coming . And keep your chin up ! Reading your blog is something that brightens my day xxx <p> That quote is so true and refreshing to see . I could have used that mindset recently while making a big move . I have not yet figured out how to get off the rocking chair , but like you said , tomorrow is another day and all we can do is try and do a little better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronic worrier- thanks anxiety ! Its so effing hard to find balance , no matter how much I want to . I find myself drained a lot too &amp; its in those moments that yoga &amp; meditation/prayer really help . <p> I recently read Kate Hudsons book : Pretty Happy . One thing that has stuck with me and that i put on my Vision Board ( mood board , drawing board , etc ) is that : A Mindful person does n't  take on others emotions . I used to want to help and pump everyone up around me so much that i would walk away feeling drained and kind of like , hey , who is helping me kind of feeling . Anyhow natural progression of age and that quote from KATE has been life changing . I also agree with your comment of the rocking chair , 100% .. but honestly , i also tell myself i have to much LIVING to do to worry about everything . xoxoxooxoxox P.s. found your blog 2 weeks ago , obsessedi follow you on all social media platforms and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be BFFs . <p> So i know you and micheal are big readers so chances are you 're already read this book , but i 'd like to recommend 7 habits of highly effective people by stephen covey to you .
