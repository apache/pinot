This principle was articulated in the recognition that most existing metadata records , in practice , combined descriptions of what might conceptually be seen as multiple distinct entities . For example , metadata records about books routinely included information such as the affiliation of an author ( i.e. , a property of the author ) , or the metadata record about a painting ( e.g. , " Mona Lisa " ) might include description of the photograph itself ( a JPEG image ) . <p> The basic idea behind the One-to-One Principle became a fundamental feature of the RDF data model , which required that distinct resources be identified , distinguished , and described separately , as in the case of the original " Mona Lisa " , created in 1506 by Leonardo da Vinci , and a photograph of " Mona Lisa " created in 2008 by John Smith . Accepting RDF as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respect the One-to-One Principle and to transcend the limitations of " flat " single-resource descriptions . <p> What constitutes a " resource " , hence a meaningful object of description , lies of course in the eye of the beholder . In a simple bibliography , a book may be described as a single resource , whereas a trained library cataloger might perceive the same book as the Expression of a Work , the particular version of which ( Manifestation ) is available in multiple copies ( Items ) -- in effect , as four separate resources requiring four separate , though related , metadata descriptions , potentially retrieved from four separate sources . The One-to-One Principle , therefore , is relative to the variety of subjective viewpoints in the world , where some people make distinctions while others do not , and others yet may draw the boundaries differently . <p> The principle whereby related but conceptually different entities , for example a painting and a digital image of the painting , are described by separate metadata records 
@@100424300 @4624300/ <h> The One-To-One Principle : Challenges in Current Practice <p> Steven J. Miller <h> Abstract <p> The DCMI One-to-One Principle holds that related but conceptually different entities , such as a photograph and a digital image of that photograph , should be represented by separate metadata records . In practice , however , large numbers of practitioners do not adhere to this principle and commonly mix elements representing two related entities in a single metadata record . This paper explores reasons why this is the case , why it is problematic , how the principle itself would benefit from greater clarity , some practical options for maintaining the principle in current systems , with advantages and disadvantages of each . The paper focuses on the widespread application context of small to medium-sized cultural heritage institutions digitizing unique local resources , creating metadata using digital collection software packages such as CONTENTdm , and exposing only simple Dublin Core metadata for OAI harvesting and aggregating .

@@100424306 @4624306/ <p> This document is intended as an entry point for users of Dublin Core . For non-specialists , it will assist them in creating simple descriptive records for information resources ( for example , electronic documents ) . Specialists may find the document a useful point of reference to the documentation of Dublin Core , as it changes and grows . <h> 4 . The Elements <p> This section lists each element by its full name and label . For each element there are guidelines to assist in creating metadata content , whether it is done " from scratch " or by converting an existing record in another format . <p> In the element descriptions below , a formal single-word label is specified to make the syntactic specification of elements simpler for encoding schemes . Although some environments , such as HTML , are not case-sensitive , it is recommended best practice always to adhere to the case conventions in the element names given below to avoid conflicts in the event that the metadata is subsequently converted to a case-sensitive environment , such as XML . <p> Some information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While there will normally be a clear preferred choice , there is potential semantic overlap between some elements . Consequently , there will occasionally be some judgment required from the person assigning the metadata. <h> 4.1 . Title <p> Label : Title <p> Element Description : The name given to the resource . Typically , a Title will be a name by which the resource is formally known . <p> Guidelines for creation of content : <p> If in doubt about what constitutes the title , repeat the Title element and include the variants in second and subsequent Title iterations . If the item is in HTML , view the source document and make sure that the title identified in the title header ( if any ) is also included as a Title . <h> 4.2 . Subject <p> Label : Subject and Keywords <p> Element Description : The topic of the content of the resource . Typically , a Subject will be expressed as keywords or key phrases or classification codes that describe the topic of the resource . Recommended best practice is to select a value from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for creation of content : <p> Select subject keywords from the Title or Description information , or from within a text resource . If the subject of the item is a person or an organization , use the same form of the name as you would if the person or organization were a Creator or Contributor . <p> In general , choose the most significant and unique words for keywords , avoiding those too general to describe a particular item . Subject might include classification data if it is available ( for example , Library of Congress Classification Numbers or Dewey Decimal numbers ) or controlled vocabularies ( such as Medical Subject Headings or Art and Architecture Thesaurus descriptors ) as well as keywords . <p> When including terms from multiple vocabularies , use separate element iterations . If multiple vocabulary terms or keywords are used , either separate terms with semi-colons or use separate iterations of the Subject element . <h> 4.3 . Description <p> Label : Description <p> Element Description : An account of the content of the resource . Description may include but is not limited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a graphical representation of content or a free-text account of the content . <p> Guidelines for creation of content : <p> Since the Description field is a potentially rich source of indexable terms , care should be taken to provide this element when possible . Best practice recommendation for this element is to use full sentences , as description is often used to present information to users to assist in their selection of appropriate resources from a set of search results . <p> Descriptive information can be copied or automatically extracted from the item if there is no abstract or other structured description available . Although the source of the description may be a web page or other structured text with presentation tags , it is generally not good practice to include HTML or other structural tags within the Description element . Applications vary considerably in their ability to interpret such tags , and their inclusion may negatively affect the interoperability of the metadata . <p> Description= " Teachers Domain is a multimedia library for K-12 science educators , developed by WGBH through funding from the National Science Foundation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site offers a wealth of classroom-ready instructional resources , as well as online professional development materials and a set of tools which allows teachers to manage , annotate , and share the materials they use in classroom teaching . " <h> 4.4 . Type <p> Label : Resource Type <p> Element Description : The nature or genre of the content of the resource . Type includes terms describing general categories , functions , genres , or aggregation levels for content . Recommended best practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary ( for example , the DCMIType vocabulary ) . To describe the physical or digital manifestation of the resource , use the FORMAT element . <p> Guidelines for content creation : <p> If the resource is composed of multiple mixed types then multiple or repeated Type elements should be used to describe the main components . <p> Because different communities or domains are expected to use a variety of type vocabularies , best practice to ensure interoperability is to include at least one general type term from the DCMIType vocabulary in addition to the domain specific type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Type= " Image " Type= " Sound " Type= " Text " Type= " simulation " <p> Note : The first three values are taken from the DCMI Type Vocabulary , and follow the capitalization conventions for that vocabulary . The last value is a term from an unspecified source . <p> The item described is an Electronic art exhibition catalog : <p> Type= " Image " Type= " Text " Type= " Exhibition catalog " <p> Note : The first two values are taken from the DCMI Type Vocabulary , and follow the capitalization conventions for that vocabulary . The last value is a term from an unspecified source . <p> The item described is a Multimedia educational program with interactive assignments : <p> Type= " Image " Type= " Text " Type= " Software " Type= " InteractiveResource " <p> Note : All values in this example are taken from the DCMI Type Vocabulary , and follow the capitalization conventions for that vocabulary . <h> 4.5 . Source <p> Label : Source <p> Element Description : A Reference to a resource from which the present resource @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Source resource in whole or part . Recommended best practice is to reference the resource by means of a string or number conforming to a formal identification system . <p> Guidelines for content creation : <p> In general , include in this area information about a resource that is related intellectually to the described resource but does not fit easily into a Relation element . <p> Examples : <p> Source= " RC607.A26W574 1996 " where " RC607.A26W574 1996 " is the call number of the print version of the resource , from which the present version was scanned <p> Source= " Image from page 54 of the 1922 edition of Romeo and Juliet " <h> 4.6 . Relation <p> Label : Relation <p> Element Description : A reference to a related resource . Recommended best practice is to reference the resource by means of a string or number conforming to a formal identification system . <p> Guidelines for content creation : <p> Relationships may be expressed reciprocally ( if the resources on both ends of the relationship are being described ) or in one direction only , even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text strings are used instead of identifying numbers , the reference should be appropriately specific . For instance , a formal bibliographic citation might be used to point users to a particular resource . <p> Because the refined terms used with Relation provide significantly more information to a user than the unqualified use of Relation , implementers who are describing heavily interrelated resources might choose to use qualified Dublin Core . <p> Examples : <p> Title= " Reading Turgenev " Relation= " Two Lives " Resource is a collection of two novellas , one of which is " Reading Turgenev " Relationship described is IsPartOf . <p> Part/Whole relations are those in which one resource is a physical or logical part of another <p> Title= " Candle in the Wind " Subject= " Diana , Princess of Wales " Date= " 1997 " Creator= " John , Elton " Type= " sound " Description= " Tribute to a dead princess . " Relation= " Elton John 's 1976 song Candle in the Wind " Relationship described is IsVersionOf . <p> Version relations are those in which one resource is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same creator <p> Format transformation relations are those in which one resource has been derived from another by a reproduction or reformatting technology which is not fundamentally an interpretation but intended to be a representation . <p> Title= " Morgan 's Ancient Society " Relation= " Engels ' Origin of the Family , Private Property and the State " Relationship described is IsReferencedBy <p> Dependency relations are those in which one resource requires another resource for its functioning , delivery , or content and can not be used without the related resource being present. <h> 4.7 . Coverage <p> Label : Coverage <p> Element Description : The extent or scope of the content of the resource . Coverage will typically include spatial location ( a place name or geographic co-ordinates ) , temporal period ( a period label , date , or date range ) or jurisdiction ( such as a named administrative entity ) . Recommended best practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary ( for example , the Thesaurus of Geographic Names Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names , http : //www. **40;0;TOOLONG ) . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in preference to numeric identifiers such as sets of co-ordinates or date ranges . <p> Guidelines for content creation : <p> Whether this element is used for spatial or temporal information , care should be taken to provide consistent information that can be interpreted by human users , particularly in order to provide interoperability in situations where sophisticated geographic or time-specific searching is not supported . For most simple applications , place names or coverage dates might be most useful . For more complex applications , consideration should be given to using an encoding scheme that supports appropriate specification of information , such as DCMI Period , DCMI Box or DCMI Point . <h> 4.8 . Creator <p> Label : Creator <p> Element Description : An entity primarily responsible for making the content of the resource . Examples of a Creator include a person , an organization , or a service . Typically the name of the Creator should be used to indicate the entity . <p> Guidelines for creation of content : <p> Creators should be listed separately , preferably in the same order that they appear in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name first , followed by forename or given name . When in doubt , give the name as it appears , and do not invert . <p> In the case of organizations where there is clearly a hierarchy present , list the parts of the hierarchy from largest to smallest , separated by full stops and a space . If it is not clear whether there is a hierarchy present , or unclear which is the larger or smaller portion of the body , give the name as it appears in the item . <p> If the Creator and Publisher are the same , do not repeat the name in the Publisher area . If the nature of the responsibility is ambiguous , the recommended practice is to use Publisher for organizations , and Creator for individuals . In cases of lesser or ambiguous responsibility , other than creation , use Contributor . <h> 4.9 . Publisher <p> Label : Publisher <p> Element Description : The entity responsible for making the resource available . Examples of a Publisher include a person , an organization , or a service . Typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate the entity . <p> Guidelines for content creation : <p> The intent of specifying this field is to identify the entity that provides access to the resource . If the Creator and Publisher are the same , do not repeat the name in the Publisher area . If the nature of the responsibility is ambiguous , the recommended practice is to use Publisher for organizations , and Creator for individuals . In cases of ambiguous responsibility , use Contributor . <h> 4.10 . Contributor <p> Label : Contributor <p> Element Description : An entity responsible for making contributions to the content of the resource . Examples of a Contributor include a person , an organization or a service . Typically , the name of a Contributor should be used to indicate the entity . <p> Guideline for content creation : <p> The same general guidelines for using names of persons or organizations as Creators apply here . Contributor is the most general of the elements used for " agents " responsible for the resource , so should be used when primary responsibility is unknown or irrelevant . <h> 4.11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Information about rights held in and over the resource . Typically a Rights element will contain a rights management statement for the resource , or reference a service providing such information . Rights information often encompasses Intellectual Property Rights ( IPR ) , Copyright , and various Property Rights . If the rights element is absent , no assumptions can be made about the status of these and other rights with respect to the resource . <p> Guidelines for content creation : <p> The Rights element may be used for either a textual statement or a URL pointing to a rights statement , or a combination , when a brief statement and a more lengthy one are available . <h> 4.12 . Date <p> Label : Date <p> Element Description : A date associated with an event in the life cycle of the resource . Typically , Date will be associated with the creation or availability of the resource . Recommended best practice for encoding the date value is defined in a profile of ISO 8601 Date and Time Formats , W3C Note , http : //www.w3.org/TR/NOTE- datetime and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> If the full date is unknown , month and year ( YYYY-MM ) or just year ( YYYY ) may be used . Many other schemes are possible , but if used , they may not be easily interpreted by users or software . <p> Examples : <p> Date= " 1998-02-16 " Date= " 1998-02 " Date= " 1998 " <h> 4.13 . Format <p> Label : Format <p> Element Description : The physical or digital manifestation of the resource . Typically , Format may include the media-type or dimensions of the resource . Examples of dimensions include size and duration . Format may be used to determine the software , hardware or other equipment needed to display or operate the resource . <p> In addition to the specific physical or electronic media format , information concerning the size of a resource may be included in the content of the Format element if available . In resource discovery size , extent or medium of the resource might be used as a criterion to select resources of interest , since a user may need to evaluate whether they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> When more than one category of format information is included in a single record , they should go in separate iterations of the element . <h> 4.14 . Identifier <p> Label : Resource Identifier <p> Element Description : An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context . Recommended best practice is to identify the resource by means of a string or number conforming to a formal identification system . Examples of formal identification systems include the Uniform Resource Identifier ( URI ) ( including the Uniform Resource Locator ( URL ) , the Digital Object Identifier ( DOI ) and the International Standard Book Number ( ISBN ) . <p> Guidelines for content creation : <p> This element can also be used for local identifiers ( e.g. I 'd numbers or call numbers ) assigned by the Creator of the resource to apply to a particular item . It should not be used for identification of the metadata record itself . <h> 4.15 . Language <p> Label : Language <p> Element Description : A language of the intellectual content of the resource . Recommended best practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RFC 3066 RFC 3066 , http : //www.ietf.org/rfc/ rfc3066.txt which , in conjunction with ISO 639 ISO 639 , http : //www.oasis- **27;42;TOOLONG ) , defines two- and three-letter primary language tags with optional subtags . Examples include " en " or " eng " for English , " akk " for Akkadian , and " en-GB " for English used in the United Kingdom . <p> Guidelines for content creation : <p> Either a coded value or text string can be represented here . If the content is in more than one language , the element may be repeated . <p> Examples : <p> Language= " en " Language= " fr " Language= " Primarily English , with some abstracts also in French . " Language= " en-US " <p> NOTE : Audience , Provenance and RightsHolder are elements , but not part of the Simple Dublin Core fifteen elements . Use Audience , Provenance and RightsHolder only when using Qualified Dublin Core . <h> 4.16 . Audience <p> Label : Audience <p> Element Description : A class of entity for whom the resource is intended or useful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the publisher or by a third party . <p> Guidelines for content creation : <p> Audience terms are best utilized in the context of formal or informal controlled vocabularies . None are presently recommended or registered by DCMI , but several communities of interest are engaged in setting up audience vocabularies . In the absence of recommended controlled vocabularies , implementors are encouraged to develop local lists of values , and to use them consistently . <h> 4.17 . Provenance <p> Label : Provenance <p> Element Description : A statement of any changes in ownership and custody of the resource since its creation that are significant for its authenticity , integrity and interpretation . The statement may include a description of any changes successive custodians made to the resource . <p> Guidelines for content creation : <p> Examples : <p> Provenance= " This copy once owned by Benjamin Spock . " Provenance= " Estate of Hunter Thompson . " Provenance= " Stolen in 1999 ; recovered by the Museum in 2003. " <h> 4.18 . RightsHolder <p> Label : Rights Holder <p> Element Description : A person or organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice is to use the URI or name of the Rights Holder to indicate the entity . <p> Guidelines for content creation : <p> Since , for the most part , people and organizations are not typically assigned URIs , a person or organization holding rights over a resource would be named using a text string . People and organizations sometimes have websites , but URLs for these are not generally appropriate for use in this context , since they are not clearly identifying the person or organization , but rather the location of a website about them . <p> Examples : <p> RightsHolder= " Stuart Weibel " RightsHolder= " University of Bath " <h> 4.19 . InstructionalMethod <p> Label : Instructional Method <p> Element Description : A process , used to engender knowledge , attitudes and skills , that the resource is designed to support . Instructional Method will typically include ways of presenting instructional materials or conducting instructional activities , patterns of learner-to-learner and learner-to-instructor interactions , and mechanisms by which group and individual levels of learning are measured . Instructional methods include all aspects of the instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback . <p> Guidelines for content creation : <p> Best practice is to use terms from controlled vocabularies , whether developed for the use of a particular project or in general use in an educational context . 
@@100424310 @4624310/ <h> Abstract <p> Within the cultural heritage community , it is increasingly common to distinguish the tasks of identification and addressing the object by using a location-independent Persistent Identifier ( PI ) such as a URN , a DOI , or a Handle linked to a URL describing the object location in an institutional repository or a digital long-term preservation system run by a national library . This way , the problem that a digital object is inaccessible if the content provider moves it to a different location can be solved since the object can still be found using the PI . In order to resolve a PI to a URL with the object location , a resolution service is required , which usually is run by the national library acting as legal deposit for the digital object . This requires the user to know , which national library is responsible for the service , which is a problem for digital library portals collecting metadata from content providers in different cultural settings and from different nations .

@@100424312 @4624312/ <h> Abstract <p> Metadata is one of the keys for digital archiving and preservation . This is well recognized as an important issue in our networked information society . There are several standards for archival and preservation metadata , e.g. ISAD(G) , EAD , AGRkMS , PREMIS , and OAIS . This leads to selection and interoperability issues for metadata standards in the design of metadata schemas for particular archival systems . This paper identifies features of metadata standards to appropriately select , combine and use them in the resource lifecycle . We present a feature analysis of the metadata standards by identifying the primary resource lifecycle stage(s) where a standard would be applied . Based on this feature analysis , this paper proposes a framework to help selection , combination and use of metadata schemas for digital archiving and preservation . Then , we propose to categorize metadata elements using 5W1H attributes ? What , Why , Where , Who , When and How ? coupled with a task model derived from the resource lifecycle . In this study , metadata elements of the chosen standards are categorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mappings are grouped and sorted in accordance with the task model . The 5W1H and task models are applied to six element sets chosen from major metadata standards .

Note that no change is proposed for the descriptions of the properties dc:contributor , dc:creator , dc:publisher Rationale : ========== Issue 1 : Range of Properties The three properties above were defined with a range of the class dcterms:Agent - this is the characteristic which distinguishes the properties from their dc : * counterparts . i.e. the intent is that , from the perspective of the DCAM , they are used with non-literal values , rather than literal values , or , from the perspective of the RDF model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an RDF predicate the object should be a URI or blank node , but not a literal . i.e. the intent is that the properties are to be used in constructs of the form ( DCAM-1 ) Description ( Statement ( PropertyURI ( dcterms:creator ) ValueString ( " Jim Jarmusch " ) ) ) ( RDF-Turtle-1 ) : filmF dcterms:creator : personP . : personP rdf:value " Jim Jarmusch " . However , the presence of the comment above introduces a contradiction , or at least an element of ambiguity , because the phrase " the name ... should be used to indicate the entity " might be read as encouraging the use of the forms : ( DCAM-2 ) Description ( Statement ( PropertyURI ( dcterms:creator ) LiteralValueString ( " Jim Jarmusch " ) ) ) ( RDF-Turtle-2 ) : filmF dcterms:creator " Jim Jarmusch " . These two constructs ( DCAM-2 , RDF-Turtle-2 ) are inconsistent with the intent that the property not be used with literal values . One of the primary motivations for creating these three dcterms : * properties - apart from the " why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - was to try to achieve a consistent usage of these properties , i.e. to declare/describe the properties in such a way that implementers would use the forms DCAM-1 and RDF-Turtle-1 , and the forms DCAM-2 and RDF-Turtle-2 were not used . But in the RDF case , to an RDF implementer , the phrase " the name ... should be used to indicate the entity " strongly implies strongly implies that the property be used with a literal object , which is not its intended use . Issue 2 : A Name is not Required It is not a requirement that a name is provided when using these properties : it is quite acceptable when using these properties to provide only a " value URI " /URI as object , or to describe the value/use a blank node , and provide various properties of the agent ( email address , home page , whatever ) , without providing a name of the agent as a value string . Issue 3 : Consistency with other DCMI term descriptions The form of words " the name ... should be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , which was defined after the original dc : * properties and before the three dcterms : * properties discussed here . In conclusion , deleting the sentence ( i ) takes a step towards removing the ambiguity ; it does n't stop people ignoring the range and using literal objects , but it avoids making the implication that this is an option ; ( ii ) removes the requirement that a name " should " be provided ; ( iii ) makes the definitions of these three properties consistent with that of dcterms:rightsHolder ( iv ) has no effect on the definitions of the dc : * properties . Method : ======= -- Edit LONG ... to create new term versions for the three properties -- Commit to VMT for next documentation build <p> Resolved : ========= To specify the range " Literal " for dcterms:title and dcterms:alternative in DCMI Metadata Terms ( " rdfs:range rdfs:Literal " ) . This resolution confirms an earlier decision discussed in December 2008 1 and not implemented . Rationale : ========== The DCMI Usage Board is specifying the range of dcterms:title , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , to the best of our knowledge , most applications currently use " title " with literal values , and because a literal values are simple to implement . The Usage Board Use acknowledges important cases which require " title " ( or " alternative " ) to be used with a non-literal value - i.e. , to consider the title as a resource in its own right , with multiple properties and values beyond just one text string . For example , a single title in Japanese may need to be rendered in more than one script . Implementers wishing to use titles with non-literal values have the option of using the legacy properties http : **32;71;TOOLONG and http : **38;105;TOOLONG - or of coining a new , non-DCMI properties with non-literal ranges . The Usage Board notes that for reasons of interoperability , such new properties could be declared as sub-properties of http : **32;145;TOOLONG 
@@100424321 @4624321/ <p> This document provides guidelines for capturing bibliographic citation information within a Dublin Core description . It focuses on bibliographic citations for journal articles , but it also considers other genre . It deals primarily with bibliographic citations for a resource within its own metadata , but some guidelines for describing references to other resources are also indicated . Some other issues that arise when describing a bibliographic resource using Dublin Core metadata are also discussed . <h> 1 Introduction and Scope <p> bibliographic citations for journal articles , this being the most common genre for which such description is required , but guidelines for other genre are also given <p> bibliographic citations for a resource within its own metadata , but some guidelines for capturing references to other resources are also indicated <p> qualified Dublin Core descriptions , though some suggestions for capturing this information in simple Dublin Core are also given <p> In addition to a need to describe bibliographic citation information for discovery and for reading by humans after retrieval of a record , some applications have a requirement to encode this information in a format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of descriptions taken from the OpenURL Framework standard ( Z39.88-2004 ) 1 , rather than inventing an alternative DCMI syntax . <p> Many implementations have needed a way to describe journal articles and , because of the lack of any guidelines , have invented many ad hoc solutions , which solve the problem locally but discourage interoperability . These guidelines provide a recommended and thus interoperable way to encode bibliographic citation information within a Dublin Core description . <p> It is expected that these guidelines will be useful when the intention is to use Dublin Core metadata to describe bibliographic items for resource discovery or for simple , interoperable resource description . These guidelines do not aim to provide a solution for more complex metadata description requirements , and they do not seek to replace metadata schemes more suitable in such cases . For more detailed ways to describe bibliographic items in XML , it is suggested that alternatives schemes , for example PRISM 2 , MODS 3 , or NLM Data 4 , may be more appropriate . <p> This document does not provide detailed guidelines for the XML @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for XML encoding will be published in a separate , future document . <p> In the various tables of data below a disctinction is made between property values that are simple strings , known as ' value strings ' , and those that should be interpreted as URIs , known as ' value URIs ' . Where appropriate a vocabulary encoding scheme is indicated for a value string . <p> The following abbreviations are used for Dublin Core namespaces within this document : <p> Abbreviation <p> Namespace <p> dc : <p> http : **27;179;TOOLONG <p> dcterms : <p> http : //purl.org/dc/terms/ <p> These guidelines are the outcome of discussions over several years by the DCMI Citation Working Group 5 . They supersede and deprecate any previous proposed recommendations by the group other than those that have been endorsed by the DCMI Usage Board . Before the introduction of the Dublin Core term ' bibliographicCitation ' it was not obvious how to describe fully a journal article using Dublin Core metadata . There was no suitable Dublin Core property to capture the journal title , as distinct from the article title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than as part of a general description . Various suggested solutions were proposed , the most attractive one being to describe the journal and issue information as an ' isPartOf ' relation , but this would not include the page details , those being pertinent to the article itself . <h> 2 Bibliographic Citations in Qualified Dublin Core <h> 2.1 Citation Information within a Described Resource <p> Recommendation 1 . Use **29;208;TOOLONG to capture the bibliographic citation information for a resource . <p> The recommended property to describe the bibliographic citation information for a resource within its own metadata is **29;239;TOOLONG . This is an element refinement of dc:identifier , defined in the ' dcterms ' namespace . The value of this property would hold details of the bibliographic item that contains the resource along with the position of the resource within it . Thus for a journal article it could capture the journal title , volume and issue numbers , pagination and publication date , or for a book chapter the book details and pagination . Other details of the resource , such as its title and creators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Optionally , but redundantly , these details may be included in the citation as well . The ISSN of a journal or the ISBN of a book may be captured as a value URI within a dcterms:isPartOf relation property . Examples 1 and 2 show Dublin Core metadata descriptions for a journal article and a conference paper . These are given in tabular form , rather than any specific syntax , but would be suitable for use within any recommended Dublin Core syntax . <p> Example 1 .

Always provide a plain text citation <p> For general resource discovery and human readability the value of a bibliographicCitation property should be given in plain text . Even when a machine-parsable citation is provided , it is recommended that the citation be repeated as a corresponding plain text citation . <p> Plain text citations may be according to a recognised citation style . Several styles were reviewed by the DCMI Citation Working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page , but there is no particular recommendation for choice of style . The style used can be indicated as an encoding scheme if it has a URI . Otherwise , there is no DCMI endorsed encoding scheme to indicate a citation style . <p> A text bibliographic citation should contain sufficient detail to identify the resource by that citation . **29;448;TOOLONG is an element refinement of dc:identifier , recognising that a bibliographic resource is effectively identified by its citation information . Thus for a journal article the value of a **29;479;TOOLONG property should contain at a minimum : the journal title ( or some other identifier of the journal ) ; the volume and issue or part numbers as appropriate ; the start page number , or some other identification within the journal issue for an electronic-only article . It is probably also sensible to provide : the full pagination information , i.e. to include the last page number ; and the date of publication , even though this may be repeating the value of a separate dcterms:issued property . Some sample plain text citations are in Example 3. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine-readable citations use an OpenURL ContextObject . <p> The provision of a machine parsable citation is encouraged to promote digital interoperability . <p> The ' OpenURL Framework for Context-Sensitive Services ' is the ANSI/NISO standard , Z39.88-2004 . It provides a way to describe a referenced resource , bundled together with the associated resources that comprise the context of the reference . This package is called a ' ContextObject ' . The standard also defines flavours of ' OpenURL ' , which are methods of transporting these descriptions between networked systems . The ContextObject is the ' payload ' of an OpenURL , but may also be an autonomous data object , and thus the value of a Dublin Core property . Further details of the OpenURL Framework standard are given in Appendix A. <p> Currently the OpenURL Framework defines metadata formats in its initial registry 7 , and hence as part of the standard , for : journals and parts of journals ; books and parts of books , including conference proceedings and papers , reports and simple documents ; dissertations ; and patents . It is probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> These metadata formats are available as both Key/Encoded-Value ( KEV ) and XML formats . Use of the XML format will be described in a future document . But for many uses , other than XML applications , the KEV format will be the most appropriate . The KEV format is a string of ' ampersand ' -delimited pairs , each pair consisting of a label , or key , and an associated value , separated by an ' equals ' . The value is ' URL-encoded ' , which means that special characters are translated into their equivalent hexadecimal byte strings to prevent their misinterpretation when transported by HTTP ( e.g. ' / ' becomes ' %2F ' , ' : ' becomes ' %3A ' ) . <p> Examples 4 and 6 show the keys and values for bibliographic citation information for the same journal article and conference paper as in Examples 1 and 2 . Examples 5 and 7 show the complete URL-encoded ContextObject for the same examples , within a bibliographicCitation property encoded in XHTML . Example 5 also includes the journal ISSN as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are probably the most commonly used ContextObject keys to describe the resource , the ' referent ' in OpenURL Framework terminology . The full metadata formats are defined in the OpenURL Registry 7 , these examples using the journal metadata format 8 and the book metadata format 9 . There are more examples in the KEV Implementation Guidelines 10 . Optionally the ContextObject could contain further details such as the article title and authors , but these are redundant within a Dublin Core description . Note that because of Recommendation 3 there should be sufficient information within the ContextObject to identify the resource . <p> Optionally the ContextObject may include a ' referrer ' , that is the originator of the ContextObject , thus indicating its provenance . In the examples the referrer is the Zetoc current awareness and document delivery service . A referrer is identified as a URI within the ' info:sid/ ' scheme using the DNS name of the service , followed optionally by the database name , e.g. **26;510;TOOLONG . <p> The KEV ContextObject used here to describe a citation is identified by a URI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistency with the guidelines for expressing Dublin Core in XHTML , it is referenced as an element ' ctx ' of a schema ' info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx : ' named ' KEV ' . The required declaration is shown at the beginning of Example 5 . <p> In Dublin Core Abstract Model 11 terms the value of the **29;538;TOOLONG property is a value string , encoded according to a KEV ContextObject encoding scheme . It is not intended to be the resource identifier , which for a journal article would probably use an appropriate URI scheme such as DOI

The libraries who have published Linked Data have all used different data models for structuring their bibliographic data . Some are using a FRBR-based model where Works , Expressions and Manifestations are represented separately . Others have chosen basic Dublin Core , dumbing down their data into a lowest common denominator format . And still others are using variations of BIBFRAME . The proliferation of data models limits the reusability of bibliographic data . In effect , libraries have moved from MARC silos to Linked Data silos of incompatible data models . There is currently no universal model for how to represent bibliographic metadata as Linked Data , even though many attempts for such a model have been made . <p> In this webinar , by Osma Suominen of the National Library of Finland , will present : ( 1 ) a survey of published bibliographic Linked Data , the data models proposed for representing bibliographic data as RDF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) an analysis of different use cases for bibliographic Linked Data and how they affect the data model ; and ( 3 ) recommendations for choosing a data model . <p> 2017-03-03 , The DC-2017 Call for Participation ( CfP ) has been published .

@@100424323 @4624323/ <p> Title : Editorial changes to terms in the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set ( DCMES ) Identifier : LONG ... Date : 2006-12-18 1 . About this decision text In 2006 , the DCMI Usage Board undertook an editorial revision of terms in the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set ( DCMES ) in order to clarify intended semantics and bring the wording of their definitions and usage comments into line with the language of the DCMI Abstract Model DCAM . An initial set of changes was posted for Public Comment from 28 August to 25 September 2006 PUBLIC-COMMENT . The comments received were discussed at a face-to-face Usage Board meeting in Manzanillo , Mexico , on 30 September 2006 MANZANILLO . This document reflects decisions taken with respect to the Public Comment document in Manzanillo MANZANILLO-DECISIONS and on a subsequence teleconference of 27 October TELECON-DECISIONS . A separate document details the response to comments made RESPONSE . The wordings recorded here are reflected in revised versions of the documents " DCMI Metadata Terms " DCTERMS , " Dublin Core Metadata Element Set , Version 1.1 : Reference Description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete historical record " DCTERMS-HISTORY . All of the changes recorded here were evaluated by the DCMI Usage Board in light of the DCMI Namespace Policy NAMESPACE . The namespace policy says that DCMI terms are identified using Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URIs ) . In accordance with the principle that distinct URIs should be assigned to distinct resources , the policy sets limits on the range of editorial changes that may allowably be made to the official labels , definitions , and usage comments associated with DCMI terms . By policy , any changes of meaning judged " likely to have a substantial impact on either machine processing of DCMI terms or the functional semantics of the terms " must trigger the creation of a new , distinct term with a new , distinct URI . In the opinion of the Usage Board , the changes described in this document are unlikely to have a substantial impact on either machine processing of DCMI terms or the functional semantics of the terms -- i.e. , they fall within the allowable range of editorial change . The changes constitute clarifications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback , and implementation experience . They provide the final twist of the lens that brings intended meanings more sharply into focus . 2 . Decision texts 2.1 . URI : http : **32;596;TOOLONG Label : Title Definition : A name given to the resource . Comment : Typically , a Title will be a name by which the resource is formally known . 2.2 . URI : http : **34;630;TOOLONG Label : Creator Definition : An entity primarily responsible for making the resource . Comment : Examples of a Creator include a person , an organization , or a service . Typically , the name of a Creator should be used to indicate the entity . 2.3 . URI : http : **34;666;TOOLONG Label : Subject Definition : The topic of the resource . Comment : Typically , the topic will be represented using keywords , key phrases , or classification codes . Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary . To describe the spatial or temporal topic of the resource , use the Coverage element . 2.4 .

URI : http : **38;780;TOOLONG Label : Contributor Definition : An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource . Comment : Examples of a Contributor include a person , an organization , or a service . Typically , the name of a Contributor should be used to indicate the entity . 2.7 . URI : http : **31;820;TOOLONG Label : Date Definition : A point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource . Comment : Date may be used to express temporal information at any level of granularity . Recommended best practice is to use an encoding scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.8 . URI : http : **31;853;TOOLONG Label : Type Definition : The nature or genre of the resource . Comment : Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the DCMI Type Vocabulary DCMITYPE . To describe the file format , physical medium , or dimensions of the resource , use the Format element . 2.9 . URI : http : **33;886;TOOLONG Label : Format Definition : The file format , physical medium , or dimensions of the resource . Comment : Examples of dimensions include size and duration . Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the list of Internet Media Types MIME . 2.10 . URI : http : **37;921;TOOLONG Label : Identifier Definition : An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context . Comment : Recommended best practice is to identify the resource by means of a string conforming to a formal identification system . 2.11 . URI : http : **33;960;TOOLONG Label : Source Definition : The resource from which the described resource is derived . Comment : The described resource may be derived from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice is to identify the related resource by means of a string conforming to a formal identification system . 2.12 .

Comment : Spatial topic may be a named place or a location specified by its geographic coordinates . Temporal period may be a named period , date , or date range . A jurisdiction may be a named administrative entity or a geographic place to which the resource applies . Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , named places or time periods can be used in preference to numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates or date ranges . 2.15 . URI : http : **33;1106;TOOLONG Label : Rights Definition : Information about rights held in and over the resource . Comment : Typically , rights information includes a statement about various property rights associated with the resource , including intellectual property rights . 3 . General categories of change 3.1 . Replacement of the phrase " the content of the resource " ( or " intellectual content of the resource " ) with " the resource " . Implementation experience has shown the semantic distinction between a resource and the " content of " a resource to be a source of confusion . According to the DCMI Abstract Model , a DCMI metadata description " describes one , and only one , resource " DCAM . In the DCMI context , this principle dates back to 1997 , when it was known as the " one-to-one principle " . When the one-to-one principle is correctly followed , the semantic restriction to " the content of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dublin Core elements are used to describe things other than document-like resources -- things such as physical objects and abstract concepts . For example , a stuffed animal has a Creator ( perhaps a taxidermist , or an artist ) but that person is not specifically the creator of " the content of " the stuffed animal . In light of current usage , the meaning of the original distinction between a resource and its content is no longer clear . In the opinion of the Usage Board , dropping the words " the content of " from definitions affirms the semantics of these terms as they have been understood in practice and with no significant practical impact on implementation . This change is relevant to the definitions of Contributor , Creator , Coverage , Description , Subject , Type , and Language . 3.2 . Replacement of the phrase " a reference to a resource " with " a resource " . In metadata , a related resource can be " referred to " only by means of a " reference " , whether that reference is a text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore redundant . The recommendation that formal identifiers be used is retained in the usage comments . This change is relevant to the definitions of Source and Relation and to the comment for Description . 3.3 . Replacement of phrases such as " use a value from an encoding scheme " and " select a value from a controlled vocabulary " with " use a controlled vocabulary " . The wording " use a controlled vocabulary " is more concise . The term " controlled vocabulary " is intentionally broad . This change is relevant to the comments for Coverage , Format , Subject , and Type . 3.4 . Deletion of word " Resource " from the labels " Resource Type " and " Resource Identifier " . In the DCMI context , the terms Type and Identifier are the only two to have used the qualifier " resource " in their labels . For example , Title is not called " Resource Title " and Date not " Resource Date " . This inconsistency has been corrected by dropping the unnecessary reference to " resource " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labels of the elements ( " Type " and " Identifier " ) in line with their names ( " type " and " identifier " ) . 3.5 . Replacement of the phrase " a string or number conforming to a formal identification system " with " a string conforming to a formal identification system " . A number is also a string , so the words " or number " are redundant . This change is relevant to the comments for Identifier , Relation , and Source . 4 . Changes with respect to DCMES of June 2005 DCMITERMS , term by term 4.1 . Title No changes . 4.2 . Creator -- In definition , replaces " content of the resource " with " resource " see Section 3.1 4.3 . Subject -- Changes label from " Subject and Keywords " to " Subject " . It continues to be acknowledged in the comment that a subject may be expressed with keywords . This change also brings the label of the element ( " Subject " ) in line with its name ( " subject " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coverage element be used to describe the spatial or temporal topic of the resource . -- In definition , replaces " content of the resource " with " resource " see Section 3.1 -- In comment , replaces " use a value from an encoding scheme " with " use a controlled vocabulary " see Section 3.3 -- In comment , " expressed as " reworded as " represented using " . 4.4 .

Publisher -- In definition , addition of missing full stop . 4.6 . Contributor -- In definition , replaces " content of the resource " with " resource " see Section 3.1 4.7 . Date -- As with Language see Section 4.12 , the reference to a specific encoding scheme in the comment is changed from " recommended best practice " to the status of an example . Hence : " Recommended best practice is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ISO 8601 W3CDTF " . -- The intended scope of the Date element has been the object of much discussion in the DCMI community . In practice , Date has long been interpreted to include the notion of a date range . The release in July 2000 of a first set of " Dublin Core qualifiers " -- which included Available , defined as referring to a " date ( often a range ) " -- consolidated this interpretation . The Usage Board has now brought the definition of Date into line with this long-standing practical interpretation by explicitly allowing date ranges . Hence : " A point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource . " 4.8 . Type -- In definition , replaces " content of the resource " with " resource " see Section 3.1 -- In comment , replaces the phrase " select a value from a controlled vocabulary " with " use a controlled vocabulary " see Section 3.3 -- In label , changes " Resource Type " to " Type " see Section 3.4 4.9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or digital manifestation of the resource " has been a source of confusion . For example , it is sometimes misinterpreted as referring to a related resource that is a " manifestation " in the sense of Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records ( FRBR ) . -- The new wording moves words from the original comment for Format into the definition in order to describe the intended meaning more concretely. -- In comment , replaces " select a value from an encoding scheme " with " use a controlled vocabulary " see Section 3.3 4.10 . Identifier -- Definition unchanged . -- In comment , replaces " a string or number conforming to a formal identification system " with " a string conforming to a formal identification system " see Section 3.5 -- In label , changed " Resource Identifier " to " Identifier " see Section 3.4 -- In comment , deletes references to specific identification systems 4.11 .

Language -- Six of the fifteen elements of DCMES -- Type , Format , Coverage , Subject , Language , and Date -- are recommended to be used with encoding schemes . Only in the cases of Language and Date , however , did the comments prescribe specific encoding schemes . In current DCMI practice , the prescription of encoding schemes ( i.e. , of " controlled vocabularies " - see Section 3.3 ) is seen as being more properly the role of an application profile , not of a term declaration . The Usage Board therefore amended the comment to reflect this , retaining a reference to one controlled vocabulary as an example . -- In definition , replaces " content of the resource " with " resource " see Section 3.1 -- In comment , replaces " use a value from an encoding scheme " with " use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In definition , replaces " a reference to a resource " with " resource " see Section 3.2 -- In comment , replaces " a string or number conforming to a formal identification system " with " a string conforming to a formal identification system " see Section 3.5 4.14 . Coverage The scope and purpose of Coverage has been a topic of much discussion and interpretation . The wordings proposed by the Usage Board address several issues : -- Use of the word " extent " in the definition . The use of " extent " in Coverage has caused confusion with respect to Format ( the comment of which refers to " dimensions " such as " size " and " duration " ) and to the term Extent -- a refinement of Format defined as " The size or duration of the resource " . The new definition replaces the ambiguous phrase " extent or scope of the content of the resource " with the phrase " spatial or temporal topic of the resource " . -- Reference in the comment to " jurisdiction " . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coverage at an early date as part of the comment and has informed a significant number of implementations . The Usage Board has made this meaning explicit by referring to " jurisdiction " in the definition itself . -- In definition , replaces " content of the resource " with " resource " see Section 3.1 -- In comment , replaces the phrase " select a value from a controlled vocabulary " with " use a controlled vocabulary " see Section 3.3 4.15 . Rights The definition remains unchanged as " Information about rights held in and over the resource " . However , several long-recognized problems have been corrected as follows : -- The label has been changed from " Rights Management " to " Rights " . The reference to " management " had more to do with possible uses of the element than with the substance of the element itself . This change also brings the label of the element ( " Rights " ) into line with its name ( " rights " ) . -- The comment previously referred both to a " statement " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides such a statement . The Usage Board sees this as an implementation issue not appropriately addressed in a usage comment . -- The qualification that " no assumptions may be made " if the element is absent was removed from the comment . The point is inappropriate because it implies that the element can only be used ( or not ) as part of a fixed element set . REFERENCES DC-GENERAL LONG ... DCAM LONG ...

@@100424325 @4624325/ <h> 0 Introduction <p> In this document , Qualified Dublin Core ( DC15 , DCQual ) is encoded in terms of RDF , the Resource Description Framework as defined by the RDF Model &amp; Syntax Specification RDFMS ( XML namespace for RDF RDFName ) , a W3C recommendation . The RDF Schema specification 1.0 RDFS is also used ( XML Namespace for RDFS RDFSName ) which is a W3C candidate recommendation . Quite often the notion of a URI ( Uniform Resource Identifier ) is used which is defined by RFC 2396 URI . The notion of URI embraces URL and URN . <p> We also discuss collaboration of qualified DC with other vocabularies and the DumbDown algorithm . An explicit encoding is provided for classical classification systems and thesauri . Additionally a procedure is discussed to create encoding for more general schemes . One of the major changes with respect to the Guidance on expressing the Dublin Core within the RDF ( DM ) is the more systematic use of RDF Schema. <h> 0.1 RDF(S) Basics <p> What is RDF <p> The basic layer of RDF can best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : They have a subject , a predicate and an object . A nice way to visualize the underlying structure is to draw nodes for subject and object and an arrow between them for the predicate . When another sentence is talking about the same subject for example , just glue the two pieces together at the subject node . Generally such geometric/semantic objects are called labeled directed graphs . The way RDF supports Gluing as basic feature is part of its potential . <p> Resources <p> A resource is formally defined in RDF as a node that can be given a URI , but one is not forced to expose that choice to the outside world . RDF treats different URIs as different resources . All resources without explicitly assigned URIs are assumed to be different by RDF . A resource can be anything that has identity . Familiar examples include an electronic document , an image , a service ( e.g. , " today 's weather report for Los Angeles " ) , and a collection of other resources . Not all resources are network " retrievable " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books in a library can also be considered resources . RFC 2396URI , 1.1 . <p> Literals <p> A literal is an object that is used only at the end of a sentence ( assertion ) . Like resources , RDF formally defines literals and any Unicode string or well formed XML can be used as a literal . If one declares an object as an XML literal , RDF will not attempt to interpret embedded markup . <p> Assertions(Statements) <p> Taken together the notion of resource and the notion of literal , resources can be used as the subjects of assertions , but there are no limitations on the statement object . <p> Properties(Predicates) <p> As the predicate in a sentence is supposed to carry meaning , which can be explained in more detail , RDF predicates are resources . The predicate might be viewed as a property of the subject resource , which has the object object as target . <h> 0.2 RDF(S) Specifics ( 1 ) <p> Repeated Elements <p> All DC Elements are repeatable . RDF allows to disambiguate the meaning of repetitions by four semantically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these constructions . ( Details will be given below ) . <p> " MetaMetaData " <p> One often runs into the problem to explain a certain package of MetaData which has been issued by some authority . RDF solves this problem without introducing vocabulary ( that would have to reinvented for each additional layer ) but with a construction which allows the creation of first class resources from assertions . For this process RDF uses the word Reification . <p> RDF Transport <p> RDF graphs can be sent on the web in XML form . As XML is essentially a tree , it does not encode RDF immediately . RDF M&amp;S provides an XML syntax for the RDF graphs , which use the XML syntax as a lower layer . This behavior enables RDF to work with and in other XML languages . This behavior is explored elsewhere . <p> More specific RDF issues will be described later in this document . <h> Basic Observation : DC Elements correspond to RDF properties . <h> 1 Unqualified DC : The hedgehog model <p> The following graph re-expresses unqualified DC in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny bit of extra information in the hedgehog model as opposed to HTML : all assertions made are about a fixed resource . ( Throughout this document resources are indicated by a circle . ) Content which is well-formed XML will be denoted with a square and addressed as literals . <p> The graph given by the hedgehog model is unsatisfactory in various respects . In particular there is no way to provide structure for a resource discovery process . <h> 2 Qualified DC <p> The DCMI has recognized two broad classes of qualifiers . We collect from the Qualifier Recommendation the information we need . <p> Element Refinement . These qualifiers make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific . A refined element shares the meaning of the unqualified element , but with a more restricted scope . A client that does not understand a specific element refinement term should be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an unqualified ( broader ) element . The definitions of element refinement terms for qualifiers must be publicly available . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interpretation of an element value . These schemes include controlled vocabularies and formal notations or parsing rules . A value expressed using an encoding scheme will thus be a token selected from a controlled vocabulary ( e.g. , a term from a classification system or set of subject headings ) or a string formatted in accordance with a formal notation ( e.g. , " 2000-01-01 " as the standard expression of a date ) . If an encoding scheme is not understood by a client or agent , the value may still be useful to a human reader . The definitive description of an encoding scheme for qualifiers must be clearly identified and available for public use . <h> 2.1 Element Refinement <p> The first issue for qualification is what DCMI calls Element refinement . RDFS provides a special property for this kind of semantic refinement : <h> 2.1.1 RDF(S) Specifics ( 2 ) <p> rdfs:subPropertyOf <p> The property rdfs:subPropertyOf is an instance of rdf:Property that is used to specify that one property is a specialization of another . A property may be a specialization of zero , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subPropertyOf another more general property P1 , and if a resource A has a P2 property with a value B , this implies that the resource A also has a P1 property with value B. <p> We declare in a machine-understandable way that the qualifier dcterms:abstract refines dc:descriptionand for the first time <p> We use another resource ( http : **38;1254;TOOLONG ) as the target of an assertion rather than just a literal in earlier examples . <h> 2.1.3 Remark <p> Other communities can also use rdfs:subPropertyOf to declare refinements of DCMI Elements in a transparent way . Note that rdfs:subPropertyOf statements can be repeated and nested . <p> The declaration of dcterms:abstract as rdfs:subPropertyOf of dc:description in the example above ensures that for every dcterms:abstract arc a corresponding dc:description arc ( with the same subject and object ) is implicitly contained in the RDF. <h> 2.1.4 <p> DC Model <p> An earlier version of the data model draft ( DM ) did not make use of RDFS and instead introduced an ad-hoc work around , which was cumbersome if one wanted to refine for instance the notion of dcterms:abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say about element refinement . The flexible notion of subProperty frees us from the HTML dot notation . It gives room for transparent encoding of partial orderings on refinements of given elements . <p> A draft for an RDF Schema Declaration for the element refinements specified in the DC Qualifiers recommendation is given in DCQS. <h> 2.1.5 Remark <p> There are relations between parts of RDF Vocabulary and DC Vocabulary which can be seen by reviewing the definitions . <h> 2.1.5.1 RDF(S) Specifics ( 3 ) <p> rdf:value <p> Identifies the principal value ( usually a string ) of a property . <p> rdfs:label <p> Provides a human-readable version of a resource name . The target of an rdfs:label arc must be a literal . <p> rdfs:isDefinedBy <p> Indicates a resource containing and defining the subject resource . The target of an rdfs:isDefinedBy arc must be a Resource . <p> rdfs:seeAlso <p> Indicates a resource that provides information about the subject resource . The target of an rdfs:seeAlso arc must be a Resource . <p> rdfs:Comment <p> This is used to provide a human-readable description of a resource . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Identifies the Class of a resource . The target of an rdf:type arc must be an instance of rdfs:Class. <h> 2.1.5.2 Dublin Core Properties <p> dc:title <p> A name given to the resource . <p> dc:relation <p> A reference to a related resource . <p> dc:description <p> An account of the content of the resource . <p> dc:type <p> The nature or genre of the content of the resource . <h> 2.1.5.3 <p> Note that rdf:value is not caught by an enveloping DC property . We will make active use of rdf:value in section 2.3 . Relations between the two vocabularies are made explicit in the DC Terms RDF Schema Draft in DCQS . These relations are also relevant for the DC DumbDown Algorithm defined below in section 3 . In the following table the relations are given in a form more convenient for human readers . <h> 2.1.5.4 <p> -- rdfs:subPropertyOf --&gt; <p> rdfs:label <p> dc:title <p> rdf:type <p> dc:type <p> rdfs:isDefinedBy <p> dc:relation <p> rdfs:seeAlso <p> dc:relation <p> rdfs:comment <p> dc:description <h> 2.1.5.5 <p> Note that the direction of the rdfs:subPropertyOf relation is due to some additional constraints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , although the definitions of rdfs:label and dc:title are basically equivalent , the requirement for rdfs:label to have a literal as target enforces the definition of rdfs:label as a subPropertyOf dc:title and not vice versa. <h> 2.2 Repeated Properties and " MetaMetaData " <p> All Dublin Core Elements are repeatable . Repeating element E has as basic meaning : <p> The objects which are values of the element E all are related to the subject under description by the relation element E. <p> In RDF , properties can be repeated : all the properties are asserted ( or logically ANDed ) . <p> Sometimes one wants to explicitly say something slightly different : the objects fulfill the relation E as a group , either in a particular order or in any order or as alternatives with respect to E. <p> RDF allows the marking of such relationships by creating new resources from the given objects in three different ways , called Bag , Seq and Alt construction . <h> 2.2.1 Repeating Properties - AND <p> AND <p> The entities AAAAA and BBBBB are both primarily responsible for the making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three constructions Bag , Seq and Alt are generally referred to as Containers in RDF . They relate groups of objects . Each Container is doing that in a very specific way . Their use has potential to structure information . <h> 2.2.2 Bag <p> Bag realizes semantically the notion of an unordered list . More specifically of a list , with ordering explicitly declared as irrelevant . This notion for instance matches the meaning of Co-authorship in Mathematics : In Math co-authors are given as a bag , whose objects are resources of type Person . This way if a Bag of Persons was used , it would avoid the introduction of new vocabulary to express the relationship . <p> Such a Bag may or may not have a public URI . The same applies to resources of type Person . In the example below the bag construction is used with otherwise unqualified Dublin Core . Even in this form the meaning differs from the previous AND Example . Jon Doe and Karin Mustermann together formed an entity , which as such represents a creator . The order in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . <p> Bag <p> Jon Doe and Karin Mustermann joint their forces to create a gadget with title Healthy Meat <h> 2.2.3 Seq <p> Some academic circles expect some meaning from the ordering of author names . This can be modeled with the Seq construction . Seq is a sequence , with the ordering explicitly declared as relevant . Both Seq and Bag require that all their contained objects are significant . <p> Below we describe a use of Seq . <p> Seq <p> Karin Mustermann and John Doe jointly contributed to a gadget . The anti-lexicographic order has been chosen deliberately . <p> Another typical application of Alt is as lists of synonyms for a chosen descriptor . As Alt gives a slight precedence to the first given value , this is exactly what happens with synonyms : They form an equivalence class with a chosen representative . <h> 2.2.5 Warning <p> The RDF Container Alt must not be confused with the refinement alternative of the DC Element title . <h> 2.2.6 Reification <p> One often wants to express some kind of authority on a given assertion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's awkward name and seemingly complicated representation as a graph , Reification is hardly more than providing a resource for an assertion , one can reference . A reification unambiguously identifies the assertion , it provides a resource for . To that objective explicitly subject , object and predicate of the assertion are given in the graph representation . <p> The general method of Reification avoids the introduction of particular vocabulary for MetaMetaData ' ' , but makes the Dublin Core Vocabulary available in that situation also . <p> Reification <p> The given abstract has been provided by the author John Doe of http : //www.potato.org . John Doe claims his work as a highly original introduction to potato theory . <h> 2.3 Encoding Schemes <p> One may view Bag , Seq and Alt as the first important examples of encoding schemes , which simply come for free with RDF . These structures in RDF can be repeated and nested and therefore are of great potential in encoding structured MetaData . <p> But there are simpler structures , which one may think about first . <p> Perhaps the simplest case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which come from using XML for RDF transport ) is that of a classic subject classification scheme . <p> Typically here we have a code - some obscure string - and a caption , which is ( supposed to be ) human understandable . <p> This sounds like providing a value/label pair . <p> In the case where there is a URI , specifying the object we want to use in it 's relation with the scheme , we could make an rdfs:isDefinedBy arc pointing to that URI . Such a triple of RDF(S) properties hanging off a resource is what one may call : <h> 2.3.2 Remark : value/label model <p> If there is some RDF Class given to identify the Scheme , we might know how to process the value and also how to take advantage of a partial order within the scheme itself . If the Class definition has a machine understandable form of how to process the value , one can dispense with the rdfs:isDefinedBy on the resource itself , but in general this is not very likely to happen . The Thesaurus - like case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please observe , that rdfs:label by definition must target literal content and can not be processed by RDF any further . <h> 2.3.3 Remark <p> Note that it is NOT required that rdf:value arcs target literals . Such requirement would restrict RDF 's potential for MetaData in an unreasonable way . <p> It can become necessary to repeat rdf:value arcs and rdfs:label arcs and also introduce new properties and nodes until following the arcs , one gets to strings ( or resources ) that can be processed . <h> 2.3.4 Iterated rdf:value and rdfs:label model <p> DC Model <p> The complete set of instructions collected on the way should suffice to correctly process the resulting value . <p> DCMI may recommend the use of properties additional to the core and additional to rdf:type , rdfs:isDefinedBy to aid processing for encoding of objects relevant to its focus . <p> It is recommended at most one rdf:value ( or subProperty thereof ) emanate from a resource in a qualified DC record . Declaring some property as subProperty of a DC property is a legitimate processing hint . There is no restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a qualified DC record . <h> 2.3.5 Remark <p> As long as it is possible to embed iterated poor man 's structured values in the sense of the DC Model section , a record can be viewed as qualified DC compliant and can expect a useful interpretation at least on the unqualified DC level . <h> 2.3.6 Remark <p> Some properties one might want to use may not be subordinated to any DC Element at all in their definition , but if in addition a DC Element or one of its refinements applies ( i.e. there is semantic overlap ) then RDF 's AND construction can be used and one should provide that DC arc additionally . This will be considered as a legitimate processing hint also . When using core elements in a poor man 's structured values ( section 2.3.4 ) carefully observe the notes 2.1.5.4-2.1.5.5 . If a scheme assigns it 's values in the form of URIs , a node with such a URI should be used instead of the anonymous node and value part of the poor man 's structured values . <h> 2.3.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context . One is tempted to construct Application Profiles from such micro structures which in themselves rest on primitive Data - Types . <p> Such a procedure is in particular advisable in the area where MetaData meets Data . This for instance happens in the notations for dates and locations . The work done on data typing in XML - Schema appears relevant . An integration of XML Schema data types with RDF in general is proposed in DAML+OIL . It fits with value/label model and is basically compliant with the cooperation of Dublin Core with other vocabularies as discussed in section 3 . <p> DCMI recommended Schemes for dates and locations will be dealt with in a separate document . <p> RDFMS gives the URI scheme a privileged role with respect to resources . There is no particular processing instruction required once a URI is given . We simply can call a resource by the rdf:resource construction . The usage of rdf:resource is defined in section 6 of RDFMS . A typical example is the following : <h> 3 DC in collaboration with other vocabularies and DumbDown <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocabularies and community defined schemes . The following more or less well known example shows how it works with vCard as suggested in VCARD . In view of the DumbDown algorithm which we will discuss in section 3.2 , one only has to give a useful rdfs:label to follow . This is particularly easy with vCard for it provides the full name of the person as a literal value . <h> 3.1.2 Math-Net <p> This is a more elaborate example that uses some vocabulary from Math-Net Schemes in addition to the vCard vocabulary . See section 3.2 how this metadata description is mapped to unqualified Dublin Core by the DumbDown algorithm . <h> 3.2 DumbDown Algorithm <p> The goal of a DumbDown algorithm is to provide a useful approximation of RDF graphs extending qualified DC with other vocabularies by a set of unqualified DC hedgehogs . The algorithm is described below and extends the version originally given in DC . <p> The algorithm gives preference to the linking of Dublin Core with other vocabulary by means of rdfs:label , rdf:value , ( dc:title ) and URI . <p> Particular emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Suppose we have a property X which has been recognized as a subProperty of a DC15 element Y or is itself a DC15 element and <p> R --- X ---&gt; N <p> is contained in the given RDF graph . ( In particular the subPropertyOf relations mentioned in section 2.1.5 are recognized . ) <p> The function dumbDownOf ( Y , N ) described below returns a set n1 , ... , nk of ' appropriate literals ' for this property . For each returned value ni an arc <p> R --- Y --&gt; ni <p> starts at the resource R in the result graph . <p> dumbDownOf ( dc:property , N ) : 1 . if the Node N is a literal we have unqualified Dublin Core . Return the literal . 2. else the Node N is a resource : 2.1 if dc:property is in dc:identifier , dc:source , dc:relation /* In this case the algorithm should preferably calculate a URI */ 2.1.1 if N is a Bag or Sequence : return the literal that is calculated by **26;1294;TOOLONG , N ) . 2.1.2 if N is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumbDownAlt ( dc:property , N ) . 2.1.3 if N is given a fully expanded URI return the string ( literal ) given by the URI. 2.1.4 if N has rdfs:label arcs : return the set of literals that are target of those arcs . 2.1.5 if N has rdf:value arcs : return the union of sets of literals calculated by dumbDown ( dc:property , V ) for every Node V that is target of an rdf:value arc . 2.1.6 else : return empty set . 2.2 else : 2.2.1 if N has rdfs:label arcs : return the set of literals that are target of those arcs . 2.2.2 if N has rdf:value arcs : return the union of sets of literals calculated by dumbDown ( dc:property , V ) for every Node V that is target of an rdf:value arc . 2.2.3 if N is a Bag or Sequence : return the literal that is calculated by **26;1322;TOOLONG , N ) . 2.2.4 if N is an Alt : return the literals that are calculated by dumbDownAlt ( dc:property , N ) . 2.2.5 if N has dc:title arcs:return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dc:property , V ) for every Node V that is target of a dc:title arc . 2.2.6 if N is given a fully expanded URI return the string ( literal ) given by the URI. 2.2.7 else : return empty set . Subroutines : **26;1350;TOOLONG , N ) : Let N1 , ... , Nn denote the elements of the container N. Join the strings ( literals ) calculated by dumbDownOf ( dc:property , Ni ) ( for all elements ) separated by " ; " . Return *the* constructed string . dumbDownAlt ( dc:property , N ) : Let N1 , ... , Nn denote the elements of the container N.

@@100424333 @4624333/ <h> Abstract <p> The importance of interoperability among computer systems has been progressively increasing over the last years . The tendency of current cataloguing systems is to interchange metadata in XML according to the specific standard required by each user on demand . According to the research literature , it seems that there exist two main approaches in order to tackle this problem : solutions that are based on the use of ontologies and solutions that are based on the creation of specific crosswalks for one-to-one mapping . This paper proposes a hierarchical one-to-one mapping solution for improving semantic interoperability. 
@@100424337 @4624337/ <h> Table of contents <h> 1 . Introduction <p> This document provides recommendations for expressing DC metadata using RDF , the Resource Description Framework . It does this by describing how the features of the DCMI Abstract Model ABSTRACT-MODEL are represented using the RDF model ( or abstract syntax ) , as defined by the RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax specification RDF-CONCEPTS . It does not rely on any specific RDF syntax encoding , though examples using the RDF/XML Syntax Specification RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR are provided in Appendix A. This allows Dublin Core metadata to be encoded using this specification in any RDF encoding syntax or other RDF representation system , such as RDF databases . <p> This Recommendation makes the following DCMI document obsolete ( while not contradicting it ) : <p> Expressing Simple Dublin Core in RDF/XML DCMES-XML , a DCMI Recommendation from July 2002 . <p> The document " Notes on DCMI specifications for Dublin Core metadata in RDF " DC-RDF-NOTES describes in more detail how this draft relates to the earlier specifications . <p> Many of the examples in this document make use of DCMI metadata terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DCMI terms DCMI-SCHEMAS. <h> 2 . Summary of the RDF conceptual model <p> The RDF conceptual model is specified in the RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax specification RDF-CONCEPTS . It is a relatively simple model , consisting of the following fundamentals : <p> An RDF graph is a set of RDF triples <p> An RDF triple has three components : <p> an RDF subject , which is an RDF URI reference or a blank RDF node <p> an RDF predicate , which is an RDF URI reference <p> an RDF object , which is an RDF URI reference , a blank RDF node or an RDF literal <p> An RDF literal can be of two kinds : <p> an RDF plain literal is a character string with an optional associated language tag describing the language of the character string <p> an RDF typed literal is a character string with an associated RDF datatype URI . An RDF datatype defines the syntax and semantics of a set of character strings that represent data such as booleans , integers , dates , etc . <p> These RDF triples are connected into RDF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RDF triple may be the RDF subject of another triple . <p> We will use diagrams to illustrate RDF graphs ( for namespace abbreviations , see Section 3 ) . A simple triple may look like in the following figure : <p> The structure of an RDF triple . In this figure , the RDF object is an RDF typed literal <p> While a graph consisting of three triples may look like the following : <p> An RDF graph consisting of three triples , connected via a blank RDF node . <h> 4 . Representing DCAM constructs using the RDF Model <p> This section describes how each of the constructs in the DCAM are represented in RDF . The RDF notions used here are defined in the RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax specification RDF-CONCEPTS and the RDF Vocabulary Description Language RDF-SCHEMA. <h> 4.1 Descriptions and resources <p> DCAM descriptions and resources are represented in the following way : <p> A DCAM description is represented using an RDF graph originating from a single RDF subject . <p> A DCAM described resource is represented by the RDF subject at the root of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ URI is available in the description , it should be used as the RDF URI reference of the RDF subject at the root of the RDF graph . Otherwise , the RDF subject should be a blank RDF node . Syntaxes may choose to use anonymous identifiers ( such as the rdf:nodeID construct ) to implement this . <h> 4.2 Statements , properties and values <p> A DCAM statement is represented using an RDF triple comprising : <p> an RDF subject that represents the DCAM resource <p> an RDF predicate that is the DCAM property URI <p> an RDF object that corresponds to the DCAM value surrogate . This RDF node will be referred to below as the value RDF node . <h> 4.3 Non-literal value surrogates <p> When the DCAM value surrogate is a non-literal value surrogate , the value RDF node is an RDF URI refence or a blank RDF node , with the characteristics given below . <p> The following diagram illustrates the main features of the RDF representation of non-literal value surrogates . <p> an RDF object that is an RDF Literal node ( either an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DCAM value string . <p> A DCAM value string language is represented using a language tag associated with a RDF plain literal occurring as the RDF object of this RDF triple . The language tag is constructed as defined by RFC-3066 , normalized to lowercase . <p> A DCAM syntax encoding scheme URI is represented using the RDF datatype URI associated with a RDF typed literal occurring as the RDF object of this RDF triple . <h> 4.7 Literal value surrogates <p> When the DCAM value surrogate is a literal value surrogate , the value RDF node is an RDF literal node , with exactly the same chararacteristics as in the case of DCAM value strings above . <p> The following diagrams illustrate the main features of the RDF representation of literal value surrogates . <p> The representation of the DCAM constructs in the case of a literal value surrogate with a Syntax Encoding Scheme URI . The notation " xsd:int " represents an RDF Datatype. <h> 4.8 Description sets <p> A DCAM description set is represented as an RDF graph that includes one or more DCAM descriptions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value can be further described in a separate DCAM description within the same DCAM description set . This is represented in RDF by letting the value RDF node be the root of an RDF graph representing any DCAM statements in the DCAM description of the value . Thus , the value RDF node will be the RDF subject of a set of triples representing the DCAM description of the value . <h> 5 . Some notes on semantics <h> 5.1 RDF semantics and the DCMI Abstract Model <p> The RDF expression of the DCMI Abstract Model has a special status among the DCMI encoding specifications . As the semantics of the notions DCMI Abstract Model is based on the semantics of the corresponding notions in RDF ( as defined by RDF-SEMANTICS ) , it is of fundamental importance that the RDF expression preserves any semantics of the DCAM . Also , any valid inferences that can be made using RDF semantics need to be valid when interpreted in terms of the DCMI Abstract Model . These requirements have not yet been formalized , but are thought to be reasonable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require defining a reverse mapping from RDF to the DCMI Abstract Model . <h> 5.2 Value Classes <p> The class or type of a value can be inferred in several ways : <p> Using the range of the corresponding property . For example , if the range of the property ex:owner is ex:Person , it can be inferred that all values of the ex:owner property are of type ex:Person . <p> Using an explicit rdf:type statement on the value . For example , if a resource has the property rdf:type with the value ex:Person , the value can be inferred to be of the type ex:Person . <p> Using knowledge from the application context . For example , an application might know that it only manages reources of type ex:Book , even though this is not part of the metadata itself . <p> It is recommended that RDF applications use explicit rdf:type triples , even if that means creating a separate DCAM description of the value . <p> The property dcterms:type has semantics very similar to rdf:type . At the time of writing , the precise relationship between those properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this specification primarily use and understand rdf:type in place of dcterms:type when expressing Dublin Core metadata in RDF , as most RDF processors come with built-in knowledge of rdf:type . <h> Acknowledgements <p> Thanks to Tom Baker , the members of the DC Usage Board and the members of the DC Architecture Working Group for their comments on previous versions of this document . <h> Appendix A : Examples <p> The following examples use the DC-TEXT syntax DC-TEXT for describing examples of Dublin Core metadata . The corresponding RDF graph is then presented , using the RDF/XML syntax RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR . Familiarity with the " striped " RDF/XML syntax is assumed . The W3C RDF Validator RDF-VALIDATOR service may be used to convert these RDF/XML samples to triples and graphs . <p> Description <p> DC-TEXT representation <p> RDF/XML representation <p> A description with a single statement , which uses a value URI to identify the value . <p> " The resource http : //example.org/123 has the subject identified by the URI http : **30;1378;TOOLONG . " <p> A description with a single statement , which uses two value strings , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vocabulary encoding scheme for the value and a value URI identifying the value . <p> " The resource http : //example.org/123 has the subject from the Vocabulary Encoding Scheme http : **30;1410;TOOLONG named ' Biology ' in English and ' Biologi ' in Swedish , which can be represented using the string " EA32 " according to the Syntax Encoding Scheme http : **38;1442;TOOLONG , and which is idenfified by the URI http : //example.org/subject32 " <p> A description with a single statement , which uses a single value string and a value URI , together with a description of the value . The description of the value has two statements , each of which only has a value URI . <p> " The resource http : //example.org/123 has the creator identified by http : //example.org/person45 , represented by the string " John Smith " .

Those metadata are , however , encoded in various different schemas and in different serialization formats , which makes it hard to automatically extract and interpret the metadata . The primary reason of the difficulty is the lack of interpretation rules of the metadata , e.g. , lack of definition of metadata vocabularies , lack of definition of encoding syntax and so forth . This paper proposes a model to support interpretation of embedded metadata without formal schema by linking a metadata instance to DCMI Description Set Profiles ( DSP ) .

Consideration is given to the peculiarities of legal language as a technical language closely related to the diverse legal systems . The paper describes a methodological approach planned for the Portal to provide a single point of access into disparate repositories where categories of law ( i.e. trade law , constitutional law , criminal law ) are the essential metadata to point to relevant material irrespective of the language used in a query . Categories of law of a specific legal system represent the way how retrieval can be satisfactorily achieved . Strategies and techniques for translating legal queries to different target languages , eventually disambiguating ambiguous words by a machine learning approach are illustrated . 
@@100424356 @4624356/ <h> Abstract <p> Controlled vocabularies enhance precision and recall but sometimes they achieve this at the expense of imposing a prescribed terminology and a homogeneous worldview upon a heterogeneous user community . Folksonomies allow end-users the freedom to describe content any way they want , but in doing so they create meta noise which diminishes precision and recall . This paper presents an alternative model called audience-centric taxonomy , which blends the best practices of top-down controlled vocabularies with the bottom-up approach of folksonomy . The result is a semantically rich and well structured vocabulary that can adapt how it presents itself to different end-user communities ensuring each audience sees the language and worldview that it prefers .

The changes are summarized in Section 2 and detailed , term by term , in Section 3 . This document should be considered in conjunction with a separate but related document , " Domains and Ranges for DCMI Properties " , which describes a set of classes and their use as domains and ranges of DCMI properties DOMAINS . <p> This document follows on an earlier revision of terms in the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set ( DCMES ) DCMES-CHANGES , which was undertaken in order to clarify intended semantics and bring the wording of definitions and usage comments into line with the language of the DCMI Abstract Model DCAM . <p> The changes described here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " DCMI Metadata Terms " DCTERMS and " DCMI Metadata Terms : A complete historical record " DCTERMS-HISTORY . <p> All of the changes described here have been evaluated by the DCMI Usage Board in light of the DCMI Namespace Policy NAMESPACE . The namespace policy says that DCMI terms are identified using Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URIs ) . In accordance with the principle that distinct URIs should be assigned to distinct resources , the policy sets limits on the range of editorial changes that may allowably be made to the official labels , definitions , and usage comments associated with DCMI terms . By policy , any changes of meaning judged " likely to have a substantial impact on either machine processing of DCMI terms or the functional semantics of the terms " must trigger the creation of a new , distinct term with a new , distinct URI . <p> In the opinion of the Usage Board , the changes described in this document are unlikely to have a substantial impact on either machine processing of DCMI terms or the functional semantics of the terms -- i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The changes constitute clarifications of term semantics in light of improved theoretical understanding , user feedback , and implementation experience . They are intended to provide the final twist of the lens that brings intended meanings more sharply into focus . <h> Free-standing descriptive labels <p> When terms such as dcterms:available were first coined as " Dublin Core qualifiers " in 2000 QUALIFIERS , it was not clear whether qualifiers were intended to be used like adjectives -- i.e. , in conjunction with the Dublin Core elements they modified -- or like nouns ( i.e. , as elements in their own right ) . The labels assigned at the time , such as " Available " , pointed to the former approach , but DCMI grammatical principles , and later the DCMI Abstract Model , ratified the latter approach . The terms dcterms:alternative , dcterms:available , dcterms:created , dcterms:issued , dcterms:modified , dcterms:valid , dcterms:spatial , and dcterms:temporal have been re-named with free-standing labels such as " Date Created " ( instead of just " Created " ) and " Alternative Title " instead of just " Alternative " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> As described in DCMES-CHANGES , wordings which distinguish the " content of " a resource have been revised to refer directly to a resource . In the current batch , this change is relevant to the definitions of : dcterms:abstract , dcterms:tableOfContents , dcterms:isFormatOf , dcterms:hasFormat , dcterms:spatial , dcterms:temporal , dcterms:DCMIType , and dcterms:requires . <h> The phrase " reference to a resource " <p> Definitions which specify encoding practice with phrases such as " reference to a resource " have been revised as described in DCMES-CHANGES . This change is relevant to the definition of dcterms:conformsTo . Note , however , that the definition of **29;1755;TOOLONG remains " A bibliographic reference for the resource " . <h> The phrase " use a controlled vocabulary " <p> It is now generally recommended that controlled vocabularies be used in metadata , so specific usage advice along these lines has been removed from the comments for dcterms:accrualMethod , **26;1786;TOOLONG , and dcterms:accrualPolicy . <h> Encoding scheme definitions <p> In accordance with the differentiation of encoding schemes into Vocabulary Encoding Schemes and Syntax Encoding Schemes , the Usage Board has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being seen and interpreted from a modeling point of view .

When RFC standards are updated , their numbers change , and the newer standard ( with a higher number ) obsoletes the older standard . In this batch of revisions , references to RFCs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Core Qualifiers " of July 2000 included encoding schemes for RFC 1766 ( tags for the identification of languages ) , ISO 639-2 ( codes for the representation of names of languages ) , and ISO 3166 ( codes for the representation of names of countries ) . An encoding scheme for RFC 3066 ( which obsoleted RFC 1766 ) was added in 2002 . Although the Usage Board currently prefers to encourage standardization communities to assign URIs to properties and encoding schemes on their own authority , the Board has taken a pragmatic stance towards identifying standards related to the RFCs and ISO standards identified with existing DCMI encoding schemes . This current batch therefore includes new syntax encoding schemes for RFC 4646 ( which obsoletes RFC 3066 ) and ISO 639-3 ( codes for the representation of names of languages ) . <h> Revisions in response to the five-year review for NISO Z39.85-2007 <p> A five-year review of ANSI/NISO Z39.85 ( The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set ) resulted in the revised standard ANSI/NISO Z39.85-2007 in May 2007 NISOZ39-85 .

In response to the comment that the Comment for dcterms:title was potentially misleading , the Usage Board decided to delete the comment altogether . <h> The statement " qualifies : " <p> When " Dublin Core qualifiers " were first published in 2000 QUALIFIERS , encoding schemes were associated with specific elements -- e.g. , dcterms:LCSH was considered to be a qualifier for dc:subject . In light of subsequent work on the DCMI model , however , the association between a property and a Vocabulary Encoding Scheme or Syntax Encoding Scheme is now seen as something more appropriately declared in an application profile than in the formal declaration of a vocabulary . " Qualifies : " statements have therefore been removed from the term descriptions for dcterms:DDC , dcterms:LCC , dcterms:UDC , dcterms:DCMIType , dcterms:IMT , dcterms:ISO639-2 , dcterms:RFC1766 , dcterms:URI , dcterms:Point , dcterms:ISO3166 , dcterms:Box , dcterms:TGN , dcterms:Period , dcterms:W3CDTF , dcterms:RFC3066 , dcterms:NLM , dcterms:LCSH , and dcterms:MESH . Methods for the formal expression of such an association in the RDF schemas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DCQ-RDF and have since been superseded by new guidelines for expressing Dublin Core metadata in RDF DC-RDF , as discussed in " Notes on DCMI specifications for Dublin Core metadata in RDF " DC-RDF-NOTES . <h> SubjectScheme and other " undeclared " members of the TERMS namespace <p> It is worth noting that since March 2000 , seven classes with URIs based on http : //purl.org/dc/terms/ ( the " TERMS " namespace ) have been used in RDF schemas published by DCMI . These classes were dcterms:DateScheme , dcterms:FormatScheme , dcterms:IdentifierScheme , dcterms:LanguageScheme , dcterms:SpatialScheme , dcterms:SubjectScheme , and dcterms:TypeScheme . These classes were added to the RDF expressions on the basis of " qualfies : " statements ( see above ) as part of an automatic routine for generating updated documentation for DCMI terms . At the time , the classes served to associate a set of encoding schemes with a particular property ( e.g. , to associate dcterms:LCSH with dc:subject ) . Since the terms were never officially declared ( outside of their undocumented use in the RDF schemas ) , DCMI does not consider them to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " qualifies : " statements and the revision of guidelines for expressing Dublin Core metadata in RDF ( see above ) , these undeclared classes will cease to be used in DCMI term declarations . <h> New terms related to the DCMI Abstract Model <p> As described in the revised DCMI Namespace Policy NAMESPACE , a DCMI namespace has been created as the base URI for terms used in the DCMI Abstract Model ( http : //purl.org/dc/dcam/ , here dcam : ) . Two new dcam : terms -- dcam:memberOf and **29;1843;TOOLONG -- have been created with the finalization of the revised DCMI Abstract Model as a DCMI Recommendation in June 2007 DCAM . <h> The Vocabulary Encoding Scheme " DCMI Type Vocabulary " and its member terms <p> As of January 2008 , member terms of the DCMI Type Vocabulary , such as dcmitype:Collection , are classes ( rdfs:Class ) , and these classes are " members of " the DCMI Type Vocabulary , a Vocabulary Encoding Scheme . <p> The relationship between the DCMI Type Vocabulary and its member terms has evolved over the past seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formalized in the current DCMI Abstract Model . The set of Dublin Core Qualifiers published in July 2000 included twenty Encoding Schemes -- a type of term defined in terms of its use to " identify schemes that aid in the interpretation of an element value " . The RDF schemas at the time went further , declaring all encoding schemes as classes ( rdfs:Class ) . <p> The terms of the DCMI Type Vocabulary ( such as http : **33;1874;TOOLONG ) were first published in 2000 as a " list of approved terms that may be used as values for the Resource Type element " . In 2003 the terms were listed as " Vocabulary Terms " -- a " type of term " defined in the legacy specification " DCMI Grammatical Principles " as indicating " that the value is a term from a controlled vocabulary , such as the value ' China - History ' from the Library of Congress Subject Headings " PRINCIPLES . The RDF schema representation declared the member terms of the Type Vocabulary as " classes " ( rdfs:Class ) and declared these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vocabulary " ( rdf:type dcterms:DCMIType ) . <p> Since 2007 , the DCMI Abstract Model applies the principle that a resource of any type may be a member of a Vocabulary Encoding Scheme . The Abstract Model introduces the property " Member Of " ( dcam:memberOf ) to express the relationship between a resource and a Vocabulary Encoding Scheme ( **29;1909;TOOLONG ) , now defined as " An enumerated set of resources " . ( The DCMI Type Vocabulary may therefore be described as an enumerated set of classes . ) <p> In the RDF schemas of January 2008 , assertions that member terms of the DCMI Type Vocabulary are " instances of " an Encoding Scheme ( interpreted as rdfs:Class ) have been replaced by assertions that the terms are " members of " a Vocabulary Encoding Scheme ( **29;1940;TOOLONG ) . <h> Addition of domains and ranges for existing properties and creation of new properties <p> A separate document , " Domains and ranges for DCMI properties " DOMAINS , proposes a vocabulary of classes for use as formal domains and ranges of DCMI properties . Domains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what kind of described resources and value resources are associated with a given property . The assignment of formal domains and ranges makes the meanings implicit in natural-language definitions available for machine processing . <p> So as not to affect the conformance of existing implementations of Simple Dublin Core in RDF , domains and ranges have not been specified for the fifteen properties of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set ( DCMES ) , Version 1.1 , which are identified by URIs in the DCMI namespace http : **27;1971;TOOLONG . Rather , fifteen new properties with " names " identical to those of DCMES Version 1.1 have been created in the DCMI namespace http : //purl.org/dc/terms/ . These fifteen new properties have been declared to be subproperties of the corresponding properties in DCMES Version 1.1 and assigned domains and ranges as outlined in this document . <h> Subproperty relations between terms in " the Dublin Core " <p> In the early years of " the Dublin Core " , it was noticed that some of the fifteen elements could be seen as fitting semantically within the scope of others ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " relation " ) . Because " elements " were seen as typologically distinct from " qualifiers " , however , it was problematic to express such semantic relations formally . As the DCMI Abstract Model no longer makes such a typological distinction , the current batch of revisions includes formal assertions that dcterms:creator is a subproperty of dcterms:contributor and that dcterms:source is a subproperty of dcterms:relation . As with the assignment of domains and ranges , these assertions are made only for properties newly created in the namespace http : //purl.org/dc/terms/ . So as not to affect the conformance of existing implementations , no such assertions are made for the existing properties of DCMES Version 1.1 . <h> Comments deleted <p> In addition to the Comment for dcterms:title , various other Comments were found to be no longer useful and simply deleted ( dcterms:audience , dcterms:license dcterms:rightsHolder , dcterms:accrualMethod , **26;2000;TOOLONG , dcterms:accrualPolicy ) . <h> Special cases <p> Editorial revision has sometimes involved deciding among different possible interpretations of terms ( e.g. , dcterms:educationLevel ) and making minor clarifications of wording too subtle to merit separate explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new versions side-by-side so that readers may judge the differences for themselves . <p> Spatial topic may be a named place or a location specified by its geographic coordinates .

@@100424358 @4624358/ <h> Abstract <p> Analysis patterns are reusable computational artifacts aimed at the analysis stage of the software development process . Although the analysis patterns can facilitate the work of analysts and developers , the access to them is still very poor because of the way they are usually described and made available . The Analysis Patterns Reuse Infrastructure ( APRI ) was proposed in order to reduce these deficiencies for supporting , cataloging and encouraging the reuse of analysis patterns . This infrastructure comprises a repository of analysis patterns documented through a specific metadata profile and that can be accessed via Web services . Based on the proposal of APRI , this article presents the specific metadata profile to the documentation of analysis patterns called Dublin Core Application Profile for Analysis Patterns ( DC2AP ) . This application profile is described by RDF files and identified via URI , thus providing Linked Data that increase the potential for reuse of the analysis patterns . 
@@100424360 @4624360/ <h> Metadata Semantics Shared Across Languages : Dublin Cores in languages other than English <p> The Dublin Core is a set of fifteen basic categories ( such as creator , title , subject , and publisher ) for describing information resources ( see http : **30;2065;TOOLONG ) . When embedded in documents on the World-Wide Web , these Core descriptions can be extracted by global indexing services for use like a sort of library catalog . Some first adopters of the Dublin Core appreciate the generic simplicity of these fifteen basic categories and use them " as is " -- let 's call them the " minimalists " . Others -- let 's call them the " specialists " -- use qualifiers to narrow the semantics of Core categories for specialized uses -- for example , to specify that a particular " creator " is a " composer " as opposed to an " author " or " photographer " . The success of the Dublin Core as a standard will depend on its ability to satisfy the specialists ' need for this kind of specificity without compromising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimalists . <p> Until now , the Dublin Core has been defined and implemented only in English . Yet the meanings of these fifteen basic categories in their " minimalist " sense could just as well be explained in French , German , Japanese , or Thai . The Dublin Core could become that which has long eluded internationalist-minded librarians : a simple description model consistent across many languages and scientific disciplines . <p> But if the Dublin Core is to meet the need of specialists across many languages , it will also have to allow users in those languages to define their own qualifiers . And since the Dublin Core has so far been used only in English and on the World-Wide Web , where indexing tags must use only the English alphabet , its designers have not yet had to cope with multiple sets of tags and qualifiers in multiple languages and alphabets . ( Note that the language of the Dublin Core itself is independent of the language of documents being described ; records created with the Thai Dublin Core could refer to articles in Japanese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourth Dublin Core Workshop in Canberra , Australia , 3-5 March 1997 ( http : //www.dstc.edu.au/DC4/ ) . This paper reports some conclusions reached there and the consensus of a break-out group on how we might move towards a manageable multiplicity of Dublin Cores in languages other than English . <p> For the purposes of indexing and searching , equivalencies between parallel Dublin Cores in multiple languages could be assured by an agreed set of fifteen machine-readable indexing tags -- let 's call them , more generically , tokens -- standing for the fifteen Core categories . These tokens , embedded with HTML in documents ( or wherever else metadata may be placed ) , would flag the Core elements for automatic Web indexers . For better or for worse , the tokens currently used for this are English words and will most likely remain so for now , just as HTML tags for Web documents and the function words of most computer programming languages are English-like . <p> But the problem is more complex when we consider qualifiers . Qualifiers guarantee interoperability of more precise semantics to the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would guarantee interoperability across languages to the extent that they were shared between Dublin Cores in different languages . A few qualifiers , such as " author " , will be useful all over the world and will likely have universal tokens . One could therefore search for an author regardless of whether the search form labelled it " author " or " putang " ( " author " in Thai ) . <p> But as the Web increasingly becomes used for local and regional purposes , it seems likely that qualifiers will proliferate for which one will not need the global interoperability afforded by such widely shared concepts . As the Dublin Core is adopted more widely , Web-based registries will evolve to document these qualifiers , both local and universal , along with their tokens and definitions . One can picture a Thai registry for Dublin Core that listed fifty or so qualifiers shared with other Dublin Cores alongside qualifiers specific to the Thai language and Thai cataloging practice . <p> For a Dublin Core in Thai , one would ideally like to have a framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set of local tokens expressed in the Thai language and alphabet , and a set of matching universal tokens for those qualifiers that were shared with other Dublin Cores . Local tokens with no universal equivalents , while useful locally , would simply be ignored by the global crawler services . Records created in Thailand , using local qualifiers , and indexed by a global crawler service that ignored those qualifiers , could still be retrieved in France via a " minimalist " search over the fifteen Core categories . <p> For several reasons , this ideal can not readily be realised with today 's Web technology . The current HTML format for metadata ( the META tag ) does not provide any standard way to distinguish between global and local tokens . And within HTML , machine-readable tokens -- whether universal or local -- must be expressed in 7-bit ASCII ( the English alphabet from A to Z , plus numbers ) . <p> Just how serious these obstacles are for deploying Dublin Core in languages other than English depends in part on how metadata will be created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metadata will be typed in largely by hand -- and the most popular program for creating Web pages today is Microsoft 's Notepad , a simple text editor -- then the limitation of ASCII will be a real problem . However , it is much more likely that users will type their descriptions into pop-up forms , perhaps with help menus and validation procedures . Software will take care of formatting the metadata properly and with the appropriate tokens . In such controlled environments , one might get around the limitations of ASCII by using transliteration : a user would type a qualifier in Thai letters and software would perform the necessary conversion into ASCII . Of course , the raw results might no longer be entirely comprehensible or editable by native speakers with plain text editors , so one could object to this workaround on grounds of principle . <p> Fortunately , it seems likely that these limitations of ASCII and HTML will be transcended by new technologies over the next year or two . The character-set limitation on tag names will fade as 7-bit ASCII is replaced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters of the world 's most common scripts . And the limitations on metadata tagging will be transcended by two new Web formats : PICS-NG and Web Collections . PICS was originally designed to support systems for rating Internet content ( for example , to allow users to block access to pornography ) , though it is evolving into a general system in which labels and local tokens in many languages can be mapped onto generic metadata structures ( see http : **26;2097;TOOLONG ) . Web Collections is a recent initiative for designing a general way to define sets of metadata ( see LONG ... <p> Both PICS-NG and Web Collections will implement the basic elements needed for multiple Dublin Cores : global tokens , local tokens , and local descriptions . Moreover , both of these metadata frameworks are being developed by heterogenous communities of experts in resource description , annotations , digital signatures , digital cash , and resource description , and they have the support of the biggest software companies . Indeed , these initiatives are shaping the next big version of HTML itself . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the World-Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) in June of 1997 , after which it will hopefully take but a few months to a year for stable browsers , servers , and tools to come to market . To the participants in the Canberra workshop interested in creating Dublin Cores in languages other than English , it seemed wiser to anticipate these new solutions than to invest much energy in extending today 's HTML . <p> While waiting for this deployment , communities can work on translating the Dublin Core into various languages . These translations will need to be discussed and reworked until they really make sense to native speakers . The resulting descriptions will need to reflect as precisely as possible the intent and semantic scope of the fifteen basic Core elements . Beyond that , local needs will determine the choice of qualifiers and their correspondence or non-correspondence to qualifiers in the English-language model . <p> As a simple first step , it seems desirable to make the descriptions of Dublin Cores in languages other than English available on Web pages , perhaps with lists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These Web sites could be linked among themselves ; indeed , the Thai description of , say , the Subject element might usefully be linked to the descriptions of that element in English and German . Help pages might describe the advantages of using universal qualifiers . Perhaps these interlinked Web servers could provide a platform for future , more advanced registry services , such as automated lookups of element values across languages , which could assist retrieval in ways we can not yet clearly imagine . In such an infrastructure of peer servers , no one model would dominate ( in a logical sense ) , as the English-language Dublin Core does now . <p> Researchers from several countries have indicated interest in establishing Dublin Cores , and projects are already underway in Berlin , at the Humboldt University in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute , and in Bangkok , at the Technical Information Access Center of the National Science and Technology Development Agency . A mailing list has been established to discuss Dublin Cores in multiple languages , and further workshops are foreseen . For further info , please contact Tom Baker at **25;2125;TOOLONG

Characterization activities using remotely acquired data are currently made complicated by different limitations relating to , as an example , the meaningful mapping between multi-sensor data or the adding of the geospatial context to satellite information . We argue that describing satellite images through a metadata application profile may leverage capabilities to promote easy-to-use data for further in-depth thematic analysis .

More specifically , we discuss RDF-compliant machine-processable aspects of the EO application profile ( EOAP ) in terms of the DCMI Description Set Profile(DSP) model .

@@100424378 @4624378/ <p> This document provides guidelines for the creation of Dublin Core Application Profiles . The document explains the key components of a Dublin Core Application Profile and walks through the process of developing a profile . The document is aimed at designers of application profilespeople who will bring together metadata terms for use in a specific context . It does not address the creation of machine-readable implementations of an application profile nor the design of metadata applications in an broader sense . For additional technical detail the reader is pointed to further sources . <p> When it comes to metadata , one size does not fit all . In fact , one size often does not even fit many . The metadata needs of particular communities and applications are very diverse . The result is a great proliferation of metadata formats , even across applications that have metadata needs in common . The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative has addressed this by providing a framework for designing a Dublin Core Application Profile ( DCAP ) . A DCAP defines metadata records which meet specific application needs while providing semantic interoperability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and models . <p> Note that a DCAP is a generic construct for designing metadata records that does not require the use of metadata terms defined by DCMI DCMI-MT . A DCAP can use any terms that are defined on the basis of RDF , combining terms from multiple namespaces as needed . A DCAP follows the DCMI Abstract Model DCAM , a generic model for metadata records . <p> A DCAP includes guidance for metadata creators and clear specifications for metadata developers . By articulating what is intended and can be expected from data , application profiles promote the sharing and linking of data within and between communities . The resulting metadata will integrate with a semantic web of linked data LINKED . To achieve this it is recommended that application profiles be developed by a team with specialized knowledge of the resources that need to be described , the metadata to be used in the description of those resources , as well as an understanding of the Semantic Web and the linked data environment . <p> The interoperability of DCAP-based metadata in linked data environments derives from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or set of documents ) that specifies and describes the metadata used in a particular application . To accomplish this , a profile : <p> describes what a community wants to accomplish with its application ( Functional Requirements ) ; <p> characterizes the types of things described by the metadata and their relationships ( Domain Model ) ; <p> enumerates the metadata terms to be used and the rules for their use ( Description Set Profile and Usage Guidelines ) ; and <p> defines the machine syntax that will be used to encode the data ( Syntax Guidelines and Data Formats ) . <h> Singapore Framework <p> How these standards fit together is illustrated in the Singapore Framework for Dublin Core Application Profiles DCMI-SF . The bottom tier , RDF , provides the foundation standards on which domain standards are built . The middle tier defines domain standards that provide structural and semantic stability for Application Profiles . The upper tier holds the design and documentation components of specific metadata applications . <p> Taking the upper tier of the Singapore Framework as a roadmap , the sections that follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrate the process we create a simple application profile that describes books and authors . We call this example MyBookCase . <p> The purpose of any metadata is to support an activity . Defining clear goals for the application used in that activity is an essential first step . <p> Functional requirements guide the development of the application profile by providing goals and boundaries and are an essential component of a successful application profile development process . This development is often a broad community task and may involve managers of services , experts in the materials being used , application developers , and potential end-users of the services . <p> There are methodologies to help in the creation of functional requirements , such as business process modeling , and methods for visualizing requirements , such as the Unified Modeling Language UML . Some find that the definition of use cases and scenarios for a particular application helps elicit functional requirements that might otherwise be overlooked . <p> Functional requirements answer questions such as : <p> What do you want to accomplish with your application ? <p> What are the limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? <p> What are the key characteristics of your resources , and how does this affect your selection of data elements ? For example , do you need to handle a variety of character sets ? <p> What are the key characteristics of your users ? Are they associated with a particular institution or are you serving a general public ? Do they all speak the same language ? How expert are they in relation to the data your application will manage ? How expert are they about the type of resources described ? <p> Are there existing community standards that need to be considered ? <p> Functional requirements can include general goals as well as specific tasks that you need to address . Ideally , functional requirements should address the needs of metadata creators , resource users , and application developers so that the resulting application fully supports the needs of the community . <p> These are some sample requirements from the Scholarly Works Application Profile ( SWAP ) SWAP : <p> Facilitate identification of open access materials . Enable identification of the research funder and project code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks that must be supported such as the following from the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records ( FRBR ) FRBR : <p> Use the data to find materials that correspond to the user 's stated search criteria . Use the data retrieved to identify an entity . <p> For the MyBookCase DCAP our functional requirements are : <p> Use the data to retrieve books with a title search . Limit a search to a particular language . Sort retrieved items by publication date . Find items about a given subject . Provide the author'sname and email address for contact purposes . <p> After defining functional requirements , the next step is to select or develop a domain model . A domain model is a description of what things your metadata will describe , and the relationships between those things . The domain model is the basic blueprint for the construction of the application profile . <p> The domain model for MyBookCase has two things : Books and Persons ( the authors of the books ) . We will see below how to describe the book using elements such as title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and email address . The domain model for our MyBookCase is simply : <p> Models can be even simpler than this ( e.g. , just Book ) or they can be more complex . The domain model for the Scholarly Works Dublin Core Application Profile , for example , is based on the library community 's domain model : Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records ( FRBR ) FRBR . SWAP defines Scholarly Work in place of FRBR 's more general entity Work and introduces new agent relationships beyond those in FRBR , such as isFundedBy and isSupervisedBy . In this way , SWAP makes use of FRBR but customizes the FRBR model to meet its specific needs : <p> After we have defined the domain model for our metadata , we need to choose properties for describing the things in that model . For example , a Book can have a title and author . The author will be a Person with a name and an email address <p> The next step , then , is to scan available RDF vocabularies to see whether the properties needed have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties , when appropriate , requires less effort and increases the interoperability of your metadata . If the properties one needs are not already available , it is possible to declare one 's own , as described in Appendix C. <p> For the purposes of our simple example , the DCMI Metadata Terms DCMI-MT is a source of properties for basic resource description . A more extensive set of properties , directly related to FRBR , is under development for the Resource Description and Access ( RDA ) standard RDAELEMENTSRDAROLES . The " Friend of a Friend " vocabulary has useful properties for describing people FOAF . <p> The most obvious consideration in evaluating terms from existing vocabularies is their definition . The Dublin Core property " title " , for example , is defined as " a name given to the resource " . If the definition fits your needs , this property is a candidate for use in your profile . However , the suitability of a property for use in a particular application also depends on the type of values the property can have . The types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value types of the existing properties you wish to use . <p> You may find it useful to ask the following questions about the values you intend to use with each of the properties needed in the profile . Note that for any given property , there may be more than one " yes " answer . <p> Do you want to use free text for the value of the property ? <p> Will the free text need to follow a pre-defined format such as the W3C format for dates ( " YYYY-MM-DD " ) ? <p> Will you want to select valid values from a controlled list ? <p> If so , is that list already available somewhere , or will you need to create it ? <p> Do you want to limit the valid values to a selection from a list , or can unlisted values be used ? <p> Have the values in the list been assigned identifiers ( in the form of URIs ) ? Or do you anticipate that URIs could be available for them at a future date ? <p> Will single value strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams " ) or is there potentially a need for more complex descriptive structures with multiple components , as when an author is described with a name , email address , and affiliation ? <p> Looking again at our MyBookCase , this is how we might answer the questions about the properties for book : <p> The title will be transcribed from the book itself . It will be a free text string . <p> We want to use the date property in various ways in our software application , such as sorting a set of retrieved bibliographic records , so we want to be sure that dates are presented in a uniform way as a structured string . <p> We want to indicate the language of the book so that users can limit their searches by language . To make sure that languages are always input in the same way , we want to use a controlled list of languages . <p> We want to record the subject from a controlled list . At least one possible controlled list , the Library of Congress Subject Headings , is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We know that our author is not a single text string but will be described with several pieces of information , such as name and email address . <p> The metadata development process will use these decisions to create the technical model of the data elements as described in Appendix C. This analysis results in the following data model , which is consistent with RDF and the DCMI Abstract Model : <p> title <p> For title we can use the Dublin Core property dcterms:title , which can take a free text string ( a " literal " ) . <p> date <p> Because we want to perform automated operations like sorting on the date , we can select the Dublin Core property dcterms:date . This property can take a string value . We can indicate that the value string is formatted in accordance with the W3C Date and Time Formats specification by using syntax encoding scheme dcterms:W3CDTF . <p> language <p> The language needs to be selected from a controlled list . We achieve this by requiring the use of three-letter codes listed in the international standard ISO 639-3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " eng " for " English " ) together with the syntax encoding scheme dcterms:ISO639-3 as a datatype . For this , we can use the DCMI property dcterms:language , which can accommodate either an identifier for the language term or a string . <p> subject <p> We want to record the subject using a controlled list . Rather than create our own , it is less work to make use of a list that already exists , and this also increases the potential for interoperability for our data . We decide that the Library of Congress Subject Headings ( LCSH ) meet our needs . Because the terms in LCSH are available as a formal vocabulary using the RDF vocabulary Simple Knowledge Organization System SKOS , we have the option to indicate each subject by using the URI that identifies it . For example , the Library of Congress subject heading " Islam and Science " has been assigned the URI http : **35;2232;TOOLONG . The DCMI property dcterms:subject can support the use of plain strings or a URI . <p> author <p> Because our author needs to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address , the author property will need to have a non-literal range so that a separate but linked description can be created in the metadata record . The Dublin Core property dcterms:creator can be used with a non-literal value , so we will use this in MyBookCase . <p> The selection of properties for describing the author as a person follows the same model : <p> The person has a name , but we want to record the forename and family name separately rather than as a single string . DCMI Metadata Terms has no such properties , so we will take the properties foaf:firstName and foaf:familyname from the Friend of a Friend vocabulary FOAF . <p> In order to record an email address as contact information for the person , we will use the property foaf:mbox , which has a non-literal range , and use mailto : URIs as values . <p> These decisions are summarized in the table below , which reflects the technical analysis of the properties that is described in Appendix C. The column header terms are defined in the Dublin Core Abstract model DCAM . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Value URI <p> VES URI <p> Related description <p> dcterms:title <p> literal <p> YES <p> no <p> not applicable 1 <p> not applicable <p> not applicable <p> dcterms:created <p> literal <p> YES <p> YES 2 <p> not applicable <p> not applicable <p> not applicable <p> dcterms:language <p> non-literal <p> YES <p> YES 3 <p> no <p> no <p> no <p> dcterms:subject <p> non-literal <p> YES <p> no <p> YES <p> YES 4 <p> no <p> dcterms:creator <p> non-literal <p> YES <p> no <p> no <p> no <p> YES <p> foaf:firstName <p> literal <p> YES <p> no <p> not applicable <p> not applicable <p> not applicable <p> foaf:familyname <p> literal <p> YES <p> no <p> not applicable <p> not applicable <p> not applicable <p> foaf:mbox <p> non-literal <p> no <p> no <p> YES 5 <p> no <p> no <p> 1 These values are not applicable for values with a " literal " range . 2 http : **26;2269;TOOLONG 3 http : **28;2297;TOOLONG 4 http : //purl.org/dc/terms/LCSH 5 Email addresses can be given using mailto : URIs . <p> The next step is to describe the metadata record in detail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Description Set Model ( itself part of the DCMI Abstract Model DCAM ( see Appendix A ) , and the record 's design is detailed in a Description Set Profile ( or DSP ) using a DSP constraint language DSP . For each Description and Statement in a record , the DSP defines a template , and each template holds relevant constraints specifying technical details such as the repeatability of elements or restrictions on allowable values . This section presents a simple Description Set Profile for MyBookCase . <p> A DSP contains one Description Template for each thing in the domain model , which in turn contain statement templates for all of the properties that describe the thing . These templates also define any rules that constrain the use of the description or the properties , such as value types or requirements and repeatability . <p> The DSP for MyBookCase will have two Description Templates : one for Book and one for Person . Each Description Template has a Statement Template for each of the properties used to describe the Book or Person . A statement template names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , value strings , vocabulary encoding schemes , etc. that apply to a single kind of statement . <p> If we decide that each metadata record is to represent exactly one book , then a book Description Template will occur once and only once in each Description Set : <p> Some of the above properties have a minimum occurrence of 0 ( zero ) . This is a way of saying that these properties are optional in our record and that a record is valid even if these properties are not present . Some of the properties are repeatable , such as language , which can occur as many as three times , and author , which can occur as many as five times . We 've defined the author as having the value of Person , which is described in its own Description Template : <p> A given Person can have one optional given name and one optional family name , each of which are literal strings . A Person can also have an email address which must be represented by a URI with the prefix mailto : . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we allow this statement to repeat as often as necessary . <p> We allow our Person description template to be used any number of times in the metadata record . This may seem to conflict with the fact that Person can only be used to represent an author up to five times in the Book description , but we anticipate other possible uses for Person in our record , such as subjects of a book , so we have chosen not to limit its number in the record in general . <p> Note that each Person description contains data elements for only one person . This also means that an author statement will have only one Person value . If there are two authors , then two author statements will be needed in the metadata record , each representing one person . One might allow a single person to have more than one name , such as real names and pseudonyms ; however , the metadata would clearly distinguish the case of multiple authors ( multiple Description Templates ) from that of a single author with multiple names ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include an affiliated institution for the author , you may want to create an institution Description Template that contains the name and location of that institution , which will then link to the author Description Template . You may also have other uses for corporate names and locations such as for recording information about the publisher of the book . <p> This completes the simple Description Set Profile for MyBookCase ; see Appendix B for a version of this DSP encoded in XML . <p> A Description Set Profile defines the " what " of the application profile ; usage guidelines provide the " how " and " why " . Usage guidelines offer instructions to those who will create the metadata records . Ideally , they explain each property and anticipate the decisions that must be made in the course of creating a metadata record . Documentation for metadata creators presents some of the same information that is included in the DSP , but in a more human-understandable form . Those inputting metadata will need to know : is this property required ? is it repeatable ? am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property ? Oftentimes a user interface can answer these questions , for example by presenting the metadata creator with a list of valid values from which to choose . <p> Some examples of the kinds of rules that might appear in usage guidelines are : <p> For works of multiple authorship , the order of authors and how many to include ( e.g. " the first three " , or " no more than twenty " ) <p> How to interpret the prescribed vocabulary of document types <p> The minimum required elements for a " minimal " record <p> Character sets , punctuation , and abbreviations to be used in strings <p> In some cases where usage guidelines are relatively simple , they may be included in the DSP document with the description of the property . The Scholarly Works Application Profile is an example where guidance instructions are included alongside the the Description Set Profile definition . <p> Other communities may have highly complex rules which , due to their length and complexity , are best presented as separate documents . For example , the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book AACR2 . Instructions relating to titles appear in many of its chapters , cover many pages of text . Guidelines of this length may best be presented separately from the DSP . <p> The technologies described in this document are syntax neutral ; that is , they do not require any particular machine-readable encoding syntax as long as the syntax employed can fully express the values and relationships defined in the DCAP . <p> To help developers turn their application profiles into functioning software applications , DCMI has developed various encoding guidelines DCMI-ENCODINGS . Description Set Profiles can be deployed using any concrete implementation syntax for which a mapping to the abstract model has been specified . DCMI has developed or is developing guidelines for encoding DCAM-based metadata in HTML/XHTML , XML , and RDF/XML ; others could be added in the future . There is no restriction on use of other types of syntax as long as the resulting data format is compatible with the foundation standards and with the DCMI Abstract Model . <p> Every application profile design team should include members who understand basic principles for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides a brief overview of the modeling choices involved in the selection and use of RDF properties in application profiles . The section concludes by relating the technical design choices to the property-by-property requirements with regard to : <p> Whether free text will be used , <p> Whether the free text will ever need follow a pre-defined format , <p> Whether valid values should be selected from a controlled list , and <p> Whether single strings will suffice or more complex values are needed . <h> The basics of RDF properties <p> RDF properties are designed to be referenced and processed in a consistent way independently of the contexts in which they appear . The Dublin Core element title , for example , can be used in one context for describing books and in another for describing statues . When used correctly and in accordance with the RDF " grammar " for data , such globally defined vocabularies provide a basis for integrating resource descriptions from a variety of sources into coherent data aggregations . <p> In order to be usable in RDF-based metadata , properties must be identified with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element title , for example , is identified with the URI http : **25;2327;TOOLONG ( abbreviated here as dcterms:title ) . Good practice dictates that these URIs be declared and documented somewhere as " RDF properties " . This declaration may be made in prose but typically is also made in a machine-readable RDF schema and ideally by the owner of the Internet domain or sub-domain used for the URIs . The URI for dcterms:title , for example , resolves ( by redirection ) to an RDF schema http : **39;2354;TOOLONG at the time of writingwhich says in a machine-understandable way that dcterms:title is an RDF property . The subdomain http : //purl.org/dc/ is " owned " ( in the sense of " controlled " ) by the organization Dublin Core Metadata Initiative . <p> In designing a metadata application , it is for many reasons desirable to use RDF properties that have already been declared somewhere . At a minimum , this is easier than doing the extra work involved in declaring one 's own RDF properties . More importantly , the use of known properties provides a basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that individuals who create vocabularies may change jobs and move on ; research projects finish their work and eventually their servers disappear ; and ownership of domain names may lapse , so that URIs which resolve today to an RDF schema might ten years from now resolve to shoe advertisements . It is best to use properties backed by organizations that have made a commitment to their maintenance . <h> RDF property semantics <p> RDF properties are usually provided with natural-language definitions . Designers of application profiles should take care to use the properties in ways that are compatible with these definitions . Designers may add technical constraints on use of properties ( such as repeatability ) , or provide more narrow interpretations of definitions for particular purposes , but they should not contradict the meaning of the properties intended by their maintainers . <p> The intended meaning of a property is determined not just by natural-language definitions but also by formally declared relationships of the given property to other properties . Definitions typically specify a formal " domain " ( the class of things that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a class of things that can be values ) . This additional information improves the utility of RDF properties by enabling inferences about the things they are used to describe . The property foaf:img ( image ) , for example , has a domain of foaf:Person and a range of foaf:Image , so that when metadata-consuming applications find metadata using the property foaf:img , they can automatically infer that the thing being described with this property is a person and that the value being referred to by the property is an image . Properties may also be semantic refinements of other properties . The property dcterms:abstract , for example , is a sub-property of dcterms:description , meaning that anything which is said to have an abstract also may be said to have a description . <p> For the purposes of re-using properties in application profiles , it is especially important to check whether or not the properties are intended to be used with values that are literals . Properties that are intended to be used with values that are literalsi.e. , with values that by definition may consist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag ( in a " plain value string " ) or a datatype identifier ( in a " typed value string " ) are said to have a " literal " range . Examples of properties with a " literal " range are dcterms:date , which is declared with a range of rdfs:Literal , and foaf:firstName , which is defined as being an owl:DatatypeProperty . The advantage of properties with a " literal " range is simplicity . The metadata carries and metadata-consuming applications expectjust one plain or typed value string , making the metadata simple to encode and simple to process . <p> Properties with anything other than a " literal " range are said to have a " non-literal " range . Examples of properties with a " non-literal " range include dcterms:license , with the range dcterms:LicenseDocument , and foaf:holdsAccount , with the range foaf:OnlineAccount . Where literal-range properties may be simpler to process , non-literal-range properties are more flexible and extensible . In descriptive metadata , literal values constitute " terminals " ( in the sense of " end point " ) ; the value string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point for any further description of the person Mary Jones . A non-literal value , in contrast , has hooks to which one may attach any number of additional pieces of information about the person Mary Jones , such as her email address , institutional affiliation , and date of birth . Potentially , non-literal values can be represented by any combination of the following : <p> A plain or typed value string ( Value String in the DCMI Abstract Model ) and not just one , but potentially several in parallel , as in the case of a title rendered in English , French , and Japanese . <p> A URI identifying the value resource ( Value URI ) . <p> A URI identifying an enumerated set ( or controlled vocabulary ) of which the value is a member ( Vocabulary Encoding Scheme URI ) . <p> Note that the difference between literal-range and non-literal-range properties is primarily a modeling issue . The type of property determines how the metadata will be encoded machine-processably for exchange and interpreted by applications that consume the metadata . End-users need not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a value string looks the same regardless of whether it is directly a literal value or a value string attached to a non-literal value . <p> When using an existing property , the choice between a literal and non-literal range will usually be mandated by the official definition . If that mandated choice is not sufficient ( e.g. , the dcterms:date property has a literal range and a more complex value is needed ) , or if a property with the needed semantics can not be found anywhere , then a new property ( with a new URI ) must be coined . <h> Coining new RDF properties <p> By definition , Dublin Core application profiles " use " properties that have been defined somewherei.e. , somewhere outside of the profile itself . If no existing property can be found among any of the well-known vocabularies , then the designers of an application profile will need to declare one themselves . <p> Declaring a new property is in itself not a difficult task . One gives it a name , formulates a definition , decides whether it takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property under a namespace to which one has access ( and not , for example , under http : //microsoft.com or http : //amazon.de ) . Services such as http : //purl.org , which is used for identifying DCMI properties , provide " persistent " URIs that can be redirected to documentation at more temporary locations . Guidance for creating and publishing RDF vocabularies can be found in " Cool URIs for the Semantic Web " COOLURIS , the RDF Primer RDF-PRIMER , and " Best Practice Recipes for Publishing RDF Vocabularies " RECIPES . Best-practice examples include DCMI Metadata Terms DCMI-MT , Dublin Core Collection Description Terms CTERMS , and Eprints Terms ETERMS , It is good practice for terms also to be published in RDF schemas ; for examples , see see the schemas associated with DCMI Metadata Terms DCMI-MT and Dublin Core Collection Description Terms CTERMS . <p> Whether to assign a literal or a non-literal range is essentially a choice between simplicity and extensibility . Value strings alone may suffice for recording a date ( " 2008-10-31 " ) or a title ( " Gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one may need to record more than just a name . When in doubt , it is wise to assign a non-literal range . In the case of authors , for example , the non-literal range provides a hook for adding email address , affiliation , and date of birth or for using a URI to point to a description of the author somewhere outside one 's own application . Because they support the use of URIs ( i.e. , the use of URIs " as URIs " and not just " as strings " ) , non-literal values are crucial in achieving the ideal of linked metadatadescriptions that are cross-referenced using globally valid identifiers . <h> Translating user-defined data requirements into design decisions <p> We can now return to the questions asked of data content experts about each potential property with regard to potential values . <p> Do you want to use free text ? " Free text " ( i.e. , strings of characters ) is called a Value String in the DCMI Abstract Model and can be used with properties of either a literal or non-literal range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a requirement to use multiple value strings , in parallel , in a single statement , for example in the case of values that are represented in multiple languages . This can only be done in conjunction with non-literal-range properties . <p> Will the free text ever need to follow a pre-defined format ? If so , then the Value String can be used with a Syntax Encoding Scheme ( datatype ) . <p> Will single value strings suffice or is there a need ( or potential need ) for a more complex structure with multiple components ? If anything more than a single value string is needed for the value , then the property used must have a non-literal range . If by chance you have found a property with the right natural-language definition but the wrong range for example , with the more limiting literal rangeyou may need to coin your own property , with its own URI , using that definition with a non-literal range . <p> Might you ever want to use a URI to identify the value or point to a description of the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a syntactic construct separate from a Value String . Value URIs can not be used to describe literal values ; they must be used with properties that have a non-literal range . It is of course possible to record a URI as a Value Stringa URI is , after all , a stringbut applications consuming the metadata on this basis will have no reliable way to distinguish that string from other strings in order to interpret it as an identifier . <p> Will you want to select valid values from a controlled list ? If so , then the following are possible : <p> Simple lists of text strings may be informally documented as usage guidelines in a Description Set Profile . <p> Simple lists of text strings may be more formally defined as a Syntax Encoding Scheme ( SES , or datatype ) , with a URI , making the list citable and available for use in many application profiles . <p> A list of strings may be interpreted as labels for a list of concepts . This is called a Vocabulary Encoding Scheme ( VES ) . Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an SES , the individual concepts of a VES may also , or alternatively , be identified using URIs . <p> If the list of values is already available somewhere and has already been identified ( e.g. , by DCMI ) as a Syntax Encoding Scheme or Vocabulary Encoding Scheme , then use that URI with the proper modeling construct . <p> If the list of values is already available somewhere but has not yet been identified as an SES or VES , you may need to interpret which model it more closely fits . Sometimes either interpretation is defensible . Whichever way you decide , it is important that the URI you coin for the encoding scheme be clearly declared as one or the other in order to avoid any ambiguity in the metadata . <p> If you want to restrict the set of valid values to a fixed list ( as opposed to allowing the use of unlisted values ) , this restriction can be declared and documented in a Description Set Profile . <p> In general , the use of formally defined values , such as controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitability for automatic processing . The use of SES and VES , as appropriate , is an important step in this direction . Increasingly , however , URIs are being assigned to individual terms in controlled vocabularies using the RDF vocabulary Simple Knowledge Organization System SKOS . The concept " World Wide Web " in the Library of Congress Subject Headings , for example , has recently been assigned the URI LONG ... As controlled vocabularies become increasingly " SKOSified " , it will become easier to use those vocabularies to find and integrate access to resources from multiple sources on the open Web . The VES construct can flexibly accommodate the transition from Value Strings alone , to Value Strings with VES URIs , and from there to Value URIs ( with or without VES URIs ) .

One of the problems of the other current tools of species distribution modeling is that they generate models with their bespoke standards that mean the models can not be used in other tools . Among the existing tools for species distribution modeling , openModeller stands out with some advantages over other species distribution modeling tools because it allows different formats for data input of occurrence of species , environmental data and parameters for the algorithms thus supporting users and users group in reach your goals without needing to know different platforms and modeling tools . 
@@100424392 @4624392/ <h> Abstract <p> There are a large number of metadata standards and initiatives that have relevance to digital preservation , e.g. those designed to support the work of national and research libraries , archives and digitization initiatives . This paper introduces some of these , noting that the developers of some have acknowledged the importance of maintaining or re-using existing metadata . It is argued here that the implementation of metadata registries as part of a digital preservation system may assist repositories in enabling the management and re-use of this metadata and may also help interoperability , namely the exchange of metadata and information packages between repositories.

Data elements , field names , column names , row names , labels , metatags , etc. seem to reproduce at whim . Librarians have been battling data disparity for over a century with tools like controlled vocabularies and classification schemes .

This poster will look at how each partner is developing exemplars for the deposit of research datasets in open access institutional repositories ( IRs ) . Datasets are not different from other digital materials in that they need to be described , not just for discovery but also for preservation and re-use . The GRADE project found that Dublin Core descriptive metadata was sufficient for discovery within a DSpace repository , though more in-depth metadata or documentation was required for re-use after downloading . In the absence of a Dublin Core application profile for research data , the project partners have looked at the other metadata models , such as DDI and STFC . The poster will also cover self-archiving versus assisted deposit of datasets , policies and licenses , and the need to establish relationships with researchers at key points in the data life cycle to build trust and user-centred curation services .

This paper discusses basic concepts and models of metadata schemas in order to clarify functional requirements for extending registry functions to enhance usability and reusability of metadata schemas . It also shows two experimental tools developed to help users find , browse and build metadata schemas. 
@@100424412 @4624412/ <h> Table of contents <p> The document proposes a set of editorial revisions to terms in the set of DCMI Metadata Terms DCTERMS . The proposed changes are summarized in Section 2 and detailed , term by term , in Section 3 . This proposal should be considered in conjunction with a separate but related proposal , " Domains and Ranges for DCMI Properties " , which proposes a set of classes for assignment as domains and ranges of DCMI properties DOMAINS . <p> This document follows on an earlier revision of terms in the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set ( DCMES ) DCMES-CHANGES , which was undertaken in order to clarify intended semantics and bring the wording of definitions and usage comments into line with the language of the DCMI Abstract Model DCAM . <p> After a Public Comment period , the changes described here will be finalized by the DCMI Usage Board , then published in revised versions of the Web documents " DCMI Metadata Terms " DCTERMS and " DCMI Metadata Terms : A complete historical record " DCTERMS-HISTORY . <p> All of the changes proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of the DCMI Namespace Policy NAMESPACE . The namespace policy says that DCMI terms are identified using Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URIs ) . In accordance with the principle that distinct URIs should be assigned to distinct resources , the policy sets limits on the range of editorial changes that may allowably be made to the official labels , definitions , and usage comments associated with DCMI terms . By policy , any changes of meaning judged " likely to have a substantial impact on either machine processing of DCMI terms or the functional semantics of the terms " must trigger the creation of a new , distinct term with a new , distinct URI . <p> In the opinion of the Usage Board , the changes described in this document are unlikely to have a substantial impact on either machine processing of DCMI terms or the functional semantics of the terms -- i.e. , they fall within the allowable range of editorial change . The changes constitute clarifications of term semantics in light of improved theoretical understanding , user feedback , and implementation experience . They are intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended meanings more sharply into focus . <h> Free-standing descriptive labels <p> When terms such as dcterms:available were first coined as " Dublin Core qualifiers " in 2000 QUALIFIERS , it was not yet entirely clear whether qualifiers were intended to be used like adjectives -- i.e. , in conjunction with the Dublin Core elements they modified -- or as elements in their own right . The labels assigned at the time , such as " Available " , suggest the former , but DCMI grammatical principles , and later the Abstract Model , clearly evolved to the latter . The terms dcterms:alternative , dcterms:available , dcterms:created , dcterms:issued , dcterms:modified , dcterms:valid , dcterms:spatial , and dcterms:temporal have been re-named with free-standing names such as " Date created " ( instead of just " Created " ) and " Alternative Title " instead of just " Alternative " ) . <h> The phrase " content of the resource " <p> As described in DCMES-CHANGES , wordings which distinguish the " content of " a resource have been revised to refer directly to a resource . In the current batch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dcterms:abstract , dcterms:tableOfContents , dcterms:isFormatOf , dcterms:hasFormat , dcterms:spatial , dcterms:temporal , dcterms:DCMIType , and dcterms:requires . <h> The phrase " reference to a resource " <p> Definitions which specify encoding practice with phrases such as " reference to a resource " have been revised as described in DCMES-CHANGES . This change is relevant to the definition of dcterms:conformsTo . Note , however , that the definition of **29;2395;TOOLONG remains " A bibliographic reference for the resource " . <h> The phrase " use a controlled vocabulary " <p> It is now generally recommended that controlled vocabularies be used in metadata , so specific usage advice along these lines has been removed from the comments dcterms:accrualMethod , **26;2426;TOOLONG , and dcterms:accrualPolicy.

The DCMI Abstract Model is being published as a DCMI Recommendation together with this Status Report . Item 2 has n't been started . Consideration is being given to the make-up of the taskforce required for item 3 , but no real progress has been made . A suggested way forward for item 4 was made to the DC-Architecture list by Pete Johnston . In the absence of any negative comments , we will seek to implement this proposal . There has been no progress on items 5 and 6 . The intention is still to complete items 1 to 6 in the next 6 months . <p> The Guidelines document has been updated following various comments received , including some comments to the Working Group chair from interested parties outside DCMI . Apart from XML encoding issues this document is nearing completion . <p> The publication of the DCMI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metadata in XML need revision . The XML encoding of citation information , as detailed in previous versions of the Citation Guidelines , will need revising when the new DC-in-XML encoding is agreed . <p> Because of the XML encoding issue , it was decided to split the Citation Guidelines document into two parts . The first part , which gives general guidance on capturing bibliographic citation information in DC with some XHTML examples , will be published following the DCMI process of Advisory Board and public reviews , beginning in March . The second part , which gives recommendations for encoding citation information in XML , will be written when the revised DC-in-XML guidelines become available . This new document will be added to the Working Group 's workplan . <p> Progress is now running slightly behind the schedule described in the Workplan .

There has also been some discussion of identifiers for collections . No requests have been raised for the addition of further descriptive attributes to the DC CD AP , but there remain issues to be resolved with the current draft , particularly regarding the **38;2540;TOOLONG relationships and how they are represented . <p> The workplan for 2004-2005 was approved by consensus . This will be posted on the Working Group 's Web page in March 2005 . The workplan is largely a continuation of work items from the 2003-2004 workplan . Item 1 , an examination of DC Date 's definition and comment to explicitly embrace the concept of date range , is currently underway . We hope to complete this initial work item and proceed with additional work items shortly . <p> In the next six months , the workplan will be systematically pursued , particularly considering whether additional schemes should be proposed for adoption . <p> The DC-Education Working Group has been gearing up for its work on development of a formal DC-Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AP work has been developed and is available .

In preparation for the work on the Application Profile as well as other deliverables for the year set in Shanghai , the Working Group has established a Wiki . <p> In the next six months , work on the DC-Education Application Profile will continue . The group will work with IEEE LOM partners in planning education-related events at DC-2005 . <p> The current workplan includes working on identifying measures of success when implementing metadata and Dublin Core . This is being done by creating a bibliography of current literature on the topic , surveying the list for input , outlining and then developing a presentation that could be made available for use by individuals within the corporate world in order to promote metadata use and Dublin Core .

It is intended to be a work in progress which the group can augment . A discussion is taking place among a group of volunteers regarding how a presentation ought to be structured and what points it should address . The outline of such a presentation has also been posted to the Wiki . Joseph Busch has analyzed the groups mailing list in order to better understand what sort of organizations are represented by various group members . This information will inform volunteers on whether to develop a vertical-specific set of presentation or a single , more generic one that can be tailored to a number of different corporate environments . He has posted a summary as well as some statistics about this to the Wiki . <p> Discussions regarding a possible pre-conference workshop have begun between the chair and Arthur Haynes .

For government implementers there is , therefore , a stronger driver to ensure harmonization between metadata standardization for discovery and recordkeeping purposes ; <p> " War stories " : Experiences around the process of development and implementation of a whole-of-Government discovery metadata program could be of great value in jurisdictions beginning such work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty in identifying issues that are purely of concern to e-Government programs . While the work items identified do have implications for other sectors , they were selected as areas of particular significance to Government programs as they operate in practice . <p> The Government Working Group met at DC-2004 in Shanghai , with 14 delegates in attendance . Minutes of the meeting are available here and on the Working Group Web page . The meeting reviewed progress with major items on the work plan , and provided a valuable sharing of experiences . <p> Since the meeting there has been renewed interest in finalizing the Government application profile . As understanding of the application profile model has developed , and an increasing number of governments have articulated their discovery metadata requirements , this appears both more important and achievable than previously . It is hoped to progress the profile over the coming six months . <p> The Kernel/ERC group is pursuing a six-point workplan that includes formally documenting kernel metadata , implementing an open process for publishing new vocabulary terms , creating open source software tools , and developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publication of two new Internet Drafts that define two aspects of the ERC syntax substrate for kernel metadata . The first , " A Name-Value Language ( ANVL ) " ( Kunze , Kahle , Masanes , Mohr ) , proposes a basic ERC record structure minus element semantics . The second , " Temporal Enumerated Ranges ( TEMPER ) " ( Kunze ) , proposes a new date/time format . It may be of interest that the application that gave rise to ERCs , namely electronic permanence , has also spawned a tool ( " noid " ) for generating persistent identifiers that communicates using ANVL . <p> A face-to-face Working Group meeting at the DC-2004 conference in Shanghai . The presentation and recommendations from that meeting are available . <p> Two open source search engines that can index , search , and transform Kernel/ERC metadata are now referenced from the working group home page . The first is " Amberfish " , and is due to the efforts of working group member Nassib Nassar . The second is " Isite2 " , thanks to working group member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server settings . <p> Related to usage and best practice guidelines , some evaluation of Kernel metadata in MLIS graduate student projects has been conducted at the University of North Carolina ( UNC ) with Jane Greenberg , and the University of North Texas ( UNT ) with Bill Moen . UNC students are looking at the DC Kernel in the context of metadata models , architectures , and applications . The UNT students will be making available comparable sets of resource citations marked up in qualified Dublin Core and in ERC . <p> The next six months anticipates further results from university-level metadata instructional experiences , continuing development of the kernel vocabulary , and refactoring of the current ERC specification in light of the ANVL and TEMPER specifications . Feedback from deployment in several maturing projects is expected to she 'd light on the efficacy of current approaches . <p> Work has been put in hand on the updates to the profile and it should be ready to submit for the Spring meeting of the Usage Board . A draft of the XML schema has been produced . Several issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : using DC XML Schemas ; mixing terms taken from different data models ; limitations imposed by XML schemas . Discussion of these issues is currently taking place on the DC-Libraries and DC-Architecture lists . <p> A further item in the work plan relates to the creation of guidance documentation and it is hoped commence this work before the conference in Madrid . Volunteers from the working group will be needed to undertake sections of this work . <p> This Working Group is primarily a forum for individuals and organizations from international communities to share information and knowledge gained from experiences in their local or domain-specific applications of Dublin Core with the global community , and especially for those where non-English languages are their primary language . Major issues of the Working Group 's interests include translations of DCMI terms into local languages and collecting/sharing local requirements and adoption of DC to local resources . Working Group members can also provide multilingual perspectives to current DC issues . Cooperation with other Working Groups , especially the Registry Working Group to collect translations of DCMI terms and related information , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scan of DC implementations . See charter at the Group 's Web page . <p> This Working Group does not have a formal work plan . The Working Group has continued its activities through 2004 by active participation of its members at the Dublin Core Working Group meeting at DC-2004 . There were session presentations and discussions on multilingual aspects of Dublin Core , including the DC Registry and digital library projects . The results of the 2004 Questionnaire on DCMES : standards - translations - will shortly be made available . <p> In 2005 , this Working Group will review its Open Issues and Related work documentation . An academic journal has shown interest in publishing works presented at the DCMI Localization and Internationalization Working Group special session in Shanghai , October 2004 as a special issue of the journal . A preliminary invitation has been sent to the speakers to submit their paper for the special issue to the Working Group Chairs . <p> This Working Group is functioning largely as a sounding board for discussion of the use of Identifiers in metadata . There are no work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been largely silent in recent months . There are currently discussions underway for a joint European/US workshop on identifiers , and this is expected to trigger some discussion on the list . <p> There has not been much active development of the Registry software in the past 6 months . The Registry is considered to be in a ' mature and stable ' state . If anything , it is slightly ahead of the need for such software . The chairs suggest to pause and let the demand for this type of application grow before investing further in it . Of course , any problems with the software that are identified will be addressed , as will new functionality deemed critical . <p> One related item that may be worth noting is a paper on Metadata Registries , co-written by Stu Weibel and Harry Wagner and submitted to the Journal of Digital Information ( JoDI ) for publication . <p> The Working Group has installed a Wiki and will focus on the following for the next year : <p> Evaluate documents in the DCMI environment and the CEN/ISSS MMI-DC environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visibility in the standards world <p> Develop guidelines for national standardization of Dublin Core <p> Activities in the workplan have n't started yet .

Date : 2006-08-28 In this document , the DCMI Usage Board proposes changes of wording to labels , definitions , and comments of terms in the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set ( DCMES ) . These changes will be posted for Public Comment from 28 August to 25 September 2006 . Any comments received will be discussed at a Usage Board meeting in Colima , Mexico , on 30 September 2006 . Originally formulated from 1994 to 1996 and revised in 1999 as DCMES Version 1.1 , this term set is the basis for the formal standards NISO Z39.85-2001 NISO and ISO Standard 15836-2003 ISO . The base document used for the changes proposed here is the consolidated DCMI terms document of June 2005 DCMITERMS . The changes proposed here reflect lessons learned from many years of user feedback and implementation experience . The Usage Board has edited definitions and comments to bring their language into line with that of the DCMI Abstract Model , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAM . All of the changes were evaluated by the DCMI Usage Board in light of the DCMI Namespace Policy NAMESPACE . The namespace policy says that DCMI terms are identified using Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URIs ) . In accordance with the principle that distinct URIs should be assigned to distinct resources , the policy sets limits on the range of editorial changes that may allowably be made to the official labels , definitions , and usage comments associated with DCMI terms . By policy , any changes of meaning judged " likely to have a substantial impact on either machine processing of DCMI terms or the functional semantics of the terms " must trigger the creation of a new , distinct term with a new , distinct URI . In the opinion of the Usage Board , the changes described in this document are all unlikely to have a substantial impact on either machine processing of DCMI terms or the functional semantics of the terms -- i.e. , they fall within the allowable range of editorial change . Rather , the changes constitute clarifications of term semantics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the final twist of the lens that brings intended meanings more sharply into focus . 1 . General categories of change 1.1 . Replacement of the phrase " the content of the resource " ( or " intellectual content of the resource " ) with " the resource " . Implementation experience has shown the semantic distinction between a resource and the " content of " a resource to be a source of confusion . According to the DCMI Abstract Model , a DCMI metadata description " describes one , and only one , resource " DAM . In the DCMI context , this principle dates back to 1997 , when it was known as the " one-to-one principle " . When the one-to-one principle is correctly followed , the semantic restriction to " the content of " a resource is in effect redundant . Moreover , Dublin Core elements are used to describe things other than document-like resources -- things such as physical objects and abstract concepts . For example , a stuffed animal has a Creator ( perhaps a taxidermist , or an artist ) but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " the stuffed animal . In light of current usage , the meaning of the original distinction between a resource and its content is no longer clear . In the opinion of the Usage Board , dropping the words " the content of " from definitions affirms the semantics of these terms as they have been understood in practice and with no significant practical impact on implementation . This change is relevant to the definitions of Contributor , Creator , Coverage , Description , Subject , Type , and Language . 1.2 . Replacement of the phrase " a reference to a resource " with " a resource " . In metadata , a related resource can be " referred to " only by means of a " reference " , whether that reference is a text description or a formal identifier . The extra words are therefore redundant . The recommendation that formal identifiers be used is retained as part of the Comments . This change is relevant to the definitions of Source and Relation and to the comment for Description . 1.3 . Replacement of the phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " use an encoding scheme " . The proposed wording is more concise and conforms more closely with the language of the DCMI Abstract Model . This change is relevant to the comments for Coverage , Format , Subject , and Type . 1.4 . Replacement of the phrase " use a value from a controlled vocabulary " with " use a controlled vocabulary " . The proposed wording is more concise and conforms more closely with the language of the DCMI Abstract Model . This change is relevant to the comments for Type , Format , and Coverage . 1.5 . Replacement of the phrase " a string or number conforming to a formal identification system " with " a string conforming to a formal identification system " . A number is also a string , so the words " or number " are redundant . This change is relevant to the comments for Identifier , Relation , and Source . 1.6 . Deletion of word " Resource " from the labels " Resource Type " and " Resource Identifier " . In the DCMI context , the terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the qualifier " resource " in their labels . For example , Title is not called " Resource Title " and Date not " Resource Date " . The Usage Board proposes to correct this by dropping the unnecessary reference to " resource " in the labels of Type and Identifier . This change will also bring the labels of the elements ( " Type " and " Identifier " ) in line with their names ( " type " and " identifier " ) . 2 . Changes to specific elements 2.1 . Format The definition of Format as " The physical or digital manifestation of the resource " has been a source of confusion . For example , it is sometimes misinterpreted as referring to a related resource -- one that is a " manifestation " in the sense of Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records ( FRBR ) . The proposed wording -- " The file format , physical medium , or dimensions of the resource " -- moves words from the original comment for Format into the definition in order to describe the intended meaning more concretely. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature or genre of the content of the resource " was found to be unhelpfully vague . As with Format , words from the original comment were used to formulate the definition : " The genre , functional category , or aggregation level of the resource . The Usage Board will be particularly interested to hear of implementations of Type that do not fit into the scope of " genres , functional categories , or aggregation levels " . 2.3 . Rights As proposed , the definition remains unchanged as " Information about rights held in and over the resource " . However , the Usage Board proposes that several long-recognized problems be corrected : -- That the label be changed from " Rights Management " to " Rights " . The reference to " management " has more to do with possible uses of the element than with the substance of the element itself . This change also brings the label of the element ( " Rights " ) in line with its name ( " rights " ) . -- The existing comment refers both to a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that provides such a statement . The Usage Board sees this as an implementation issue best removed from the comment . -- The qualification that " no assumptions may be made " if the element is absent was removed from the comment . The point is inappropriate because it implies that the element can only be used ( or not ) as part of a fixed element set . 2.4 . Coverage The scope and purpose of Coverage has been a topic of much discussion and interpretation . The wordings proposed by the Usage Board address several issues : -- Use of the word " extent " in the definition . The use of " extent " in Coverage has caused confusion with respect to Format ( the comment of which refers to " dimensions " such as " size " and " duration " ) and to the term Extent -- a refinement of Format defined as " The size or duration of the resource " . The proposed definition replaces the ambiguous phrase " extent or scope of the content of the resource " with " spatial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the comment to " jurisdiction " . The notion of " jurisdiction " entered into the scope of Coverage at an early date as part of the comment and has informed a significant number of implementations . The Usage Board proposes to make this meaning explicit by referring to " jurisdiction " in the definition itself , hence the definition : " The spatial or temporal topic of the resource , or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant " . 2.5 . Subject Two changes are proposed : -- Change of label from " Subject and Keywords " to " Subject " . It continues to be acknowledged in the comment that a subject may be expressed with keywords . This change also brings the label of the element ( " Subject " ) in line with its name ( " subject " ) . -- In the comment , advice that the Coverage element be used to describe the spatial or temporal topic of the resource . 2.6 . Language Six of the fifteen elements of DCMES -- Type , Format , Coverage , Subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with encoding schemes . Only in the cases of Language and Date , however , did the comments prescribe specific encoding schemes . In current DCMI practice , the prescription of encoding schemes is seen as being more properly the role of an application profile , not of a term declaration . The Usage Board therefore proposes to amend the comment to reflect this , while retaining references to two encoding schemes as examples . Hence : " Recommended best practice is to use an encoding scheme , such as RFC 3066 RFC3066 or ISO 639-2 ISO639 " . 2.7 . Date As for Language see Section 2.6 , the Usage Board proposes to change the reference to a specific encoding scheme in the comment from " recommended best practice " to the status of an example . Hence : " Recommended best practice is to use an encoding scheme , such as the W3CDTF profile of ISO 8601 W3CDTF " . The intended scope of the Date element has been the object of much discussion in the DCMI community . In practice , Date has long been interpreted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July 2000 of a first set of " Dublin Core qualifiers " , which included Available , defined as referring to a " date ( often a range ) " , consolidated this interpretation . The Usage Board now proposes to bring the definition of Date into line with this long-standing practical interpretation by explicitly allowing date ranges . Hence : " A point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource . " DAM LONG ... DCMITERMS LONG ... ISO LONG ... NAMESPACE LONG ... NISO LONG ... 3 .

These proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 September 2006 . <p> The Usage Board will coordinate with DCMI Architecture Working Group on finalizing a number of developments related to the DCMI Abstract Model . <p> Between DC-2006 and the end of the year , the DCMI Abstract Model and related specifications ( DC-XML , DC-RDF , and DC-TEXT ) will be revised in order to clarify the nature of Vocabulary Encoding Schemes and of domains and ranges . <p> The Usage Board will review and finalize a proposal for a vocabulary of classes for use as domains and ranges . <p> In early 2007 , the revised Abstract-Model-related specifications and proposed vocabulary of domain and range classes will be posted for public comment . <p> At its mid-year meeting in March or April 2007 , the Usage Board will finalize the vocabulary of classes and use them to assign domains and ranges for existing terms . <p> In support of this work , it is expected that DCMI will contract technical writers to prepare updated guidelines on how to prepare Application Profiles and declare metadata vocabularies . <p> The next meeting of the DCMI Usage Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Manzanillo , Mexico . <p> From 28 August to 25 September , public comment was held for a set of editorial changes of the definitions of terms of the original fifteen-element Dublin Core . The definitions were updated after the DCMI Usage Board reviewed these definitions for consistency , clarity , and conformance with the DCMI Abstract Model . <h> Working Group highlights <p> The accessibility Working Group has been active in collaboration with the ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36 Working Group in developing a final version of the AccessForAll information models for both the description of users needs and preferences and for resource descriptions to be matched to those needs and preferences . This work has taken place simultaneously with the finalization of new accessibility recommendations from W3C , including one that requires accessibility metadata on all resources . Coordination of these activities , and other relevant ISO , EU and IMS activities has made working difficult at times but hopefully will ensure greater interoperability of accessibility metadata . There has been extensive discussion of the new accessibility approach through such channels as the DCMI Accessibility Wiki and e-mail lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been presented and face-to-face discussions have taken place . The CPB/WGBH National Center for Accessible Media ( NCAM ) , a US research and development facility dedicated to the issues of media and information technology for people with disabilities , has developed a multimedia presentation to help explain the new specifications and their use . <p> A major issue is education and outreach about accessibility metadata and the huge difference it can make to most people , and the way in which it can help people who can not find what they can use on the Web despite having the necessary skills and equipment . It should be noted that while search engines might help with the finding of content by subject , this does not solve accessibility problems . <p> Some work was done on refining the functional requirements document , although this remains unfinished . Discussions have been held concerning past discussions of the Agents Working Group about agent descriptions and all relevant earlier documents have been collected . There has been some contact concerning the use of specifications developed by the FOAF ( Friend Of A Friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finalizing the update of the functional requirements document and the possible development of an Application Profile for agent descriptions within Dublin Core metadata . This activity may change depending on results of discussions concerning FOAF . <p> A call for tender was issued in early 2006 by DCMI to fund the development of revised guidelines for expressing Dublin Core metadata in XML and in RDF . The public comment period for these documents was held from 30 May through 27 June 2006 and a report on issues raised was prepared . This will serve as the basis for further updates of the RDF expression . <p> A Draft update of the Namespace Policy for the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative ( DCMI ) was prepared . <p> A new syntax for representing DC metadata description sets in plain text , known as DC-Text , has been developed . This syntax is particularly intended to aid discussion about the usage of the DCMI Abstract Model on mailing lists and in the DCMI Wikis . <p> Some work was undertaken to assign domains and ranges to DCMI properties . However , this activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly , work looking at revising the Dublin Core property definitions in line with the DC Abstract Model has also moved to the DCMI Usage Board . <p> Much of the work on the Architecture Working Group work plan at the start of the year remains , though significant progress has been made in some areas . In particular , the following items from the current work plan remain in progress : <p> Develop a short document for RDF implementers , clarifying the resource vs. literal string value issue and providing advice on best practice . <p> The Working Group decided to assemble a list of related standards , including de facto standards , as a working group resource . There are different standards in use by different communities or for different purposes , some informing others , so a list of these would be a useful reference . This list of related standards was finalised on 2006-03-31 , as a working group resource . <p> There is an outstanding item on the work plan , to write " Guidelines for the Dublin Core in XML Encoding of Bibliographic Citations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guidelines for implementing Dublin Core in XML . <p> On the issue of representing item format , agreement was reached on the use of a property to represent the media type of items within a collection . As a consequence of this decision some changes were also made to the proposed use of the dc:type property and the Collection Type Vocabulary . <p> The Working Group is currently preparing the version of the DCMI Collection Description Application Profile ( and supporting documents ) which will be submitted to the DCMI Usage Board for review at its meeting in Manzanillo at the end of September 2006 . <p> The issues related to the ownership and maintenance responsibility for both the Collection Description Application Profile itself and the new terms that have been created for use in that profile remain to be resolved , but some initial discussions have taken place which indicate that a third party is willing to take on this role , in partnership with DCMI if appropriate . <p> The Application Profile will be published with a reference to a date syntax encoding scheme for open-ended date ranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the DCMI Date Working Group develops a suitable syntax encoding scheme in the future , consideration will be given at that time to amending the Application Profile to reference that new scheme . <p> As decided at DC-2005 in Madrid , the DCMI Education Working Group had two agenda items for 2006 : <p> Work on a DC-Education Application Profile <p> The Joint DCMI/IEEE LTSC Taskforce working on a joint DCMI/IEEE specification with the working title " Recommendation for using IEEE LOM Elements in Dublin Core Metadata . " <p> In July 2006 , a working draft of a DCMI Education Application Profile was published to the DCMI Education discussion list for preliminary discussions prior to the Working Group meeting at DC-2006 in Manzanillo . The focus of the draft is on a limited set of education-specific properties and controlled vocabularies . The properties of concern are : Audience , Conforms To , Education Level , Instructional Method , Mediator , Subject , and Type . Since controlled vocabularies for a number of these properties are of necessity jurisdictionally-based , the draft provides a beginning list of potential schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has drafted a representation of the metadata elements of the IEEE Learning Object Metadata Standard in terms of the DCMI Abstract Model . Recent progress in this area is summarized in a presentation by Pete Johnston and Andy Powell at the CETIS Metadata &amp; Digital Repositories SIG . <p> Information that was developed in the last year was posted to the group 's Web page . <p> As part of the activity to build a body of case studies of how Dublin Core and other metadata have been implemented in corporate environments , some case studies were posted on the group 's Web page . More case studies will be added to the current list . <p> The group was considering a real-world Application Profile as an example , but unfortunately the development of that Application Profile was stalled and the group could not continue its evaluation . The group is now looking for other examples to consider . <p> A special session will take place at DC-2006 in Manzanillo with two presentations . <p> The Government Working Group has continued work on the Application Profile . An editorial group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wiki , were further discussions and editing are taking place ; especially by the editorial group . Discussion on the mailing list has been at a minimum because the Wiki for the last several months has been the main communication platform . <p> Two more work item are in progress at the moment , this is " Service description " and " Controlled vocabularies " . The editors will report on status at the DCMI Government Working Group meeting at DC-2006 . <p> While there was little traffic on the mailing list , the group 's chair has been working in the background on further documentation . Presentations related to the Kernel work were held at the JCDL Workshop on Metadata Tools for Digital Resource Repositories on 15 June 2006 . The workshop presentation described the implementation of Kernel metadata to resource description retrieval . The retrieval method itself was co-authored and implemented by three working group members . <p> Activity in the past year has centred on two matters . Firstly , DCMI received a request for feedback on RDA ( Resource Description and Access ) , a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and built on foundations established by the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules ( AACR ) . In response to this request , a sub-group was established in order to provide access to the commercially sensitive drafts but the task has proved unwieldy and feedback has been minimal . In response to the invitation from CC:DA , the Committee on Cataloging : Description &amp; Access within the America Library Association , Diane Hillmann undertook to provide a DCMI perspective to that body and produced some valuable feedback . <p> Secondly , the matter of re-using terms from MODS ( the Metadata Object Description Schema developed by the Library of Congress ) in a Dublin Core Application Profile . In the spirit of not inventing terms when they exist in another namespace , there are three terms in the DCMI Libraries Application Profile taken from the MODS schema . The mismatch between the underlying models is a complex area and has been problematic for the Application Profile for the past few years . The issues were articulated and extensively discussed on the list in April 2006 and a way forward is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at DC-2006 . <p> It is hoped to progress some of the issues raised about RDA at the special session on RDA at DC-2006 . In addition , now that the drafts of RDA have been made publicly available , it may be possible to find a way to offer additional feedback . <p> Other than the MODS terms there are a few lesser matters to be finalised in the DCMI Libraries Application Profile , if it is to be submitted to the Usage Board for approval . The working group will address these outstanding items at the meeting at DC-2006 . <p> This Working Group does not have a formal work plan and is primarily a forum for individuals and organizations from international communities to share information and knowledge gained from experiences in their local or domain-specific applications of Dublin Core with the global community , and especially for those where English is not the primary language . <p> The DCMI Localization and Internationalization Working Group Web page was updated with a number of presentations given at the previous Working Group Meeting , held at DC-2005 . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one was received from Bulgaria . <p> DCMI is encouraging the establishment of DCMI Affiliates under the Affiliate Program . The Localization and Internationalization Working Group , as the only DCMI working group with a specific focus on these issues , has potential to collaborate with the Affiliates and to promote sharing and exchange of regional needs and information in the global community . <p> A revised Working Group charter was submitted in March 2006 as a result of the change of chairs : Andrew Wilson resigned and John Kunze from the California Digital Library became the new co-chair . The new charter states : " The DCMI Preservation Working Group is a discussion forum for individuals and organizations that are interested in metadata related to digital preservation . As a focus for discussion , over the course of a year this group will deliver a 6-page overview of the landscape of emerging preservation metadata standards , preservation frameworks , and the relationships of those standards to the DCMI view of metadata . " . <p> Over the last year the Registry Working Group has acted as a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internationally . Although there has not been much traffic on the mailing list there has been exchange of news and pointers to project updates . There have been bi-lateral meetings between the The European Library registry group and the JISC IEMSR ( UK ) , and other exchange of information with the DART registry ( Australia ) , the NSDL registry ( USA ) , and the ISO 11179 XMDR initiative . <p> Metadata schema registries have a wider scope than Dublin Core , so the Dublin Core processes for progressing recommendations and guidelines are not appropriate for much of the work of the various registry projects . This means that one of the main drivers for working group activity is absent . Whilst the group has value as a focus point we need to consider carefully before taking on specific work items for the next year . Discussions at the Registry Working Group meeting at DC-2006 will inform future plans for the group . <p> Since the responsibility for Maintenance Agency activities was turned over to the Directorate after DC-2005 , the only task on the 2006 work plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call was sent out for contributions from people with experience , but only a single contribution from one country was received and more are needed . Some follow-up activities did n't give more contributions . The Working Group chair considers other options . <p> The DCMI Tools Working Group held a workshop as a parallel event at the international JCDL conference in June 2006 , in Chapel Hill , North Carolina . The workshop was opened with a number of presentations giving an overview of metadata tools development and usage . This part was followed by a group work and brainstorming session which included discussion of available information transmission from international standardization to implementers of tools , services and functionalities . A detailed report of the workshop was published in DLib magazine in July 2006 . <p> It was agreed at the Madrid and at the Chapel Hill meetings to develop an Application Profile and a classification vocabulary to describe services , tools , algorithms and functionalities . It is planned to present a first draft at the meeting in Manzanillo . <p> The ODRL/DCMI Profile Working Group was formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created , which attracted 41 members . A discussion paper was prepared and shared on the Working Group mailing list . However , there was no response to the discussion paper and little or no other discussion on the list . The group chairs therefore propose to close down the group . <p> The program chairs , Javier Solorio Lagunas of the University of Colima and Thomas Baker of DCMI , have prepared a very interesting conference program . The program features two keynotes , one on 3 October 2006 by Abel Packer of BIREME in Brazil and one on 6 October 2006 by Michael Crandall of the Information School at the University of Washington . In three plenary and four parallel paper sessions , 21 long and 7 short papers will be presented . Furthermore , in the workshop track , 13 Working Group sessions and eight special sessions are on the program . One each of the four conference days , tutorials will introduce basic as well as more advanced concepts related to the implementation of Dublin Core metadata in practice . <h> Community <p> At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 934 subscribers , a decrease of 14 compared to September 2005 . On the other hand , the total number of subscriptions to the active DCMI Working Groups ( not counting DC-General ) increased from 2,127 to 2,239 over the last 12 months , an increase of 112 .

@@100424438 @4624438/ <h> A Strawman Proposal for Metadata Extensibility <h> 1 . The Problem <p> Extensiblity means the ability to change or augment metadata standards - either ' officially ' ( by changing the standard ) or ' unofficially ' ( to support local extensions ) . <p> Extensions range from adding a new metadata element to creating an entirely new metadata set . <p> Extensibility causes problems to both the human users of the metadata system and to the software that supports them . <p> The human creating metadata first of all needs to be notified that standard has changed , and then needs to be able to find out what the changes mean . What values , for example , are legal in the new metadata element ? The human viewing metadata needs to be able to find out what the information entered into the changed metadata elements actually means . <p> Note that the human issues of extensibility are a special case of the general problem of understanding metadata . In current systems , for example , how does a new creator discover what metadata elements are available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> For software designers , the issue is how to reconfigure the software used by metadata creation tools , metadata storage engines , and metadata display programs to take into account the changed metadata standard . For a widely distributed system this reconfiguration must be automatic ( or as close to automatic as possible ) . The economic cost of manual reconfiguration is simply prohibitive , even if it were practicable . <p> Further , the ability to easily configure metadata software to handle different metadata sets opens the possibility of metadata software which can easily handle multiple metadata sets ( even ones not yet defined ) . This reduces the cost of the development of metadata systems and assists in the introduction of such systems . <h> 2 . A Strawman Solution <p> The essence of metadata extensibility is the ability to electronically publish a metadata schema . This allows metadata creators to understand what information they should add to a set of metadata , and metadata users to understand the meaning of the metadata sets they receive . Representing this schema in a machine processable form allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The following strawman proposal has been based on the schema specification system used in X.500 . Experience has shown that this system is very extensible ; although with certain limitations . The use of HTML to publish the schema is designed to address these limitations . <p> A mechanism for linking a reference description of a metadata schema has been proposed in 1 . This proposal is simply an extension of this schema idea to address the problems of extensibility . <p> This proposal is intended to broadly indicate how a metadata schema system would work and what information it would contain . The examples are not intended as syntax proposals . Nor is their any suggestion that this is all that the schema would contain . <h> 3 . Metadata Schema Publishing <p> The basic approach is to include in each metadata set a URI pointing to the metadata schema specification for that set . The specification can be viewed as a more formal version of the document proposed in 1 , so the same linkage mechanism could be used : <p> &lt;LINK REL = SCHEMA.dc HREF = " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of Web pages describing the schema used to construct this metadata set can be found at the specified URL . ( A URN would be preferable , but in the absence of a deployed URN scheme , URLs will work . ) <p> The structure of the pages pointed to by the metadataSchema URL are shown in Figure 1 . <p> The root page describes the metadata set as a whole , and includes lists of metadata elements ( attributes ) which may and must be contained in the set . Each metadata element has a page which describes the purpose of that element , and links to pages which describe the syntax and semantics of the element . <h> 4 . Metadata Set Schema <p> The page describing the Metadata Set would contain the following information <p> The name of the metadata set <p> The version and date <p> A text description of the purpose of the metadata set <p> A list of mandatory metadata elements <p> A list of optional metadata elements <p> A pointer to the formal standard describing the metadata set ( if one exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the following example : <p> Dublin Core Metadata Element Set Version 2 Date 15 January 1997 <p> The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is intended to describe document like objects .

Metadata Element Schema <p> A page describing a metadata element would contain the following information <p> The name of the metadata element <p> A textual description of the purpose of the metadata element <p> An optional pointer to the syntax of the metadata element <p> An optional list of semantics of the metadata element <p> A pointer to the formal standard describing the metadata element ( if one exists ) <p> An example might be : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource . Where practical , the content of this field should coincide with the Z39.53 three character codes for written languages . <p> The metadata element schema has been separated from the page describing the metadata set as a whole to allow individual metadata elements to be referenced by multiple metadata set specifications . <h> 6 . Metadata Element Syntax Schema <p> This portion of the schema specifies syntactic limitations on metadata values . For example , a metadata values may be limited to ' upper case strings ' . <p> A syntax instructs the user of the metadata set ( human or machine ) how metadata values are represented . This allows values to be consistent and aids machine processing and display of previously unrecognised metadata elements . <p> At a basic level , a syntax is equivalent to a type in a programming language . The basic syntaxes are strings , integers , floating point numbers and booleans . Although most ( all ? ) current metadata elements would fall into one of these four basic syntaxes , it is likely that more complicated , structured , syntaxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might contain a sequence of a string , an integer , and then a further string ) . <p> The syntax may also specify limitations on the values over and above the broad limitations of strings , integers , floats , and booleans . A string might have a maximum number of characters or on the range of characters . <p> A page describing a metadata element syntax would contain the following information <p> The name of the syntax <p> A textual description of the syntax <p> A textual description of the rules for comparing two values <p> A formal description of the syntax <p> A pointer to the formal standard describing the syntax specification ( if one exists ) <p> An example might be : <p> Telephone Number Syntax <p> A telephone number is a string of up to 32 characters which complies with ITU recommendation E.123 . Such a string has the following format : <p> A leading ' + ' <p> The country code ( e.g. ' 1 ' for the US ) <p> The area code ( with no brackets or leading zero ) <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An example telephone number is ' +61 3 9282 2615 ' <p> Two telephone numbers are the same if they have the same digits in the same order . Spaces are not significant . <p> The metadata element syntax has been separated from the metadata element specification itself so that many metadata elements may share the same syntax ( e.g. fax machines are labeled by telephone numbers ) . <p> There is a close relation between the syntax and semantics of a metadata element ; both can control the values that can be placed in the metadata element . The syntax is intended to be used to specify mechanical rules controlling values ( e.g. all characters must be in upper case ) . The semantics are intended to control values by specifying meaning ( e.g. taxonomies ) . However , there is a large overlap and one or other might be more appropriate in a particular case . <h> 7 . Metadata Element Semantic Schema <p> This portion of the schema specifies semantic limitations on metadata values . For example , the values might be limitted to Library of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semantic schemes ( and so the actual metadata element needs to contain a qualifier ) specifying which scheme is actually used . <p> A page describing metadata element semantics would contain the following information : <p> The name of the scheme <p> A textual description of the scheme ( possibly just referring to the ' well known ' standard ) <p> A pointer to the formal standard describing the semantics ( if one exists ) <p> The metadata element semantics have been separated from the metadata element specification itself so that many metadata elements may share the same semantics . <p> There is a close relation between the syntax and semantics of a metadata element ; both can control the values that can be placed in the metadata element .

Possible methods of bootstrapping this knowledge include : <p> Discovery through Altavista like searching <p> Discovery through metadata schema index pages <p> Automatic inclusion via configuration of metadata generators <h> 9 . Use of the Web Pages <p> The Web pages describing the metadata schema can be used in two ways : <p> As Help files . The Web pages describe the metadata set , the metadata elements , and the values that can be placed in metadata elements . The information in the pages can be used as the source material for ' help ' files to assist the metadata creator and metadata user in creating or using a metadata instance . These are more useful than on line standards because the pages are logically segmented so that a user does not have to , for example , retrieve ( and read ) the entire document when obtaining a help for a particular attribute . <p> As configuration files . Although not shown in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also be encoded into a machine recognisable format and included in the Web pages .

@@100424445 @4624445/ <h> Abstract <p> The Madison Digital Image Database ( MDID ) is an Internet-based content delivery system designed to allow instructors to teach with digital images and image catalog data . James Madison University ( JMU ) is currently developing an enterprise-level version of the MDID that will support custom catalogs , multiple collections , and cross-collection searches . The new MDID relies on Dublin Core ( DC ) to facilitate cross-collection searches . We anticipate that Dublin Core will also make catalog customization , data exchange and system interoperability easier . This poster describes the implementation of Dublin Core in a relational database , the mechanism for conducting cross-collection searches , and other benefits of using Dublin Core in the new MDID. 
@@100424453 @4624453/ <p> Description : This document contains a proposal by the DCMI Type Working Group 1 to the Dublin Core Usage Board for a moving image Type in the DCMI Type Vocabulary 2 . <p> Name : MovingImage <p> Label : Moving Image <p> Definition : A series of visual representations that , when shown in succession , impart an impression of motion . For example , an animation , movie , television , video , zoetrope , or visual output from a simulation . <p> Comment : moving image or still image replaces the term image <p> Type of term : Encoding Scheme <p> Encoding Scheme : DCMI Type Vocabulary 2 <p> Term qualified : dc:type <p> Why needed : The Dublin Core was initially developed for describing textual resources on the Internet . Deployments of DC have since expanded to include visual , audiovisual and new media collections . When the DCMI Type Vocabulary was formed a wider ranging list of agreed types ( such as moving image and still image ) were grouped together as image in the expectation that another vocabulary would provide the necessary distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed . <p> It is therefore proposed that the DCMI Type Vocabulary be extended to separate the value image into two resource types . The purpose of separating a moving image resource from a still image resource is to support discovery of resources that originate from , and are managed by quite different domains and are quite different forms of intellectual expression . <p> The risk of over elaborating a high-level type list , intended to be general is matched by the risk of not having a top level term for such a richly subtyped resource . Among these subtypes are form terms like Animation , Documentary , Unedited footage , etc . These would most likely be included in any second level lists proposed by the moving image community . The absence of such a top level term impedes the discovery of resources and reduces , rather than increases , interoperability . It is expected that both the still image and moving image domains will register second level encoding schemes . However , this proposal should not depend on any particular encoding scheme recommendation . <p> The suggestion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify moving image resources would be compromised by the number and complexity of format terms . This would also impede discovery of resources and reduce , rather than increase , interoperability . <p> The addition of the term moving image will acknowledge the importance of the moving image as one of the significant repositories of cultural memory and intellectual expression in the 20th century . It will not only facilitate the description of media forms such as television news , cinema and documentary but assist in the description of emerging new media and dynamic forms of expression in the 21st century . <p> Proposed status : Recommended <p> Related DCMI terms : Image , StillImage ( proposed ) <p> Related non-DCMI terms : <p> motion picture ( AACR2 ) : A length of film , with or without recorded sound , bearing a sequence of images that create the illusion of movement when projected in rapid succession . <p> Videorecording ( AACR2 ) : A recording on which visual images , usually in motion and accompanied by sound , have been registered ; designed for playback by means of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visual works in which the image , by an optical trick , appears to be in motion . Media for moving images include motion pictures , video recordings , flip books , and some optical toys such as zoetropes . <p> Motion Picture ( MARC 21 ) : A series of still pictures on film , with or without sound , designed to be projected in rapid succession to produce the optical effect of motion . <p> Videorecording ( MARC 21 ) : A recording on which visual images , usually in motion and accompanied by sound , have been registered , and which are designed for playback on a television receiver or video monitor . <p> Motion picture ( AMIM2 ) : a length of film , with or without recorded sound , bearing a sequence of images that create the illusion of movement when projected in rapid succession . <p> Video ( AMIM2 ) : a recording in which electronic signals of visual images , usually in motion and accompanied by sound , have been registered . Video is generally designed for playback utilizing a monitor . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-term benefits of such a change far outweigh the short-term adjustments . Further , as the Dublin Core metadata scheme evolves beyond an original user group and the descriptive needs of their time , it is natural that changes will occur . <p> An informal survey of the Dublin Core community ( DC General ) has revealed little evidence of any concern that deprecating the term ' image ' would cause problems for existing deployments of DC.Type terms . Where image has been used it appears to have been most commonly used for still images or augmented by local qualifiers . <p> To avoid difficulties with deployments of the existing term image it is proposed to add the two terms moving image and still image as preferred types . The existing term and the two coupled proposals for new terms will reflect this change : <p> The Status of the term image will change to Deprecated .

These suggestions will be discussed at the next meeting of the Usage Board , on 29-30 April in Seattle . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was held for updated specifications for DCMI DCSV , DCMI Period , DCMI Point , and DCMI Box to bring their language in line with the DCMI Abstract Model . <p> The XML schemas published on the XML Schemas page were updated in January 2006 to include support for new terms recently approved by the Usage Board . <p> The slides of the Tutorials that were given at DC-2005 were made available in PDF from the Training section of the DCMI Web site In January 2006 . <p> DCMI issued a Call for Tender in January 2006 for brief texts and presentations explaining the rationale and business case for Dublin Core metadata to non-experts . After evaluating the seven responses in February , The DCMI Directorate decided to award the work to Barbara Gorson , a consultant on information in digital environments . Further subcontracts were awarded to Andy Powell ( Eduserv Foundation , UK ) and Pete Johnston ( UKOLN , University of Bath , UK ) to revise the " Guidelines for implementing Dublin Core in XML " in order to update their support for the DCMI Abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden ) to finalize a revision of guidelines for expressing Dublin Core in RDF which have been developed by the RDF Taskforce of the DCMI Architecture Working Group . Revised versions of the encoding guidelines for XML and RDF are expected to be posted for public comment in the next months . <h> Working Group highlights <p> A small committee of the Working Group has been drafting a new standard for ISO . In the development of this standard , the implementation within the Dublin Core community was a high priority . The proposed standard reached Final Committee Draft ( FCD ) late in 2005 and has been out for public comment before final voting in early March 2006 . Between the first phase of development and the presentation of the FCD version , a lot of work was done on the information model and the proposed vocabularies . It appears that a version of the information model can be drafted that is consistent with the DCMI Abstract Model . Further discussion concerning a new Dublin Core term is ongoing . The objective is that the solution will match the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in Mobile Web and Device-Independent activities . <p> There has been active participation in the work in face-to-face meetings , ( multiple ) weekly teleconferences , on the Accessibility wiki and several lists including the DCMI Accessibility Working Group list . <p> The work activities scheduled for completion in this period were finished , with one exception . The following items were completed : <p> Engagement with other Working Groups . Due end September 2005 . Completed November 2005 . <p> Determine purpose(s) of agent description work . Due end October 2005 . Completed November 2005 . <p> Review previous agent description work . Due end of November 2005 . Completed October 2005 . <p> The activity to revise the functional requirements document was not completed by the due date of 31 January 2006 due to other work pressures . <p> There was some discussion of the question of the purpose of describing agents on the group 's mailing list in October and November 2005. but no postings since then . <p> Two main activities should be completed in the period leading up to DC-2006 . The revision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of February or early March 2006 . The second activity is the drafting of an Application Profile for describing agents as related descriptions . The group anticipates that this will be completed in time for submission to the DCMI Usage Board meeting at DC-2006 . <p> Finalise the provision of a persistent URI for the latest version of our XML schemas . <p> Develop an XML binding for Dublin Core metadata which supports all ( or a substantial subset ) of the features of the DCMI Abstract Model . Revise DCMI XML schemas accordingly . <p> Finalise revisions to the Namespace Policy for the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative to align use of terminology with other DCMI recommendations . <p> Evaluate use of GRDDL as mechanism for transforming arbitrary XML-encoded Dublin Core metadata into RDF according to the DCMI Abstract Model . <p> Monitor W3C developments for encoding RDF in XHTML and revise current guidelines for expressing Dublin Core metadata in HTML/XHTML as necessary . <p> Develop abstract model of Dublin Core Application Profiles . <p> Consider developing a representation of the DCMI Box , Period and Point encoding schemes using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items above are being undertaken by the DCMI RDF Taskforce . Unfortunately , there has been no real progress in this taskforce since the Madrid meeting . Recently , DCMI have agreed to fund Mikael Nilsson to undertake some of the document preparation activities on behalf of ( and working with ) the taskforce . <p> Pete Johnston has been working on the two work items associated with the XML encoding guidelines . New non-date-stamped URIs for the most recent versions of the XML schemas are in place and are in the final stages of being tested . These will be announced shortly . DCMI have also agreed to fund Pete Johnston and Andy Powell to work on a revised version of the " Guidelines for implementing Dublin Core in XML " , in order that it can provide full support for all aspects of the DCMI Abstract Model . <p> A revised Draft DCMI Namespace Policy was drafted before the Madrid meeting . However , there has been no progress on this document since then . <p> Work on the final four work items ( GRDDL , RDF in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) has not yet started . <p> By the October 2006 meetings , the XML Schema URIs will have been fully tested , a revised version of the " Guidelines for implementing Dublin Core in XML " will have been finalised and the documents and issues associated with the DCMI RDF Taskforce will have been significantly progressed . A revised DCMI Namespace policy should also be in place . <p> It is also worth noting that Pete Johnston has developed a syntax-neutral text-based way of representing Dublin Core description sets that conform to the DCMI Abstract Model as part of the ongoing DCMI/IEEE LTSC Joint Taskforce . This way of writing down description sets is particularly useful for aiding mailing list discussions . It is currently being used to support discussions by the DCMI Usage Board , the Accessibility Working Group and the DCMI/IEEE LTSC Taskforce . The document describing this representation will be shared , for comment , with the Architecture Working Group with a view to it becoming a DCMI Recommendation or a DCMI Recommended Resource . <p> The Working Group decided to assemble a list of related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group resource . There are different standards in use by different communities or for different purposes , some informing others , so a list of these would be a useful reference . The draft page ( http : **34;3423;TOOLONG ) was started by the Working Group chair and has been augmented by suggestions from several Working Group members . <p> Finalisation of the list of related standards is planned for the end of March 2006 . Later inclusion of appropriate additions will be possible . <p> There is an outstanding item on the work plan , to write " Guidelines for the Encoding of Bibliographic Citations " . This is waiting on a revision to the Guidelines for implementing Dublin Core in XML . <p> A revised draft of the DCMI Collection Description Application Profile has been circulated . This draft addresses two changes requested by the DCMI Usage Board after their preliminary review of the Application Profile : <p> Minor presentational changes , particularly to expand abbreviations <p> The introduction of some new properties to address the problem that , in the previous version , the constraint on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value space of a sub-property of that property <p> The representation of Item Format has not yet been discussed . <p> An extension to the Analytical Model of Collections and their Catalogues has been developed by Michael Heaney of the University of Oxford , with the aim of clarifying some of the issues surrounding the differences between the Location of a Collection and the Service which makes a Collection available . The issue is currently under discussion via the mailing list , and opinion seems to be in favour of retaining both the isLocatedAt and isAccessedVia properties . <p> Further work on Encoding Scheme(s) for Open-Ended Date Ranges depends on work by the DCMI Date Working Group . <p> Progress is now running slightly behind the schedule described in the Workplan . A proposal to address the issue concerning the representation of Item Format will be made during March 2006 by the Working Group chair . <p> At the DC-2005 conference , Douglas Campbell ( National Library of New Zealand ) was appointed co-chair of the Working Group . The group established a workplan for 2005-2006 that provides for work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial phase gives priority to categories of dates sought by other DCMI Working Groups . A draft encoding standard , " Date and Time Short Form " , has been prepared by Charles McCathieNevile and is under review . <p> The Working Group will focus on completing its workplan . No face-to-face meetings prior to the DC-2006 conference are currently planned . <p> The major focus of the workplan for 2005-2006 of the Working Group is on the development of the DCMI Education Application Profile . Work on the Application Profile has two intertwined components : <p> descriptions of the use of DCMI properties in Dublin Core-based metadata instances ; and <p> descriptions of the use of IEEE Learning Object Metadata ( LOM ) elements in Dublin Core-based metadata instances . <p> Work on the first component is underway through the Application Profile Drafting Committee and work on the second through the Joint DCMI/IEEE LTSC Taskforce . The work of these two bodies is inextricable intertwined . The need to integrate select IEEE/LOM elements into the DCMI Education Application Profile was identified as early as 2000 at the DCMI Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means for doing so remained illusive until the emergence of the DCMI Abstract Model . Thus , upon the completion of the Taskforce work , the Drafting Committee will integrate select IEEE/LOM properties into the emerging Application Profile . <p> The work of the Drafting Committee is progressing albeit slowly . Stemming from discussions at the face-to-face meeting at DC-2005 in Madrid , the Drafting Committee has narrowed its focus to those properties most relevant to the education/training domain : type , audience , educationalLevel , instructionalMethod and mediator . Discussions are ongoing on the Drafting Committee list of the audience property . The new DCMI Education wiki is being used successfully as the Drafting Committee 's collaborative work space . The target is to complete , at a minimum , these education properties for discussion at DC-2006 and to submit a proposal for consideration by the DCMI Usage Board at its mid-term meeting in early 2007 . <p> The joint DCMI/IEEE LTSC Taskforce held three conference calls . A first analysis of a mapping from IEEE/LOM to the DCMI Abstract Model was finished and agreed , resolving the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples . <p> In the next months , more conference calls are foreseen to resolve further issues . The Taskforce aims to have a draft document before DC-2006 in October 2006 , including a set of examples and introductory material . Around the same time , the group hopes to submit the documents to both DCMI and IEEE LTSC for formal endorsement . <p> In December 2005 , Jayakumaran ( Melvin Jay Kumar ) of Web Publishing House in Singapore was appointed co-chair of the group . <p> Information developed by the Corporate Circle was posted to the group 's Web page ( bibliography , case studies , reports , presentation ) . <p> Work has started to rework the Web pages to better support the group 's needs . A small committee has been working to redesign the pages . Alex Massytchev has completed a design and coded the first level of pages . The following steps are a wider review of the design and tests for browser compatibility and accessibility . <p> Continuation of the work item to build a body of case studies of how Dublin Core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been put on hold until to work commissioned by DCMI is complete , as there may be some overlap . <p> A sub-committee to identify and evaluate an application profile is headed by Melvin Jay Kumar . He is in the process of identifying an appropriate project and application profile that can be used and published as an example on a public Web site . <p> Duane McCollum has taken on responsibility to chair a sub-committee to prepare a workshop at DC-2006 . He plans to ask the DCMI list for help and volunteers to help plan and execute the workshop in Colima . <p> The work with the DCMI Government Application Profile has started within the editorial group , i.e. the editor has drafted a roadmap and workplan . This draft plan will be presented to the Working Group when the editorial group has finished it and will later be published at the group 's Web page . <p> Due to lack of time the work item concerning controlled vocabularies has not started yet , and may be further postponed . Other work items progress as planned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the final result of " Service description " will be presented at DC-2006 in October 2006 . <p> Issues with the re-use of MODS elements in the DCMI Libraries Application Profile : three volunteers at the meeting agreed to take this forward with the Library of Congress . Rebecca Guenther has since agreed to take part and is investigating the requirements of MODS . <p> Revision of RDA : in December 2005 , a DCMI committee was formed to participate in the review of the drafts of RDA from a DCMI perspective . This has proved a challenging task and a new and more useful approach is being formulated . <p> Provision of a representative of the Dublin Core community to CC:DA : Diane Hillman agreed to take this role at the January 2006 ALA meetings and has provided useful insight into AACR principles . <p> It was felt that it would be easier to assess the applicability of RDA to Dublin Core if there were a statement of requirements for content level rules from DCMI . This specification , based on a broader set of principles , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided shortly . It has been proposed that a special RDA session could be held at DC-2006 . <p> This Working Group held a special session at DC-2005 in Madrid , Spain . 13 participants attended the special session from 9 countries . <p> The session included a presentation from Tom Baker , in his role as DCMI Director of Specifications and Documentation , on the issues arising for translations of DCMI terms . <p> The group will work on ways that valid and certified translations of DCMI terms could be identified . <p> The second part of the session included presentations from some of the Working Group members , including Dublin Core metadata developments in South Africa , Japan , Thailand , New Zealand , and Taiwan . There were also two presentations on multilingual issues . <p> The Working Group would like to work toward publishing the papers for these presentations in a special issue of a journal . However , so far not enough written papers have been received . The chairs will work toward uploading the presentations to the group 's Web page . <p> Shigeo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the International Workshop on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications , held at the 8th International Conference on Asian Digital Libraries , 12-15 December 2005 , Bangkok , Thailand . The Asian Institute of Technology , Thailand and University of Tsukuba , Japan sponsored this in cooperation with the DCMI . The workshop collected 60 participants from about 10 countries and regions . <p> This Working Group is primarily a forum for individuals and organizations from international communities to share information and knowledge gained from experiences in their local or domain-specific applications of Dublin Core , especially where English is not the primary language <p> Using the Working Group 's mailing list as a platform for information exchange in order to give the heterogeneous group of subscribers ( from libraries , museums , archives , etc. ) the chance to present their different needs , challenges and approaches , and to benefit from the experiences of other domains . <p> Creating a task group for the purpose of developing a recommendation to DCMI on the interpretation , application , and possible extension of the element set described in the final report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , digital object preservation types ) . <p> Activity within the Registry Working Group has focused on exchange of information and experience amongst the various registry initiatives identified at DC-2005 . The NSDL Registry project has established a Registry blog and a project wiki , providing additional channels for communication . <p> Both the NSDL Registry project and the JISC IE Schema Registry project have been working on developing scenarios and use cases to cover the various requirements of registry stakeholders . The JISC registry scenarios will be made available so there is potential for some work across these projects on analysis of requirements . <p> Members of the Woking Group met in January 2006 at the British Library with representatives of The European Library ( TEL ) service , a collaboration between European national libraries supported by the European Commission . Discussions have centred on possibilities for setting up a more structured metadata registry to disclose the TEL Application profile , and in the longer term to register relevant crosswalks . <p> Rachel Heery , the Working Group 's chair phoned into the eXtended Metadata Registry ( XMDR ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overview of registry activity related to Dublin Core and to consider possible interaction between the groups . The XMDR project is helping to develop Edition 3 of ISO 11179 Parts 2 &amp; 3 . Collaboration was discussed around sharing of use cases and registry content ( metadata schemas ) which might be registered in the XMDR prototype . This collaboration can be taken forward now registry projects have moved forward on their use cases . <p> A call has been sent out for contributions to guidelines for national standardization . Up to now a single contribution from one country was received and more are needed . The chair will follow up on the call to try to get the needed contributions . <p> The list of tools on the DCMI Web is being updated . It is generated from a database to make maintenance easier . The structure of the database and Web site are still under discussion in the group , because this is an experimental implementation of metadata used for the description of tools http : //dublincore.org/tools/ . <p> Several members of the Working Group met in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for software , tools and algorithms . Results were discussed with some members informally at a workshop held in Osnabrnck on 24 November 2005 . <p> A proposal for a Workshop on " Metadata Tools for Digital Resource Repositories " , submitted by the chairs of the DCMI Tools Working Group , has been accepted for the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries ( JCDL ) . The workshop will include presentations by selected tool developers , an exhibition by application developers via a current open call , and a breakout session to discuss needs of tool developers and users . JCDL will be held in Chapel Hill ( NC , USA ) , 11-15 June 2006 . ( See : http : **27;3459;TOOLONG for links to workshop information ) . <p> Publication on the DCMI Tools Working Group list of a first version of the DCMI Tools Application Profile and a report on its implementation is planned for June 2006 . <p> This Working Group was deactivated at the DCMI Advisory Board meeting in September 2005 . The editors ( Mary Woodley of California State University Northridge , Diane Hillmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oregon Libraries ) of the documentation that was produced under the group 's charter ( Using Dublin Core , the DCMI Glossary and the DCMI Bibliography ) will work with Tom Baker , the DCMI Director of Specifications and Documentation , to maintain and further develop this set of documents . <p> There has been no activity in the joint ODRL/DCMI Profile Working Group during this period . No messages have been sent to the mailing list and no documents have been produced . As a result of this lack of progress , the Working Group chairs ( Renato Iannella and Andy Powell ) propose to revise the aim of the Working Group . The intention is that a document will be produced that describes how to link from DCMI metadata descriptions to ODRL DRM expressions . When finalised , this document should become a DCMI Recommended Resource . <p> The document above will be authored by Andy Powell ( Eduserv Foundation ) . A first draft will be produced during March 2006 . <h> The DCMI Conferences <p> DC-2005 , held from 12 through 15 September 2005 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 countries .

@@100424528 @4624528/ <h> Using Metadata Standards to Improve IMF and National Data <p> Nalini Umashankar <h> Abstract <p> This poster illustrates how metadata standardization in the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) leads to an improvement in the quality of statistical information and a better understanding of data and metadata by users . It enables a more efficient and faster exchange of information at lower costs , which is made possible as a result of collaboration with member countries and other international organizations . Metadata standardization leads to greater efficiencies and lower costs in global exchange and internal production of data . Use of metadata standards enhances the accountability of countries for providing quality information about their economy and improves the understanding of data by users . The IMF experience , as outlined in this abstract , demonstrates how metadata standards have resulted in faster , cheaper and more consistent production and dissemination of data .

Have a way to refer to an encoding scheme that uses what in ISO 8601 is called the " basic format " for date and time , i.e. YYYYMMDD etc. without hyphens . W3CDTF uses the " extended format " , i.e. YYYY-MM-DD etc. with hyphens. 2 . Have a mechanism to accommodate the other types of dates we talked about , most of which are not in ISO 8601 . These include : approximate dates questionable dates open ended date ranges BCE dates Non-Gregorian dates and maybe also : Quarter Season ( the latter 2 have been expressed as needed in Z39.50 several years ago ) .

I am trying to get a copy of the new version from NISO-- as we know ISO does n't make these freely available . To my knowledge those expressions of date still are n't accommodated . So there would need to be an extension or revision to 8601 rather than a profile to get #2 . If DCMI were to register all of ISO8601 then I guess I would have #1 available , although it still would n't be explicit that what I 'm using is the basic notation in ISO8601 , which was my point all along . And I 'm told that registering ISO8601 basic was rejected so I 'll have to live with it . I do n't have the energy to fight this one any more . I 'm thinking about doing the extensions within NISO to attempt to get ISO 8601 revised to include these . Emphasize the word " thinking " .

It reuses the complexType dc:SimpleLiteral , imported from the dc.xsd schema , which permits simple element content , and makes the xml:lang attribute available . This complexType permits the derivation of other complexTypes which would permit child elements . XML elements corresponding to DC elements are declared as substitutable for the abstract element dc:any , and XML elements corresponding to DC element refinements are defined as substitutable for the base elements which they refine . This means that the default type for all XML elements ( i.e. corresponding to all DC elements and element refinements ) is dc:SimpleLiteral . Encoding schemes are defined as complexTypes which are restrictions of the dc:SimpleLiteral complexType . These complexTypes restrict values to an appropriates syntax or format using data typing , regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these encodings an xsi:type attribute must be used in the instance document . Also , note that one shortcoming of this approach is that any type can be applied to any of the elements or refinements . There is no convenient way to restrict types to specific elements using this approach . Changes in 2008-02-11 version : Add element declarations corresponding to 15 new dcterms URIs , and amend use of substitutionGroups . Add compexType definitions corresponding to ISO639-3 , RFC4646 . This group is included as a convenience for schema authors who need to refer to all the DC elements and element refinements in the http : **27;3488;TOOLONG and http : //purl.org/dc/terms namespaces .

Research has mainly focused its attention on the library community and aggregated content projects . This article concentrates on the specificity of metadata quality within the museum sector , and describes the possibilities of data-profiling techniques regarding metadata quality evaluation , by applying a general-purpose data-profiling tool on a large collection of metadata records of an ethnographic collection . Based on the results of this case study , we propose further steps in our research , and present the implementation of a metadata quality tool within an open-source collection management software .

Tying it into the ISO process automatically locks up the document . My view is that it will give more cons than pros to use this route . <p> The Refinements of the Dublin Core element is a moving target . Also for this a formal standardisation will lock up the document . So for this subject as well the relevant route is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing the process it may then be relevant to give this document a formal status . One way will be to make a description of the process and the registry of refinements of Dublin Core and use this description as the basis for an ISO Technical Report or a CEN Workshop Agreement ( CWA ) in the environment of CEN/ISSS Workshop MMI-DC . Maybe the best route will be a CWA and then if possible an ISO Technical Report . <p> The CEN/ISSS Workshop on MMI-DC has started a project team Application profile guidelines with the objective to define guidelines on Dublin Core Application profiles . <p> The work is concerned to make it an easier and better-defined process to define Application Profiles for use of the Dublin Core with specific projects or in specific application domains .

This work needs to be done in conjunction with other work of the MMI-DC concerned with the development of application profiles for the use of Dublin Core in specific domains . The work contains five elements : <p> Identify existing work on application profiles , developed or under development , that is to be considered ( ensuring inclusion of all major application profiles ) . <p> Obtain experience from this work concerning profiles . This experience to include general observations , issues encountered and remaining problems . All aspects should be covered that might be helpful to designers in establishing application profiles to establish the precise rules for use of metadata in a specific project or application domain . It is also required to consider how to facilitate the use of application profiles once defined , including the standards for interoperation of distinct application profiles . <p> Collate this experience into a set of guidelines aimed at implementers to assist them with defining future application profiles and in applying these profiles . <p> Provide a semi-formal specification of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make recommendations on how to establish a machine readable/interpretable form for application profiles . <p> The production of a specification of a **30;3517;TOOLONG form for application profiles is not an expected part of this project . <p> This work was started last month and the result will be a CWA in a year .

See http : //purl.org/dc for more information on Dublin Core . Many tags may be repeated at this level , and also allow multiple occurences of their subelments . The intended usage is that distinct items ( for example distinct creators ) should be expressed with separate elements , while alternative forms of reference to the same item ( for example , several ways of referring to the same creator ) should be expressed as alternate subelements. &lt;/description&gt; &lt;group order= " seq " &gt; &lt;element type= " title " minOccurs= " 0 " maxOccurs= " * " /&gt; &lt;element type= " creator " minOccurs= " 0 " maxOccurs= " * " /&gt; &lt;element type= " subject " minOccurs= " 0 " maxOccurs= " * " /&gt; &lt;element type= " description " minOccurs= " 0 " maxOccurs= " * " /&gt; &lt;element type= " publisher " minOccurs= " 0 " maxOccurs= " * " /&gt; &lt;element type= " contributor " minOccurs= " 0 " maxOccurs= " * " /&gt; &lt;element type= " identifier " minOccurs= " 0 " maxOccurs= " * " /&gt; &lt;element type= " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /&gt; &lt;element type= " language " minOccurs= " 0 " maxOccurs= " * " /&gt; &lt;element type= " rights " minOccurs= " 0 " maxOccurs= " * " /&gt; &lt;/group&gt; &lt;/ElementType&gt; &lt;/Schema&gt; <p> How to Use the Schema Crucial to understanding how this is used is to first understand the role of the several URI-based references , such as personReference , subjectReference and resourceReference . These occur within elements whose content model is very flexible in Dublin Core . For example , in DC the creator element may have free text or it may have a reference to a specific company or individual via some well-known identification system . Controlled sets of names , for example D-U-N-S numbers , make excellent identifiers . We pair these with the Universal Resource Identifier specification , and propose that companies and organizations that control identifiers should name their identifier sets with URIs , thereby allowing us to use the datatype ' URI ' wherever a controlled identifier is needed . <p> For example , supposing that Dun and Bradstreet gave a URI beginning with ' urn:www-dnb-com/dunsno ' to every number they issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Generic Dublin Core Element Set This defines each of the fifteen elements in a completely unconstrained fashion .

Interoperability and openness have been guiding principles of the DCMI community for over twenty years , and these principles have evolved through the development of Semantic Web standards and Linked Open Data . A deluge of new data sources is magnifying the perennial challenge of metadata quality but also inspiring the development of innovative tools , practices , and solutions , the focus of this year 's conference . <p> In conjunction with each conference , the DCMI community holds an Annual Meeting at which DCMI citizens discuss ongoing work in areas such as vocabulary management , website design , and RDF validation . Together , the Conference and Annual Meeting provide opportunities for seasoned professionals , newcomers , students , apprentices , and early career professionals to share knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public- and private-sector initiatives to network and compare notes . Following the pattern of last year 's conference in Copenhagen , DC-2017 will overlap with the -- annual meeting of ASIS&amp;T -+ , providing additional opportunities for professional interaction . <p> These gatherings advance DCMI 's mission of promoting the interoperability and harmonization of metadata , from element schemas and Semantic Web vocabularies to application profiles , ontologies , and knowledge organization systems . <p> Beyond the focus of the conference theme , submission of papers , reports , presentations and poster are welcome in the following broad categories of metadata design , deployment and best practices : <p> Workshops engage participants in active work to address one or more well-defined problems or issues .

@@100424559 @4624559/ <p> The DC-Education Working Group ( WG ) met in a breakout session on Monday 22 October 2001 during the DC Workshop in Tokyo to review work accomplished to date and to chart the 2001-2002 work agenda . A PowerPoint presentation with a proposed Working Group agenda was used to guide the discussion during the breakout session . After a brief review of the history of the WG by the co-chairs , the participants were briefed on the formal recommendations for education-specific elements and element qualifiers that the Usage Board ( UB ) issued at its meeting at OCLC in May in Dublin , Ohio including : ( 1 ) an ? Audience ? element , ( 2 ) a ? Mediator ? qualifier for the ? Audience ? element , and ( 3 ) a ? Conforms To ? qualifier for the ? Relation ? element . All three of these recommendations now officially exist in the DCMI ? terms ? namespace . Work is underway to update documentation at the DCMI web site . <p> The WG then discussed the status of the DCMI/IEEE LOM Memorandum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from DCMI , IEEE LTSC , IMS , EdNA ( Education Network Australia ) , and GEM ( Gateway to Educational Materials ) in Ottawa where plans were set out to operationalize the intent of the MoU . The participants in Ottawa issued a document titled the ? Ottawa CommuniquT ? that sets out a work agenda. 2 The co-chairs reported further that work was well underway on a metadata manifesto that sets out the mutual understandings of IEEE LTSC and DCMI with regard to modular , interoperable metadata and that a formal document embodying those understandings was nearing completion . Additional information can be found in the PowerPoint presentation in cells 9-11 . <p> The co-chairs reported that over the course of the past year , WG listserv discussions had reached a consensus regarding an additional qualifier for the ?

Alternatively , a more specific statement of the location of the audience in terms of its progression through an education or training sector. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sent to the UB pursuant to its procedures . <p> The WG then discussed the status of its work on an education specific resource type vocabulary . Work on the vocabulary had been suspended in light of the discussions in the Type WG with regard to a possible DCT2 vocabulary . It was thought that any work in the Education WG should be compatible with any architecture defined by the Type WG . Subsequent to the Education breakout session , it was learned that the Type WG had dropped its intentions to pursue a DCT2 vocabulary and to rely instead on work by domain/practice communities . Thus , the Education work in this regard will be revived . <p> The participants discussed the work done over the past year to determine whether additional ? Audience ? element qualifiers might be justified . It reviewed the draft document summarizing the use of audience descriptors in an array of current projects. 3 The discussion focused on several categories of metadata statements that might suggest the need for an ? Accessibility ? qualifier . Discussion of this possibility will be moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interest group formed to explore the issues of accessibility in the larger context of DCMI-based metadata . <p> There was brief discussion of a very early working draft of statements gleaned from a handful of education-based metadata projects with regard to teaching processes and characteristics. 4 It is the intention of the co-chairs to continue the development of this draft document through discussions on the listserv . The goal is to determine whether an education-specific element to capture such statements might be justified . Such a determination can not be had without additional input into the working document and further discussion over the course of the coming year . <p> The WG decided that there was a need for discussion this coming year regarding the need to capture metadata statements dealing with learning objectives that are local or intrinsic to a resource . In the ? conformsTo ? recommendation issued by the UB , it is possible to reference external **31;3905;TOOLONG to which a resource may be correlated .

The background for this issue is that documentation of any ( and all ) changes to the original fifteen elements needs to be done on a priority basis in order to prepare for a potential NISO review later this year . Andrew has compared the draft against what was decided last year in Madrid 3 . Aside from polishing the text explaining the changes in the above , an announcement giving overall context for the comment period on dc-general needs to be finalized , see first draft at 2 ( maybe move this draft into the Wiki ) . As of 2006-03-30 , the proposed changes need to be justified . Each individual term needs to have a justification for the change proposed , even if this is just cut-and-paste from another term . Several sections marked ( @#@@#@TODO ) need to be filled in . An announcement giving overall context for the comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content of the resource " ) needs to be finalized . ACTION 2006-03-16 Andrew : Wordsmith justifications for the proposed changes , also on a per-element basis ( sections marked " @#@@TODO " ) , with particular attention to " content of the resource " . ACTION 2006-03-16 Andrew : Suggest a comment for dc:language along these lines ( " Use an encoding scheme ... " ) and post to dc-usage for discussion . ( This was done on 2006-03-28 and the proposed comment text has been integrated into 1 ) . In February 2006 , discussion on the DC-Government and DC-Corporate lists suggested that DCMI re-think its approach to 2- and 3-letter language codes . In effect , the change in wording proposed in 1 ( recommending that one follow RFC 3066 in using 2-letter codes when available ) is at odds with the preference of many implementers for 3-letter codes . While this issue may require special attention on the list , the consensus was to try to keep this as part of the current batch of changes . Diane suggested that the crux of the issue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recommend one or the other ? One way to handle this problem is to generalize the comment . From an interoperability point of view , the crucial point is that whichever way an implementer does it , an encoding scheme should be used .

See the Dublin Core Home Page ( http : //dublincore.org ) for further information about the workshops , reports , working group papers , projects , and new developments concerning the Dublin Core Metadata Element set . <p> The current list of elements and their general definitions were finalized in December 1996 . The elements and their names are not expected to change substantively from this list , though the application of some of them is currently experimental and subject to varying interpretation from implementation to implementation . <p> Note that elements have a descriptive name intended to convey a common semantic understanding of the element . To promote global interoperability , a number of the element descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element values . It is assumed that other controlled vocabularies will be developed for interoperability within certain local domains . In the element descriptions below , a formal single-word label ( expressed in all upper case ) is specified to make the syntactic specification of elements simpler for encoding schemes . Each element is optional and repeatable . <h> Element Descriptions <p> TitleLabel : TitleThe name given to the resource , usually by the Creator or Publisher . <p> Author or CreatorLabel : CreatorThe person or organization primarily responsible for creating the intellectual content of the resource . For example , authors in the case of written documents , artists , photographers , or illustrators in the case of visual resources . <p> Subject and KeywordsLabel : SubjectThe topic of the resource . Typically , subject will be expressed as keywords or phrases that describe the subject or content of the resource . The use of controlled vocabularies and formal classification schemas is encouraged . <p> DescriptionLabel : DescriptionA textual description of the content of the resource , including abstracts in the case of document-like objects or content descriptions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entity responsible for making the resource available in its present form , such as a publishing house , a university department , or a corporate entity . <p> Other ContributorLabel : ContributorA person or organization not specified in a Creator element who has made significant intellectual contributions to the resource but whose contribution is secondary to any person or organization specified in a Creator element ( for example , editor , transcriber , and illustrator ) . <p> DateLabel : Date A date associated with the creation or availability of the resource . Recommended best practice is defined in a profile of ISO 8601 ( http : **29;3938;TOOLONG ) that includes ( among others ) dates of the forms YYYY and YYYY-MM-DD . In this scheme , the date 1994-11-05 corresponds to November 5 , 1994 . <p> Resource TypeLabel : TypeThe category of the resource , such as home page , novel , poem , working paper , technical report , essay , dictionary . For the sake of interoperability , Type should be selected from an enumerated list that is under development in the workshop series . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. , size , duration ) of the resource . The format is used to identify the software and possibly hardware that might be needed to display or operate the resource . For the sake of interoperability , the format should be selected from an enumerated list that is currently under development in the workshop series . <p> Resource IdentifierLabel : IdentifierA string or number used to uniquely identify the resource . Examples for networked resources include URLs and URNs ( when implemented ) . Other globally-unique identifiers , such as International Standard Book Numbers ( ISBN ) or other formal names would also be candidates for this element . <p> SourceLabel : SourceInformation about a second resource from which the present resource is derived . While it is generally recommended that elements contain information about the present resource only , this element may contain metadata for the second resource when it is considered important for discovery of the present resource . <p> LanguageLabel : Language The language of the intellectual content of the resource . Recommended best practice is defined in RFC 1766 <p> RelationLabel : RelationAn identifier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource . This element is used to express linkages among related resources . For the sake of interoperability , relationships should be selected from an enumerated list that is currently under development in the workshop series . <p> CoverageLabel : CoverageThe spatial and/or temporal characteristics of the intellectual content of the resource . Spatial coverage refers to a physical region ( e.g. , celestial sector ) using place names or coordinates ( e.g. , longitude and latitude ) . Temporal coverage refers to what the resource is about rather than when it was created or made available ( the latter belonging in the Date element ) . Temporal coverage is typically specified using named time periods ( e.g. , Neolithic ) or the same date/time format ( http : **29;3969;TOOLONG ) as recommended for the Date element . <p> Rights ManagementLabel : RightsA rights management statement , an identifier that links to a rights management statement , or an identifier that links to a service providing information about rights management for the resource .

Includes : a ) browsing by topic and competency , b ) ability to save a set of learning resources with a named set- not sure if this can be tied to a user account or whether they will all be publicly accessible , c ) the ability to create learning trajectories or transit maps , defining a sequence of learning resources that an instructor would use in class as part of their curriculum . Have rudimentary wireframes for these features , will refine those as first step , then will work with Abi to modify custom plugins and determine what additional work will be needed for the trajectories . Joseph is moving the latest update on topical and competency index into the triple store this weekend , and will import into WordPress when complete . Sean will need to update learning resource metadata when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with content partners to develop content for gaps identified in CI . Sam has met with his team to discuss areas for contribution , others are still in progress . Would be good to get these in by end of June so they are available during the user testing that will happen over the summer/fall , but can continue working on them until the end of the summer . Mike C will set up a meeting with content partners after iConference to get them talking to each other . <p> Editorial Board : <p> Tom , Mike , Joseph and Stuart met re a method for collecting suggestions for competencies , and settled on simple method to do this- use Google doc as collector method , automatic method for generating a Word doc that can be uploaded to Google when updates are made . Source used to generate Word doc is plain text , so can review in side by side diff in Github . Will be sufficient to show changes so can make changes manually in ASN editor . Might want to announce new versions over Twitter at major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuart to send out updates at appropriate times . <p> Editorial board met last week , scheduled five more calls between now and end of June to finalize competency index , with the goal of publishing in ASN at that time . Reviewed CI as a whole , to find where holes are and need to be filled based on Sean 's gap analysis . Areas being considered for update include : a ) non-RDF linked data ( will engage with Margie to discuss her ideas around this ) , b ) five stars linked data requirements , c ) SKOS , d ) mapping and predicates , e ) basics on issues involved in versioning and provenance , f ) Ruby and Python to work with linked data , g ) cleaning , refining and enriching data . Will also meet in fall to add and change , but probably not over summer . <p> Marketing and Community Building : <p> Mike L encouraged blog contributions at any time , may be something that the content partners could contribute to .

@@100424578 @4624578/ <h> Glossary/Record Paradigm and Graph Paradigm <h> From DCMIMediaWiki <p> The XML tree mindset and the Resource Description Framework ( RDF ) graph mindset were present in the DC community almost from the start , causing the confusion and talking-past-each-other that still persists today . <p> At the first workshop in 1995 , the task was seen as that of defining " elements " for " records " -- basically , the XML mindset . By saying that all elements were " optional and repeatable " , a message was reinforced that the Dublin Core provided a " functional " vocabulary -- i.e. , a set of terms intended to be used together to describe things of a certain type . <p> By the latest in 1999-2000 , when the first set of " qualifiers " was prepared , it was clear that the resulting vocabulary lacked the functional coherence of the DC-15 . By then , the notion that DCMI metadata terms were a " vocabulary " was in ascendance . That 's also precisely when the notion of the application profile ( AP ) was put forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of terms which could be used selectively , together with terms from other sources , themselves used selectively , to address specific requirements . The notion , then , that further uncontrolled expansion could make the DCMI metadata terms , as a whole , even more spotty , ad-hoc , amorphous , and unmaintainable , led in 2001 to the establishment of the DCMI Usage Board . <p> In the meantime , the XML-mindset notion that DCMI metadata terms -- qualifiers included -- constituted a functional vocabulary , lived on in the notion that the entire term set should form the basis of a " qualfied Dublin Core " format . <p> It was clear that people needed more precise , specialized descriptions , but it was also clear that trying to specialize in all directions at once would lead to an unmaintainable muddle . Hence the emphasis on APs . <p> XML defines purely syntactic elements . There is no general semantic interpretation for XML elements -- each XML schema defines its own tree structure . Attributes in XML , as far as can be seen , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package together at that point . There may exist an out-of-band specification ( e.g. , in a separate PDF or HTML document ) to explain to humans what the information means , and one can use that specification to design applications that do meaningful things with the information , but the parser is just traversing the ad-hoc tree format assigning values to placeholders . <p> RDF , in contrast , uses terms with underlying grammatical categories in the context of meaningful statements -- categories that are recognizably similar to the nouns and verbs of natural language . RDF is a general-purpose language , designed by humans for use by humans and machines . <p> The problem is that we are in the middle of a sudden ( 20-year ? ) shift from a predominantly print world to a predominantly digital world . It is not scalable ( in the present ) or preservable ( for the future ) to invent new languages , such as XML formats , for every application in the absence of an RDF interpretation -- RDF being the only general-purpose grammar of data , with traction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this transformation also virtually guarantees that any applications and user-facing interfaces we use today will at some point , probably soon , be superseded . Data that can not " speak for itself " is vulnerable to becoming irrelevant . <p> Not only are applications increasingly expected to be " linkable " ( in the present ) , but we hope they will be interpretable ( in the future ) . Not that anyone needs to abandon XML , but arguably , to continue pouring culturally important information into ad-hoc data formats -- in the absence of well-defined interpretations as triples -- is like making statements without grammar , and creating data without URIs is like saying things without proper footnotes citing sources . Cultural memory institutions should live by the scholarly ethos , by which things like grammar and footnotes are essential , and the language of triples represents the application of that ethos to data itself .

In order to repeat an earlier study , to apply data from an earlier study to a new model , we need to be able to precisely identify the very subset of data used . While verbal descriptions of how the subset was created ( e.g. by providing selected attribute ranges and time intervals ) are hardly precise enough and do not support automated handling , keeping redundant copies of the data in question does not scale up to the big data settings encountered in many disciplines today . Furthermore , we need to be able to handle situations where new data gets added or existing data gets corrected or otherwise modified over time . Conventional approaches , such as assigning persistent identifiers to entire data sets or individual subsets or data items , are thus not sufficient . <p> In this webinar we will review the challenges identified above and discuss solutions that are currently elaborated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Data Alliance ( RDA ) on Data Citation : Making Dynamic Data Citeable .

This webinar offers a short critical introduction to Linked Data by positioning this approach within the global evolution of data modeling , allowing an understanding of the advantages but also of the limits of RDF . After this conceptual introduction , the fundamental importance of data quality in the context of Linked Data is underlined by applying data profiling techniques with the help of OpenRefine . Methods and tools for metadata reconciliation and enrichment , such as Named-Entity Recognition ( NER ) , are illustrated with the help of the same software . This webinar will refer to case-studies with real-life data which can be re-used by participants to continue to explore OpenRefine at their own pace after the webinar . The case-studies have been developed in the context of the handbook " Linked Data for Libraries , Archives and Museums " , which will be published by Facet Publishing in June 2014 . <p> Ruben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " iMinds , Belgium , where he obtained his PhD in computer science in 2014 .

And in that specification I need to provide a URI for an encoding scheme to support the representation of " open ended " date ranges . It does n't have to be a DCMI-owned URI , but I need a description of a date format , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DCMI Abstract Model ( as a class or as a datatype ) . So , given that this is beyond what is in W3CDTF ( for which DCMI provides the class with the URI http : **26;4000;TOOLONG ) and ISO8601 ( and DCMI currently provides no URI for the class of things represented by ISO8601 anyway ) , it seems to me I/we ( DC CD WG ) have little option but to create our own specification for that format .

@@100424595 @4624595/ <p> These guidelines specify the structure and content of Dublin Core Application Profiles , a form for documenting which terms a given application uses in its metadata , with what extensions or adaptations , and specifying how those terms relate both to formal standards such as Dublin Core as well as to less formally defined element sets and vocabularies . The document on which this is based was originally developed in the context of the CEN/ISSS Workshop on Metadata for Multimedia Information - Dublin Core ( WS/MMI-DC ) of CEN , the European Committee for Standardization and was published in 2003 as the CEN Working Agreement CWA 14855 . <p> The text of this version is substantially identical ( minus introductory text related to CEN procedure and a table of contents ) to the text of CWA 14855 , from which future revisions will increasingly diverge . <h> Introduction <p> A Dublin Core Application Profile ( DCAP ) is a declaration specifying which metadata terms an organization , information provider , or user community uses in its metadata . By definition , a DCAP identifies the source of metadata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards such as Dublin Core , in less formally defined element sets and vocabularies , or by the creator of the DCAP itself for local use in an application . Optionally , a DCAP may provide additional documentation on how the terms are constrained , encoded , or interpreted for application-specific purposes . <p> A DCAP is designed to promote interoperability within the constraints of the Dublin Core model and to encourage harmonization of usage and convergence on " emerging semantics " around its edges . Historically , application profiles have emerged out of a need to share local domain- or application-specific refinements of or extensions to Dublin Core within particular application communities without necessarily seeking an extension of the core standard maintained by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative ( DCMI ) . Application profiles document how implementers use elements from Dublin Core along with elements from other vocabularies , customizing standard definitions and usage guidelines for local requirements HEERY . <p> In practice , application profiles are created for a wide range of purposes : to document the semantics and constraints used for a set of metadata records ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementers harmonize metadata practice among themselves ; to identify emerging semantics as possible candidates for formal standardization ; as guides for semantic crosswalks and format conversions ; as specifications for formal encoding structures such as Document Type Definitions ( DTDs ) ; for interpreting or presenting legacy or proprietary metadata in terms of widely-understood standards ; or for documenting the rules and criteria according to which a set of metadata was created . Application profiles often represent " work in progress " , providing foci for ongoing efforts to incrementally improve and clarify a body of shared metadata semantics within a particular user community . <p> In the absence of guidelines , creators of application profiles have hitherto invented a wide range of presentation formats . The present document distils the salient features of many existing profiles into a format that is as concise and simple as possible , yet as precise and detailed as is sometimes necessary to support the various uses identified above . <p> Semantic interoperability the ultimate purpose of documents such as DCAPs is a longer-term goal to be pursued as metadata vocabularies and related enabling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DCAPs are designed to document metadata usage in a normalized form that will lend itself to translation into common models , such as RDF , that can be processed by machines to automate such interoperability . <p> Machine-understandable representations will achieve this goal to the extent that metadata terms can be referenced using stable , well-documented identifiers . As discussed below , the practice of identifying metadata terms with Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URIs ) is currently gaining momentum . Maintaining a DCAP over time , then , may involve improving its precision incrementally by identifying its terms with URIs as the URIs become available ; this is referred to here as the Principle of Appropriate Identification . <p> In the meantime , these guidelines aim at the more modest aim of providing system developers and information specialists with a normalized and readable view of Dublin-Core-based metadata models . A DCAP should include enough information to be of optimal usefulness for its intended audience a Principle of Readability even if this entails the redundant inclusion of information , which , in a formal system of machine-processable schemas , might otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexibility of presentation required by the Principle of Readability , no assumption is made that DCAPs will be convertible into future machine-understandable forms without the use of ad-hoc heuristics or manual intervention . Creators of DCAPs should bear in mind that a normalized form of documentation can not itself address the deeper problems of interoperability in a world with a diversity of underlying metadata models problems which will continue to challenge the metadata community as a whole , and the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative in particular , for the foreseeable future . <p> The present document gives guidance on how information should be structured and presented in Dublin Core Application Profiles . Principles and concepts underlying DCAPs as declarative metadata constructs are defined and explained . <p> The guidelines do not mandate a particular document format for DCAPs . DCAPs may be presented as plain text files or as Web pages , word-processing files , PowerPoint , or indeed as ink on paper . By providing a consistent presentation structure for such documents , these guidelines aim at making it easier for people to understand what others are doing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that DCAPs will be convertible as straightforwardly as possible into expressions that use schema languages , such as RDF , for automatic processing by machines . In this sense , a normalized documentational form for DCAPs is a first step towards the more ambitious and long-term goal of automating semantic interoperability across a broad diversity of information sources . <h> 2 Definitions <p> Dublin Core Application Profile ( DCAP ) : A DCAP is a declaration specifying which metadata terms an organization , information provider , or user community uses in its metadata and how those terms have been customized or adapted to a particular application . By definition , a DCAP is based in part on Dublin Core and follows DCMI Grammatical Principles DCMI-PRINCIPLES . A DCAP consists of a Descriptive Header and one or more Term Usages . <p> DCMI Grammatical Principles : As maintained by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative , DCMI grammatical principles specify a typology of metadata terms Elements , Element Refinements , Encoding Schemes , and Vocabulary Terms along with their interrelationships and functions DCMI-PRINCIPLES . A DCAP is based on the simple model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is consistent with DCMI grammatical principles , which do not themselves specify more elaborate models . <p> Descriptive Header : A Descriptive Header places the DCAP into an interpretive context by specifying , at a minimum , a Title , Creator , Date , Identifier , and Description for the DCAP . An optional Preamble may comment on any technical or stylistic conventions followed in the DCAP . <p> Term Usage : A Term Usage is a description of a metadata term , which , at a minimum , identifies a metadata term in accordance with the Principle of Appropriate Identification by using one or more identifying attributes Term URI , Defined By , Name , Label as described in Section 3 . Optionally , a Term Usage may also describe or annotate a term in more detail by providing additional definitional attributes , relational attributes , or constraints , as described in Section 4 . <p> Principle of Appropriate Identification : The Principle of Appropriate Identification dictates that metadata terms be identified as precisely as possible . As established in the so-called CORES Resolution of December 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cite its Uniform Resource Identifier ( URI ) . All DCMI metadata terms are identified with URIs , and URIs are currently being assigned to the terms of other major semantic standards such as MARC21 and IEEE/LOM CORES-RESOLUTION . Whenever such URIs are available they should be cited as an attribute of a Term Usage ( its " Term URI " ) . Terms to which URIs have not ( or not yet ) been assigned should be identified using other attributes as appropriate , as described in Section 3 . <p> Principle of Readability : The Principle of Readability dictates that a DCAP should include enough information in Term Usages to be of optimal usefulness for the intended audience of the DCAP even if this entails the redundant inclusion of information which , in a formal system of machine-processable schemas , might otherwise be fetched dynamically from external sources . Conversely , the Principle of Readability allows unused attributes simply to be omitted from display . <h> 3 Identifying terms with appropriate precision <p> Application profiles serve to clarify who is declaring and maintaining the metadata semantics that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a metadata term used in a Term Usage can be identified with appropriate precision ( the Principle of Appropriate Identification ) . <p> At present , the preferred method for identifying a metadata term is to cite its Uniform Resource Identifier ( URI ) if such is available . A URI is " a compact string of characters for identifying an abstract or physical resource " constructed according to a generic and flexible syntax URI . The World Wide Web Consortium has promoted the notion that " All important resources should be identified by a URI " WEBARCH and has specifically promoted the use of URIs for identifying metadata elements . In the CORES Resolution of December 2002 , the maintainers of seven leading metadata standards Dublin Core , IEEE/LOM , DOI , CERIF , MARC21 , ONIX , and GILS -- pledged to assign URIs to their elements and to articulate policies for the persistence of those URIs CORES-RESOLUTION . ( Note that a URI , when used to identify a metadata term , often functions as a Web address for accessing information about that term , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CORES Resolution does not require that such identifiers resolve to such resources , and URIs that result in " file not found " messages are not necessarily " broken " as identifiers . ) <p> For metadata terms to which a URI has been officially assigned for example , by DCMI or by another signatory of the CORES Resolution that URI should be cited in the field " Term URI " . For example , the Dublin Core element " Audience " should be cited as " http : **28;4089;TOOLONG " . As this form of identification is precise and sufficient on its own , other identifying fields may be left blank : <p> In accordance with the Principle of Readability , other identifying attributes such as Name and Label could be added here to make the DCAP more " reader-friendly " . If the DCAP is intended as a guide for processing metadata records , it may indeed be necessary to provide a Name ( i.e. , the string actually used in the metadata records ) . If the Name or Label of a term are considered more " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Term URI , the order of these attributes may be changed to put these first . See Sections 5.4 ( " Attributes copied from external sources " ) and 5.2 ( " Readability of Term Usages " ) for further discussion . <p> A term that has been declared or documented somewhere but not assigned a URI ( as far as one knows ) should be identified as precisely as possible by providing its name and pointing to a declarative document or schema in which it has been defined . The declarative document or schema should be cited with URI , Web address , or bibliographic reference in the field " Defined By " . The term itself can be cited using either a string identifier or token ( in the field " Name " , which by default is assumed to be case-sensitive ) or a natural-language label ( in the field " Label " ) , or both , taken from the declarative document or schema : <p> Term URI <p> - <p> Name <p> AttendancePattern <p> Label <p> Attendance Pattern <p> Defined By <p> http : **34;4119;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any other declarative document , the field Defined By should simply cite the URI of the DCAP itself ( as assigned with Identifier in the DCAP Descriptive Header ) . For example , in a DCAP with the URI " http : **29;4155;TOOLONG " , a new local term called Star Ratings could be defined as follows : <p> Term URI <p> - <p> Name <p> StarRatings <p> Label <p> Star Ratings <p> Defined By <p> http : **29;4186;TOOLONG <p> A creator of a DCAP wishing to declare locally coined terms in a way that makes them citable with precision , and thus re-usable by others , may undertake the additional step of assigning them URIs . At present , the technical conventions and " Web etiquette " for naming metadata terms with URIs have yet to establish themselves in common practice , though at a minimum it seems both polite and sensible not to promote new URIs unless it is expected they will be maintained . For the purposes of DCAPs , DCMI itself provides models of practice , and further options are likely to emerge as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note that the CORES Resolution itself addresses the use of URIs as identifiers only and is silent on whether the URIs should resolve to informational Web pages or schemas CORES-RESOLUTION. <h> 4 Attributes of a Term Usage <p> Attributes for describing the metadata terms " used " in a DCAP are listed below . Note that they are called " attributes " here simply to avoid confusingly recursive formulations such as " terms for describing terms " . <p> Use of Identifying Attributes in Term Usages ( see Section 4.1 ) is governed by the Principle of Appropriate Identification . According to this principle , a Term Usage should use one or more of the four Identifying Attributes to identify a term as precisely as appropriate i.e. , with a formally assigned URI if available , or alternatively by citing a name or label for the term along with a reference to a document , schema , or Web page in which that term is defined . <p> All of the other attributes of Term Usages are optional and should be used as local needs may dictate . As discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " attributes may be distinguished as necessary . <h> 4.1 Identifying attributes <p> Term URI <p> A Uniform Resource Identifier used to identify the term . <p> Name <p> A unique token assigned to the term . <p> Label <p> A human-readable label assigned to the term . <p> Defined By <p> An identifier of a namespace , pointer to a schema , or bibliographic reference for a document within which the term is defined . <h> 4.2 Definitional attributes <p> Definition <p> A statement that represents the concept and essential nature of the term . <p> Comments <p> Additional information about the term or its application . <p> Type of term <p> A grammatical category of the term ( e.g. , " Element " , " Element Refinement " , or " Encoding Scheme " ) . <h> 4.3 Relational attributes <p> Refines <p> The described term semantically refines the referenced term . <p> Refined By <p> The described term is semantically refined by the referenced term . <p> Encoding Scheme For <p> The described term , an Encoding Scheme , qualifies the referenced term . <p> Has Encoding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Encoding Scheme . <p> Similar To <p> The described term has a meaning the same as , or similar to , that of the referenced term . <h> 4.4 Constraints <p> Obligation <p> Indicates whether the element is required to always or sometimes be present ( i.e. , contain a value ) . Examples include " Mandatory " , " Conditional " , and " Optional " . ) <p> Condition <p> Describes the condition or conditions according to which a value shall be present . <p> Datatype <p> Indicates the type of data that can be represented in the value of the element . <p> Occurrence <p> Indicates any limit to the repeatability of the element . <h> 5 Discussion <h> 5.1 Descriptive Headers <p> By definition , a DCAP consists of a Descriptive Header and one or more Term Usages ( see Section 2 ) . The Description Header should include the following : <p> A brief description of the DCAP based on Dublin Core . At a minimum , the description should specify a Title , Contributor , Date , Identifier , and Description , as explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the DCAP will elaborate on the context in which the DCAP is intended to be used . <p> Optionally , a Preamble for the DCAP should describe any technical or formatting conventions used in the DCAP . For example , if namespace prefixes are used in the Name field ( see Section 5.6 ) , these prefixes should be documented here . The Preamble can also cite Web pages or schemas in which the terms used in the DCAP are documented and defined so that such information does not need to be repeated in the " Defined By " field of each individual Term Usage ; see the example in Section 6.1.1. <h> 5.2 Readability of Term Usages <p> By default , each term cited in a DCAP should be described with its own Term Usage a table with a full set of attributes on the left and attribute values on the right . In accordance with the Principle of Readability , however , the intended use of a DCAP may dictate a different presentational style : while DCAPs intended for use by software developers will need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for human consumption can ( and often should ) be much terser . The following are several ways in which Term Usages may be formatted for readability : <p> Instead of creating a separate Term Usage for every Element Refinement and Encoding Scheme used in an application , such terms may simply be cited in the attributes Refined By or Has Encoding Scheme of the Term Usages of the Elements to which they refer ( see Section 5.3 ) . Note that this terser style does not support the addition of usage notes , local definitions , or annotations , for which a full Term Usage must be used . <p> Attributes not needed for Term Usages can simply be omitted . At one extreme , a Term Usage might legitimately consist of just a Name and a Term URI ; see the example in Section 6.1.2 ) . <p> The order of attributes presented in Section 4 is significant only for the usability of DCAPs as documents not for future machine-processable representations of DCAPs . Authors of DCAPs may therefore change the order of attributes in the interest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such changes may make it more difficult for people to compare two DCAPs visually . For examples of how Name ( in boldface ) is placed before Term URI , see Section 6.1.2 and DCMI-TERMS . <p> In the interest of readability , it might make sense to describe Elements , Element Refinements , and Encoding Schemes with different subsets of relevant attributes . Indeed , these different types of terms might be grouped under separate sections of the DCAP document . ( For example , see how Elements and Element Refinements are separated from Encoding Schemes in the document " DCMI Metadata Terms " DCMI-TERMS . ) <p> In the interest of readability and of future machine-parsability , attributes should be repeated when necessary ( as opposed to listing multiple values for a single attribute ) . <h> 5.3.1 Using Vocabulary Terms <p> According to DCMI Grammatical Principles , a Vocabulary Term is a member of a controlled vocabulary of values , and a controlled vocabulary of values ( as a whole ) is named by an Encoding Scheme DCMI-PRINCIPLES . <p> In general , it is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either in the sense of creating lists of potential values or in the sense of giving that list ( as a whole ) a name and URI . Sets of Vocabulary Terms are most appropriately declared in separately citable documents external to a DCAP . <p> However , if the creator of a DCAP merely wishes to specify a short list of possible values ( e.g. , " Animal , Vegetable , or Mineral " ) , these can be simply listed in a " Comment " field . <h> 5.3.2 Using Encoding Schemes <p> There are three ways to cite Encoding Schemes in a DCAP : <p> The most concise way is to use the attribute Has Encoding Scheme ( or Comment ) for a blanket reference to a set of encoding schemes documented elsewhere . The DCAP for Resource Discovery Network , for example , simply cites " RDN Subject Encoding Schemes " and gives a URL where the list of those encoding schemes may be found ; see the example in Section 6.1.2 . <p> A more precise way is to use the attribute Has Encoding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scheme by its URI ( or by Name and URI ) ; for example , see the example in Section 6.3.2 . <p> In addition to citing Encoding Schemes in the Has Encoding Scheme attribute of Elements , creators of DCAPs may want to describe Encoding Schemes in stand-alone Term Usages in order to annotate their usage , for example by specifying a Datatype , Occurrence , or Local Definition . The attribute Encoding Scheme For points back to the Element or Element Refinement qualified . <h> 5.3.3 Using Element Refinements <p> The options for Element Refinements are analogous to those for Encoding Schemes : <p> Statements such as " all terms in Vocabulary D can be used as element refinements for Contributor " can be simply recorded in a Refined By attribute ( or as a Comment ) . <p> Element Refinements can be cited one-by-one using the attribute Refined By ; see the example in Section 6.3.2 . <p> Element Refinements can additionally be described in separate Term Usages. <h> 5.4 Attributes copied from external sources <p> Ideally , application profiles would be dynamically up-dated with information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this information would be integrated with local annotations into a " one-stop " document for the convenience of users . The use of machine-understandable DCAPs may some day make this possible . <p> In the meantime , however , creators of DCAPs who wish to include definitions or other such information from original source documents in their Term Usages have no choice but to copy that information from the source . While the Principle of Readability specifically permits this , authors of DCAPs should bear in mind that copied information , if not maintained , can go out of alignment with the official source . <p> Where information copied from external sources is supplied , this fact should be reported in the Preamble as described in Section 5.1 . Where it is necessary to distinguish in a DCAP between attributes defined locally and attributes copied from an external source , the DCAP should establish its own document-internal convention , such as distinguishing between a Local Definition and a Source Definition ; see the example in Section 6.3.2. <h> 5.5 Types of Comments <p> Past creators of application profiles for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most popular of which have been Notes , Best Practice , Usage , Scope , Open Questions , Examples , Purpose , Guidelines , and Do n't Confuse With . While the present guidelines lump all of the above into a generically named Comments field , creators of DCAPs may wish to repeat this field with different labels as needed . The needs of future machine processing do not now seem to dictate tighter uniformity in this area . <h> 5.6 Term URIs versus Qualified Names <p> In the sense intended here , Qualified Names are names of metadata terms that are " qualified " with a prefix standing for a namespace with which the terms are associated ( a " namespace prefix " ) . For example , the Dublin Core element " Title " is sometimes referenced in metadata records and usage documentation using a namespace prefix such as " DC. " or " dc : " as in " DC.Title " or " dc:title " . As straightforward as this citation method may seem , it is based on assumptions about the nature of " namespace " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environments ( e.g. , HTML versus RDF versus relational databases ) or metadata communities ( e.g. , for citing elements from standards other than Dublin Core ) , and at any rate it presupposes an additional mechanism or declaration for associating prefixes with the proper namespaces . <p> For such reasons , it is far better to cite an element with a full URI indeed , this is the only method supported by the CORES Resolution and by DCMI policy CORES-RESOLUTION , DCMI-NAMESPACE . According to the Principle of Appropriate Identification followed in these guidelines , a Term URI must be cited when available . <p> On the other hand , long strings such as " http : **32;4217;TOOLONG " are not very readable and may be misunderstood by the average reader of a DCAP . In accordance with the Principle of Readability , therefore , the author of a DCAP may choose to use qualified names ( e.g. , " dc:title " ) in the " Name " field as long as any prefixes used are explained in the Preamble of the DCAP , and as long as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Declaring new elements <p> There is nothing to restrain the creator of a DCAP from creating new URIs as identifiers for locally coined metadata terms . For reasons discussed above in Section 3 , one should perhaps pause for reflection before taking this step , and if URIs are declared , this step should perhaps be documented separately and not embedded " in passing " into a DCAP full of Term Usages . Any URIs declared for use in a DCAP might best be formed by following the DCMI algorithm and concatenating the URL of the DCAP ( e.g. , " http : //myproject.org/profile/ " ) and the Name of the term ( e.g. , " starRatings " ) into a single string ( e.g. , " http : **35;4251;TOOLONG " ) DCMI-NAMESPACE . Other models for forming URIs as identifiers for metadata elements are emerging with the implementation of the CORES Resolution CORES-RESOLUTION. <h> 5.8 Documenting grouped or nested metadata elements <p> In order to be usable across a diversity of application environments , Dublin Core was designed as a flat set of attributes for describing a resource . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be embedded in more elaborate models that group or nest the elements in locally specific ways . <p> In the absence of a clear and widely accepted data model beyond that of the flat set of attributes , however , applications for integrating metadata from many different sources may be able only to extract and interpret the metadata in terms of Simple Dublin Core , losing any application-specific modelling context . An application designer wishing to document nesting or grouping constructs in a DCAP will need to extend the guidelines described here in order to do so and should bear in mind that documenting such constructs will not in itself guarantee that they will be understood or correctly processed by other applications . <h> 5.9 Documenting unorthodox practices <p> For reasons both of history and of expedience , a significant number of applications have metadata based on interpretations of the Dublin Core model that are unsound from the standpoint of today 's grammatical principles . For example , an application may use CreatorDateOfBirth an element representing the birth date of a creator of a resource that does not , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imply . <p> Rather than incorrectly asserting " CreatorDateOfBirth " to be an Element Refinement refining http : **34;4288;TOOLONG , the Term Usage in the DCAP should simply record the local name of the element and identify the URI of the DCAP itself as its source . For example , if the DCAP itself is identified by " http : **35;4324;TOOLONG " , the Term Usage should declare the following , leaving empty any fields ( such as " Term URI " and " Refines " ) that would make incorrect assertions about the element : <p> Whether " errors " such as " CreatorDateOfBirth " will be of negative consequence for interoperability will depend on how they are interpreted and used in the context of particular applications . The analytical effort involved in creating a DCAP is in effect an important first step towards putting such applications onto a more interoperable foundation . <h> 6 Examples <h> 6.1 UK Resource Discovery Network OAI Application Profile <h> 6.1.1 Descriptive Header <p> Title <p> RDN OAI Application Profile <p> Contributor <p> Andy Powell <p> Date <p> 2003-03-23 <p> Identifier <p> URL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document expresses the application profile established by the Resource Discovery Network ( RDN ) to be used by RDN partners for harvesting of records using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting ( OAI-PMH ) . The Application Profile is expressed according to guidelines published by the CEN/ISSS Reference . Full user documentation for the Application Profile , together with associated XML schemas , is available at http : **26;4361;TOOLONG <h> 6.1.3 Commentary <p> The DCAP for the UK Resource Discovery Network is formatted in the tersest possible style RDN . Note in particular the following : <p> The Descriptive Header puts the DCAP into a specific usage context . <p> Only the attributes actually used in a given Term Usage are shown . Indeed , most of the Term Usages in this DCAP consist of just a Name and a Term URI . <p> Instead of listing all of the DCMI- and RDN-maintained Encoding Schemes as separate Has Encoding Scheme entries ( or as separate Term Usages ) , this DCAP uses shorthand references to " DC Subject Encoding Schemes " and " RDN Subject Encoding Schemes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for the former ) and in a Comment field of the Term Usage ( for the latter ) . <p> This DCAP increases the readability of Term Usages by listing the Name , in boldface , before the Term URI . This option is discussed in Section 5.2 . <p> To enable the user to find the resource by limiting the number of search hits according to a date , e.g. the date the resource was made available . <p> Local Comment : Notes <p> Dates need to appear in a format that is recognisable to people all over the world , and that can be interpreted by computer software . The W3C format allows accurate searching , and makes it clear which is the year , month or day . The format is ' ccyy-mm-dd ' , where ' ccyy ' is the year , ' mm ' is the month and ' dd ' the day . When the time is also needed , add ' hh:mm ' , where ' hh ' is the hour ( using the 24 hour clock ) , ' mm ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at http : **29;4389;TOOLONG . <p> Local Comment : Not to be confused with <p> Coverage Date refers to dates relevant to the information resource itself , not the information held within the resource . For example , for a document about the civil service in the 18th century , put ' 18th century ' in Coverage and put the date published in Date . <p> The value must always be taken from the specified encoding scheme , with the exception of the ' updatingFrequency ' refinement . <p> Obligation <p> Mandatory <p> Condition <p> A value must be given either for the unqualified date or at least one date refinement <p> Datatype <p> - <h> 6.3.3 Commentary <p> The DCAP for the UK e-Government Metadata Standard is formatted in the most detailed and specific possible style EGMS . While this results in a significantly longer document than the DCAPs for RDN and Renardus , such specificity may be helpful to developers of applications that need to create or process metadata based on the DCAP . Note in particular the following : <p> Encoding Schemes and Element Refinements are listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which they refer . In addition , each Encoding Scheme and Element Refinement is also described in its own Term Usage , which allows information about each of them , such as Definition and Constraints , to be recorded in the DCAP as well . <p> The Term Usage marks information coming from outside sources : the " Source Definition " copies the definition of Date from DCMI documentation , while the " Local Comment " supplies usage information local to this DCAP . <h> Annex A : Metadata describing a DCAP <p> A DCAP should itself be described with Dublin Core metadata , either in a header or in a separate metadata record . At a minimum , this description should include : <p> Title <p> A name for the Application Profile . <p> Contributor <p> A creator or maintainer of the Profile . <p> Date <p> The date of last modification . <p> Identifier <p> An unambiguous reference to the Profile . Best practice is to provide a URL by which a copy of the document or schema can be retrieved over the Web . <p> Description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the description should elaborate on the context and purposes in which the DCAP is intended to be used ; the organizations or individuals involved in its development ; any arrangements , policies , or intentions regarding the future development and maintenance of the DCAP ; or technical characteristics of the instance metadata or database described . <h> Annex B : Options for machine-interpretable DCAPs <p> DCAPs can be expressed in machine-interpretable schema languages , and such machine-interpretable schemas can be manipulated by software applications . This CWA does not give detailed recommendations on how such schemas should be structured , as a number of issues are still open for debate . The scope of this CWA is limited to recommending how application profiles can be expressed as text documents . Future options for machine-interpretable DCAPs are outlined below . <p> Currently , two schema languages specified by W3C might be considered : XML Schema XML-SCHEMA and RDF Schema RDF-SCHEMA . The choice of schema language will be influenced by the functionality that the schema is intended to support for example , whether it is required as a predictable format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metadata . Such different objectives imply different choices between the two schema languages . There has been some discussion on ways to combine XML Schema and RDF Schema to more fully express characteristics of application profiles HUNTER . More recently there has been an attempt within the W3C to differentiate RDF Schema as a vocabulary description language and XML Schema as a basis for providing structured data exchange . <p> An XML schema provides a structured expression that supports validation of instance metadata . In effect , an XML schema provides a document " template " which acts as an exchange format for metadata instances . An XML Schema serves the same function as an XML DTD with additional capability for extensibility and namespace handling . <p> An RDF schema expresses relationships between terms , providing a data model for expressing the semantics of terms their properties , classes , and definitions . The underlying RDF data model combined with the use of unique identifiers allows software to infer relationships between terms and perform data aggregation . <p> RDF Schemas are effective for expressing the semantics of application profiles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data-typing , and constraints . Possible approaches to the expression of application profiles in RDF have been explored within projects such as SCHEMAS BAKER and MEG MEG-REGISTRY.

This had n't occurred to me before but after writing all that stuff about XML elements not being DC elements , I wondered whether the use of " contain " in the first sentence of the comment is also slightly misleading/inappropriate in the light of the DCAM . XML elements are containers , and they have content . But DC elements are not containers and do not have content : they are properties and they describe relationships between resources and values . So it might be recast as something like " Typically , a rights management statement for the resource is provided . " or " Typically , rights information includes a rights management statement for the resource . " 
@@100424603 @4624603/ <h> Memorandum of Understanding between the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative and the IEEE Learning Technology Standards Committee <h> Introduction <p> The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative ( DCMI ) and the IEEE Learning Technology Standards Committee P1484 ( IEEE LTSC ) express their joint commitment to collaboration on the development of interoperable metadata for learning , education and training . In particular , both organisations see benefit in maintaining compatibility between the ongoing development of the IEEE LTSC Learning Object Metadata ( LOM ) and the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set ( DCMES ) . <p> It is the view of both parties that it is vital that the learning , education and training communities continue to be able to take advantage of tools and services that emerge from both initiatives the DCMI approach to developing metadata standards for resource discovery across domains and flexible detailed descriptions for learning objects as supported by the IEEE LOM . <p> Both DCMI and IEEE LTSC have long held certain fundamental assumptions regarding the development of metadata specifications for the web , and our ability to collaborate is directly tied to a mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IEEE LTSC LOM constituents have substantially overlapping technical and descriptive metadata requirements and are therefore best served by a single architecture that presents a minimum of barriers to the creation , interchange , and use of metadata . <p> Based on this philosophy , we agree to support modular , extensible , structured metadata . For the interchange and use of metadata , the World-Wide Web is a strategic medium , and we agree that an effective architecture must be deployable using existing web infrastructure , and can be expected to evolve along with that infrastructure . <h> Architecture <p> Features of a common architecture include a commitment to : <p> Open extensibility : Communities or applications must be able to refine or extend the semantics of the elements , to support local or community needs . On the other hand , such extensions should not compromise cross-domain interoperability . We agree that extensions should be identified in a standards-based way as to which community has created the extension and to produce guidelines which may facilitate this . <p> Modularity : The architecture should support the use of complementary groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be managed by distinct entities or agencies . For example , DCMI addresses general characteristics of web resources , such as author and title . The IEEE LOM focuses on detailed descriptions of learning objects . Therefore , a description of a learning , education or training resource could include elements from these two ( or possibly more ) sources . An example of an additional group of elements in the broad ' e-learning ' community could be discipline-specific extensions . <p> Refinement : Appropriate values for metadata elements can be refined through the use of specific schemes or encoding standards . Examples of such refinement include the specification of date encodings ( e.g. , ISO 8601 ) to assure unambiguous parsing rules , the specification of a classification scheme ( e.g. , Dewey Decimal Classification ) , or the definition of a controlled vocabulary ( e.g. , roles of contributors to a resource in IEEE LOM ) . <h> Semantics <p> We agree that , in order to best support the modular construction of metadata , metadata elements should not contain overlapping semantics . This means that the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups of elements . <p> We recognize that this type of overlap can and does occur , especially with legacy metadata collections . However , DCMI and IEEE LTSC agree that it is in our communities ' best interest if our specifications are developed to avoid such semantic overlap . <p> We further agree that metadata elements should be defined to reflect broad geographic , cultural , and linguistic requirements . <h> Syntax <p> Philosophical , architectural or semantic aspects of this Memorandum of Understanding are independent of any technology or syntax for expressing metadata . In order to build tools and applications that actually implement these aspects , some syntax is required and we agree to collaborate on interoperability in that domain as well . <p> As of this date , there are a number of technologies that we envision using to create common specifications , including : <p> Simple representations of embedded metadata in HTML are and will continue to be important for significant segments of our communities and establishing common representations of our standards in HTML is important . <p> XML can be expected to accommodate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being a Web industry standard for data and document encoding . <p> The Resource Description Framework ( RDF ) provides a useful approach to satisfy the requirements of extensibility and modularity , and can thus lead to direct interoperability between each communities ' metadata requirements . <h> Ongoing Collaboration <p> As implementation of metadata takes place within the learning , education and training communities new or refined requirements will arise . For those requirements that address general metadata ( i.e. not specific to learning , education and training ) the IEEE LTSC will forward those requirements into the DCMI community for discussion and specification . For those requirements that are specific to learning , education and training , DCMI , through the DC-Education Working Group , will forward those requirements to the IEEE LTSC LOM Working Group . <p> The chair(s) of the DC-Education Working Group will have invited expert ( voting ) status within the LTSC LOM Working Group . Additional dialog between the groups on learning , education and training metadata will take place in public forums such as email discussion list . <h> Implementation of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of the aims and goals of educational metadata .

The foundational workshop of March 1995 in Dublin , Ohio aimed at improving the " discovery " of electronic resources on a rapidly growing World-Wide Web . The approach taken was that of defining " elements " for simple " records " describing " document-like objects " 1 . Implicit was the traditional model of a search application indexing text fields ( value strings ) for retrieval . <p> What actually happened , as we know , was that Google developed a radically different , wildly successful , solution to the problem of resource discovery . The Dublin Core community 's understanding of metadata 's role subsequently evolved in several ways : <p> The focus on " resource discovery " came to be seen as artificial -- what descriptive element might not be conceived as " useful for discovery " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource description " . <p> The scope of Dublin Core metadata was broadened from " electronic resources " to encompass , in principle , any object that can be identified , whether electronic , real-world , or conceptual , and particularly including resources of the sort named in the DCMI Type Vocabulary 2 , such as physical objects , software , services , and sound . <p> Attention shifted from the " record " as an aggregate information object to individual metadata " statements " designed to be merged and recombined in an emerging Linked Data environment ( see glossary entry " records or statements " ) . <p> Metadata came to be seen as valuable less for the value strings it carried than for its use of URIs -- controlled identifiers for subject headings , Web documents , people , and the like -- and for the role of properties ( such as Dublin Core properties ) in defining explicit links and cross-references between resources . URI-rich metadata came to be seen as the basis for richly interlinked browsing and data mashups . <p> Anything that might be identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a service ( for example , " today 's weather report for Los Angeles " ) , and a collection of other resources . Not all resources are network " retrievable " ; for example , human beings , corporations , concepts and bound books in a library can also be considered resources . <p> Metadata <p> @#@@ The simplest definition of metadata is " structured data about data . " Metadata is descriptive information about a resource whether it be physical or electronic . The underlying concepts behind metadata have been in use for as long as collections of information have been organized . Library card catalogs represent a well-established example of metadata for resource discovery . Metadata can be generated either " by hand " or derived automatically using software . Understanding of metadata role has evolved : Label , annotate with text-string values / linking information with URIs - navigating , structured browsing , contextualizing , bundle of links for context . <p> " elements " for a simple " record " -- one " more informative than an index entry but ... less complete than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects " 1 .

This would also impede discovery of resources and reduce , rather than increase , interoperability . <p> The addition of the term still image will acknowledge the importance of the static image as a non-textual repository of cultural memory , artistic and intellectual expression and complement the addition of the term moving image . <p> Visual arts ( U.S. Copyright Office ) : For copyright purposes , visual arts are original pictorial , graphic , and sculptural works , which include two-dimensional and three-dimensional works of fine , graphic , and applied art . <p> Environmental Impact : <p> The world of fixed images ( including text ) , still pictures and static visual materials has a long descriptive heritage within quite separate domains . Many adopters of the DC.Type term , ' image ' have used the term to distinguish between text and image . The term has also been used for still image collections where pictures , photographs , maps , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' electronic images ' or within museum ( physical object ) collections . Such breadth of use makes it difficult to identify a specific still image domain . Instead , there appear to be several communities of interest , one in the physical world and one in the electronic . Within these communities the term ' image ' is not necessarily a domain specific term . Consequently , legacy deployments of the term ' image ' within these communities is unlikely to be compromised by this proposal . <p> To avoid difficulties with deployments of the existing term image it is proposed to add the two terms still image ' and moving image as preferred types . The existing term and the two coupled proposals for new terms will reflect this change : <p> The Status of the term image will change to Deprecated .

@@100424616 @4624616/ <p> The DCMI Box encoding scheme is a method for identifying a region of space using its geographic limits and representing that information as a value string . Components of the value string correspond to the bounding coordinates in north , south , east and west directions , plus optionally up and down , and also allow the coordinate system and units to be specified , and a name if desired . A method for encoding DCMI Box in a text string using the DCSV syntax is described . This notation is intended for representing a value of the DCMES element Coverage , particularly when using HTML meta elements . <p> Revision note : <p> 2006-04-10 . After approval of the DCMI Abstract Model DCAM as a DCMI Recommendation in March 2005 , the DCMI Usage Board undertook a review of the DCSV syntax specification and of the related specifications for the encoding schemes DCMI Box , DCMI Point , and DCMI Period , with the goal of revising their language for conformance with the Abstract Model . A summary of the changes made can be found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 , the DCMI Abstract Model supports the construct " related description " as a method for describing value entities such as a persons or , indeed , time periods or locations in space . The DCMI Usage Board encourages implementers to consider using related descriptions as an alternative to packaging descriptive information in DCSV-encoded strings . Descriptions based on the DCMI Abstract Model are more likely to be interoperable over the longer term than descriptions using DCSV-syntax-based specifications . <h> Table of Contents <h> 1 . Introduction <p> Several methods are available to indicate a place . These include , but are not limited to : <p> a name , normally defined in an identifiable enumeration such as a gazetteer or list of jurisdictional localities ; <p> a unique geocode , such as a postal code ; <p> the coordinates of a point , using geographic values or some well-defined projection and units ; <p> a set of arcs or faces describing the polygon or polyhedron comprising the perimeter of the place ; <p> the limits of a regular shaped container which encompasses the place , typically a rectangular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some well-defined projection and units . <p> The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set DCMES includes an element , Coverage , the value of which may be a place . If a name or geocode is used as the value representation for the property , then the enumeration from which that is selected determines valid value strings . However , there are no simple , commonly used , notations for indicating a place using coordinates . Here we define DCMI Box , an encoding scheme which specifies the geographic limits of a place , and describe a method for encoding DCMI Box in a text string using the DCSV syntax DCSV . <p> In the simplest usage , DCMI Box approximates the extent of a place using a container with a regular shape . For a more precise representation of an irregular shape it is possible to use the approach of " tiling " the place with a set of simple regions defined using DCMI Box . Alternatively , another notation describing a polygon or polyhedron may be used . If a value corresponding to a point is required , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Identifying a place - the DCMI Box scheme <p> We identify a place by considering the minimal rectangular box which fully encloses the place , whose faces are aligned parallel with the axes of an identified cartesian coordinate system Figure . <p> 1All components are optional . If any *limit component is absent , then this implies an interval unbounded on that side . Thus , a DCMI Box with a single component northlimit= " 0 " would identify the entire southern hemisphere . <p> 2Component values are text strings representing numbers . Units should be included using conventional ( SI ) notation , unless the relevant units or zunits component is present . However , if units are given as part of any component value , then for this component these override those given by units or zunits . <p> 3If this component is absent then the value is undefined . Processors performing numeric comparisons are recommended to set values corresponding to maximally inclusive matching . <p> 4In this context the name is non-normative .

Encoding DCMI Box with DCSV syntax <p> The components specified above have no meaning when disaggregated , since in any particular instance it is the complete set which acts to indicate the specific location . For systems in which data is encoded using a limited character set , this is conveniently accomplished by packaging the components into a single text string according to the DCSV syntax DCSV . <p> A DCMI Box value string using DCSV syntax , and using the component names defined above , appears as follows :

A face-to-face meeting of the WG will take place at DC-2003 6 . <p> The initial work schedule has proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of participants who have contributed actively to the development of the application profile , but reasonable progress has been made in developing the " core " of the profile . <h> Proposal for activities , 2003-2004 <h> Activity <p> The Group proposes to complete the work originally proposed : <p> to continue its work on the application profile for collection-level description with the aim of presenting a proposal to DC Usage Board at its next meeting ( after DC-2003 ) <p> to develop some supporting documents/tools , particularly <p> the creation of appropriate usage guidelines for the schema ; <p> a set of crosswalks for mapping between this collection description schema and some major domain-specific standards and schema used for collection-level description ( e.g. ISAD(G) , EAD , MARC21 ) . <p> schemas to support encoding in RDF and XML in accordance with current DCMI guidelines <h> Community need <p> A number of activities and initiatives ( e.g. in the UK , the Research Support Libraries Programme ( RSLP ) and more recently the work by the Joint Information Systems Committee ( JISC ) to develop an " Information Environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Library ( TEL ) project ; the Institute of Museum and Library Services ' project to develop a Collection Registry of National Leadership Grant projects ) have illustrated the interest in using collection-level description to support the disclosure/discovery of collections . At the same time , they highlight the absence of consensus on a metadata schema suitable for the description of a wide range of collections . <h> Support for activity <p> Several participants in the above activities are now contributing to the WG . In the UK , the Collection Descripton Focus ' work on raising awareness of CLD generally and the importance of consistency of approach complements the efforts of the DC CD WG , and the Focus has sought to promote the work of the WG within the UK . <p> The DC activity has also attracted the interest of the group at Optical Storage Technology Association ( OSTA ) working on MPV ( a specification that defines a manifest and metadata format and practices for processing and playback of collections of digital photo , video , and related audio and file content ) .

The intent of specifying this element is to provide a means to express relationships among resources that have formal relationships to others , but exist as discrete resources themselves . For example , images in a document , chapters in a book , or items in a collection . <h> Justifications and Uses <p> Digital resources are rarely published in isolation . Most are published as part of a collection of related resources . For example , HTML pages are often published in hyper-linked webs , and images are often published in thematic galleries . <p> Much intellectual effort is spent organising collections . Part of this organisation is a description of the relationships between resources in the collection . This organisation allows users to discover resources in a structured way . For example , users can browse through a library collection using the subject headings in the catalog until they find a subject of interest to them . <p> Some resources have their relationship to other resources embedded within them . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship to another resource . Other resources have no facility for doing this . The Dublin Core relation element is intended to support the description of relationships to other resources within the metadata for a resource . <p> Potential uses of the relation element include : <p> allowing users to browse through resource collections using only metadata descriptions <p> aiding metadata indexing tools to decide on the value of resources ( those with the most references ) <p> The Hypertext links in HTML Internet draft analyses the use of hypertext links on the World Wide Web and provides suggestions for explicitly marking up hypertext links with relationship descriptions . It identifies a number of categories of relationships : <p> Navigation aids such as <p> contents - link to a table of contents <p> index - link to an index <p> Hierarchy links such as <p> child <p> sibling <p> top <p> Sequence links such as <p> begin <p> end <p> next <p> previous <p> Related links such as <p> biblioentry - bibliographic entry <p> glossary <p> The CORBA Relationship Service Specification defines a very general service for defining and manipulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our requirements , but does identify four commonly used relationships : <p> contains <p> containedin <p> references <p> referencedin <h> A Strawman <p> Examining the relationship description techniques mentioned above , it is obvious that the possible relationships between resources depend heavily on the domain of the resources , and hence impossible to enumerate all of them . For that reason , this strawman proposal suggests the definition of a core set of relationships which are useful and understood in most domains . Specialists in certain domains may extend this core set , but should not expect the extensions to be understood outside their domain . <p> Most of the relationship descriptions mentioned above allow description of hierarchy , containment , citation , and context relationships . The strawman proposal suggests that these be used as the core set of relation qualifiers . <h> Hierarchy <p> TYPE=IsParentOf <p> The resource being described is higher in some arbitrary hierarchy than the resource being pointed to by this relation element . <p> TYPE=IsChildOf <p> The resource being described is lower in some arbitrary hierarchy than the resource being pointed to by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web of HTML documents describing an organisations departmental structure , a page describing a particular Unit may refer to the organisations home page . <p> RELATION ( Scheme=URL ) ( Type=IsChildOf ) http : //www.dstc.edu.au/ <h> Containment <p> TYPE=Contains <p> The resource being described contains the resource being pointed to by this relation element . <p> TYPE=ContainedIn <p> The resource being described is contained in the resource being pointed to by this relation element . <p> For example , the metadata for a document which contains an image of an albatross could include the relation element

Comments by interested readers are most welcome at the task group 's mailing list . <h> Scope <h> Purpose <p> The user guide for Dublin Core Diane Hillmann 's " Using Dublin Core " was first drafted in January 1998 and last revised in November 2005 . The user guide remains one of the most popular documents on the DCMI Web site , attesting to a strong user demand for such introductory materials . <p> Recognizing that many aspects of the user guide are in need of revision not just points of detail and links to external documents , but more fundamental points related to the difference between " legacy " and " semantic " approaches to Dublin Core metadata , the Usage Board put the user guide on the agenda of its face-to-face meeting in Seoul of 16 October 2009 and noted the following : <p> Localization groups need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should remain short and easy to translate <p> Parts 4 and 5 on " elements " and " qualifiers " need to be revised and updated with current terminology and noting formal range issues <p> The document might in principle be shortened if it were to focus on examples for a smaller selection of more " difficult " properties <p> The document needs a new introduction outlining the current principles and goals of DCMI <p> With regard to syntax and other implementation issues , the guide need only point to more comprehensive documents . <p> The current examples are very " bibliographic " in nature , so at a minimum the document should emphasize the applicability of most properties , in principle , to any type of resource . <p> The guidelines for the FOAF vocabulary ( e.g. , like this ) provide one potential model to follow from the standpoint of style .

The intention of the Task Group process is to align the LRMI integration with DCMI procedures to guarantee the outcome is consistent with DCMI principles and practices . Those principles and practices include conformance to DCMI namespace policy1 ( as amended ) , page persistence policy2 ( as amended ) and open development and decision making that serve to guarantee the reliability and acceptance of the specification through principled maintenance and community-driven further development . The DCMI/LRMI TG will be a permanent Task Group with work packages defining particular outcomes and time-frames as defined from time-to-time through open DC-Education community input . <h> Scope <p> LRMI is both : ( a ) an informal community loosely defined by sets of participants on the two LRMI Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terse set of classes and properties . The work of this particular work package of the LRMI Task Group pertains to the LRMI specification and touches only tangentially on the LRMI community . <p> NOTE : Both DCMI and LRMI operate open communities and the boundaries between the two are totally porous . <p> Transition of the documentation supporting the LRMI specification from LRMI.net to dublincore.org . <p> NOTE : The transition involves a faithful replication of LRMI 1.1 . <p> Currently , the LRMI specification exists as a set of tables informally defining LRMI classes and properties . The Task Group will create an RDF schema of the LRMI specification assigning property URI to comport with namespace policy and support principled curation and further development as determined by the community ; <h> Deliverables <p> ( Complete ) Create the necessary Jiscmail list/forum for archived communications of the new LRMI Task Group . <p> ( Complete ) Creation of both wiki . <p> ( Complete ) DCMI website pages for the LRMI Task Group . <p> ( Complete ) Precisely replicate on the DCMI website the content of the narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LRMI 1.1 specification from lrmi.net . <p> ( Complete ) In consultation with the Technical Board , determine the PURL that will resolve to a canonical RDF expression of the 1.1 specification : <p> http : **25;4781;TOOLONG ( " dcx " is the namespace reserved for RDF serializations of DCMI Community Specifications ) pursuant to a proposal for a revised DCMI namespace policy. 3 <p> ( Complete ) Prepare HTML replication of the current 1.1 specification for the DCMI Website as the new canonical statement of the specification thus bringing it within the context of the DCMI page persistence policy ( see http : **32;4808;TOOLONG ) . <p> ( Complete ) Create an RDF expression of the canonical 1.1 to conform with the DCMI namespace policy ( with formal references to related specifications including IEEE LOM and DCMI education extensions ( DCTERMS ) ) . <p> Consistent with the DCMI proposal , the PURL URI would always reference the most resent " version " ( snapshot ? ) of the specification with the internal representation being in time-stamped directories--e.g. ,

Joseph , Stuart and David absent from call so no further updates . <p> Resource Collection : <p> Sean and Mike C. had calls with all the content partners over the last couple weeks to walk through the gap analysis and examples Sean had pulled together . Each partner is looking at their own work stream and the Competency Index to focus on areas that they will be able to contribute new learning resources to in the coming months . Once they have narrowed their focus , Mike C. will combine their plans and get out to the group to avoid overlap and duplication . <p> Sean is continuing to work on the user manual and will post to the listserv next week for feedback and review . Sean has also been going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; will be done within next week and will go back to adding new resources ; approximately 10-15 new resources have been added in the past month . <p> Editorial Board : <p> The Google doc with the Competency Index has been posted for comment , and we have received a few .

Tom Johnson will be contributing competencies for Ruby libraries for linked data , Adam Rabinowitz will contribute competencies for temporal data . Stuart has talked with Seth and Reuven for additional competencies , but have n't seen input yet . Tom will connect with Sean to think about upcoming Editorial Board call , and how to jump start additional review and input for the CI . RDF fundamentals and SPARQL are covered well at this point , but need more expert input to fill in other areas . Need suggestions for new people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike C , Joseph , Stuart had scheduled a call for reviewing the technical workflow in getting updates from EB version of CI into the production system , but had to cancel .

Currently do n't know what URI the headings refer to-- may need to extend data format for EB to include the concept number so that it can be converted into reference in triple store . Joseph will need to confirm whether this is possible . <p> Marketing and Community Building : <p> Current poster proposals are in for ALA and IFLA . Ideas for a joint DCMI/ASIST workshop are being explored by Marcia and Margie , but need to follow up to avoid overlap and confusion . Should bring Stuart into conversation to make sure that efforts are aligned ; perhaps a call is needed with Margie , Marcia , Stuart and Mike C. to sort out options .

Tom will think about competencies for SKOS as starting point for this , and will point Sean to resources related to SKOS . An effort to collect guidelines on how to turn strings into URIs , such as OpenRefine tutorials would be useful . This kind of information would also be useful for special collections , museums and archives , since they have put much effort into developing controlled vocabularies but have n't turned the terms into findable resources . <h> Action items <p> Stuart , Abi and David Talley to set up follow-up call to prioritize UI work . <p> Abi will continue to troubleshoot rating plugin to see if can make it work correctly . <p> Sean will post the editing user manual to DC-PET group for feedback . <p> Tom will follow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ways to further engage outside contributors for CI . <p> Stuart to set up meeting with Joseph/Tom/Mike C and Stuart to discuss technical implications of a process for managing incoming comments for Editorial Board use . <p> Mike C. will coordinate with Stuart to set up discussion among Margie , Marcia , Stuart and Mike C. on potential DCMI submissions . <p> Tom and Sean will discuss adding SKOS materials to the CI and learning resources , and think about other ways to incorporate competencies related to conversion of value vocabularies into linked data . 
@@100424625 @4624625/ <p> There is a sense of instability in the current definition of the Dublin Core among organisations that want to start implementing . Organisations directly involved in the Dublin Core activity have started implementing in the understanding that the definitions were open to change as a result of their experiences . Other organisations , however , are waiting for a stable situation before they start investing substantial amounts of effort and money in creating Dublin Core metadata . Standardising the Dublin Core would ( a ) clearly mark a stable version of the agreements and ( b ) make the process of change verifiable . <p> 2 . To ratify <p> Some organisations are required to use ( international ) standards for their activities . Examples are government agencies who are bound by public procurement policies . Being able to refer to an international standard for metadata would give them a tool to implement and/or procure products that conform to this standard . In relation to this , it was mentioned that standardising DC could help in ISO 9000 compliance . <p> II . What should be standardised ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in RFC 2413 ( now referred to as version 1.0 ) is the clear candidate to act as the basis for international standardisation as this is the version that has currently been implemented by a large number of projects . This version will therefore be proposed as input for the standardisation process . <p> 2 . It is true that there are still discussions over the semantics of some of the elements in version 1.0 . In DC-6 , a short-term action was agreed to tidy up the definitions of version 1.0 . This will lead to DC version 1.1 , with the same 15 elements as version 1.0 , but with clarified descriptions . Given the intended timescale for this ( 3 months ? ) , it is likely that version 1.1 can be injected in the standards process , together with any other ballot comments , before a standard is ratified . <p> 3 . The standardisation of version 2.0 that is under construction can be progressed as a new version of the DC standard probably at the end of 1999 at the earliest . <p> III . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various options for standardisation of Dublin Core . Candidate standardisation bodies that have been identified are : ( a ) ISO , the International Organisation for Standardisation ( b ) CEN/ISSS , the Information Society Standardization System of the European Committee for Standardization ( c ) NISO , the US National Information Standards Organization <p> A parallel approach is proposed , submitting DC 1.0 as a work item to the three bodies at the same time , addressing it to : 1 . ISO TC46/SC4/WG7 2 . CEN/ISSS Workshop on Metadata for Multimedia Information ( MMI ) for adoption as a CEN Workshop Agreement ( CWA ) 3 . NISO Standards Development Committee <p> The timescale of the standardisation process depends on the established procedures of the three bodies . Of course , the proposal has to go through these procedures , although wherever possible , a fast-track option will be pursued . Hopefully , the ballot process for all three tracks can be well underway at the time of DC-7 in Frankfurt . <p> In any case , there was a consensus in the break-out session that the DC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , for example , it would be the DC process and not any external standards organisation that would control changes . <p> IV . What could be problems in the process ? <p> Three issues were identified : <p> 1 . Copyright issues All of the standardisation bodies have certain policies towards copyright on the standards they publish . A solution can be proposed where the standards bodies have shared copyright , which allows them to sell the standard document , whereas the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative at the same time should retain the rights on making the content freely available on the Web . A similar solution has been found between ISO , NISO and the Z39.50 maintenance agency concerning the Z39.50 standard . <p> 2 . Document format All of the standardisation bodies have certain rules pertaining to the layout and format of published standards . There should be a certain flexibility , provided that the core body of the standard is identical . An example of this is again the Z39.50 standard where the content of the ISO and NISO standard documents is identical . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body for the maintenance of the content of DC should be a more-or-less formalised maintenance agency much like the Z39.50 Maintenance Agency supported by the Z39.50 Implementers Group is responsible for the maintenance of Z39.50 . The proposals for the Organization and Process of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative ( Directorate , Technical and Policy Advisory Committees , and DC Workshops ) should lead to a similar identifiable maintenance agency .

@@100424631 @4624631/ <p> This document describes the Singapore Framework for Dublin Core Application Profiles as presented at the International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications in Singapore , September 2007 . The purpose of this document is to provide a stable and citable point of reference for the Singapore Framework . <p> The Singapore Framework for Dublin Core Application Profiles is a framework for designing metadata applications for maximum interoperability and for documenting such applications for maximum reusability . The framework defines a set of descriptive components that are necessary or useful for documenting an Application Profile and describes how how these documentary standards relate to standard domain models and Semantic Web foundation standards . The framework forms a basis for reviewing Application Profiles for documentary completeness and for conformance with Web-architectural principles . <p> This document provides a summary of the framework . Future documents are planned for providing guidance in creating the necessary documentation . <p> The term profile is widely used to refer to a document that describes how standards or specifications are deployed to support the requirements of a particular application , function , community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application profile has been applied to describe the tailoring of standards for specific applications . <p> The DCMI Abstract Model , published as a DCMI Recommendation in March 2005 , provides a metadata model of the kind required for formalizing a notion of machine-processable application profiles . In September 2007 , Mikael Nilsson presented a framework for the definition of Dublin Core Application Profiles at the International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications in Singapore ( dubbed the " Singapore Framework " ) . <p> The process of " profiling " a standard introduces the prospect of a tension between meeting the demands for efficiency , specificity , and localization within the context of a community or service on the one hand , and maintaining interoperability between communities and services on the other . Different metadata standards may provide different levels of flexibility : some standards may be quite prescriptive and leave relatively few options for customization , while others may present a broad range of optional features which demand a considerable degree of selection and tailoring for implementation . <p> It is desirable to be able to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those standards - in combination . The implementers of metadata standards should be able to assemble the components that they require for some particular set of functions . If that means drawing on components that are specified within different metadata standards , that should ideally be possible . They should also be safe in the knowledge that the assembled whole can be interpreted correctly by independently designed applications . The metaphor of the Lego set has been used to describe this process : an application designer should be able to " snap together " selected " building blocks " drawn from the " kits " provided by different metadata standards to build the construction that meets their requirements , even if the kits that provide those blocks were created quite independently . <p> In a Dublin Core Application Profile , the terms referenced are , as one would expect , terms of the type described by the DCMI Abstract Model , i.e. a DCAP describes , for some class of metadata descriptions , which properties are referenced in statements and how the use of those properties may be constrained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes and syntax encoding schemes . The DC notion of the application profile imposes no limitations on whether those properties or encoding schemes are defined and managed by DCMI or by some other agency : the key requirement is that the properties referred to in a DCAP are compatible with the notion of property in the Resource Description Framework . <p> It is a condition of the abstract model that all references to terms in a Dublin Core metadata description be made using URIs . Once identified using URIs , terms may be drawn from any source and references to those terms can be made without ambiguity . This set of terms can be regarded as the " vocabulary " of the application or community that the application profile is designed to support . The terms within that vocabulary may also be deployed within the vocabularies of many other DCAPs . <p> It is important to realize that the semantics of the terms used in application profiles is carried by their definitions , which are independent of any application profile . Semantic interoperability is addressed outside of the realm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application profile describes the set of guidelines , description rules , and constraints used in creating a specific set of metadata records . As semantic interoperability is provided by a correct use of terms defined in one or more vocabularies , application profiles are about providing high-level syntactic or structural interoperability in addition to the semantic interoperability . <p> According to the Singapore Framework , a Dublin Core Application Profile is packet of documentation which consists of the following components : <p> Functional requirements ( mandatory ) <p> The functional requirements of a Dublin Core Application Profile describe the functions that the application profile is designed to support , as well as functions that are out of scope . <p> The functional requirements form the basis of evaluating the application profile for internal consistency and for giving guidance on the appropriateness of the application profile for a given use . <p> Domain model ( mandatory ) <p> The domain model defines the basic entities described by the application profile and their fundamental relationships . The purpose of the domain model is to define a basic scope for the application profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text or using a more formal approach such as UML . <p> Description Set Profile ( DSP ) ( mandatory ) <p> A Description Set Profile ( see DSP ) defines a set of metadata records that are valid instances of an application profile . The Description Set Profile model is currently being developed within the Dublin Core Architecture Forum and is in progress of being put forward as a DCMI Working Draft . <p> The Dublin Core Description Set Profile model is designed to offer a simple constraint language for Dublin Core metadata , based on the DCMI Abstract Model A DSP constrains the resources that may be described by descriptions in a description set conforming to the application profile , the properties that may be used , and the ways a value may be referenced . <p> Usage guidelines ( optional ) <p> The optional usage guidelines describe how to apply the application profile , how the used properties are intended to be used in the application context etc . <p> The figure also shows how the components of a Dublin Core Application Profile relate to " domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities -- and to the W3C standard Resource Description Framework ( RDF ) , the default foundation for machine-processable semantics in our time . <p> Description Set Profiles are based on the DCMI Abstract Model ( DCAM ) inasmuch they specify how the entities of the DCAM are used in a specific set of metadata . In this sense , the DCAM constitutes a broadly recognized model of the structural components of metadata records . The DCAM , in turn , is grounded in RDF . <p> Description Set Profiles typically use properties and classes defined in standard Metadata Vocabularies such as the DCMI Metadata Terms . Metadata Vocabularies , in turn , are expressed on the basis of the RDF Vocabulary Description Language ( also known as RDF Schema , or RDFS ) . <p> The Domain Model used in an application is often based on a domain model in wider use ; for example , the generic model Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records ( FRBR ) is an important point of reference for resource description in the library world . <p> Guidelines for expressing a specific Description Set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of several specifications published by DCMI to provide guidance on expressing Dublin Core metadata using common data syntaxes such as HTML , XML , and RDF/XML . <p> As the Singapore framework is still young , there are no stable , published examples of full-blown application profiles that conform to these guidelines . At the International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications in Singapore , however , work on aligning the in-progress ePrints applications profile with the Singapore Framework was presented ; a slide presentation is available . An experimental model in a specialized wiki syntax is also available for the ePrints application profile .

Saved sets are moving along , close to being done , just resolving a few bugs before finished . Working on private learning trajectories next- much of the Saved sets functionality will apply here , with just a few more additional functions needed . <p> Stuart would like to use next month 's call to review the finished product , to walk through what has been accomplished-- should be at minimum viable product by then . We 'll use Webex to screenshare . Also will need to document the backend of the project from the technical side in Github before completion as foundation for future implementations . <p> Resource Collection : <p> Elsevier is still working on RDF vocabulary mapping tutorials . Mike L is coordinating with people in Elsevier 's Operations team to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and recommend .

Sam Oh is continuing work on Topic Maps and SPARQL query examples and quizzes based on the OCLC data , and Synaptica is working on a number of video tutorials based on their RDF work . <p> Marcia will be working on user testing this summer , will be hiring one RA and will try to hire Sean as well . Also will have an independent study student available . She will need to ramp up the students , and will then establish personas and collect feedback from representative users based on those personas . If others have names of people who might be good candidates as evaluators , send to Marcia so she can contact them . Stuart pointed out that it would also be a good idea to evaluate the editing tools as well as the website . Melanie Wacker may be a good candidate for this aspect . Sean may be able to take some of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Marcia . Mike , Sean , Marcia and Stuart will work on protocols for evaluation of site . Marcia and Mike will touch base when she is back home in a week or two to discuss further . <p> Editorial Board : <p> Last call was in early June ; made some progress on evaluating gaps in CI as a whole to identify priority areas for further work . Planning to meet July 15 for next call . People are digging into specific areas for competencies to fill gaps . Should be able to complete work on July call and declare v1 finished . Also will have two calls in Sep/Oct to address any outstanding issues . Will be experimenting on process for automatic updates to the CI in Github modeled on the Schema.org process , and will test process in July . Will document the process and wrap up work on this in Sep/Oct .

@@100424633 @4624633/ <h> Summary <p> Technical : Using sprint method for development , weekly meetings with first report out tomorrow . Will use new topical vocabulary as navigation structure for learning resources . All have been diving into Avada WP theme-- high learning curve , complex PhP templates , which makes downstream modifications problematic if make changes . Need to be aware of this for long-term maintenance . Working on content elements , improved overall navigation structure . Abi has been working on display for Learning Resources page . Now shows all resources associated with any competency in right hand column . Is implementing expand and collapse behavior on Competency Index ( to keep viewing window small ) . You can see the current state on a private page1 ( log-in required ) . Next steps will be investigating reordering of resource display so title is first , followed by description . Thinking about how voting mechanism might be used to allow users to evaluate learning resources , with automatic ranking based on number of votes . Important since this will be the long-term strategy for surfacing high-value resources once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cataloging tool so can be tagged with these . Waiting for final topic list and will add that to resource tagging tool as well . Will pull remaining tagged resources in Github into triple store . As we discuss users logging in , may need to get SSL certificate for website to encrypt passwords to provide protection on public network logins . Joseph is currently refactoring the competency index editor to make it more usable , last piece is generation of RDF to make sure hierarchical data gets produced correctly on authorship , and relationships are preserved . <p> Resource Collection : Sean cataloged 65 resources this month , 50 the prior month . Total resource count is 355 , but the complete total is closer to 450 ( 60 have not been migrated yet to repository , and of 70 syllabi , about 30 do not have URLs ) . Will probably have to wait until later to figure out what to do with non-URL resources . Have added more resource types to list so that can refine categorization of resources . OCLC has made their static dataset available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set once content partners have evaluated . DCMI will explore putting up more interactive interface later . Mike C. is gathering feedback from partners and will work with Eric to finalize . <p> Editorial Board : Have further developed the topical vocabulary for navigation and will be finalizing tomorrow . This will enable us tagging to a stable subject index for resources , which will make it possible to map the resources to competencies in the WordPress site . The focus until now has been on SPARQL , using resource warrant . Some gaps in resources identified , but nearly complete . This section will be finalized by the next monthly call , with public review next . Next goal is to look at the Fundamentals category , the largest batch of material and probably the most well-covered . Will use resource warrant and expert warrant ( Editorial Board ) . <p> Marketing and Community Building : Mike L. launched the blog last week with his post2 , time for others to start contributing . Anyone can get a WordPress account ( just below login link on site ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written a post already , others welcome to participate .

Dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public radio and television producers and managers , archivists and information scientists , called together by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , have been meeting to develop a single , shared protocol for identifying and describing our rich media assets . Administered by WGBH/Boston , the Public Broadcasting Metadata Initiative &lt;http : **34;5569;TOOLONG ; is a cross-organizational , multi-disciplined effort to establish a standard way to describe all public broadcasting content ( radio and television ) , so that it can be more easily exchanged between colleagues , software systems , institutions , community partners , individual citizens , etc . It is our belief that in a rapidly evolving and deeply challenging media environment , a well-formed Metadata Dictionary directly addresses our core mission of serving the people of the United States . By working hard to sensibly describe public broadcasting content with standardized , accurate descriptions , we can facilitate easy access and use by teachers , scholars , lifelong learners , engaged citizens and community partners . We are now at a point where we need to validate our work by gaining the insights of key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , and we would like to solicit your assistance in this validation process . We have created an online survey that is linked to the Public Broadcasting Metadata Dictionary ( PBCore ) . Each PBCore metadata element ( which is based on the internationally-accepted Dublin Core format ) is described along with its attributes and controlled vocabularies . Your feedback as to the clarity and usefulness of each element will be gathered through this online process - which can be broken up into multiple sessions should you desire . We hope you will be willing to help us in this important process . Should you wish to substitute a person in your organization or business who is more familiar with content exchange and/or metadata issues , please feel free to indicate their name , phone and e-mail address in your reply to this e-mail .

This allows the resulting data to be validated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A secondary goal was to make the encoding also be valid RDFRDFMS which allows the document to be manipulated using the RDF model . We have tried to limit the RDF constructs to the minimum , and the result is a mostly standard header and footer for every document . <p> We acknowledge that there will be further documents describing other encodings for DC without these restrictions however this one is for the simplest possible form . One result of the restrictions is that the encoding does not create documents that can be embedded in HTML pages . Please refer to other Dublin Core documents that can describe how to do that . <p> Any well-formed XML document should include a statement of the version of XML used ( and content encoding ) . At present , the only valid version of XML , as defined in the W3C Recommendation , is 1.0 . It is therefore strongly recommended to include the statement <p> For each resource described by Dublin Core elements , they must be enclosed in a container element - a pair of rdf:Description tags - with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or several identifiers and these can be URIs . If a resource has at least one URI , the most appropriate one should be used in the about attribute of the rdf:Description element like this : <p> &lt;rdf:Description about= " http : // .... / " &gt; ... &lt;/rdf:Description&gt; <p> ( see below for what to do about other Identifier elements ) <p> Inside the rdf:Description container , put each of the Dublin Core elements with the dc : namespace prefix before them , so for example the Title element becomes dc:title ( all lowercase ) and used inside the rdf:Description container like this : <p> This can be repeated for all other DCMES elements that are needed with the standard Dublin Core guidelines - all elements are repeatable and optional . Note that there is no requirement on applications consuming this document to preserve the order of elements in the container and therefore you should not expect this to be preserved . <p> If the value of the Dublin Core element is not plain text , but another resource with a URI , that should be recorded using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no content which is done by starting and closing the element at the same time like this : <p> There may be more than one Identifier element for the resource containing URIs or other identifiers . If a URI identifier is available and appropriate to use , it should be made the value of the about attribute of the rdf:Description element as described above . The remaining values of the Identifier elements should be encoded in the same manner as the other elements . Here is a fragment of a description of a book which has a non-URI identifier : <p> It may be that there is no identifier for the resource , in which case neither of the above methods should be used and both the about attribute and Identifier element left out . This is used something like this : <p> XML provides an xml:lang attribute that can be used on any element . This provides a way to describe the language used for the content of the element . The DCMES provides a Language element which is used to describe the language of the resource . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be encoded using the rules of XML when there are special characters in the value . The special characters that need to be encoded , and when they need to be are summarised here for reference : <p> Plain text <p> XML Encoding <p> Required in <p> &amp; <p> &amp;amp ; <p> Element and attribute values <p> &lt; <p> &amp;lt ; <p> Element and attribute values <p> &gt; <p> &amp;gt ; <p> Element and attribute values <p> ' ( apostrophe / single quote ) <p> &amp;apos ; <p> Attribute values <p> " ( double quote ) <p> &amp;quot ; <p> Attribute values <p> Note that the &amp;apos ; and &amp;quot ; only need to be used for those character inside attribute values , which are only needed for the rdf:resource attribute ( see Section 2.4 ) and the xml:lang attribute ( see Section 2.5 ) . <p> All other characters outside the core US-ASCII range of 32-126 should not be encoded with the HTML entities such as &amp;eacute ; since these are not defined in XML . Numeric entities for the characters should be used which are written as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alternatively they can be encoded as Unicode in one of the formats such as UTF-8 which is widely supported . <p> Dublin Core encoded in the method described here can be refered to from an HTML document and associated with it by means of the HTML &lt;LINK&gt; element . The recommended relation type for this purpose is REL= " meta " , used like this : <p> The DTD and example documents have to be validated with an XML parser that can handle URIs for the DTDs . Unfortunately , this is n't very widely supported at present . One online validator that seems to handle this is the service at http : **37;5637;TOOLONG <p> All validating XML parsers support using local files for DTDs in the SYSTEM parameter . This can be used to validate with the DTD by saving it from the URL given in section 2.2 to a local file and amending the DC/XML documents to have , for example : &lt; !

DCMI will need as much detail in documentation around access and process to support long-term sustainability ( including passwords and log-on credentials , particularly for Abi and David on the WordPress site ) . Abi will add comments to code at least , may need to move to Github . <p> Resource Collection : <p> Sean is continuing to catalog the remaining learning resources , and updating already cataloged records to reflect the changes in the CI . He has 2-3 dozen resources left to update , will end up with 450 or so , and may add some additional items . There are some areas such as provenance and storing RDF data with no competencies . Could add resources , but without competency ca n't do that . May be able to flesh some of these out in near term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the competencies are missing from the editor : " Knows Tim Berners-Lee 's principles of Linked Data : use URIs to name things , use HTTP URIs that can be resolved to useful information , and create links to URIs of other things " under the Linked Data Principles topic , and ' Finds properties and classes in the Linked Open Vocabularies ( LOV ) observatory and explores their versions and dependencies " under the Finding RDF Vocabularies topic . This may be related to the manual update process discussed below . <p> Sean also needs to complete documentation on the cataloging tool and other resource management processes and issues and post to WordPress . Additional learning resources will be created by end of month by David Clarke , Sam Oh and Mike Lauruhn , and Sean will catalog these when he receives them . <p> Editorial Board : <p> Marcia has discovered a couple mistakes in the CI : 1 ) a repetition of the competency " Converts/manipulates SPARQL query outputs ( RDF-XML , JSON ) to the exact format required by a third party tools and APIs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of FusionTables instead of Fusion Tables ( per Google usage ) in " Uses Google FusionTables to create maps and charts " . These may be a function of the manual updating process and will be corrected . <p> The Competency Index for Linked Data2 has been published through ASN , so is now available for direct reference with stable URIs for each element of the index . This is something that would be good to provide a link to on the expanded CI page on the LD4PE website , since many educators will want to reference canonical URIs for the competencies in their lessons . Tom has been documenting the editorial process and expects to complete by the end of the month . A final pass at the Index will happen sometime in January , assuming funding can be obtained to continue work , otherwise , we are at a stopping point with the current version . If time permits , a revised workflow , streamlining the process for updating the CI will be completed by end of month as well , assuming Joseph and Tom can coordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mike Lauruhn and Margie Hlava , the prompts and survey used at DC-2016 for the LD4PE workshop have been spread to a wider audience through blogs and tweets , including one on the LD4PE website3 . <p> Margie will also be presenting next month and will add this to our list of presentations and feedback . Marcia 's submission to the iConference ( in Wuhan , China next March 22-25 ) for a Special Session on " Building Learning Modules around the Competency Index for Linked Data " has been accepted- so we will continue to have good exposure for the project in the international arena . Marcia has also had a submission to the Museums and the Web conference in April . Mike L has been collecting a list of public presentations on the project- if you have presented at a meeting , conference or other event in the past two years on the project , please let either Mike L or Mike C know so that we can include in our project report to IMLS . <h> Action items <p> David to add link to published ASN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page on LD4PE website <p> Mike L , Sam Oh , and Dave Clarke send links to their learning resources to Mike C and Sean so they can be cataloged <p> All complete any documentation on processes , lessons learned , architecture so we can add this to the website ( or Github ) to make sure that we have full documentation of the project for future use <p> All send any presentations on the project over past two years ( or upcoming presentations ) to Mike C to include in IMLS project report

@@100424641 @4624641/ <h> DC-2015 , S+o Paulo , Brazil <h> September 1 , 2015 September 4 , 2015 <p> CONFERENCE ABSTRACT : The need for structured metadata to support ubiquitous access across the Web to the treasure troves of resources spanning cultures , in science , and in the digital humanities is now common knowledge among information systems designers and implementers . Structured metadata expressed through languages of description make it possible for us to ' speak ' about the contents of our treasure troves . But , like all human languages , our languages of description both enable and isolate . The push to break out of the isolation of the metadata silos in which professionals inevitably design , implement and manage metadata in order to discover the intersections of our treasure troves drives much of today 's discourse and emerging practice in metadata . The emergence of massively integrated Web presences such as Europeana and the Digital Public Library of America ( DPLA ) along with the reshaping of public access globally through mechanisms such as Linked Data and schema.org drive our conversations , our excitement , and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DCMI community gathers for both its Annual Meeting and its International Conference on Dublin Core &amp; Metadata Applications . The work agenda of the DCMI community is broad and inclusive of all aspects of innovation in metadata design , implementation and best practices . While the work of the Initiative progresses throughout the year , the Annual Meeting &amp; Conference provides the opportunity for DCMI " citizens " as well as newcomers , students , apprentices , and early career professionals to gather face-to-face to share experiences . In addition , the gathering provides public- and private-sector initiatives beyond DCMI that are doing significant metadata work to come together to compare notes and cast a broader light into their particular metadata work silos . Through such a gathering of the metadata communities , DCMI advances its " first goal " of promoting metadata interoperability and harmonization . This year , the Annual Meeting &amp; Conference is being hosted by the Universidade Estadual Paulista " S+o Paulo State University-+ and held in S+o Paulo , Brazil . 
@@100424642 @4624642/ <p> This document specifies an abstract model for Dublin Core metadata . The primary purpose of this document is to specify the components and constructs used in Dublin Core metadata . It defines the nature of the components used and describes how those components are combined to create information structures . It provides an information model which is independent of any particular encoding syntax . Such an information model allows us to gain a better understanding of the kinds of descriptions that we are encoding and facilitates the development of better mappings and cross-syntax translations . <p> This document is primarily aimed at the developers of software applications that support Dublin Core metadata , people involved in developing new syntax encoding guidelines for Dublin Core metadata and people developing metadata application profiles based on DCMI vocabularies or on other compatible vocabularies . <p> The DCMI Abstract Model builds on work undertaken by the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) on the Resource Description Framework ( RDF ) RDF , RDFS . The use of concepts from RDF is summarized below in Section 5 . <p> The DCMI Abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Readers that are not familiar with UML class diagrams should note that lines ending in a block-arrow should be read as ' is ' or ' is a ' ( for example , " a value is a resource " ) and that lines starting with a block-diamond should be read as ' contains a ' or ' has a ' ( for example , " a statement contains a property URI " ) . Other relationships are labeled appropriately . In this document , words and phrases in italics are defined in Section 7 , Terminology . <p> The abstract model of the resources described by descriptions is as follows : <p> Each described resource is described using one or more property-value pairs . <p> Each property-value pair is made up of one property and one value . <p> Each value is a resource - the physical , digital or conceptual entity or literal that is associated with a property when a property-value pair is used to describe a resource . Therefore , each value is either a literal value or a non-literal value : <p> A literal value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-literal value is a value which is a physical , digital or conceptual entity . <p> A literal is an entity which uses a Unicode string as a lexical form , together with an optional language tag or datatype , to denote a resource ( i.e. " literal " as defined by RDF RDF ) . <p> A description set is a set of one or more descriptions , each of which describes a single resource . <p> A description is made up of one or more statements ( about one , and only one , resource ) and zero or one described resource URI ( a URI that identifies the described resource ) . <p> Each statement instantiates a property-value pair , and is made up of a property URI ( a URI that identifies a property ) and a value surrogate . <p> A value surrogate is either a literal value surrogate or a non-literal value surrogate : <p> A literal value surrogate is a value surrogate for a literal value , and is made up of exactly one value string . The value string is a literal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrogate is a value surrogate for a non-literal value , and is made up of zero or one value URI ( a URI that identifies the non-literal value associated with the property ) , zero or one vocabulary encoding scheme URI ( a URI that identifies the vocabulary encoding scheme of which the non-literal value is a member ) , and zero or more value strings . Each value string is a literal which represents the non-literal value . <p> A value string is either a plain value string or a typed value string <p> A plain value string may have an associated value string language that is an ISO language tag ( for example en-GB ) . Plain value strings are intended to be human-readable . <p> The abstract model of the vocabularies used in DC metadata descriptions is as follows : <p> A vocabulary is a set of one or more terms . Each term is a member of one or more vocabularies . <p> A term is a property ( element ) , class , vocabulary encoding scheme , or syntax encoding scheme . <p> Each property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has domain relationship . Where it is stated that a property has such a relationship with a class and the property is part of a property/value pair , it follows that the described resource is an instance of that class . <p> Each property may be related to one or more classes by a has range relationship . Where it is stated that a property has such a relationship with a class and the property is part of a property/value pair , it follows that the value is an instance of that class . <p> Each resource may be an instance of one or more classes . <p> Each resource may be a member of one or more vocabulary encoding schemes . <p> Each class may be related to one or more other classes by a sub-class of relationship ( where the two classes are defined such that all resources that are instances of the sub-class are also instances of the related class ) . <p> Each property may be related to one or more other properties by a sub-property of relationship . Where it is stated that such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever the sub-property is part of a property/value pair describing a resource , it follows that the resource is also described using a second property/value pair made up of the property and the value . <p> Each syntax encoding scheme is a class ( of literals ) . <p> Note that the word " vocabulary " is used here to refer specifically to a set of terms , a set in which the members are properties ( elements ) , classes , vocabulary encoding schemes , and/or syntax encoding schemes . <p> Each non-literal value may be the described resource in a separate description within the same description set - for example , a separate description may provide metadata about the person that is the creator of the described resource . A literal value can not be the described resource in a separate description . <p> The DCMI description set model does not provide an explicit mechanism for indicating the classes of the described resource . Classes of the described resource can either be indicated explicitly using one or more statements in the description or be inferred from the domains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DCMI description set model indicates the distinction between literal values and non-literal values through the presence in a statement of a literal value surrogate or a non-literal value surrogate . For a non-literal value , the DCMI description set model does not provide an explicit mechanism for indicating further the classes of the value . Classes of any given non-literal value can either be indicated explicitly using one or more statements in a separate description about that value or be inferred from the range of the property . For a literal value , the classes of the value can either be indicated explicitly using a syntax encoding scheme of the value string or be inferred from the range of the property . <p> The abstract model presented above indicates that each DC metadata description describes one , and only one , resource . This is commonly referred to as the one-to-one principle . <p> However , real-world metadata applications tend to be based on loosely grouped sets of descriptions ( where the described resources are typically related in some way ) , known here as description sets . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting and the artist . Furthermore , it is often the case that a description set will also contain a description about the description set itself ( sometimes referred to as ' admin metadata ' or ' meta-metadata ' ) . <p> Description sets are instantiated , for the purposes of exchange between software applications , in the form of metadata records , according to one of the DCMI encoding guidelines ( for example , XHTML meta tags , XML and RDF/XML ) DCMI-ENCODINGS . <p> A DC metadata value is the physical , digital , or conceptual entity or literal that is associated with a property when a property-value pair is used to describe a resource . For example , a value associated with the Dublin Core Creator property is a person , organization or service - a physical entity . A value associated with the Dublin Core Date property is a point ( or range ) in time - a conceptual entity . A value associated with the Dublin Core Coverage property is a geographic region or country - a physical entity . A value associated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entity ) or a physical object or person ( a physical entity ) . A value associated with the FOAF name property is a literal . Each of these entities is a resource . <p> Note that this Recommendation does not explicitly define a formal semantics for the DCMI Abstract Model . The intention is that the formal semantics can be defined by reference to the RDF and RDF Schema semantics , as defined in RDFMT . The equivalence between some of the notions in the DCMI Abstract Model and the corresponding RDF notions is given in the following table : <p> Together with the DCMI Recommendation " Expressing Dublin Core using the Resource Description Framework ( RDF ) " DCRDF , these equivalences form the basis of the formal semantics of the DCMI Abstract Model . However , the details of such a semantics is outside the scope of this Recommendation . <p> Particular encoding guidelines ( HTML meta tags , XML , RDF/XML , etc . ) DCMI-ENCODINGS do not need to encode all aspects of the abstract model described above . However , they should refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model are encoded and which are not . <p> Encoding guidelines should indicate how a non-literal value can be treated as a described resource in a separate description in those cases where a non-literal value surrogate does not include a value URI . <p> A value surrogate for a non-literal value , made up of a property URI ( a URI that identifies a property ) , zero or one value URI ( a URI that identifies the non-literal value associated with the property ) , zero or one vocabulary encoding scheme URI ( a URI that identifies the vocabulary encoding scheme of which the value is a member ) , and zero or more value strings ( literals that represent the value ) . <p> Anything that might be identified . Familiar examples include an electronic document , an image , a service ( for example , " today 's weather report for Los Angeles " ) , and a collection of other resources . Not all resources are network " retrievable " ; for example , human beings , corporations , concepts and bound books in a library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two properties which indicates that the two properties are defined such that whenever the sub-property is part of a property/value pair describing a resource , it follows that the resource is also described using a second property/value pair made up of the property and the value . <p> A set of strings and an associated set of rules that describe a mapping between that set of strings and a set of resources . The mapping rules may define how the string is structured ( for example DCMI Box ) or they may simply enumerate all the strings and the corresponding resources ( for example ISO 3166 ) . <p> A literal , optionally associated with either a syntax encoding scheme URI or a value string language . In a literal value surrogate a value string encodes the value ; in a non-literal value surrogate a value string represents the value . <p> The underlying model for Dublin Core metadata has evolved since first formalisms were proposed in the late 1990s . The following table presents rough terminological equivalences between earlier versions of DCMI grammatical principles DCMI-GRAM-PRIN and the current DCMI Abstract Model .

@@100424650 @4624650/ <p> Identifier : LONG ... Description : This is one part of the minutes for the Usage Board meeting of 20-21 September 2009 . See http : **31;5718;TOOLONG . Guidelines for Application Profiles - discussion LONG ... Tom would like a list of what needs to be done to finish guidelines . Do there need to be more things in this document ? Or keep it high level ? Pete - should this be an intro to DCAM too ? This relates to strings and things issues ( literals and non-literals ) . We can expand the model section to do this . This would be the missing section between sections 4 and 5 . This is also related to VES and SES - could we package them all together ? Tom notes the difficulty with explaining " literal " and " non-literal " . Is the point that non-literal values are " all defined outside the immediate metadata record " and that non-literal values are " more controlled and amenable to computer manipulation " ? No . A literal value with a syntax encoding scheme is " controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not . The distinction is : Can it be described ? Describability is the nub of the issue . Andy says ( eduserv blog ) : if the topic is considered a literal value is a descriptive cul-du-sac , no further description of the topic is possible . Andrew will paste Andy 's blog post on the wiki . Point of confusion : typed literals . These can be linked to a context ( cf. W3C DTF ) , but this is still a cul-du-sac because you ca n't say anything more . There is a problem getting beyond a string value / we have to get them to understand the difference in functionality from going from a literal value as a string as something without mediation to a user , to the next step - they need to know the value proposition , but starting from the literal vs. non-literal distinction because they want to help their users . Karen tried to make a typology . But this does n't map onto literal vs. non-literal . Karen 's going in the right direction by saying a literal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too simple , because something is lost : We have two columns : 1 . literal and non-literal 2. uris , typed ... There is debate on where people start : at authority files or not ? and we need to acknowledge where they are and move them to the argument we have to make about these distinctions . Karen has a post from Jason Tamale ( sp ? ) where he uses a relational database as a comparison point to literal and non-literal . What 's the road metaphor for non-literal value ? Can you say that a non-literal value can be ( further ) described ? Yes , but this is not enough . we need to get the metaphor right . Can we get back to the metadata : what you can put in the way the metadata is modeled is not directly related to display If you model something as a literal - it can only be one string ( typed or not ) . If you model something as a non-literal - you can add to it , further describing it ( linking to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionality . It 's shared and linked information not created by them . We can start with the authority control record , but can take it further . We can tell them there is more there - specifically that they can gather more information and link to it , and this is good because it improves the quality of the products they produce . This is the right track because it 's a functional **31;5751;TOOLONG . It is debated that authority control records are a good place to start , people who know this are not , in fact , our largest user group . Other Questions about the Guidelines Document : Is the invented syntax good ? Do we need to do more of this in our documentation ? Could just use the xml fragments throughout . Ultimately it would be nice to see an entirely worked out example of " my bookshelf " . Also , would be nice to see these written out in prose , and then show the xml fragment . Should we add another example or extend the example for a more compelling case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop the RFC3066 reference ( it should be be RFC4646 ) ... Tom did some edits ... it was in section 5 of an early version , but now it 's gone Pete : the diagram in section 4 , because it says " book has part person " , not " book as author person " . And in sec. 5 first bullet , should we add VES , yes we should . The sentence is awkwardly worded , but we can add a sentence or half a sentence about VES as defined by the DCAM . Tom : let 's talk about Andrew 's discussion Andrew : got more confused the more he looked at it . We talked about a way to differentiate between SES and VES . We have said many things in the past . Things vs. strings issue where VES are literal and SES are non-literals , but we still have the issue of what a literal and non-literal are , we will establish that later . We made a formulation in Manzanillo ... ? Tom : In Manzanillo we made a decision about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't make as clear of a distinction , for example SES . Pete : We 've said SES is equivalent as RDF 's notion of datatype , we have said that there is a lexical space - a set of strings , and a set of values to which they map , and there are rules of getting from lexical space to value space . e.g. , W3C DTF , and there 's boolean too , so we have 1 , and true that map to the notion of true , and 0 and false as the notion of false . this is problematic because it can be seen as a controlled vocabulary ... Tom : we went through the exercise of clarifying encoding schemes , see UDC example , see Box example , see ISO 639-2 , representations of the names of languages . This was productive because we made clear in the definitions . It is the set of conceptual resources or a string - and we put those in the definitions . Pete : We have a modelling choice . Do we want to treat languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take language tags as values from an SES . We need to move toward modeling the world as a set of strings or a set of things . Andrew : then it 's down to the modeling , so how do we want to do it ? All SESs could be VESs , so ... does it matter ? Pete : what do you want to do with these values ? So you want BTs to be things , so we can describe them further Andrew : in general do n't we want to say more things ? Pete : it depends , that point in time can be described by many different calendar systems ... it 's always a trade off . Tom : everything as an SES , and in GRDDL transforms is made a SES for HTML . Andrew : but these things can change ... so Tom : Is it appropriate to use a new URI for something that has changed from VES to SES Andrew : So it comes down to us as to whether we want to model the world as VES or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SES ) and as a VES ... we see two ways , and we took a stand on that . Andrew : Working on the idea of how to explain to the community what literals and non-literals are . Tom : we have to understand what this document is doing . We might approach this , we have twenty odd examples , we could have gone either way ( VES or SES ) , but some were clear-cut examples , we might walk through these and quote from the title of the specification to make the point that what is included is a set of strings or we see it as a set of concepts , to account for the decision-making process . Stefanie : question - ISO 639 can be bother a SES and a non-literal - see example in Karen 's Guidelines document . Tom : gets back to the problem of confusing literal with value string - non-literal can have value strings and can be typed . They say " I want a string so I need to model things as a literal " but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SES does not mean literal . VES does not mean non-literal . ACTION : Andrew will produce another draft of SES and VES document , looking back at examples we took a stand on in DCMI Metadata Terms , We decided Box was an SES because of the Box specification document managed by DC . Tom : Stuart , what 's your experience teaching the difference between VES and SES ? Stuart : The students do n't have a problem . They grasp it as well as it is defined . Tom : we need to move on to other things . Let 's move on to Profile Review Criteria themselves - to ask how well they work ( for outsiders and insiders ) . Profile Review Criteria Tom : My personal sense is that checking constraints was a useful exercise . To what extent will APs fit the DSP model ? Tom thinks the review criteria are good in their present form .

In order to repeat an earlier study , to apply data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be able to precisely identify the very subset of data used . While verbal descriptions of how the subset was created ( e.g. by providing selected attribute ranges and time intervals ) are hardly precise enough and do not support automated handling , keeping redundant copies of the data in question does not scale up to the big data settings encountered in many disciplines today . Furthermore , we need to be able to handle situations where new data gets added or existing data gets corrected or otherwise modified over time . Conventional approaches , such as assigning persistent identifiers to entire data sets or individual subsets or data items , are thus not sufficient . In this webinar , Andreas Rauber will review the challenges identified above and discuss solutions that are currently elaborated within the context of the working group of the Research Data Alliance ( RDA ) on Data Citation : Making Dynamic Data Citeable .

@@100424655 @4624655/ <p> LONG ... Date : Mon , 18 Apr 2005 13:58:23 +0200 From : Thomas Baker To : DCMI Usage Board back-channel Subject : Accessibility - new proposal LONG ... Liddy has reacted to the digest of our discussions ( see my summary below ) . My gut feeling is that the best we can do , under the circumstances , is to finalize something rather close to what we " approved " in Shanghai . I propose : Definition : A description of the resource in terms of how it can be perceived , understood , or interacted with by users . Comment : An accessibility description might be used to match the ( digital or physical ) resource to a user on the basis of the user 's ability profile . Implementers wishing to express the values for this element in a machine-readable language should consider treating such expressions as " related descriptions " in terms of the DCMI Abstract Model . In a nutshell : -- The definition returns to " description " ( instead of " statement " ) -- but dc:description itself can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital resources ( and Liddy agrees ; see below ) . -- It does not cite EARL , which is not yet stable ( and Charles agrees ; see below ) . -- It includes a caveat with regard to associating the element with a " related description " . -- It refers to the intended use ( " matching " ) . As we did in fact " approve " such language in Shanghai , it would be awkward to argue that we have since changed our mind ... How to proceed ? Liddy and Charles have not yet seen the proposed text -- I 'm posting it here first . In order to post my summary of their email ( below ) on the public list , I 'd need their approval and , ideally , confirmation that my summary is correct . Hence I 'm posting first to DC-USAGE-BC ... Tom ---- Main background , repeated here as reference ( see earlier summary of the complete discussion ) Proposed definition Definition : " A description of the qualities of the resource in terms of control , display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preferences of a user . " Comment : " The qualities of control , display and content include the user 's control of the interface , the sensory modality of the resource as presented and variations in the expressive form of the information . Recommended best practice is to express the value in a machine-addressable manner such as the W3C Evaluation and Reporting Language ( EARL ) . " UB decision from the meeting notes ( 2005-10-10 ) Agreed to change definition to : " A description of the qualities of the resource in terms of control , display and content that can be used to match the needs and preferences of a user . " Note : need to clarify comment to indicate what is meant by ' control , display and content ' and to note that recommended best practice is to provide a machine-readable statement . Definition on the table as of 11 April Definition : A statement about the ease with which it is possible to use , interact with or comprehend the resource , regardless of the technology used . Comment : Ease of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or interact with a resource -- digital or physical -- regardless of the technology being used . For example , this element may be used for statements about the accessibility of a resource to people who are permanently or temporarily disabled . Users wishing to associate this element with a description of a resource from the standpoint of accessibility -- a " related description " in terms of the DCMI Abstract Model CITE -- should consider expressing the value in a machine-readable language such as the W3C Evaluation and Reporting Language ( EARL ) CITE . Liddy 's reaction to the discussion and proposed definition ( disclaimer : paraphrased by me ) . -- The April 11 definition is not acceptable . The definition and comment make a statement that should not be made by DCMI " for many reasons " . DCMI would , in effect , be " making all the mistakes of non-experts in the field " . -- For Liddy , it is important to hold on to the notion of " can be used to match the needs and preferences of a user . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the object in terms of accessibility characteristics that can be used to match the needs and preferences of a user . " -- Charles agrees , saying that the important thing is that the metadata describes characteristics of the resource that are relevant to its accessibility , " specifically so that appropriate matches can be made between users and resources " . -- Liddy agrees about not enumerating " control , display , and content " as " qualities of a resource " . She prefers a vaguer wording such as " in terms of accessibility characteristics " because this could be broadened to include physical access and whatever else might be discovered as necessary for wheel-chairs and the like . She would not want to restrict the element at this stage , so that they will be able to describe best practice in a variety of circumstances more easily . -- She does agree with broadening the concept by removing references to specific qualities that restrict the scope of the element . That said , for the purposes of clarification : -- " control " is the human-computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the modality -- visual , auditory or tactile ; -- " content " has to do with the intellectual contribution of the resource , service , or other object . -- Liddy agrees that access-as-obtain and access-as-use are different things . The problem with the word ' accessibility ' is well-known and confusion has occurred in many fora , but it is felt that changing the term used would cause even more confusion . Best practice is to avoid the use of the word ' access ' and to always structure sentences so that ' accessibility ' can be used . Conversely , the accessibility community carefully avoid referring to obtainability as ' accessibility ' . -- Liddy agrees that in the W3C world , accessibility is about " intellectual accessibility " -- things like level of difficulty and language . It also seems to have something to do with the ease with which a resource can be used . According to http : **39;6030;TOOLONG , Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web . More specifically , Web accessibility means that the Web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , navigate , and interact with it effectively , as well as create and contribute content to the Web . Web accessibility addresses all disabilities , including visual , auditory , physical , speech , cognitive , and neurological disabilities . -- Liddy agrees that the proposed Accessibility element is not specifically about " Web Accessibility " in the sense of accessibility to digital resources in the context of the Web . Rather , the " Web " part is the idea that the Web is used to ship around the metadata , and the resources described by that metadata need not be digital . For example , in the educational context they could be physical objects such as text books and work sheets . -- Therefore , she agrees that one could use this element to describe the accessibility of a building . In fact , this has been considered and there is already work underway to establish a vocabulary for event and location physical accessibility ( arising from last year 's work in MMI-DC in Europe ) , though in such contexts , she thinks the definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources ' because people do n't think of buildings as ' resources ' . -- She particularly dislikes one of the alternatives we considered ( " A statement about the ease with which the resource can be accessed and used , regardless of the technology being used . " ) . The main objections : -- it is quite different from what was proposed ; -- it does not convey the purpose of the metadata ; -- it uses the bad word ( access ) in a confusing way , hinting at definitions that have been discredited in the field . -- Commenting on text we considered at one point Factors that determine the ease of access and use of the resource include the control of the interface , the sensory modality of the resource as presented and variations in the expressive form of the information . ... she made the following objections : -- the word ' access ' is used incorrectly -- there is an opening for usability in general , which was never intended ; -- the term involves a quality judgment , which seems inappropriate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the the Accessibility property not actually describing the " accessibility " of the resource , but as describing the resource ( itself ) in the context of a process -- involving a description of the resource and a description of the user -- the outcome of which is an indication of the accessibility of that resource for that user . Liddy says that an accessibility statement describes in strict detail the accessibility qualities of the object just like date has details about a date . In other words , she does not at all understand the notion of Accessibility as denoting a relation between a resource and a description of that resource -- where that description describes those specific attributes of the resource that support such an " accessibility assessment " process . -- Liddy agrees that we should be able to use an Accessibility element for an unstructured plain-literal " accessibility statement " . The example she offers is : " This resource conforms to WCAG Level AA " . -- Confusingly -- in light of her suggestion above ! -- Liddy strongly objects to defining Accessibility as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular accessibility benchmark " ( or words to that effect ) -- a wording we considered because it seemed to be what some of the Web pages were about . She explains that the accessibility community has done alot of work to get away from this approach . Conformance statements in this field are very problematic and not helpful anyway as there is no known specification to which conformance guarantees accessibility . -- With regard to our confusion about EARL , she reports that David Weinkauf and Anastasia Cheetham have developed a small EARL generator that produces what they are talking about -- see LONG ... She points to http : **28;6071;TOOLONG for a working demo of a production system using this approach . -- Following URLs she provided , I found LONG ... -- a user guide which explains EARL on the example of TILE . This makes the intended process a bit clearer to me . Basically , it involves comparing " profiles " in XML -- on one hand the profile encoding the accessibility needs and preferences of a user , on the other a profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point with using the Accessibility element ) : When the TILE authoring tool is used to aggregate and publish learning objects , authors are prompted to provide information about the modality of the resources , stating whether or not they contain auditory , visual , textual , or tactile content , as well as any equivalent alternative resources along with their alternative accessibility properties . This information is captured in the resource meta-data profile . Users , on the other hand , are given the option of creating an ACCLIP profile stating their accessibility needs and preferences . Together , this information is used to determine whether or not a requested primary resource should be substituted or supplemented with an equivalent alternative resource , as well as styled ( e.g. , CSS ) or transformed ( e.g. , image to ALT text ) , in order to meet the needs and preferences of the user . -- Charles thinks the technology is reasonably stable in practice but agrees that EARL is not " stable " in terms of process . He therefore agrees that we might drop the reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something machine-readable . Since DC allows literal text , he figures a plain-text accessibility statement would would be feasible though not very useful
