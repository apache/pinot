@@108816379 @4216379/ <p> Brian Wright came to FAU in January of 2012 and was elevated to Interim Head Coach in October of 2013 . Upon the hiring of Charlie Partridge , Wright elected to stay with the program to build what he had begun as FAU 's offensive coordinator . He was named Associate Head Coach/Offensive Coordinator and Quarterbacks Coach by Partridge in December of 2013 . <p> As the Interim Head Coach , Wright drew the team together " realizing it was about the team , the family and being better men " to capture the four-consecutive games , including a victory over Tulane who would earn a New Orleans ' Bowl berth at season 's end . Wright 's reign as interim head coach came to an end with a perfect 4-0 record and the team becoming bowl eligible for the first time since 2008 . FAU 's offense , led by sophomore quarterback Jaquez Johnson , outscored its last four opponents 151-40 , averaged 428.8 yards per game , including a single-game average 240.5 yards on the ground . Defensively , the Owls finished the regular-season ranked No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an average of one per game in 2012 . Half of the sacks , 16 , were recorded in the team 's last four games . <p> Wright accepted the added responsibility as head coach much like he had attacked the task of building an offensive coaching staff upon coming to FAU in 2012 and the task of converting FAU to an up-tempo attack as opposed to the pro-style which had been the Owls ' mainstay since inception . To make his task more difficult , he had to do so with just three-starting newcomers returning . By game two the starting quarterback position was solidified . Wright and the offensive staff made great strides by playing to the strengths of each individual and not forcing or sticking to one answer . It began with the quarterbacks . In 2012 , senior QB Graham Wilbert improved his efficiency by 68% moving from 91.72 as a junior to 134.62 as a senior . He reduced his interceptions to six after tossing double-digits in 2011 . More importantly for the team , Wilbert spread the ball to eight different receivers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wright 's system allowed Wilbert to look for answers all over the field which opened the door for the senior to have career games with a season high 403 passing-yards against in-state rival FIU . He used the knowledge of the new system to hurt opponents with the short pass while also finding receivers with 50 , 60 and 75 yard passes . Protecting the quarterback was a key to the team 's success . FAU was T-104 nationally in sacks allowed prior to Wright 's arrival . They improved that rank by 21 spots in 2012 providing more options for the offense to work . To off-set this loss of NFL draftee Alfred Morris , Wright and the offense saw seven individuals carry the ball more than once and not one ended the season with negative yardage and as a unit , they tallied just 38 yards less than the previous season with a dominate running back . Much of that success can be attributed to fewer sacks eliminating the negative 179 yards lost by the previous season 's quarterbacks . To exemplify the total improvement , FAU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards by improving its average yards per game by 102 yards per game . The 2015 offensive addition began the year by posting 44 points in an overtime loss to Tulsa . One week later that shocked the southeast with a first half performance versus the University that sent the two teams into intermission with a 20-20 score . Junior running back had rushed for nearly 140 yards prior to the break and an injury . By seasons ' end , the Owls running attach mirrored Wright 's previous two seasons with his 2014 , 2015 and 2013 being the top three team rushing seasons in the Owls history . His dual threat quaterback scheme , led by Jaquez Johnson also etched Johnson in the record books as the only Owl in program history to surpass the 5,000 yard passing and 1,500 yard rushing plateau . <p> Since coming to FAU in 2012 , Wright has improved the Owls ' total offensive ranking nationally from its season ending 120 , out of 123 schools , to a No. 83 spot at the end of the 2013 regular-season . In 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoring offense . By 2013 that rank had climbed 40 spots to No. 79 , including the use of 12 different scoring options . The most prolific was Johnson who rushed for 10 touchdowns , the most of any quarterback in the history of FAU . He was responsible for 22 scores in 2012 which list him among the program 's top-10 all-time career scorers with two remaining seasons to play . <p> In 2013 , Wright led the Owls to their third-consecutive season averaging 20+ points per game . FAU has had a similar span from 2007-09 and played in two bowl games during that stretch but did so under two different coordinators . Wright 's up-tempo offense was directed by second year starter Jaquez Johnson , who much like his first season under center , concluded his campaign ranked nationally in 14 categories , including No. 56 nationally in passing efficiency . Johnson , will play his final season in 2014 and is in position to break nearly every FAU quarterback record and is listed in 3-of-5 rushing all-time categories . Wright also had the opportunity to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C-USA in receptions and was No. 18 nationally in all-purpose yards . Johnson and Whitehead 's ability to connect and the team 's scoring success can be attributed to its ground game . Under Wright 's direction the team has averaged 154.6 rushing yards per game . Using multiple backs , the Owls set an all-time program high 2,225 yards in 2013 and tallied the program 's second most in 2014 with 1,963 . <p> At Montana StateBrian Wright spent his first two seasons at Montana State debunking the notion that the transition to a new offensive system is inherently difficult . Wright 's two Bobcat offenses , led by dynamic quarterback DeNarius McGhee , averaged 440.6 yards per game , easily the most productive two-year span in school history . After leading the Big Sky in scoring offense , total offense and passing offense in 2010 , Wright 's unit topped the league in scoring offense and total offense in Big Sky games in 2011 .

At USC , wed finished our first year , we were 6-6 and lost to Utah in the Vegas Bowl . It was not like recruiting to USC , not like what you 're used to .

Being in those interviews , you can tell sometimes that of the four or five people in that room that you 're meeting with , maybe two or three of them want to do something special . I could feel everyone in that room was committed to doing something really special . Why not build something special and take it to where its never gone before and continue to do that ? Pete ( Carroll ) would say all the time , anybody can win once . You can have one year because you fall into a great quarterback , or the ball bounces the right way or you get some good calls , but can you do it over and over and over again ? That 's what success is , and that 's what were getting ready to do here .

McCormack cites five leading candidates to make up the starting rotation , helping to offset the loss of two mainstays from last season , David McKay and Brandon Rhodes . <p> Junior righthander Marc Stewart and senior lefthander Sean Labsan are the two most experienced starters back . They combined to go 11-1 on the mound a season ago . Stewart , 6-0 with a 3.58 ERA , was second on the team in innings pitched with 78 , behind Rhodes 99 . Labsan was fourth , with 46 frames in 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERA . Both held opposing hitters to a .240 batting average or better . <p> Junior Alex House , a key member of the 2016 bullpen , is expected to move into the rotation . The 6-3 righty pitched all 23 of his games in relief , and was 2-1 with a 3.13 ERA . Similarly , Nick Swan , a sophomore southpaw who is coming off a C-USA All-Freshman campaign , will be stretched out for a starting role . Swan had 19 appearances with two starts in his debut season , posting a 3-0 record and a 3.09 ERA . Between he and House , the duo punched out 52 opposing hitters and walked just 25 total . <p> That quartet will be joined by junior college transfer Jake Miednik . At Walters State Community College , the 5-10 lefthander was 13-1 , struck out 127 batters in 79.2 innings pitched , and was named National JUCO Pitcher of the Year . <p> " Those at this point look to be the five starters , " said McCormack . " Stewart and Labsan have the most experience returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two starts and House of course was huge in our bullpen , but we 'd like to see if he can make the transition into the rotation . Newcomer Jake Miednik , who was 13-1 and an All-American last year in Junior College , will look to make an impact . He gives us depth and it gives us three lefties in the rotation . <p> " You feel really good about the fact that with Stewart and Labsan , with 25 starts last year between them , and Swan and House , with about 20 appearances each , there 's a lot of guys with Division I experience . With that being said , Miednik also had 14 starts last year and 20 starts over the last two years , so he has experience as well . I like the group as a whole and I think that they all will be successful in their own right . Its just a matter of getting these guys starts early in the year and see where things fall into place .

Of all nationwide returnees , the senior righty ranks second with 15 saves and shut down his opposition to the tune of a .182 batting average and just five earned runs in 28 innings pitched ( for a 1.61 ERA ) . <p> While the end of the relief staff is shored up , the team will have to make up for the departure of three talented setup men , all of which signed with MLB organizations following the end of their FAU playing careers : Devon Carr , Robbie Coursel and Colyn OConnell . McCormack has a lot of options at the ready to lead that effort . <p> " I think were going to have a really strong bullpen , " he said . " Ever since I 've been a head coach , I 've wanted a great bullpen . It shortens the games and you do n't  tax the starters as much . It starts with Cameron Ragsdale and his 15 saves , then you have Mark Nowatnick , who had a number of high-pressure innings last year , so he s prepared . Kyle Marman has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he s really taken a jump and I think he s really prepared to contribute in a big way . <p> " Two other returning guys , Jordan Poore and Eric Keating , both left-handed , have had very good fall seasons and that has continued into the spring .

And to keep our tradition of having a sidearm-righty , we have Drew Peden on staff , hell give us an opportunity to give our opponents a different look . <p> " Two others that are going to help out in some form or fashion and have had good preseasons are Blake Sanderson and Nick Prather .
