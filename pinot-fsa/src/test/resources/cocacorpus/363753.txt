Parents may also wonder if they are doing enough and if their child is getting the therapy they need . <p> It 's also easy for parents to feel alone and worry about their child being left out or left behind . Moms and dads may feel like outsiders in certain situations and worry about the future for their child . It 's also common for parents to feel guilty and worry about how siblings are affected . <h> Ways to be Supportive of Parents <p> School-based therapists can play an important role in supporting parents of special needs children . Consider the following suggestions : <p> Ask parents how they are doing : When you have the opportunity , spend a few minutes getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few kind words or taking a little time to ask how they are doing can make a difference . <p> Offer suggestions on activities : Parents of a child with special needs may need suggestions on what types of activities to do at home to help their child progress . It 's also helpful to provide information on what goals you 're working on , and how parents can reinforce therapy work at home . <p> Do n't criticize : You may not agree with everything a parent does or their parenting style , but it 's not your job to criticize . Of course , if you see or know about something that is harmful , you are obligated to speak up . <p> Provide resources : Be prepared to offer parents resources for community organizations and agencies that may be helpful . Many communities offer services for children with special needs , such as recreational programs or parent support groups . <p> Offer good news when appropriate : It 's nice for parents to hear something positive about their child or their progress . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a student is doing or what goals have been reached . A little praise and good news can boost morale and confidence for both students and parents .

The COTA works directly with an occupational therapist in any number of settings including hospitals , clinics , schools , and treatment centers . Usually the COTA helps provide rehabilitation for patients who are suffering from a variety of medical problems . These problems may be physical , emotional , mental , or developmental depending on the type of facility the COTA is serving . <p> To become an occupational therapist assistant , you must receive and associate degree or certification from a special training program . While this is helpful and necessary , most training will occur on the job , as techniques and preferences vary depending on the occupational therapist the COTA will be working with . <p> Many of the schools I 'm familiar with use COTAs to help fill the requirements of IEPs and 504 plans . Employing an occupational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , they often have the occupational therapist go in and evaluate individual students and create a treatment plan for each student . A COTA will then go in and help students with the exercises or activities outlined by the occupational therapist . The COTA will also keep detailed records of each session and provide regular feed back to the occupational therapist . The occupational therapist can then schedule routine follow-ups to check on progress and make adjustments to the treatment plan as needed . This allows a small school district to utilize the services of one therapist throughout the county and minimize cost without appreciably affecting the care of the students . <p> In a hospital or center setting , the COTA will typically have more clerical duties in addition to assisting with therapy exercises , preparing therapy machines and areas , and working with the occupational therapist .

It is important that the COTA be sensitive to that pain or frustration without allowing the patient to subvert his or her own treatment by not pushing themselves to their limit . This can be especially difficult for COTAs who work with children , in a school , or any other setting . Being able to walk the line between compassion and necessity is a skill learned on the job and not in a class . <p> What have you learned as a certified occupational therapy assistant that you never even thought of while in school or training ? <p> I found this article very informative and even though the error was made about Cotas being displayed as an OT assistant , as a COTA with almost four years under my belt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate , sensitive to their disability .

If you are an adrenaline junkie and thrive on a fast paced working environment , you may already know ER nursing is for you . But working as a nurse in the emergency room is not like it looks like on television . If you are considering becoming an ER nurse there are several things to consider , such as working conditions , what types of patients you will see and the pros and cons . <p> What Types of Patients Do You Treat ? <p> The type of patients you see in the ER will vary depending on the size of the ER , city you live in , and even by the time of year . For instance , if you work in a large emergency room , you are likely to see a little of everything , including patients with injuries from car accidents , assaults , and drug overdoses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely treat patients who have cardiac and respiratory emergencies , infectious diseases and stroke patients . You will also encounter patients with injuries , such as fractures , dislocations and cuts . <p> Keep in mind , not all patients who come to the emergency room are having a true medical emergency . Some patients come for flu symptoms , psychological issues , and other non-life-threatening problems . <p> Advantages of ER Nursing <p> There are several things you may like about working in the emergency room including the following : <p> Great Experience : Since you will see all types of injuries and illnesses , working in the ER provides great experience . Even if you eventually go into another area of nursing your ER experience will be a great benefit . <p> Variety : - No two days are the same , which helps prevent boredom and keeps the job interesting . <p> Rewarding : It is very rewarding to play a part in helping someone who is in a life threatening situation .

Dealing with critically i 'll patients can be an interesting challenge , but also can cause stress . <p> Emotionally Tough Cases : In the ER , you may see all types of situations including child or elder abuse . You will see victims of violent crimes and tragic accidents . If you are going into ER nursing , you will need to learn how to deal with these types of situations and leave work behind . <p> Fast Paced Environment : Although some people may consider working in a fast paced environment a positive , others may view it as a negative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands .

@@76898571 @5598571/ <h> The Difference Between a Nurse Practitioner ( NP ) and a Physician Assistant ( PA ) <p> by Angela Stevens on May 25 , 2009 <p> As many patients know , people rarely see a medical doctor for routine physical examinations anymore . They are far more likely to have an appointment with a Nurse Practitioner ( NP ) or Physician Assistant ( PA ) who works in the practice . Many people are unaware of what each title actually means . I 'm embarrassed to admit that I did n't know the difference for a very long time . What is the difference between a Nurse Practitioner and a Physician Assistant ? <p> Nurse Practitioners <p> A Nurse Practitioner is a registered nurse ( RN ) who also has a Master 's degree and clinical experience . The NP may work independently or as a member of a health care team . He or she helps to educate patients , with a focus on health maintenance , counseling , and disease prevention . A nurse practitioner must choose a particular specialty during his or her training . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure better patient outcomes , and may involve the patient 's family in their treatment plan . A Nurse Practitioner has a collaborative relationship with physicians . <p> Nurse Practitioners have a median 36-hour work week , with a median salary of $73,000 annually . They may work in a variety of settings and specialties , including family medicine , neonatal , pediatrics , geriatrics , obstetrics and gynecology , acute care , occupational health , or as Certified Nurse Midwives and Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists . <p> Physician Assistants <p> A Physician Assistant is a licensed health professional who has passed the national certificated exam that is administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants . He or she does not choose a specialty , but must complete a clinical rotation through various specialties without regard to post-graduation career path . The PA works under the supervision of a physician to provide preventative , diagnostic , and therapeutic health care services . He or she helps take medical histories , examine patients , treat patients , order and interpret lab tests , order and interpret x-rays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In most states , a PA also has prescribing privileges . A Physician Assistant may also participate in managerial or supervisory duties . <p> Physician Assistants have a median 32-hour work week , with a median salary of $69,000 . They may work in a variety of settings and specialties , including family medicine , pediatrics , obstetrics and gynecology , internal medicine , emergency medicine , orthopedics , general surgery , thoracic surgery , and geriatrics . Those who specialize in surgery are involved in preoperative and postoperative care ; they may also work as assistants during major surgery . <p> Nurse Practitioner or Physician Assistant ? <p> Both Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants can play important roles in health care practices . Patients are in good hands , whether they are treated by a PA or NP . Prospective students should consider becoming a Nurse Practitioner if they favor the nursing model or a Physician Assistant if they favor the medical model . <p> You failed to point out that NPs are also licensed health care professionals that sit for National Boards as well depending on their speciality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , NPs do focus on health promotion and disease prevention , but they are also vital to diagnosing , interpreting lab results , and some read x-rays as well depending on the practice . There is a lot of the " medical " side that NPs perform , but yes , they embrace the nursing model which is what makes nurses nurses . <p> PAs have a supervisory agreement with their supervisory physician . PAs have 100% of their patient charts reviewed within 24 hours . While NPs have a collaborative agreement with their physician practice which determines the percentage of their charts that must be reviewed . It is my understanding the percentages differ from practice to practice . <p> I have worked directly with a NP in an occupational medicine practice . Both of us performed the exact same tasks , ordering/interpreting labs , X-Rays , etc <p> I am trying to decide which school I should go to . P.A. or N.P. I have been a tech in the hospital for 8 years now . I love patient care I do believe I do n't  want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sciences and how everything in the body syncronizes . I am also interested in knowing if there are travel assignment possibilities for either . Can anyone lend some advice please ? Thank you very much ! <p> What exactly are the limitations for a NP vs a PA . NP can practice independant from a physician whereas a PA can not . But what exactly are the advantages and disadvantages of each . I have my BSN and trying to decide which route to take ? <p> Deciding factors as to whether one should pursue a degree as a Nurse Practitioner or a Physician Assistant is primarily dependent upon the State in which you will be working . In many cases , the pay is relatively equal , as are the duties and level of responsibility . Another question would be what the MDs in any given area prefer . For many , the preference is the NP because of the independence factor , while other Physicians have exactly the opposite opinion they would rather employ a professional that extends their clinical reach , but within defined paramaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fairly misunderstood . NPs are " independent " in that their nursing license is issued by the sate nursing boardhowever the " collaborative practice " arrangement that permits these RNs to perform medical acts as NPs is a defacto supervisory arrangement with a physician or physician practice . Only in rare circumstances would one find an NP practicing medicine ( often referred to as advanced practice nursing ) without some definite connection to a physicians license . Similarly , PAs funstion under a supervisory or practice agreement . It is common for PAs to practice under the " general " supervision of a physicianthat is without the physician presentalso there are many instances where PAs are not required to have co-signatures for charts , and in my own state the only requirement is that the PA must meet with the supervising physician once every 6 months . NPs in my state are required to have " written protocols " whereas PAs are not . <p> PAs do specialize and in fact , about 50% do . They also have the flexibility to cross over into various specialties because their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to salary surveys I have read for both disciplines , PAs earn a higher median salary than NPs ( from their own organizations ) . Also , PAs have prescriptive ability in all , rather than " most " states . The real point to the layperson should simply be that both providers are well-educated , properly licensed , and in the same clinical setting perform essentially the same job with an equal degree of capability . <p> I am not demeaning the article , which did present good information , but it does seem a bit slanted towards an NP view of NPs vs . PAs and not a true comparison of the two different disciplines . <p> I 'm curious about the pay rate / work hours info . The information ( and sequence and phrasing ) appear very similar to that from a Berkeley article of a couple of years ago . Assuming ( without judging ) that this was the primary source , I 'm wondering if PAs in fact tend to work less hours than NPs . The exact phrasing in the Berkeley article is : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2004 ) : $73,620 annually , working 36+ hours a week " and " Median PA National Salary ( 2006 ) : $69,517 annually , working 32 hours a week " <p> So is the median work week info cross-verified , or is this just general rate/hour info without claim of actual median weekly work hours ? <p> Yes , NPs are highly educated medical practitioners who can diagnose , treat , read labs and initiate treatment . NPs also at the same time do disease prevention and management . The education of an NP starts from being an RN to BSN and then to masters level . And its true , NPs collaborate but for special situations that we acnnot handle . NPs can run their own clinic and offers high qaulity care to sick patients . NPs can write prescritions without a physician , they have their own DEA number and furnishing number . PAs can not practice without a doctor . If I were to choose . NP had extensive training both in nuring and medicine . <p> I just wanted to clarify a few points from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a collaborative agreement with a physician , but this is usually a few charts reviewed quarterly . There are many states where NPs can practice independently without any physician involvement ( although there are statesusually in the Southwhere NPs are supervised just like PAs ) . Often times in rural areas NPs are the only health care providers around , and they frequently have their own clinics . I do n't  know what the " written protocols " he is talking about . NPs use evidence based medicine just like physicians to make medical decisions ( including diagnosis , prescriptions , and any other diagnostic tests ) . NPs all have nursing background , and therefore usually have years of nursing experience ( I worked 8 years in an ICU ) as well as a better understanding of the patient experience . As only 2% of graduating MDs are going into primary care , NPs are estimated to be the majority of primary care providers in the near future . <p> I am a senior in college majoring in Nutritional Science and trying to decide whether to go onto become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going nuts ! I am a people person , a leader , and agree more with the nursing model as I enjoy work more directly with the actually person as a whole , however , PA seems quite appealing too ! HELP ! <p> Hi Alisa You do n't mention what state you are in , so I will address your question in general . ( Different states have different criteria . ) The main difference is the level of autonomy ( and your relationship with the physician with whom you choose to collaborate ) . NPs are , in general , more autonomous than PAs . PAs work more directly , on a daily basis , with the physician . The actual day to day care is usually the same , with the exception of prescribing privilegeswhich is different for every state . They both diagnose and treat medical conditions . Just coming out of college , the quickest way to go would be Physician Assistant , since you do n't have ( or at least did n't mention ) any previous Nursing experience and there are two-year ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make sure to choose one that is accredited . The AAPA website ( www.aapa.org ) can direct you to one in your area . Be aware , too , that many programs will require some previous healthcare experience ( i.e. EMT , Medical Assistant , etc . ) . Good luck with your decision ! You sound like a wonderful candidate no matter which path you choose ! -Sherry Crews <p> Sherry- I go to school in Minnesota , but am from Wisconsin and am willing to practice anywhere afterwards . I have always had a passion to work with kids , am very hands on , and thoroughly enjoy the nursing model , however , I am starting to be pushed towards becoming a PA rather than an NP . I plan to get my CNA soon as well as other healthcare experience , but as of now I am at a stand still . I appreciate any advice ! <p> If you are currently in school for your CNA training and wish to work as a CNA for awhile ( to get the coveted healthcare experience ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your research . It is possible to go through a PA program within two years or so . Going in that direction would allow you to work sooner than attacking a lengthy nursing program . So , if that 's important to you , the PA route would be the best bet . If you have plenty of time ( and earning money is not an immediate issue ) , I suggest the nursing path . However , there is no rule that says you cant do both ! <p> As noted above , I think it is important to point out that NPs have all of the same medical privileges as you pointed out for the PA . We diagnose , treat , and have prescriptive authority . In fact , in NYS a nurse practitioner is an independent provider , where a PA must work under the direct supervision of a physician . Somehow the term " nurse " in the title of the practitioner seems to allow for the belief that we do not perform these services , when in fact , we not only perform them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supervising doctor . We do require a collaborative agreement with a physician , and rightfully so . Isnt collaboration what medicine is all about anyway ? So please be sure gentle reader that a you understand : a NP likely has had multiple years of clinical experience prior to entering into an accreditation program , providing him/her with an outstanding knowledge base clinically . We are INDEPENDENT providers . This needs to be pointed out as a distinct difference between an NP and a PA . Every PA I know has an excellent ability to diagnose and treat . I am blessed to work with several that are outstanding , so there should be no concern that the care provided by a PA is less than that of a NP ; they simply are required to have supervision and more oversight in their daily delivery of care . <p> Take this with a grain of salt , because I am neither a PA nor an NP yet , but I have seen both in action as a paramedic and nurse , and offer the following comments . Civilian PAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their scope of practice , duties , privileges and responsbilities . Individuals interested in military medicine/healthcare ( as I am ) should be aware that PAs and NPs are currently assigned quite different missions within the armed forces , owing to the historical nature of nursing and PA . The first PAs came from returning Vietnam-veteran corpsman and medics , whose considerable experience found no exact civilian counterpart . These were trained under the hurry-up medicial training model used in WWII , and PAs were the result . To this day , many medics and corpsmen become PAs . Nurse-practitioners come mostly from nursing , which is historically a female-dominated profession . Fair or not , the army , navy , etc. use PAs very differently than NPs . The former in more-stereotypically male roles nearer to the front , NPs in missions the nurse corps has always received . The services are beginning to change in how they use PAs and NPs , but the old ways do persist . For anyone interested in military medicine , as I am , weigh this factor in your decision-making . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nurse-anesthetists do many of the same cases as anesthesia MDs , and at considerably less cost . CRNAs can practice independently in many states , and are very widely used in the military , where many are men . CRNAs are very well-compensated , making well into the six figures , some as high as 170K/year . It is a pre-requisite to have done 2+ years in ICU/ER nursing , before admission to a masters program . Training takes two years . My brother is an MD in anesthesia , and recommended CRNA to me . My interests lie elsewhere , but someone reading this may want to explore this crucial specialty . <p> My investigations show that PAs get a generalist education , and specialize later ; APNs are forced to choose a specialty earlier in their training , while still in school . Both approaches have their merits ; choose according to your learning style and tastes . Similarly , a semantic point is that PAs are " medical " practioners , while NPs are " nursing " practitioners . Strep throat is strep throat , a fractured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says on it , but be aware that these terms and distinctions will follow you around in your professional life . <p> I 've seen more PAs assisting in surgery than NPs , but the latter are becoming more common . Some hospitals and docs use PAs only , others NPs only . Both are heavily-used in under-served areas , such as inner-cities and rural areas . <p> Anyone know of a source for comparing PA and NP side-by-side , in terms of duties , scope of practice , income , hours , state regs , etc. ? I 'm still making up my mind . Also , is there a clear advantage in terms of cost and length of training for one or the other , or financial aid avalable ? I 'm probably leaning toward the PA route , but not yet decided for certain ; there are pros-and-cons to both . <p> I found your comparison on the differences between a Nurse Practitioner and Physician Assistant very informative . I 'd like to read further . Do you have an information source or reference on the material ? Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminology is all semantics . Its funny how the percentages of PAs and NPs that own their own clinics is the same at 2 percent . And yes , technically an NP can be " independent " of a physician , but he or she will be extremely limited in the services he or she can provide . The fact is PAs receive far greater didactic and clinical education . An NP has 500 and 700 didactic and clinical hours , respectively , while a PA has 1000 and over 2000 . And being a nurse before being an NP does not mean you 're better suited for diagnosis or therapeutic treatment . Nurses do neither of those two things . I 'm a nurse who is becoming a PA because I know PAs are better trained . Right out of school a PA is better . After a few years working an NP and PA are comparable . <p> Dear Friends , I have a friend who is a PA , but who would like to obtain certification as a NP . This is due because in the third world country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize PAs , but does recognize NPs . Any suggestions ? Thanks . <p> I am a freshman at a community college in maryland and right now I plan on becoming an RN , then transfering to a 4-year school and receiving my BSN . So basically I 'm trying to become a nurse practitioner , but then I heard about a Physician Assitant . I sorta know the difference between the two . But I still cant decide . I am a people person , I want to help and diagnose patients . I jus want a high and rewarding position in the medical field . Can someone help me to decide PLEASE . <p> As pointed out by BSN2PA " collaboration " and " supervision " probabaly are just semantics . I however do feel they are not paying their nursing background due justice .. I too have a BSN and currently work in a rural healthcare clinic as an APN . While working as an RN were there not times that something was wrong with your patient and you knew what was causing their problem and you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw , felt , or knew was their " diagnosis " ? If you never had that type of patient encounter then I can see how you could make a statement referring that having a background as a RN does not make you better suited to diagnose and treat . No RNs can not do those things but the knowledge gained from the experience should not be undermind . The amount of clinical hours per APN course varies but 1000 hours does seem to be around the standard .. as compared to the PA program that may be around 1500 to 2000 hours . Here I must state that anyone with any type of Bachelors degree with NO medical knowledge can become a PA . Now.without bias I feel that no matter which program someone elects to persueit comes down to how much time and effort they put in to their studies as well as their clinicals that will determine how good/great of a provider they will become no matter what type of background they have . <p> I have been an RN for the past 3.5 years in Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am trying to decide between being an NP or a PA . I feel that I have a good grasp on medical conditions due to my experience and am leaning towards PA school . It seems more intense and more expensive than becoming an NP . Any advice ? <p> I was an LPN for years , got my ADN , in BSN school , and planning on NP school when I graduate . I decided this when I was a new LPN grad 8 years ago and every week gets me closer to my goal ! My cousin is planning on going to PA school , mainly because RN school is so hard to get into . <p> Putting the expense aside , as well as difficulty getting in ( and through ) any particular course of study , the bottom line is how independent do you wish to function ? If autonomy is of utmost importance to you ( i.e. running your own clinic ) , then NP is the route I suggest you take . If you prefer being under the guidance of an MD on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all due Respect to NPs : I am a licensed RN and was considering becoming an NP , in fact , it was my plan all along when I was going to nursing school because I talked to a number of NPs and PAs and they informed me that " NPs and PAs essentially did the same job . " Some of these licensed professionals could not even tell me exactly what the difference was , so I decided that nursing was the way to go , given that I would be in the hospital sooner , just in case I did n't  end up enjoying my future job . Well , my twin brother is getting his PA degree , and he and some very close friends of mine , have told me that the NPs they have encountered have not been adequately prepared for practicing medicine . A trusted physician even spoke earnestly concerning the fact that well NP students came to his clinic to learn 2X per week , PA students came 5 days a week . He said , with no disdain , that NPs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nightingale " and " caring . " This upset me a great deal , given what my plans for the future were , however , I must emphasize that the doctor did not say this to an NP or to be mean or arrogant , but it was out of kindness that he was honest with myself . An NP student in fact , reportedly was extremely upset and dissapointed because he was going to NP school , and when he was in the clinic , he was realizing that he did not have the skills he needed . I meant an RN getting her NP license at a hospital where I was working and she informed that the first two classes she was taking , were , " Theory of Caring , " And " Ethics of Caring . " While caring is very important in healthcare , and a holisitc view of the patients well-being is vital , I do not believe that a person who already has a BSN , needs another class on how to " care " for patients . Myself , I can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do so regardless of if someone was teaching me " how to care . " Certainly these " caring classes " are not vital to a graduate level program . If you are an RN and do n't  know how to care , you will never learn how and you should leave medicine . I write this comment only to try and help those who might read it . I have the utmost respect for nurses , as I am myself one of them . While MDs give orders and have a larger amount of medical knowledge , Nurses hold the hospital together . I salute those people who are attempting to advance their abilities to care for others by getting their NP , but I would HIGHLY recommend that if you are an RN looking to advance their degree that you choose the PA route . <p> Thanks to the many people who spoke up in an effort to clarify this subject and present a more balanced view of the pros and cons of each practice . I can attest to the fact , having taught midlevel students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more " medical " education , while NPs get a more " nursing " oriented one . That point was well taken . PAs get roughly 75% of a medical school education , while NPs get advanced nursing training with some emphasis on recognizing and diagnosing disease . Both groups display a greater concern for patient comfort and concerns than many MDs are taught , or perhaps feel they have time for , however . I practiced in Maryland in a practice that generally used its NPs to staff the school based health clinics . In office practice , we found they tended to perform " PEs " , referring the complex problems for a future visit to either the MDs or PAs in the practice . PAs were sometimes turned away from jobs , especially in pediatrics , as being " overqualified " . This highlights the fact that PAs receive a greater degree of technical training in procedures and surgical , including minor surgical , skills and therefore are qualified to specialize in fields other than family practice and general pediatrics . It is a frightening prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " independent " practice ( though they do precisely this in several states ) . One of the strengths of the PA profession is that it defines itself as a dependent one , always associating PAs with MDs , however loose an association may be permitted by state law . It has always mystified me that some physicians consider PAs more of a potential threat while seeing none in NPs who , after all , are the ones who grant themselves the right to practice independently . Prescriptive practice also varies across the country , although , I believe , at this point , with some variations , it is nearly universal to both groups . NPs led the way , chronologically , because their " privilege " sprang from the nursing lobby which was eager to grant it ( whether or not pharmacists were eager to fill those prescriptions ) rather than the medical one which was more circumspect about sharing this function . <p> Also to Rachelle , and in response to the remark made by Ms Crews , " If you prefer being under the guidance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then welcome to PA school ! " <p> One of the things to be alert to when looking for a job as a midlevel provider is the degree of autonomy granted by a particular situation . There are NPs , as I stated , who work only in school clinics . There are PAs who are nothing but " yes men " ( or women ) . Either may find him/herself in a position where they are expected to see a patient , run to the MD with a report , get advice on what to do next , run back and do it and then return again to have any Rx either written or approved . This is an extremely wasteful and inappropriate use of a midlevel practitioner and one , I hope , which has gone the way of the horse and buggy . PAs are EQUALLY likely to find themselves working in a practice where they see their own patients , make their own diagnoses and plans and write their own prescriptions . The comfort of working with other professionals and the reason an independent NP practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , minds nearby with which to consult . I know in our practice , MDs consulted PAs quite as frequently , in their areas of expertise , as PAs did MDs ! In other words , choose your path by the quality of the education you think you will receive : not by any " were better than they are " advice you may be given . Hours , incidentally , are as variable as salary and responsibility : it will be your job to hammer out an arrangement that satisfies your needs . <p> what are you trying to say , sorry i can not understand oh being in some western country can say what all you want i am not against some western guy , i am an indian and if i was weak in studies i can be a nurse just blaber that 's what u know i wasted my time jesus <p> I believe that , despite the extensiveness of the PA schooling versus the schooling for NPs , NPs obviously work independently without concern and have done so for awhile now . Any persons worry over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the groups abilities in practice , not just assuming because one is different from the other that one is better . This is Evidence-Based Practice . <p> I am sorry but I would really like to know where the author of this article received their information . There are so many fallacies and misleading information in this obviously not well thought out , and unresearched article it makes my stomach turn . I personally do not know any PAs that work a 32 hour work week . As a cardiothoracic surgery PA we work a median 50-60hr work week with the addition of call hoursyes , call . As a matter of fact the didactic training as well as the clinical internships that a PA must endure is far more intense and demanding than that of a nurse practitioner . By the way , you cant go to physician assistant school part-timeunlike NPs . Physician assistants are trained under a medical model with courses and internships mentored by physicians .. not nurses or nurse practitioners . Nurse Practitioners are still trained under a nursing model and nursing theory with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exam and for recertification must pass a board exam every six years ( nps never have to take their boards again after initial certification ) . In addition , PAs must complete 100 hours of CME every two years to stay certified .. 50 of them being category I credits . Category I CME are approved by the American Medical Association which are what physicians are required to complete as well . NPs are not required to complete CME , but rather CEUs which are nursing credits , approved by the ANA ( American Nursing Association ) . It is true that some NPs may make more than PAs but truthfully their salary profile is quite similar . PAs have a slight edge if they are surgical because of the higher reimbursement involved with surgical procedures . This article was really upsetting to me as it does not give a factual and realistic comparison between nps and pas . I would not advise anyone to use this site as a reference to better understand the differences between the professions , as well as their roles . <p> This has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am confused . I saw a PA today for the first time and was interested in their schooling . The article says there are 2 year programs and you do n't  need medical background ? Does that mean I could just jump into PA school as an LPN ? I live in NC and there are schools that offer the program but I live too far from them , so I was looking up online programs . I am also about to start an LPN-BSN online program but if I can just go to PA school then I 'll do that , but I was a little confused on how this works ? I feel like that 's not right . <p> As a student who just applied to 10 PA programs throughout the country using CASPA and supplemental Apps , I know the PA application requirements . Yes , your Major of your Bachelors does not technically need to be science-related , but you need to have taken a large amount of prerequisite courses that many students do not take if they were " English " majors or some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with minors in Chem and Bio , and I 've had to explain why I am this major numerous times to the few schools that I have spoken to , but this is not my main point . Prerequisite courses vary by school but usually include Chemistry 1 &amp; 2 , Organic chemistry 1 &amp;2 , Biochemistry , Genetics or Cell Biology , Microbiology , Stats or Biostats , A&amp;P 1 &amp; 2 , Psychology , non specific upper level biologies , and then basic English courses and humanities . On top of this many schools require around 2000 patient care hours with direct patient experience , ( RN , EMT-b , -i , or -p , CNA , PT , PTA , LPN , etc ) Some programs require 1000 , some require 4000 , &amp; others do n't  have a minimum , but these are more uncommon . Generally you must take the GREs , or in lieu or that the MCATs , and then submit it in a lovely CASPA package , and wait for interviews in fall and winter for a summer or next fall program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allowed to work a job whilst in school . <p> That would be how you get into a PA program . the PA application process is n't given justice by described as " Here I must state that anyone with any type of Bachelors degree with NO medical knowledge can become a PA " <p> I just have one question , I want to become a PA and I pretty much know a lot about the field , but I was wondering if PAs can practice in any state other than the one they were licensed in ? I read somewhere that you have to stay in the state you took your exams and received your license in , is it true ? Thanks you ! <p> I was interested in becoming a PA about 2 years ago while starting college my advisor had brought it to my attention and Ive done some research but I am I guess discouraged because I do n't  do well in science or math classes . I always wanted to be in the health field since I was a little . I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live in pennsylvania and both PA &amp; NPs are well recognized and high demand . My question would be can I major in communications and still apply to PA graduate program ? as seen above previously , you need the major science prereqs . <p> After being in this buisness for a while i may have a differing position on this issue . The mistake that i feel we are making is in the area of over generalization. i have personally worked with every demographic mentioned in the article and in the discussion . some PAs are better than some NPs and some NPs are better than some PAs . take the ego out of this discussion this is not a distance urination contest , ( if you get my drift ) . As an FNP that worked years in a level 1 trauma unit prior to NP school i was better prepared for the education that others who did n't  have as much prior training . the truth is that no person , not MD , PA , or NP is prepared just out of school to jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) without help and supervision . if you think you are going to do that you are over confident and unsafe . In my humble opinion , choose what you want to do based on the amount of time it takes you to complete your goals . If you already have a BSN , be a practitioner , if you have another degree be a PA. it will take you at least 7 years to become an NP for the most part if you start today , there may be a faster route as a PA but i 'm not sure . really to me the other arguments are of no consequence . Neither is better or worse , we are here to care for the people who trust us with their health care not to fortify our egos by declaring which is best . Remember , our highest callings are to do no harm and to be a servant to those who come to us for help . remember this and you will be sucessful in whatever you do ! ok now i 'm off my soapbox . <p> You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as your prerequisites are taken care of . Just be prepared to tell the admissions people how that will help you in medicine . Also , be sure to have great grades and rock the GRE . Some PA schools are nearly as competitive as medical schools . <p> If you 're talking about income , the median income for PAs is 89,40 and for NPs is 90,121 . PA usually start out 10K higher than NPs but money wise it ends up being the same . Its really about what and how you want to practice . NPs will be the new general practice doctors . PAs are more likely to assist Drs in cardiology , oncology or some other speciality . NPs have specialities to but they tend to be more in the line of womens health , pediatics and family practice . Most people that opt for NP I think do so because they want to be able to practice on there own and being nurses to begin with feel more connected to with their patients . It is true PAs can take a test and be admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinical credit toward admission for being a massage therapist . But the escelerated PA 2 yr program was rigiorous . A nurse that has completed a four year program and graduate school has a lot to offer . They have years of clinicals and patient experience . You cant do either of these without working hard and being smart . NPs can practice on there own . PAs have to work under a doctor . Its what 's best for you . <p> A very brief " side-by-side " view of federal laws governing compliance for PAs and APNs , now together known as Non-Physician Providers ( NPPs ) , can be seen here : https : **37;1282;TOOLONG See the PDF " Medicare information " Even here the list is not quite complete , but relatively simple and correct . It will reveal they are equivalent from a billing standoint as far as the governement is concerned . Where the govt goes , often private insurance will follow . Regarding differences from a PA perspective : 1 ) Education Yes APNs need a nursing degree , then a masters degree and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have a national board and specialize earlier . There are very few PA schools that still offer a certificate or even BS any longer . &gt;80% are now Masters programs requiring a BS first . Does not have to be science , but surely helps and you will need the grades , prerequisites and prior medical experience . I was a military EMT . A classmate of mine was a band major with years of experience as a CNA , go figure . Degree inflation in time will likely require a doctoral as well , as PTs have moved there too . There is a national board with every 6 year recert . PA education is focused mainly as a generalist for primary care setting , but does follow a medical block-training model with courses taught by MDs or PAs . Some lectures are the same lecture provided to medical students , only condensed . I 'm sure NP training is rigorous . Only look at the website for various schools and you can see coursework for either . I would not discount a nursing backround , but experience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do have prior medical experience of some sort . 2 ) Work all will take time to be proficient and feel secure enough to act independent . As stated , it would be dangerous if you though otherwise . I can not speak to how independently NPs act in the outpatient setting . In the inpatient setting , PAs and NPs are often indistinguishable . They work side by side in pulmonary , cardiac , ICU and ER settings , among others . It is rare to see NPs in the OR , though . All charts are being cosigned by **25;1321;TOOLONG docs , regardless of state laws , as far as I can tell , and I 've worked in two states . This is because hospital credentialing and privileging requirements mandate this due to our litigious society . And with electronic records , it is automatic that charts are cosigned . Neither NPs nor PAs need scripts cosigned by their doctor . In the outpatient setting , I know PAs that are functionally independent . The doc is not coming in to see patients with them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually only if prescriptions were provided . It varies state by state and doc to doc , and laws change for all as both professions seek more " autonomy . " In a primary care setting , be it family medicine or emergency medicine , oversight will likely not be great . There are varying degress of oversight in the hospital . I have yet to see an APN function independently in the hospital . 3 ) Specialty- This will vary as stated numerous times . APNs tend to focus on womens/childrens/family practices . But I see them in many specialties around the hospital . They are rare to see in the OR , but some do . Not to say they have n't worked as an OR nurse . I have seen some going to surgical assist courses to compensate . CRNAs of course are OR oriented by training . PAs work in womens/peds/family practices . I have seen them in every specialty in the hospital I can think of , including morgue . They are utilized well in the OR , with didactic and surgical rotations as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training . <p> 4 ) Licensing For PAs , you are not limited to your state . If you wish to change , you need to apply for a license for that state . You do not need to retake the national board , unless the state has a board exam , and some do . I imagine APNs have at a minimum to reapply for a license as well . <p> 5 ) Compensation Pay for both will likely vary greatly by specialty . Last APAA census data showed mean salary for PAs at 90K . I know PAs that have made &gt;150K , depends on call schedule and this would be a surgery specialty . CRNAs are making this , and have an excellent lifestyle . New grad in primary care , there is census data for all of these , but among PAs/APNs is likely not too dissimilar and is at the lower end of the pay scale . Higher for experience and production pay . <p> 6 ) Travel many foreign govts do not recognize PAs or APNs , so for NGOs , PAs have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what Ive seen/read . I 'm sure exceptions exist . US govt organizations do , and both can work oversees as a US govt employee . For PAs , they do legally work in Canada , UK and Australia , Guam/Phillipines . There may be others . APNs likely have some legal status in other countires too . <p> 7 ) Demographic Both are majority women and white at this point , variants among specialty . <p> 8 ) Which to decide Both are respected fields , both should be proud and both are in demand . As stated , look at your state . Some are more bent toward APNs and some PAs . Laws are more and more making them quite indistinguishable Specialties look to both in many applications , or if you apply when they seek one , they will likely consider you if the experience is there . As I said , reimbursement is the same . I think both are great and have equal respect for my APN collegues . If I could do it over againI might look into a CRNA . It means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the investment . <p> A few question , Would you want to see someone trained by nurses in the nursing model or someone trained by MDs ? Wouldnt you want to see someone that has gone through training side by side with residents , fellows , and med students ? Would you want to see someone who does not have to take a national board exam to make sure they are competent ? Would you want to see someone who does not have to take their board exam every 6 years ? The Answer is Clear . PERIOD . SEE YOUR PA . <p> Do n't forget to mention that by 2015 those going to be NP 's will have to get their DNP and not just MSN <p> This is a FAQ from the AACN website : <p> 16 ) Does implementation of the DNP mean advanced practice nurses will no longer be permitted to practice without a doctorate ? <p> No , nurses with masters degrees will continue to practice in their current capacities . Recommendations are included in the Roadmap Task Force report on how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this credential . <p> I hate to be a jerk but I see an abdundance of comments related to pay . If you folks are overly concerned with that then the healthcare industry is not for you . I work with both PAs and NPs and the overwhelming complaint is about money and hours when compared to their physician counterparts . I 've worked in family medicine , urgent care and ER . These were all physician driven practices and believe me when I tell you the docs are just happy to have the help . Most now days could n't give a rats ass what you are as long as you do n't  kill somebody or piss off the staff . For those of you just coming out of college with a science related degree or nursing please volunteer somewhere for a year or so in the third world . You will have a completely different outlook when you return . If you still want to be a NP or PA after that GO FOR IT ! Youll be a much better clinician . <p> Very interesting points made by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certified by AANP . As an RN I was able to specialize in the areas of nurisng/medicine I was mostly interested in : med-surg , oncology , wound/ostomy care . My clinical experiences during both Masters and post-Masters education gave me an opportunity to become clinically solid and practice with healthy confidence after graduation as an NP ( BTW , I 've had over 2000 clinical hours combined by the end of NP education its required to be certified ) . My preceptors were both MDs and NPs they were all fantastic ! As in any profession , you must have the drive and the ambition to become the best , and to continue to grow . Medical field is highly competetive ; if you want to be a practitioner that can truly collaborate with an MD you need the ambition . That said , the surgeon I currently work with , specifically was looking for an NP , " because of the nursing background and the educational background " . Other than surgical mandatory module , the NP education is not really that different didactically from the PAs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though nursing tought me to see the whole person , not just a system/organ the PERSON , family included . Believe me , it makes a measurable difference . Nursing takes the WHO definition of " health " in hand and goes to work = As far as the practical side of things . There is no significant difference in the salary or the hours depends on the setting . as an NP w/hospital privileges , I can admit and discharge patients ; PAs cannot. there are 2 certifying bodies for NPs ; each has somewhat different requirements : mandatory CMEs +/- professional development ( teaching , etc . ) , OR you can get re-certified every 5 years . Masters degree is not mandatory for entry into practice for PAs , unlike for NPs . However , both professions are facing the potential higher requirements for entry into practice . I think , both professions are great , and can be a good fit for a specific individual . <p> one more point : On a federal level , Medicare allows PAs to get their own NPIs , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shall be made to his or her employer . " This is because PAs are " supervised " by physicians , versus the collaborative agreement that NPs have with physicians . With Nurse-Midwives becoming independent practitioners and not requiring collaborative agreements anymore , it is possible that the entire NP profession will acquire the same independence soon . Independent practice , anybody ? What is your American Dream ? <p> I have read the entire thread . There is a level of truth in most of the comments posted . A quick glance at the comments and you can quickly pick up on the bias view . The facts are the facts . And I will point them out . I have an association with both groups and well informed about intent , practice parameters for both . First thing to understand , the nursing board is independent , it is as easy for the board to declare medical independence as it is for it to declare nurse practioners as rockets scientist . The meaning of this there is no check and balance with respect the credential they pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiring a physician part time to collaborate with , the fact is on paper NPs are the independent practioner of the two under the law In the real world , all hospital treat mid-level care practioners equally , that is regardless of the groups the doctor is the final check off .. As for education , facts are the facts the didactics associated with diagnosis and treatment it is clear , PAs has much more class room and clinical rotation time . Just for a quick illustration , the guidelines for NP education dictates 700 clinical hours which may be done sparingly , 700 clinical hours amounts to about little than 3months of rotation . Looking at PA training , each rotation is about 2months long . The real , true on average coming right out of school a PA will be better informed then a NP but that edge quickly disappear within the first two years of working Intent , both groups want to be independent , which is concerning as a healthcare consumer . One comment said , they will be the new primary care providers , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training and education necessary to be completely independent . Whether PAs change the name to physician associates , or whether NPs , add another credential to the same thing they 've been doing ( DNP ) , none of it can make up for the standard set for medical practice . The good , both are highly skilled profession with a lot to offer the medical community . My suggestion do n't  do either if you believe its a short cut to acting like a doctor . In the end , when push come to shove , there will be signs notifying patient to specify whether you want to be treated by a medical doctor , MD , a nurse practioner , who practice medicine in a nursing model , or Physician assistant It goes that route you will be looking for a job . Ironic enough PAs and NPs I have talked to , refuse to see anyone other than a the medical doctor do you think the rest of the public will feel differently .. ? I 'm a pharmacist so it does n't  matter to me . What i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be viewed like doctors , and you think its a good move , but it will end up biting you in the future when push come to shove If you want to be a doctor go do it , if you want to be a mid level care do it .. , but whatever you do stay in your lane . We all in healthcare , so no need for PAs n NPs to bicker about 1st , 2nd , or 3rd place The ultimate choice rest with the patient . If you 're a patient what would you choose . <p> Dan , respectfully , i 'm not sure where you get your information . my clinical requirement from my NP program was 1000 hrs . You are also not mentioning the 4 years of nursing school and clinical training before i ever stepped into NP school . Not mentioning other training gained in nursing pracitice such as " CEN , ACLS , TNCC , ATLS , PALS , ITLS , BLS , PEPP , and last but not least CCRN " , all achieved prior to advanced practice training and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also required at least 1 year of critical care experience prior to admission and was a 3 year program . 7 years of school and 1 year of critical care minimum , and you say that a buisness degree and 2 years of school is better training ? your comments appear to be enclusive at times but are clearly inflammatory in nature . PAs are well trained and i love working side by side with them and the MD , i choose not to degrade any of them . however .. i think that this discussion may be better served by those of us who acutally touch patients . i would never attempt to determine how well a pharmacist counts pills because i am not a pharmacist . <p> I am curious as to where everyone is getting there facts . Firstly , PAs make more in some areas , but generally the pay is the same . The major exception is the west coast , particularly California where there is a strong nurses union . The NP in Ca is licensed under the state nursing board and far exceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ) . Second , the PA has a biology degree or something similar usually , then they get their masters ( est. 3 year program ) . This is does not mean they come with healthcare experience . They receive all of their training in school or after in a fellowship . NPs should ( however , not always ) have several years experience in an acute care setting . Some programs take NPs with less experience , which I do n't  agree with . Typically , most NPs have had several years HEALTHCARE experience . What more needs to be said ? Everything you learn in healthcare , you learn on the job and anyone who says different is lying to themselves . And as far as the curriculum goes , at the end of the day , both PAs and NPs sit for boards . Do you think that the boards are easier for NPs ? ! ? ! <p> do NPs if you like to deal and actually touch and be there for patients -PA if you want to do more diagnosing and stuff -salary is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is NPs you can practice independently , if you want to own your own practice some day go that route . -other then that idk what to tell people <p> I 'm currently in school perusing my ADN then plan on taking an accelerated transition course for my BSN while already working as an RN . I know that 's not where I want to stop . I 've wanted to be a physician but quite honestly , I do n't  want to be nearing 40 barely starting to practice medicine . I 'm ok with the decision I 've made to be a non-physician health worker . <p> I 've read every thread on here and am still torn whether to go for PA or NP ! I feel as though having a BSN going to PA school will have its advantages as I would have nursing courses under my belt AND the rigorous training for PA . I have looked at the curriculums , salaries , and tuitions for both . Having researched this , I noticed everything was higher and harder for PAs than NPs . I currently live in AL but intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having said that , is there any more insight someone might have ? Especially in the state of FL ? <p> Its funny how most articles that talk about the differences between NPs and PAs tend to offer the same stuff that you can find pretty much anywhere else on the Internet . If you really want to know the biggest things that separate a NP from a PA are : 1 . PAs are required by law to have a relationship with a physician . This relationship is paramount to successfully taking care of patients . A lot people see this as a master/servant type relationship ; however , this is quit the contrary . The relationship that a PA has with their supervising physician allows them to grow and develop skills beyond the basic skill set that a PA initially graduates with allowing them to become a more functional and collegial member of the health care team . This is what is meant by the phrase " independence gained through dependence " . With this being said , I know many PAs that own their own clinics that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAs are trained in the medical model where as NPs are trained in the nursing model . This allows physicians and PAs to share a common knowledge so that they can communicate with one another more effectively . Good communication is paramount to providing excellent patient care . It provides a core philosophy that is shared by both physicians and PAs putting the patient first , practicing evidence based medicine , practicing to the standards of care for their respective communities , and on-going learning . 3 . All accredited PA programs have specific national standards that every program ( regardless of which state you are from ) must meet . Those standards mirror those of their supervising physicians . For example , physicians and PAs are required to recertify every 10 years and maintain a minimum of 50 CMEs per year . The Board of Medicine in every state governs PA 's and physicians . NP programs vary wildly from state to state in regards to there core requirements and clinical hours . Once a NP you are only required to take you licensing board once in your entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take your boards to practice at all . Hence , this is why you see some NPs with the credentials ARNP v. FNP-C after their name . If you want to practice as a PA you have to be certified . In some states NPs ( even though they are practicing medicine ) are governed by their respective Boards of Nursing . 4 . Personally , one of the most disturbing differences that I see that separates NPs from PAs that is sadly perpetuated by many physicians , legislatures , and lay people is the NP profession touting themselves as not just independent practitioners , but as equal in par with physicians in training and education . And , yes I am talking about the Doctor Nurse program that Columbia University and the various Nurse Associations have so dubiously promoted . Personally , I think that there is nothing more tragic in our health care system as a person who has 2-3 years of extra education touting themselves as an equivalent practitioner as physicians . I find it laughable that even with the extra clinical training that a NP gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the amount of clinical hours a PA gets during their training . It is sad to see a group of people within such an honorable profession blindly place their own ambitions and desires above that of their patients over some sort of headstrong glory hunger , just so they can call themselves doctors without actually going to medical school . It just goes to show what you can get away with when you have large sums of money and huge PACs in Washington . Yet , on the other side , their is a part of me that is some-what sadden by physicians total lack of abstinence to start a bridge program for NPs and PAs to get through medical school in a reduced amount of time , especially when their is a huge lack of primary care providers within this country . <p> Blake .. awesome post . I 'm glad I stumbled upon this site .. Every NP and PA I have met could careless about this argument .. It seems like the only people who care are the ones that are trying to figure out which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NP , PA , or MD .. titles mean nothing .. it always comes down to the individual .. You can talk about training and experience all you want .. but if the doc , PA , or NP does n't  give a shit .. then none of it matters . What good is 2000 hrs for PAs when they have never experienced a code and are pumping on someones chest trying to get them back like most nurses .. And what good is all that nursing when your simply sick of it and semi burned out .. and all the PAs and NPs can tell you what good is that med school when doctors stop caring cuz all they can think about is the hot nurses or tee time .. no .. none of it matters .. all programs have sufficient training and we know this because all professions have put out excellent practitioners .. but in the end .. the only thing that matters is the individual .. so when you step into a doctors office and see an " i could care less " face .. maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note .. I am RN and have seen great NPs and PAs and have seen idiot NPs and PAs .. the percentage is the same for MDs . I 'm not gon na sit here and say PAs are bad cuz lack of experience .. because most study their asses off in school and take full advantage of their clinical hours .. alot of NPs have great experience from hospitals and some have poor backgrounds .. so its a toss up .. just stop worrying about who is smarter and pick a program or if your a pt see the first person available .. <p> Ive been reading all these comments that seem to be NP is better and have more privileges and stuff . here 's the thing , I am going to PA school I have a bachelors degree in medical sciences from a highly recognized university and my older sister is in a NP program here in the same state . While a lot of you keep saying PAs can not practice without the supervision of a MD and a nurse practitioner can is true in a sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yes they are under the supervision of a doctor but they are the right hand man of a doctor the MD and PA collaborate together in the speciality they are in . PAs can open their own clinics in the same scope of practice as the doctor they have been working with and the doctor does not have to be present and PAs can diagnose and treat illnesses and perform many tests without the dr being present . PAs in certain specialities can make upwards of 130,000$ a year with experience according to a recent salary survey . Pas practice under the medical part of medicine and NPs the nursing part . I had to take organic chemistry and physics at my school to be able to apply to their PA program and then graduate level courses like immunology , infectious diseases , biochemistry that I chose to take because it has been very helpful in my Pa studies . I do n't  like how this article and comments are basically saying NPs are better blah blah . Does it matter that much ? PAs make a higher salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeries . I appreciate anyone who is a NP or PA because they are providing care for sick people and helping out MDs. we should respect both careers . <p> I have been an NP for 8 years and have never seen , until now a 36 hour work week . I have been specialized in neurosurgery , first OR assist as well as orthopeadics . I have worked rehab medicine and now vascular surgery . We can do anything and more that a PA can and for the record our training is everybit as demanding as " PA school " if not more so ! They go from a 4 year school with a major in biology or some science to the PA program whereas the NP has sometimes as many as 2 prior degrees in nursing prior to the Masters in Nursing or Doctorate that PAs cant even obtain . The biggest difference between the 2 paths , and this is from personal experience is that the NP is more rounded in patient care and the PA tends to have the " Im a mini doctor " syndrome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is salary , for the most part it is the same , but I will say I know of NO NP or PA making grater that $150k a year but I do make more than the 3 PAs that are in the same practice as me and they work in the hospital/OR and have to take call and all of the misery that goes with it , I do n't  and I run my independent clinic in the office BECASUSE the docs know I can practice more independently than the PAs ! ! The future of healthcare will tell the true tell ! ! Just watch OBAMA care and you will see the NPs take over ! <p> In what states can PAs have a " collaborating physician " agreement similar to that of an NP ? Thinking about going back to school for NP , but already have a rad assoc and healthcare ad bachelors . NP would be my first pick , but schooling would be a lot longer . However , I 'd like to be able to work independently once experienced . What 's your opinion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( curious myself as to the difference between a PA and a NP ) . I myself am not in the medical field in any capacity , but rather I am a recipient of the health care delivered by these healthcare professionals that you are discussing . It is the same argument I heard for years concerning the MD vs the DO . It is not the letters behind the healthcare professionals name that concern me . It is rather the competency and dedication of the professional that ensures me that I am getting the best care available . I am 66 years old and I can assure you that there are incompetent people in every profession . Over the years I have encountered PAs , NPs , MDs , and DOs , both men and women , who I would trust with my life , as well as some who I considered to be " Quacks " . Some like Fords , and some like Chevrolets , but both serve the same purpose . If you are struggling as a student as to which career to pursue , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Education is NEVER a waste of time , and remember that you get out of a career what you put in it , so just do it . <p> LD , I am glad your concern is that you make more money than your brother but , based on your comment , it would appear you need to go back to undergrad and concentrate on your grammar and English abilities . Personally , I find a comment of this nature to be both condescending and hypocritical , unless of course you are being cynical . Then it would just be in bad taste . <p> Some of the information posted above by PA and NP providers are spot on while others are nothing more than wild assumptions and completely false allegations promoted by professional jealousy " I am better/smarter than you are " . <p> My input to those who are considering the attendance to a graduate level program for the purpose of becoming a clinical provider I would provide this suggestion , if you are a nurse , enjoy the nursing profession , and wish to pursue a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then attend a NP program . If you have clinical experience or not , wish to pursue a clinical mid level position based on the medical/surgical model , and wish to work in collaboration with a physician or surgeon , then attend PA school . I can assure you , as a mid level professional , there will be a time when you will be confronted with a clinical problem that exceeds your education , training , and experience and having a clinical partner that works in collaboration with your abilities will be quite satisfying without any occupational jealousy . Best of luck to all that are preparing to enter the world of medicine and surgery . <p> I have to refer many of the readers to the AANP website for correct practice authority answers . Many states allow complete independent practice authority for NPS while others have very specific and different requirements . The latest legislation laws pertaining to these questions are posted on this website . As an RN with over 25 years of practice , I will soon graduate as a Family Nurse Practioner , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nursing Practice with a concentration on Psychiatric care . This will not only allow prescriptive authority but will allow me to focus on counseling , diagnosis and treatment of Psychiatric diseases and disorders in addition to medical prescriptive authority . Every NP must pass a national certification and an additional national certification for psychiatric NPS . All this is in addition to a doctorate degree which is very rigorous and prepares NPS to be agents of change in our health care system . <p> The difference in an NP and PA has more to do with focus . The focus of an NP is care , while the medical focus is cure . I have worked with a few PA S who are skilled , compassionate and patient focused but in my many years of practice in ICU , ER , Occupational , community , and primary care as well as Clinical Administrator . NPS get my vote hands down for improving patient outcomes ! <p> She is a horrible NP , she is very ignorant and makes mistakes constantly . She told me " EVERYONE makes mistakes " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You put your trust and life in her hands . Yes everyone makes mistakes , but for your doctor to make mistakes is a no-no . From a professional POV let 's use an example . You go see a doctor , and he/she makes a " mistake " and misdiagnoses you , or miss-reads your medical records . So your dying because of the " mistake " . And her/his response is " EVERYONE makes mistakes " . Now to a true professional , that 's being blatantly ignorant/and or lazy . Doctors are probably the one profession where mistakes should n't happen . Would you put your life in the hands of a NP to evaluate you , or your loved one ? No I 'm not making this up , its not slander either , if she 's a true NP she would admit to this , if not , may God be with you . Because doctors are n't  suppose to make mistakes , unless your just not doing your job and living up to " do no harm " . <p> Just a patient here . Sorry I wont see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new health care reform Is putting unqualified people into Practice . Cheaper for them . PCP should always be Physcians . Not playing doctor because You cant get into medical school . Drs gods , hell no . But the education and experience <p> Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners actually make about the same . One may or may not make more than the other depending on their skill level . For instance , a Physician Assistant specializing in surgery will make an average of $80k-100k more than a Nurse Practitioner . There are plenty of PAs that I know that make even $220k specializing in surgery . And about that , a Physician Assistant has a number of schools to choose from where they provide " specialty courses/programs . So , its not just in their clinicals . Please correct that info in your blog . Thx !

When you work as a nurse traveler , you combine both a new living environment and a new job . It 's no wonder you may be a little apprehensive . Keep in mind that everyone gets a little nervous starting a new travel assignment , especially if it is their first . Below are some suggestions for overcoming a few common fears nurse travelers may have . <p> - 1 . You 're afraid you will hate your living arrangements . Whether you are worried about getting a bad roommate or living in a less than desirable neighborhood , it 's common to have a few concerns about living arrangements . One thing you can do to ease fears is find out as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . Ask what 's included regarding furnishings . Be sure to determine if you will be sharing your place with another traveler . Do an Internet search of the area , which will help you find out things , such as population size , crime rate , and local attractions . Keep in mind your housing arrangements are often negotiable . <p> 2 . You wonder if you will be lonely . Moving to a new area and starting a new position where you do n't know anyone can be a bit lonely at first , but there are things you can do . You will immediately meet people at work . Get to know your coworkers . Ask about fun places to visit . Get involved in your community or workplace by doing things , such as joining a church , community group or sign-up for a fitness class . Do n't be afraid to take the initiative and ask a few coworkers to get together after work for dinner or to show you around . <p> 3 . You are worried about not having benefits . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will negotiate benefits . Usually health insurance is included . Some jobs will also include the option to contribute to a retirement plan . Whether you have paid sick days or vacations days while you are on assignment varies . Knowing in advance if paid time off is a benefit will help reduce your worries . <p> 4 . You 're anxious about getting dumped on . You may worry that as a traveler , you may not get the greatest of work assignments during your shift . Some travelers are afraid they may get the sickest patients or the largest workloads on a regular basis because they are viewed as an outsider . Rest assured , this is usually not the case . Remember the hospital was likely short staffed and that 's way they needed a traveler . Your coworkers may be grateful you are there . If you did see an unfair pattern of getting larger workloads than other staff on a regular basis , talk with your supervisor . <p> 5 . You are concerned you will have a lack of steady work . Some travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without pay during their assignment due to low census in the hospital . While many hospitals do cancel staff when patient census is low , your contract will state whether you can be cancelled . Some contracts will have a stipulation that a traveler can not be canceled without pay . That way you are guaranteed a certain number of hours . <p> Skype has opened its online-based client beta for the entire world , right after introducing it generally in the Usa and You.K. previous this calendar month .

You do n't want to be stuck in a small , cramped apartment or arrive not realizing your place is only partially furnished . When it comes to living arrangements for a travel job , you have a few options. - <p> Private Apartment <p> One option many healthcare travelers choose is housing in a private apartment. - Most often travelers are offered a one bedroom apartment , which may be in an apartment complex . This type of housing is good for someone who prefers not to share an apartment with another traveler . It is also a good choice for someone who is not traveling with any family members. - Although most apartments you will be offered will be furnished , make sure you understand what is included . You may have to bring bedding , cookware and towels . <p> Shared Housing <p> In some instances , you may be given the option of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared housing is you get to know someone immediately . If you hit it off , you have someone to hang out with right from the start . The downside is if you and your roommate are not compatible , it could be a problem . Similar to a private apartment , your housing will likely be furnished and in a neighborhood close to where you will be working. - <p> RV Living <p> One option some travelers may not consider is living in an RV. - If you already have an RV , this may be a good choice . Since you will not need the apartment , your company may cover the cost of staying in an RV park . Many RV parks have amenities , such as a pool , workout area and clubhouse . <p> Housing Allowance <p> You can also opt to take a housing allowance and find your own place to live while on assignment . This option provides you with the most control , but keep in mind , all costs may not be covered . If you have friends or family in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , taking the housing allowance makes sense . If you want to pick your own apartment and will be going to an area where rents are high , it may make more sense financially to take the free housing offered . A housing allowance may not cover the costs completely if you were to find your own place . <p> Regardless of which housing option you choose , consider some of the tips below to make your move go smoothly . <p> Whichever type of housing you decide upon , be sure you get the details . Read your contract carefully to determine what is included , such as utilities and furnishings . <p> Negotiate to move in a few days before you start your new job . This will give you time to get organized and settle in to your new place . <p> You may also want a move out date a couple of days after your assignment ends to allow you plenty of time to pack up . <p> Although your place may be furnished , consider taking some smaller items from home to give your place a familiar feel .

But switching gears and working in a school setting can bring additional rewards and benefits . <p> Occupational therapists are needed in public and private schools to work with children from kindergarten through high school and up to age 21 . Therapists may also find employment in early intervention programs working with preschool age children . <p> School-based occupational therapists focus on addressing educational needs to promote students participation and performance in school .

Therapists may also have to get creative to modify a child 's environment to overcome disabilities . <h> Collaboration <p> Occupational therapists working in schools may enjoy a collaborate environment . Therapists often work together with teachers , aides , parents and school counselors to develop and implement goals for students .

However , some services cost patients almost as much with insurance as without . Physical , occupational , and speech therapy are often classified the same by insurance companies as treatment received by a specialist like a cardiologist or oncologist . Because of this , the co-pay is higher for these visits , which are usually more frequent than those required by others in this category . For instance , a stroke victim may need to see a speech therapist and an occupational therapist twice a week . If their co-pay is $32 , the average according to The Kaiser Family Foundation , the weekly fee can quickly become out of reach for many patients . <p> - <p> Stop Accepting Insurance <p> Many offices no longer accept insurance because of the various hassles associated with doing so . Instead , they offer to bill the insurance company after payment is received in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay away from being an in-network provider ? Because you wo n't be held to their requirements or limitations . This allows therapists to focus on what is best for the patient rather than what is best for the insurance company 's bottom line . The one caveat is that many patients are afraid to visit providers who are not in their insurance network . It may take time to build up a client base and to earn consistent referrals from physicians and medical facilities . <p> - <p> Promote Legislation for Limitations <p> According to Kaiser , several states are considering legislation that would limit the percent of cost that could be paid by deductible . Often , specialist deductible will be 80-95% of the therapy cost . By reducing the cost of the deductible , more patients would be able to afford the care they need . It would not negatively impact the cost of visits to other specialists , because their base cost is so much higher to begin with . Unfortunately , insurance lobbyists are against these types of measures because it would increase the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some claim it would cause insurance premiums to increase for employers and employees . Another option is to encourage legislation that would reduce the amount of co-payments to no more than those established for primary care providers .

Have you found it is more difficult to give patients the care they need with certain insurance companies ? Are you actively trying to change legislation to help promote the needs of your patients or do you think current legislation endeavors are the wrong way to remedy the situation ?

@@76898668 @5598668/ <h> Impact of Conduct Disorders in Schools <p> by Howard Gerber on March 1 , 2012 <p> Conduct disorder is a common psychological diagnosis among children and adolescents . It is a chronic behavior problem that is often seen in schools . It can be difficult for teachers to tell when a child is simply having a string of bad days or being overly extroverted and when there is a true psychological problem . Because of this it is important to make teachers aware of the psychological and counseling services available to them and their students .

@@76898672 @5598672/ <h> Leftover Medications at the End of the School Year <p> by Howard Gerber on July 20 , 2010 <p> One of the primary roles of a school nurse is to dispense medications that have been brought in by parents . A doctor may prescribe medications for conditions such as asthma , allergies , migraines , infection , or pain . Over the counter medications may also be brought in for students by their parents , such as a pain relievers , antihistamines , or eye drops. - All of these medications are kept in a secure location and accessible only by a nurse or other school official . At the end of the school year , some medications will be left over . Several steps need to be taken by the school nurse in order to dispose of the medications prior to leaving for the summer . <p> First , a deadline for picking up the medications needs to be determined . Usually , the deadline is set for the last day of school for students , but occasionally the deadline is extended to the last day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to stop by and pick up the medications . Then the nurse will attempt to contact the parent either with a note sent home with the student , a letter to the house , or a phone call . All three methods may be attempted if contact can not easily be made . If the parents come in to the school , the nurse hands the medication over to them and her job of disposal is finished . <p> Unfortunately , it is often the case that parents are too busy to come in , especially if the child is no longer taking the medication . If this happens , the nurse should follow the FDA guidelines for drug disposal . By reading the patient information or drug label , the nurse would discern if there were any specific drug disposal instructions and follow any that were given . If there are no specific disposal indications , the medications should be removed from their original container and mixed with ground coffee or other undesirable materials , then put into a sealable can or bag and placed into the trash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can also be utilized . <p> Regardless of whether the medications are over the counter or prescribed , they should be disposed of at the end of the school year . Removing them from the school ensures that no summer students might accidentally find and ingest them . Since no student can be given medications other than those brought in by his or her parents , there is no reason to save them for the following year . <p> The methods listed above are general guidelines . Each school district will usually have a policy for the disposal of medication , which is heavily influenced by state policy . How does your school dispose of medications at the end of the year , and how was the policy created ?

When a teacher would suspect physical , mental , emotional , or sexual abuse , he or she was to contact my friend . Teachers were encouraged not to report abuse to authorities on their own because of the difficulties it could cause . Instead , the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could talk with and monitor the child . <p> Once the school officials were informed , an investigation was necessary . A physical exam by the school nurse and an emotional inventory by the school counselor were typical . No matter what the outcome , asking the questions and looking for the signs is a difficult task . Liz knew that her final decision would play an important , possibly even life changing , role in the child 's future . If she decided there were no signs of abuse when the child was being abused , the child would continue to be in danger . If she decided there were signs of abuse when the child was not being harmed , the family life would be severely affected , and the relationship with the school could be irrevocably harmed . <p> These are the types of decisions she had to make on a regular basis , and the stress was enormous . Several of her colleagues were not able to stay in school settings because they could not handle the emotional stress of dealing with abused children and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose to look at dealing with child abuse as a blessing rather than a curse of her job . When she did intervene and correctly report child abuse , she knew she had saved that one child from being harmed further .

Unfortunately , child abuse is a reality , and often the only help a child may receive is from school staff . Becoming a school nurse is more than dispensing medication and attending to scrapes and sprains . The most important job of a school nurse is constant vigilance in looking after the overall well-being of all the students in the school . Helping to stop and prevent child abuse is one very important aspect of that job . Are you ready to save a child ?

@@76898701 @5598701/ <h> Responsibilities of a Teacher of the Visually Impaired <p> by Angela Stevens on March 30 , 2010 <p> The biggest responsibility of a teacher of the visually impaired , or TVI , is to lead the student 's educational team . While the student will have a 504 or an IEP , and thus a special education teacher assigned to him or her , that special education teacher has not been specifically trained to meet the needs of a visually impaired student . The TVI must help show the special education teacher , classroom teachers , staff , and possibly even the parents what they will need to do in order to make the education environment as effective and enjoyable as possible . <p> The specific responsibilities of the TVI will depend greatly on the degree to which the child is visually impaired . If the child has slight to moderate impairment , the TVI may only need to help work out a plan and make sure proper equipment and materials are purchased and utilized , both in the classroom and at home when appropriate . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include large print textbooks , audio textbooks , Braille textbooks , and computer programs that will help make learning easier for the child . If the child is severely impaired , the TVI may make a recommendation for an assistant to help the student in the classroom . <p> In regards to the classroom setting , the TVI would need to evaluate the classroom ( or classrooms ) the student will be in for safety and adaptability , and offer advice on how to make these areas safer and more effective for the student . The TVI would also consult with teachers to help them understand what the student will need from them , and provide training for teachers and staff to help them learn teaching and organizational strategies they can use for the student . <p> Throughout the school year , the TVI may want to meet with the student and family to offer assistance and help them learn skills that can be used at home to further the educational goals established during the IEP meeting . This would include regular progress assessments and a time for the parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think may help the student in or out of school . <p> Most importantly , however , is the responsibility the teacher has to make sure everyone is comfortable with the education plan . This means making sure questions have been answered , information has been shared , and that all parties feel they are ready to begin this new adventure together . Often teachers , staff , and even other students do n't know how to treat a visually impaired person , and so they adopt a defensive or overly helpful attitude , when in fact the student just wants to have a normal educational experience . A TVI can help make sure everyone is comfortable and working together to achieve that outcome . <p> Are you a TVI ? What are the most challenging and rewarding aspects of your career ? <p> I am a TVI in Texas and the most challenging aspect of my job is communicating to the administrators the difference between a caseload and a workload . When you are a TVI you are not only a teacher , but a casemanager , problem solver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its your job to give the student what they need because many times you are the only one who knows what they need and how to teach them .

Pass TAKS , be an active member of the school marching band , and little things like realizing that those little bumps on the page actually represent letters .

Although all patients are going to be different , consider some general guidelines in order to work effectively with pediatric patients. - <p> A Child 's Age Matters <p> Children are going to have different needs at different ages . For example , very young children may be confused and scared , while a teenager may be self-conscious or angry about their situation .

Child life specialists are trained to work with children who are dealing with medical issues . They can provide explanations of procedures , activities during downtime and a distraction during procedures . <p> Dealing with Difficult Situations <p> Dealing with children facing medical issues , including life threatening situations , can be emotionally challenging for workers . Healthcare workers are often compassionate , which makes it difficult to avoid feeling bad for the families involved . It is important healthcare workers continue to be empathetic and kind , but not to overstep boundaries .

I knew that they were leaving for speech , but I did n't really know what that was or why it was necessary . I just knew that I wanted to go and that I was so jealous of those kids who got to leave class , regardless of why it was . <p> As an adult , I see speech therapy in such a different light . It 's not about getting to leave class and do something different from the other students , although that is an incentive for kids who might otherwise be unwilling .

Kids who talk differently from other children know that they do , and that can affect confidence . The age-old lisp , turning Rs into Ws , stuttering " these are some of the classic issues that cause students to need assistance from a speech therapist . Sure , these things may be cute when they are five years old , but at age 10 , such problems are n't so adorable . <p> If your child seems to be having trouble socializing at school and you know that they have a speech issue , consider enrolling them in speech therapy . Newfound skills build confidence , and they will be eager to show off their new speech skills by talking to other people . <p> Speech Therapy is Fun <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adult , speech therapy is a bore and may even be an embarrassment . For this reason , most adults who may benefit from speech therapy do n't get the help they need . Do your child a favor and allow them to attend speech therapy at school while it is still fun . - Not only does this take away from the bore of re Not only does this take away from the bore of regular curriculum , but it gives students something else to improve , work on and look forward to outside of their regular studies . <p> While it may not sound like a ball of joy to a parent , most kids find speech therapy to be fun and look forward to it . <p> Avoid Costs down the Line <p> When it is offered by the school , speech therapy is free of charge .

It increases their confidence , their chances of success in school , and gives them the tools they need to combat their speech issue for the rest of their life . Do your child a favor and enroll them in speech at school if they need it . They will come home ranting and raving about the fun they had before too long , and you will see their speaking improve for the better .

Some skills are technical , such as knowing how to start an IV or change a dressing . Other skills are intellectual including calculating medication dosages or interpreting lab results . <p> But there are also another set of skills that are equally important for nurses to have . Soft skills are not something you can easily measure , but they are an important part of being a good nurse . <p> If you have never heard of soft skills , you might wonder what they are. - Soft skills are personal attributes that help you interact effectively with others . Soft skills are essential in nursing to give it that human touch . <p> Of course , - technical skills , such as drawing labs , inserting catheters and suctioning a tracheostomy are necessary for nurses to be qualified to work .

Consider a few soft skills below that can help a nurse be effective : <p> Communication skills : Communication skills are one of the most important soft skills a nurse can have . Effective communication helps prevent medical errors , improves patient care and builds strong working relationships . Strong communication skills help patients understand what 's happening with their care . But there is more to communication skills than talking . Good communicators also listen well .

As a nurse , you 'll have plenty of opportunities to deal with dilemmas and difficult situations that require critical thinking skills . <h> The Importance of Soft Skills <p> So why are soft skills so important ? Soft skills make working with other staff members more effective and enjoyable . If you have good working relationships , it makes your work experience better . But that 's not all .

It 's not always easy to keep students interested . Getting students engaged in therapy is half the battle . That 's where technology and apps may help . <p> Although you do n't want to rely solely on screen time , certain apps can be useful . Integrating various therapy apps into your treatments sessions can increase participation , interest and make therapy something kids enjoy. - <p> Apps for kids with special needs can help students participate in self-directed play and develop life skills . They can also promote a variety of skills , such as motor , visual perception , and sensory skills . Specific apps also help you work with students on math skills , writing , and social skills . <p> One of the benefits of using apps is therapy can feel like a game , which helps keep a student 's attention .

With the large variety of apps available , there is something for students of all ages and abilities .

There are different categories of books to choose from , such as humor and fantasy or kids can make up their own theme . After writing the text , kids draw pictures to go with their story . <p> My Little Suitcase is an app that helps with visual perception skills . If you 're working with a small group , the app allows four players at the same time . It 's a simple memory game . Students find matches for items they would pack in a suitcase . At the end of the game , kids guess where they are traveling based on what they packed . <p> Improving writing skills is often a goal for school-based occupational therapists. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine motor skills . Students trace letters , shapes , and numbers , and are provided with visual and auditory feedback to let them know when they use correct formation . <p> Ready to Print is an app that may work well for school-based therapists . It 's great for preschoolers , but can be used with school-age kids as well . It helps work on fine motor skills and visual perception . It also builds a foundation for writing . There are various activities for kids of all ability levels . Students can complete mazes , connect the dots , or do simple activities , such as touching targets . <p> Put it Away is an app that helps teach students how to clean their room and put things back where they belong. - It promotes independence . Kids drag objects from one location to where they should be put away . It teaches students how to organize items and associate where certain things belong . You can customize the app with pictures of a student 's home environment to make it more effective .

That day of the 5K , it was snowing so hard we could barely see five feet in front of us . We crossed the start line and had maybe ran about twenty feet when one of the girls said to me " Bridget , we must be almost there . Right ?

Of course , one of the biggest perks is living in and exploring different parts of the country . <p> As a healthcare professional , you 're not the only one who benefits . Healthcare travelers , such as nurses , physical therapists and physician assistants all make a difference in multiple peoples lives . Although it can vary , consider some of the common ways healthcare travelers make a difference with every assignment they take. - <h> Travelers often bring a new perspective <p> Healthcare travelers are new to whatever facility they are working in . Working in various hospitals allows travelers to see how things are done in- different facilities . Travelers can offer new insights and ways of doing things from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not all . A traveler may not know all the ins and outs of their new place of employment , but in some ways , that may be helpful . Healthcare travelers bring a fresh perspective to the job . They are not fed-up with hospital policies or tired of dealing with the same old issues at work . A fresh set of eyes can be invaluable to a facility and bring a positive attitude , which could help staff look at the situation differently . <h> Ease patient workload <p> Healthcare travelers are often needed when there is a shortage of permanent staff . Travelers may be needed for a variety of reasons including to provide additional support during busy times or fill in for staff who are on leave from their job . Travelers also are sought after to work in difficult-to-fill positions . Whatever the reason they come on board , healthcare travelers provide the additional staff needed , which eases the workload of permanent staff. - - <h> Help fight burnout <p> One reason permanent healthcare workers become burned out is because they feel overworked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take their- toll . By easing the workload , healthcare travelers may prevent other staff members from becoming overwhelmed. - - <h> Improved patient satisfaction <p> When patients feel staff spend adequate time with them , they are often better satisfied with the care they receive . When a facility is- short-staffed , workers often have to rush through their tasks to complete everything . Some of the human connection may take a back seat to getting through all the work . When- travelers start working , they take some of the burden and workloads are- smaller , so staff can spend the time they need with their patients . <h> Better quality of care <p> Probably one of the most important ways healthcare travelers make an impact is by improving quality of care . By keeping staffing levels safe , everyone can do their job better , which means the patients get the care they deserve . <h> Inspire <p> Working as a healthcare traveler , making and impact and seeing the country is a great gig .

If the answer is yes , you 're in good company . In addition to nurses , speech therapists , physical therapists , and occupational therapists are also needed for travel assignments in a variety of healthcare settings . <p> While the idea of working as a healthcare traveler may be appealing , it may also be a little overwhelming . After all , you might think that you have to be outgoing and an extrovert to succeed as a healthcare traveler , but that 's not the case . Plenty of people who consider themselves introverts can also flourish on the road . If you tend to be a little on the quiet side , you can still thrive on a healthcare travel assignment . <h> One Day at a Time <p> One of the best things you can do is take one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignment with a plethora of- concerns , it 's easy to become overwhelmed . Do n't get ahead of yourself . Remember that you do n't have to become instant best friends with everyone you meet . Let relationships evolve naturally . Give yourself a little time to get used to your new environment . <p> As an introvert , you also have to be realistic about what you can handle . If you are busy at work all day , you may not want to immediately go out with your coworkers after work . Instead , you may need a little downtime to unwind by yourself . <p> Also , consider what type of social situations you are comfortable with . Do you prefer to hang out with a small group of people instead of going to a crowded club ?

Consider making the first move to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new neighbors . Consider bringing treats to work or sharing with neighbors to introduce yourself and build rapport . It does n't  require a lot of interaction time to drop off treats but still improves your reputation as a co-worker and friend . <h> Allow Yourself Time to Recharge <p> Working as a healthcare worker often involves a lot of interaction with co-workers , patients , and their families . It can be draining for an introvert to have all that interaction all day long . It 's okay to take time for yourself . <p> Being an introvert does not mean you are a loner , but it might mean you need a little time by yourself to recharge . One thing that sometimes separates extroverts from introverts is that extroverts recharge by being around others , while introverts need time by themselves to decompress . <p> It may also help increase your confidence to realize the strengths that many introverts have . Introverts are often good listeners , which will help you get to know your co-workers better . Introverts often like to put the spotlight on others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Introverts sometimes take a little longer to feel comfortable in a new situation .

Many healthcare professionals wear scrubs when they are at work . You might have no other choice when it comes to your work wardrobe , or you might just prefer to wear scrubs . <p> The good news is more scrub choices are available today than in the past . The bad news is scrubs may still not be your top fashion choice . Regardless of whether you love them or hate them , there are some scrub dos and don'ts to keep in mind . <p> DO check to see if the hospital has a certain policy for which color scrubs you can wear . For example , nurses might be required to wear blue scrubs while physical therapists may have to wear green . You do n't want to spend money on scrubs only to find out you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out if you get a uniform allowance or if the hospital provides scrubs .

Depending on your job , you may be repositioning patients , moving equipment , and bending or squatting throughout the day . Drawstring or elastic waistbands may work well . <p> DO choose the right size . Scrubs that are too baggy are unflattering and can even look sloppy . If possible , try scrubs on before purchasing and select something that fits well without being too tight .

Keep it professional , which means no deep V-necks or undies peeking through . It 's not just women who should avoid low-cut scrubs or t-shirts . Male chest hair peeking out through a scrub top is also a no-no . When it comes to scrubs , a big fashion faux pas is trying to make them look inappropriate . <p> Do n't wear low riders . But in the hospital when you 're bending over , you do n't want to be showing too much .

There are a lot of perks , but there are some negatives as well.and some parts of the job belong on both lists , because one mans trash is another mans treasure . Confused ? Do n't  worry , you 'll see . <p> Pros of a Travel Nursing Career <p> 1 . The travel . Obvious ? Maybe . But have you stopped to think about all that travel has to offer ? You choose what assignments to accept and where to go . Its a great way to try Boston clam chowder in Boston and visit all the historic sightsmaybe ride that silly duck tour . Or accept an assignment in Cincinnati in the fall to catch a few Bengals games.or the Yankees in NY . <p> If sports are n't  your thing , maybe youd like to dip into history and visit Washington D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from coast to coast for the beaches . <p> 2 . The money . Travel nursing nearly always pays more per assignment than a permanent position , but the money adds up in other ways as well . All your expenses are paid . So not only do you pocket a more than competitive salary and often an attractive bonus package , you are n't  paying all those bills that would normally come out of your salary . <p> 3 . The networking . Your average nurses in the trenches cant meet and impress the sheer number of doctors , administrators , and other nurses . The advantage of networking is simple . Employability. - The more contacts you have , the more likely you are to get a job when you decide to settle down . Put your best foot forward and people will remember you . <p> 4 . The freedom . You 're in control of your own career . Once in a while , you 'll land a bad assignment . But its only for a few weeksand then you move on . If its really bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of career freedom . <p> The Cons of a Travel Nursing Career <p> 1 . The travel . What ? Wasnt that on the pro list ? It was . But travel can be stressful , and some people simply cant conceive of leaving home and going from place to place . Todays travel nurses , armed with iPads and face-to-face chats with friends and family , are much more connected than nurses from a decade ago , but it can still be lonely on the road . The good news : you can usually bring your pets , your spouse , your kids if they 're out of school , or a friend who needs a vacation . Sometimes you have to share accommodations , but as long as you 're up front about what you want , you can choose to take your living allowance and find your own place . <p> 2 . New situations . You know your job , but you 're walking in to a new working environment every few months , and it will not always be comfortable at first . You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , no matter where you land . You also have to have the ability to hit the ground running . <p> 3 . Opportunities lost . This depends heavily on your goals . If the endgame is to put down roots and move up the career ladder , then the answer is balance . Travel nursing looks great on a resume and gives you networking advantages you would not get otherwise . When the perfect opportunity knocksa plum permanent assignment at a place you love in a location that suits youyou have to know it when you see it . <p> Sooo true . I was a travel nurse . Landed a position that I did sign on for a permenant assignment for 2 years . I have been here now for 3 years permenant and sometimes feel travel nurses I work with have it so much better than me .

In addition to being rewarding , there is often flexibility in the types of jobs you can work . For example , not all jobs in healthcare are full or part-time . Many healthcare workers also work per diem . <p> Working per diem can be a great way to supplement your full-time job . Before deciding if a per diem job is right for you , it is helpful to have a thorough understanding of what is involved . <p> Per diem work involves working when the need arises as opposed to a set schedule .

Per diem employees may also be needed during periods when the hospital census is high , such as during flu seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice for people who already have a regular job .

In many cases , per diem employees are paid at a rate higher than regular employees because they are not receiving benefits like health insurance . You may also get opportunities to work in various settings . For instance , if you are a nurse working per diem at a staffing agency , you may have the chance to work in an ER of a hospital one shift , and the next assignment may be in a different department or facility . <p> Another advantage of working of per diem is that you can work additional shifts when needed and cut back at other times of the year .

@@76898833 @5598833/ <h> Preventing a Lice Outbreak <p> by Angela Stevens on October 12 , 2009 <p> The first step in preventing the spread of lice in a school setting is for the school nurse to remind teachers of the signs of a lice infestation . Teachers must look for students who are constantly scratching their head , especially on the back of their neck or behind their ears . Adult lice are about the size of a sesame seed and may be gray , white , or tan . <p> If a student is suspected of having lice , the child should be sent to the school nurse who will then comb through the child 's hair to verify infestation . If the child does have lice , she will be kept in the clinic until a parent or guardian can retrieve her . Once the child has been taken home , the school nurse must begin working to identify other children and prevent further spread . <p> All students the child comes into contact with should be inspected by the school nurse . Students in the same class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same lunch period should all be sent to the nurse . If the student has been in contact with a large majority of students the school nurse may need to inspect the entire student population . This can be accomplished by scheduling appointments for the students and may require the nurse to have assistants . If multiple students are found to have lice , sending a letter home is in order . Without identifying the student or students affected , parents should be made aware that lice have been discovered in some of the students at school . A request should be made of parents to have them also check their child as well as any other children in the home . If someone in the home also has lice , that person may unknowingly give it back to a child who has undergone treatment already . <p> Finally , the most important role a school nurse may play when there is an outbreak of lice in the school is that of a comforter . Many adults have biased attitudes about lice that are not factual and that can influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition , and it is not found only on children with bad hygiene . Additionally , the school nurse should make sure parents know it is not necessary to cut or shave a child 's hair , as the medications for lice eradication are quite capable . It is important , however , that the school nurse reinforces the importance of checking other family members , as reintroduction of lice typically occurs in the home . <p> Have you had lice or had to tell a child and her family they needed to treat for lice ? How did it affect you or how did it affect the children and family ?

Being a travel nurse is different than working as a staff nurse . Travel nursing presents some unique challenges that a permanent job does not , but it is worth the effort because of all the rewards . Below are several suggestions to help you make the transition to travel nursing . <h> Take advantage of your orientation . <p> As a new travel nurse , you should get an orientation to your facility . Every hospital has a different procedure for orientation . Travel nurses are often expected to jump right in , so your training may not be as long as a staff nurse gets .

For example , ask questions , get a tour and find a mentor . <h> Locate your resources . <p> One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an emergency and not know where the crash cart is .

Your travel contract should also provide information on certain scheduling aspects , such as how many weekends you are required to work in a month . It 's also helpful to find out who will get called off for a low patient census shift . Consider asking other questions , such as what is the policy for floating to another unit and what the holiday work requirements involve . <h> Give yourself a little downtime each day . <p> Part of why you 're working as a travel nurse is probably for the adventure .

Once you make friends , it makes the travel assignment even more exciting . <h> Take a deep breath . <p> Adjusting to working as a travel nurse can take a bit of time . Some nurses may feel right at home quickly . But others may find they are homesick or questioning if they made the right choice . Give yourself a little time . It 's common to feel a bit overwhelmed at first . Remember to take things one day at a time .

However , that can sometimes sound easier than it really is . <p> I 've encountered families where it 's emotionally draining to be in contact with them . While I ca n't go into specifics , it 's pretty safe to say that , with some families and students , I 've wanted to reach out to them and offer more than my services as a psychologist . I believe it 's human nature to want to help those in need , and that 's part of what drove me to get into psychology .

Allowing yourself to get pulled in by the family and the students emotionally can cause a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's difficult at times to distance yourself emotionally , but it 's a must if you 're going to be successful at your job and at serving the community and the schools you work with . <p> In order to keep yourself from risking your professionalism , take these rules of professional conduct into consideration whenever you feel that you 're getting too close to the situation . <p> You are an advocate to the school , the community , and the students you serve . It 's in everyone 's best interest to protect students ' identities when conducting research or working with a family and school . <p> You make a distinction between what you say as an individual and as a professional representing the school , community , or students you 're working with .

In a case such as that , it 's better to refer the family or student to a neutral party or counselor . <p> Much of maintaining your professionalism is learned through situations you encounter as well as staying current on the ethical standards of the National Association of School Psychologists ( NASP ) or the American School Counselor Association . As the times and technology changes , even school psychologists are subject to the flux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Doctors , nurses , healthcare staff , and mental health staff all have stressful jobs to begin with , but when that profession focuses exclusively on children , it seems the stress factor increases exponentially . <p> While working with children , I have made numerous friends in the medical field who specialize in pediatrics . One lady in particular stands out " Debbie . For many years , she was a neonatal nurse before she began working with me to help older children . Over lunch or coffee , she would often tell me about some of the highs and lows of being a neonatal nurse . <p> Neonatal nursing involves much more than standard nursing care for a patient . A neonatal nurse must be able to care for an i 'll baby , as well as offer emotional support to the parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her patients , she was often completely in charge of all care and feeding of a patient in addition to routine medical tasks . Once the baby became stronger , she would teach the parents how to handle or avoid equipment while changing , feeding , or cuddling the baby . The high point of her profession was when a baby who had been struggling was able to be sent home as a healthy happy bundle of joy . <p> Exhausted and worried parents would often come to the neonatal nurses for information and answers because they were more readily available than the doctors were . This was sometimes difficult for Debbie because there is little concrete information nurses are allowed to distribute . The aftermath of dealing with these emotionally distraught parents took its toll on her emotional health as well . <p> Of course , the most heartbreaking part of her job was the same as for any other nurse , the death of a patient . She felt this was amplified by the hopes and joy the child was anticipated with , and felt the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most she could do for these parents was to hold them and let them cry and then go home and cry for them herself . <p> Ultimately , Debbie found the job to be more rewarding than stressful , and she retired from her hospital after 30 years . She and I became friends in her second career and not as a result of being unhappy in her first career . Understanding the stress parents of children felt helped her treat our patients and helped her deal more compassionately with the children 's parents . <p> What made you want to become a neonatal nurse ? What parts of the job are you most looking forward to ?

She actually was a resident on several occasions for different reasons . This was the first glimpse I had at the extreme versatility of a nursing home nurse . <p> Many nursing homes have different levels of care . Some areas are for rehabilitation or recovery , while others provide long-term care . My grandmother used both sides of our local nursing home , which allowed me to meet and get to know a number of the nurses . <p> The responsibilities of a nursing home nurse ranges from helping a person who has broken a hip become ambulatory again to assisting a patient with advanced Alzheimer 's disease . This means that the nursing care may be extremely light or intensive depending on the patient 's circumstances and needs . <p> The first time my grandmother was in the nursing home , she was recovering from major surgery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , but did not think she needed to remain in the hospital . At first , the nurses had to monitor her diet , medications , and keep the wound clean . She needed assistance in all activities of daily living , including personal grooming . Some of these tasks were completed by nurses and others by aides . I found that the rehabilitation and recovery nursing was one of the highlights for the nurses . These patients were going to recover and return home . The nurses were able to meet the families and form relationships with the patients that were not going to become painful later . <p> The last time my grandmother was in the nursing home was for an advanced illness . While the nurses and staff were professional , helpful , and even friendly to my grandmother and my family , they still seemed more subdued . I realized later that , while the job was still something they loved , it took more of a toll emotionally . While they got to know all of us , they knew we would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obvious that they had still grown attached to my family . This would definitely be the low side of becoming a nursing home nurse . While it certainly is rewarding to help the family and the patient through a difficult time , it is also emotionally draining to lose people on a regular basis that you have become close to . Even those who maintain a professional detachment will find one or two patients each year that are especially endearing . Learning to balance this love and loss takes a true gift . 
@@76898868 @5598868/ <h> Pros and Cons of Co-Teaching <p> by Howard Gerber on January 9 , 2012 <p> There are several reasons why many schools have begun to adopt a co-teaching model in their classrooms . Class size laws in many states require a lower student to teacher ratio as do many individualized education plans . Co-teaching can even result in a better teaching experience for the teachers and the students , as long as the teachers get along . <p> Class Size <p> From an administrative perspective co-teaching is extremely attractive . Many states consider two teachers in one classroom of 40 adequate for a 20 classroom size limit . This is great for schools which do n't have enough the physical space or monetary means to add extra classrooms to reduce class sizes . For teachers it means not having to face the task of supervising , teaching , and grading work for 40 students in five to six classes each day . However , there are still 40 children crammed into that one classroom . The ability to have those larger numbers may make administrative staff more inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having that many children in one class is going to be more difficult to teach and control , even with two teachers . <p> Special Education <p> Many individualized education plans , or IEPs , require that a student have access to a special education teacher during specific classes . By making one of the teachers in a co-teaching team a special education teacher , a school can accommodate more students in each class than if the teacher had to move between classes . For example , five students who have an additional assistance accommodation in math could all be scheduled together in the same math class where the special education teacher could co-teach with the math teacher . That special education teacher could then go to an English class and co-teach to meet the IEP specifications of another set of students the following period . The danger with this is that those special education students would be grouped together , which does not fully honor the spirit of an inclusive classroom experience . <p> Personalities <p> Many teachers have strong personalities and almost every teacher has his or her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing , grading , and even decorating . Co-teaching offers the opportunity for great success and great failure . If the teaching styles of the two teachers mesh well together they may find the experience more relaxing and more effective for themselves and their students . If the two have completely different teaching styles and preferences it could turn into a nightmare for the staff and the students . <p> Have you been a member of a co-teaching team ? How did it affect your overall happiness with your job and how did the children react to having two teachers in a room ? Do you think this is an effective solution to classroom size regulations or IEP accommodations ?

However , as an educator , it is the duty of all teachers to teach about the diversity that makes this nation so great . <p> By widening the scope of holiday decorations to encompass more than just those holidays that are widely commercialized , educators will be able to broaden the scope of understanding of the students whose minds they are supposed to be engaging . They will also be able to include the holidays of some of their minority students who may otherwise feel left out during the more mainstream holidays . By encouraging students to share what holidays are important to their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educators will be taking advantage of what is often referred to as a teachable moment . Which brings us to the role of holiday decorations : they should be used to encourage teachable moments . <p> What holidays do you decorate for and how do you use those decorations to open the minds of your students ? 
@@76898872 @5598872/ <h> Pros and Cons of Matching Scrubs in the Workplace <p> by Howard Gerber on February 16 , 2012 <p> When you walk into a hospital or a doctor 's office , one of the first things a person sees is the office staff , then a nurse , and finally a doctor . For years now , hospitals and private practices have been moving toward allowing everyone to wear scrubs to work . Staff members and patients tend to love the policy or completely hate it , and there are good points to be made for either side . <p> Love the Scrubs Trend <p> There is certainly something to be said for uniforms . Schools , athletic teams , and almost every other organized group have some sort of uniform that allows people to recognize members easily . This same premise is the reason matching scrubs have become so popular . They allow patients to instantly recognize who in the area may be able to help them . It also allows for a sense of unity and can increase teamwork between coworkers . Another positive feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have to think much about getting dressed for work . Instead of spending valuable time before work choosing just the right outfit , you can look for a clean pair of scrubs and be on your way . Comfort is another key factor . It is much easier to move and accomplish daily tasks in scrubs . This is true whether you are seeing patients or having to climb up ladders for patient files . <p> Hate the Scrubs Trend <p> The only people in a hospital or doctor 's office who should be discussing medical issues are nurses and doctors . However , when everyone looks the same , it is easy for patients to get confused and ask office staff about medical issues . This tends to be frustrating for both the patient and the office worker . Another annoyance is that if the administrators choose a color that is less common , it may be difficult to find options that are flattering for all staff members . Finally , if all staff members have to wear matching scrubs , it greatly reduces the individuality each person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposefully wear cartoon characters or animals to cheer patients up or to make the day more enjoyable for themselves . By having to conform to a strict dress code this creative outlet is removed potentially making the workplace less enjoyable . <p> How do you feel about mandated matching scrubs in the workplace ? Do you think it makes life easier or do you prefer standing out from the crowd ? <p> After years of hearing everything imaginable from the " white jacket " types of Nursing Admin folks who wander the corridors trying to look busy , I have to admit I almost lost it when one of them Seriously told me that it is Arlington Hospitals policy for nursing personnel Not to Ever wear any scrubs that have faces on them because patients recovering from anesthesia can be horribly frightened by seeing them . In 25+ years of Critical Care Nursing ( including Surgical Recovery ) I have never , ever seen a patient respond to anything nurses might be wearing . What they have mentioned is : wanting pain meds , repositioning , being cold , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or sometimes the IV bothering them . Never once heard anyone mention my scrub top scared them .

One of the best ways is by being a team player . Nursing is not a job where you can keep to yourself and go it alone . Working in a collaborative environment will make things run smoother and make your workday more enjoyable . Good teamwork also improves patient care and eases stress . <p> Working well as part of a team helps set the tone and shows your work ethic right from the start . It also helps your coworkers trust you , which is important at any new job . Consider the suggestions below to be a team player . <p> Be flexible . Flexibility is needed if you are going to be a team player . You may need to take on an extra patient if a coworker is busy , or switch gears and stop what you 're doing to help a colleague in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps to get to know your coworkers , so you 'll understand their strengths and weaknesses . Everyone has areas of their job where they excel . But there may also be tasks that are a little more challenging for some . If you know your coworker has trouble starting intravenous lines , offer to help if you are around when he needs it . <p> Maintain good communication . Being a team player without effective communication is difficult . Talk honestly with your coworkers to find out what they need . But good communication also goes both ways . Do n't expect your colleagues to know what you need if you do n't ask . If you need help , be clear when asking for assistance . <p> Lead by example . There may be instances where you can take a difficult patient or perform unpopular duties . Doing something your coworkers dread shows the team your willingness to put team members first . <p> Be a problem solver . In some cases , helping does not involve performing a task or taking on extra work . Pitching in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem for your teammate . Do n't be afraid to speak up if you think you have the answer to a problem . <p> Keep the entire team in mind . Your team usually does not just include other nurses . Travel nurses often work with an array of workers from other disciplines . Being a team player does n't mean you take on responsibilities outside your scope of practice . But it may mean lending a hand when you can . It may be helpful to hold a frigidity patient 's arm when the lab tech is drawing blood or help the respiratory therapist position a patient for therapy . <p> Say thank you . Everyone likes to know they are appreciated . If you see a coworker going above and beyond , give some positive reinforcement . Also , when help is offered to you even if you do n't accept it , never forget your manners . A simple thank you can go a long way in letting your teammates feel valued .
