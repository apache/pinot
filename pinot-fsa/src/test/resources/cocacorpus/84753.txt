What are they trying to prove ? How does pointing out " shrinkage " somehow elevate or affirm natural hair ? In a backward move , it does n't  affirm natural hair at all . Instead long straight hair is still being used as the definition of feminine beauty . So natural hair is nice and all , but its ability to achieve the LSH look is the thing folks should celebrate . <p> Very perceptive comments .

@@72561211 @1261211/ <h> Five Realities of Being a Light-Skinned Token <p> Its 2017 , and colorism is clearly alive and well . We know this , although some refuse to acknowledge or admit it . Some do n't  think its important because at the end of the day , to most , being black will trump the color of your skin . Some do n't  admit it out of guilt , lack of empathy or willful ignorance . Regardless , it is n't going to go anywhere if we can not have open , honest , and respectful conversations about it without resorting to insults . <p> As a light-skinned black woman , colorism is n't a topic I like to broach because I 'm damned if I do talk about it and damned if I do n't  . Ive been told that I only believe colorism and light-skinned privilege exist because it makes me feel superior . On the flip side , I 've also been accused of ignoring light-skinned privilege and the plight of darker-toned black women . Ultimately , I 've learned that sometimes a lot of times I just need to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in the black community has a place in the conversation . <p> Light-skinned women occupy an awkward space . We are often seen as the " ideal " black woman , but also insulted for being " not really " black , " diluted " black , or just " not black enough . " As a much-needed dark-skinned pride movement bubbles up on social media , some have gone so far as to associate true blackness with dark skin only , patently rejecting the blackness of all else . This leaves women like me in an awkward space because we are not accepted , nor do we belong , outside of black culture . <p> There 's no question that lighter-toned women are often used as a safer , more acceptable representation of black women in mainstream media ( and this has been going on for decades now , peep this shockingly colorist vintage Ebony magazine cover ) the assumption is that I find this flattering or acceptable . I can only speak on my personal experience and those around me when I say I really do n't  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who cheer when were obviously ( and often awkwardly ) placed in a sea of white women to show " diversity . " Allow me to break down some realities of being a light-skinned token . <p> 1 . It increases resentment within the black community , especially among women . You think that people care that I do n't  like light-skinned women being paraded around as ambiguous representations of black beauty ? Of course not , we likely wo n't even get to that point of the conversation . There 's a misdirected resentment towards light-skinned women due to colorism when we literally have no control over the color of our skin . I actually believe there are specific reasons to promote this division that has roots in slavery , but I 'm trying to keep this article semi-short , and the concept is nothing new . <p> 2 . People tend to find it more acceptable to say racist things around you . Sophia Richie expressed this some time ago ( and people even threw her a side eye because she apparently does n't  look black enough ) , but people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to think you 're docile or have a reason to be less militant ( ie , privileged ) . " Oh , you are n't  a real black person , I was n't talking about you . " Last time I checked , being black was n't a processed burger from a fast food joint compiled of artificial materials . My blackness is real , it matters , and I do n't  play that shit . <p> 3 . Colorism exhibited by the mainstream is anti-black and strips away our identity as black women . I fail to understand why I would be happy to see someone who looks like me be a representative of the black race when I know that the reason explicitly is rooted in not looking " that " black or being " acceptable " black . What kind of victory is that ? This is more of a convenience to the media but a complete disservice to everyone in the black community , not just those excluded in representation . <p> 4 . You sometimes question whether an opportunity is the result of your skin color rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking others if they were okay with accepting an opportunity that they could confirm was the result of privilege , and while I 'd like to think not , everyone is n't that blatant about it . Whether the opportunity is minor or major , its a nagging thought . <p> 5 . Some believe that your light skin is a get out of racism free ! card . It is n't . Months ago , I saw a combative and divisive meme circulating the web challenging light-skinned women to relay their stories about being called a monkey . The assumption , of course , was that they could n't so they should stop whining about being bullied for having lighter skin . But to a racist non-black person , a " monkey " is a beast regardless of skin tone . Not to mention , skin color does n't  exclude one from having black features that are often ridiculed in society , such as " soup cooler " lips , " nigger noses , " and the like . <p> Let me be 100% clear , this is not an article that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dismiss my societal privilege ( which is well documented ) , or my ability to exist more comfortably in certain spaces .

When Montgomery and his troops conducted an assault on a collection of plantations along the Combahee River , Tubman served as a key adviser and accompanied the raid . On the morning of June 2 , 1863 , Tubman guided three steamboats around Confederate mines in the waters leading to the shore . Once ashore , the Union troops set fire to the plantations , destroying infrastructure and seizing thousands of dollars worth of food and supplies . When the steamboats sounded their whistles , slaves throughout the area understood that it was being liberated . Tubman watched as slaves stampeded toward the boats .

@@72561250 @1261250/ <p> The song is entitled Creole and , I 'm guessing , was supposed to be a celebration of Beyonces Creole heritage . Though born and raised in Texas , Beyonces mother Tina Knowles has roots in Louisiana Creole culture , which is a mix of French , Spanish , African and Native American cultures . In a 2012 LOreal campaign , the singer famously defined her heritage as " African , French and Native American " , and in her hit anthem Formation , she refers to being a mix of Creole and Negro . <p> Unfortunately , the song reads more as a celebration of light skinnedness . Here are the lyrics ; <p> Okay so let 's set aside the fact that the lyrics are atrocious and the music sounds like it was pieced together from discarded BDay samples . The song is lacking for other reasons . <p> Many blacks in America are multiracial . Having existed in this country for hundreds of years , most of us have European ancestry . However , it seems we are most invested in acknowledging this ancestry for what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loosen our hair . Beyonce is obviously connected to her Creole heritage , but to distill it down to being " exotically tempting " and a " yellow bone " is reductive and even embarrassing given that Louisiana Creole culture is rich in language , dress , tradition and cuisine . <p> Having said this , the song is a decade old . Beyonce has certainly grown and developed since then . I would be surprised if she still co-signed this . <p> this reads as a reach ( like arm out of socket ) if she calls for red/yellow/brown bones to floorwhere is the colorism ? Would you like her to hit up pantone to make sure she gets every shade ? What does sound suspect is this line here : <p> Many blacks in America are multiracial .

Yes , some are but the majority are n't  . Some of those attributes you stated , such as voodoo ( black magic or roots ) , can be seen in the south ( Georgia , South Carolina , Florida , Mississippi ) and its due to our African ancestors , not Haitian influence . <p> I 'm not denying Haitian influence in Creoles but some of this can be seen in other black groups due to all of our ancestors being from West Africa . <p> I love Kompa music . Its really big in the DR . Haitians in the Caribe , Ethiopians in Africa , Hondurans in Central America would always have the love of fighting for freedom where they stood . Ethiopians were never enslaved AT ALL . Hondurans were in the Caribe and were sent to Central America . They speak Spanish and will go on and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their freedom .

I could see if she was only talking about light skin or yellow bones , but she did n't  . She even equated the different skin tones to Creole food . Help me understand how this is colorism . <p> This is one of the dumbest articles that I have ever read . What on earth is the author even talking about ? Is she that insecure that she does n't  think that someone can not celebrate their own heritage ? Did I miss something .

She should be able to voice whether implicitly or explicitly that she is proud of her light skin . She should n't be made to feel bad about this because others are dark skinned .

There is a lot to fix right there . <p> Ok , but you sound like any light skin black from America , the Caribe , South America calling others so Black and yourself and your tribe sooo light . So even in Tswana same old same old . So ancient tribal African tribe offers no enlightenment , no wisdom , no road map for doing better . <p> I 've actually lived in South Africa , a lot of them are naturally light skin and lot of them are dark too .

@@72561260 @1261260/ <p> Many black women are still in recovery from the season finale of Insecure , the critically acclaimed brainchild of Issa Rae . On social media its not uncommon to come across black women who shed tears during the penultimate scene , when Issas bitter and disillusioned ex-boyfriend Lawrence is seen vigorously sexing someone else . Since then , the internet has lit up with countless think pieces on who was right and who was wrong . Did Lawrence deserve to be cheated on after his several-year stint of ai n't  shitness on the couch ? Was Issa wrong for sexing Daniel while Lawrence was in the midst of getting his shit together ? Adding to the complexity is Raes own admission that she was deliberate about making the situation morally ambiguous . As a result , whatever side you 're on , both characters actions are kind of hard to completely defend . <p> In the midst of this all , one thing seems to have been forgotten . #Teamblackwomen was the real winner of Insecures first season . Because for the first time in a long time our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or black male lens . Not relegated to the side chick or the side kick . Black womanhood was front and center with no apologies and no filter . <p> Issa Rae and co-star Yvonne Orji , who plays Molly , are dark-skinned black women . That they are also loved and desired , however imperfectly , is a given . Its not a plot device or a wink to the audience . The hashtag #MELANINGODDESS does n't  flash across the screen every time they appear . <p> Instead , we enter a world where the desirability of these women , as life and sexual partners , is not under question . And in a media unhealthily obsessed with the supposed unlovability of black women , this alone is a huge psychological relief . <p> Sweeten this with the fact that Issa and Molly entertain a steady ( and visually pleasing ) stream of suitors , from perfect-assed Lawrence ( I know yall peeped that bathroom scene ) to Jidenna . Suitors who are black , Arab , Asian American . <p> Some might find this unrealistic . I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black girlfriends , scrolling through matches on OKCupid or EHarmony , trying to discern who may or may not be a creep . In the world of Insecure , that black women date , and date alot , is a given and not up for tortured debate . <p> And this is not to say the show does not tackle the structural issues we face out in the dating world . From Mollys racially ambiguous co-worker being wifed up by a black man despite being physically and professionally unremarkable , to the toxic commentary Lawrences friends offer about how black women in the old days knew how to sit and take it when their partners were unfaithful and unmotivated , the show offers plenty reminders of the patriarchy and anti-blackness we encounter in pursuit of enriching long-term relationships . But Insecure skillfully balances this with thoughtful commentary on how our own poor personal decision-making contributes to our dating dilemmas . Would things have looked different for Issa had she spoken up early and/or left Lawrence instead of passively remaining in a relationship she did n't  really want ? Is Mollys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy ? Towards the end , the show hints that both women could benefit from therapy to sort it all out . <p> Ultimately , Insecure is a win for black women because its our story , imagined , written and executed by one of us . No , black women are not a monolith , but we saw glimpses of ourselves and/or the black women we know in Issas anxiety and Mollys stubbornness , when Issa sat on the couch Netflix and chilling with Lawrence , when both women grappled with the consequences of self-sabotaging decisions . They were always complex , always beautiful , always unapologetically black . And for that reason , we definitely won .

The darkest matte foundation Maybelline sells on its UK site is Sun Beige . <p> The Maybelline matte foundations available in the UK.The Maybelline matte foundations available in the United States . <p> Gray wrote a blog post questioning why Maybelline was not catering to brown-skinned black women and dismissed the notion there is n't a market . ( According to a 2011 census there are 1.9 million black Brits in the UK . ) She also questioned why Dunn was used in the ad when her foundation color is n't even available . <p> " Even though I am annoyed by this I am not surprised , this is an issue that plagues any woman who is not white . Getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost impossible . <p> I like so many other black women have to buy high end foundations and concealer because billion dollar beauty corporations simply do n't  cater for us .

Same for Loreal paris . So its not even surprising to me . <p> Here in Canada , trust me there NOTHING for black woman . I can not buy any drugstore foundation . I do not understand why drugstore brand do n't  carry anything for black woman that 's really funny and weird .

To be honest I love makeup but I am makeup free 80% of the time ahah ! <p> I do n't  buy drug store foundation . My experience has been that its garbage .

I know it works for some people and I get why people would be upset . Consider this why are we begging companies to take our money who obviously do n't  give enough of a f about us or our money to make our shade . They obviously know we exist . <p> Exactly . I would advise Nadia to look into companies such as Black Radiance and Black Opal .

According to a recent article in Marie Claire , " the- practice allows women to marry each other to preserve their livelihoods in the absence of husbands . " <p> By Kurya tribal law , only men can inherit property , but under nyumba ntobhu , if a woman without sons is widowed or her husband leaves her , she is allowed to marry a younger woman who can take a male lover and give birth to heirs on her behalf . <p> While legally married in a same-sex union , these women are not romantically or sexually involved . To Westerners this sounds bizarre , to the nyumba ntobhu , however , the arrangement is win-win . According to Kurya reporter , Dinna Maningo : <p> these women realize the arrangement gives them more power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to choose their own male sexual partners . Marriages between women also help to reduce the risk of domestic abuse , child marriage , and female genital mutilation . <p> The arrangement usually involves a younger woman of child-bearing years marrying an older woman who is either childless or without a male heir . Its expected that the younger woman will take a boyfriend and produce an heir for her household . Given that birthing children is expected of all women in their society , marrying a woman does n't  change that norm .

" - Mukosa also has a boyfriend . " So far he has treated me beautifully , " she says . " But I can easily break up with him if that changes . " <p> Its important to note , however , that these marriages are not recognized by Tanzanian government .

@@72561313 @1261313/ <h> Does Natural Hair Retain Length Better with Braids or Weaves ? Poll <p> A few years back I wrote an article on why naturals should consider abandoning extensions/weaves as a regular/daily style routine . Flash forward to today and a reader wrote to me saying that the main reason she wore extensions is that they helped her hair grow faster and wondered why that was the case . Now , I understand what she meant was retain length rather than grow because we all know that the growth rate per se does not change whether your hair is in extensions or not . Additionally , let us assume that the extensions/weaves are done properly i.e not too tight/ not too small/ hairline protected . <p> If you have been around the natural world for a few years , you may also have heard of the crown and glory technique which was essentially an extension braid method to retain natural hair length . The original site is long gone but there are still some hair forums where this method is discussed and is popular as a length retention technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or weaves help you retain hair length better ? My answer is yes and no . <p> Yes Better protection for the ends and low/no daily manipulation The reason why some naturals may experience higher retention with braid extensions and weaves is due to two key reasons . These type of styles fully encase the hair which means that the ends of the hair are tucked into the extension . They are therefore not hanging out and being subjected to possible tangling . Additionally with full head weaves , all the hair is under no daily manipulation while braid extensions have very minimal manipulation for styling . These two effects probably contribute to length retention in a big way . No High stress during install , high weight of extensions on fine hair and shedding hair during takedown <p> Some naturals will , however , report that extensions really do not work for them . This is normally attributed to high breakage and shedding as a result of wearing extensions . During the install process , hair does have to be very thoroughly detangled and for some hair , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the norm to have each strand on its own . Naturals with fine individual strands or low density hair may also find that their hair is not able to really hold the weight of extensions . It is sometimes possible to even see breakage at the root of hair . Finally during the takedown process , shed hair must be removed carefully and not get trapped or tangled within hair that is not shedding . <p> In short , there is no straightforward answer . Some people will benefit from extensions while others will not .

Applying the sticky gels to wet hair is easiest . However , I apply gel on damp hair if I- am- looking to minimize shrinkage and have the overall most defined look .

We tend to overlook the issue , or settle on the idea that using a wide-toothed comb on wet hair should do the trick . I , too , believed that there was no more to be said on the issue , but that could n't be farther from the truth . <p> Enter : My paddle brush ( I use a standard Goody brand one found at any Target or Drug Store ) .

Let me repeat : IT WAS EVEN BETTER THAN THE WIDE-TOOTHED COMB ! <p> The paddle brush adds a smoothing element that a comb simply can not . While detangling from tip to root , it holds the conditioner within the brush which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follicles " which better coats them , and ( B ) reduces the amount of hair lost during the detangling process .

Have you tried a paddle brush for detangling ? How did it work ? <p> At the beginning of my journey , I would have said that wide tooth combs are the ONLY way to go . But I have learned from experience that such a comb does not do a really good job at finding all the tangles and shed hairs in my head .

@@72561333 @1261333/ <h> Science Confirms Castor Oil Does Not Thicken Hair Strands <p> Its one of the first recommended remedies when naturals complain of thin strands or weak edges ; " Girl just rub it with some castor oil ! " And many women swear by the thickening and strengthening properties of castor oil , but what if its not scientifically proven ! A detailed article from NaturallyCurly.com explains why castor oil does not actually thicken strands of hair <p> " it is biologically impossible for the physical hair strand to become thicker after it has emerged from the scalp . Therefore , it should make sense that products applied directly to the hair that promise to increase the thickness can only deliver the illusion of actual hair thickness . In order to physically grow thicker strands of hair , you would have to address the problem at the root ( pun intended ) " <p> But what about the many naturals who swear by incredible results from castor oil ? <p> " Improved hair density due to a castor oil treatment could be attributed to the lubricating of the scalp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can help clear up bacterial infested follicles . This can most likely be achieved with other oils such as rosemary or tea tree oil . In addition , it is often encouraged to lightly massage the oil into the scalp . A scalp massage alone could possibly stimulate blood circulation , which may help the flow of nutrients in the papilla . In this case , results would not be limited to the use of castor oil , but any product associated with a scalp massage or scrub . In my opinion , this all comes down to a personal preference . " <p> " castor oil perhaps can stick to hair more firmly than most oils and therefore create an illusion of thickness . Anyone who has used it will note how thick and viscous it is . It is almost like a soft glue and tends to stay put and not move when applied . It does not transfer easily either , which means that it can attract small particles of dust and lint which may also add to the illusion of thickness . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castor oil ! It is still an incredible oil with great sealing and strengthening abilities . <p> Yes , but people do n't  use castor oil to thicken their individual hair strands , but to restore thin edges ( increase the *number* of individual hair strands ) . And even this post admits that by killing bacterial growth on your scalp , it allows dormant follicles to produce hair and accomplish just what these ladies are looking for . = <p> I have been into natural hair sites for 4+ years and have never heard that black Jamaican castor oil made strands thicker ; I noted on my research that it help regrow and retain your edges , aaarrrggghhh , what 's up with that headline ! <p> Yeah , I 've never heard that either .

@@72561334 @1261334/ <h> The Science of Combing Breakage <p> Nicole sent these articles to me , and I found them fascinating . Its kind of a dense read , but it breaks down the physics of combing and its effects on the hair.The research was done by a C. Robbins , and these are summaries of the full experiments . <p> Impact loading and hair breakageDuring combing of hair , short fiber fragmentation ( less than 2.5 cm ) and longer segment breaks occur by different pathways . Longer fiber breaks most likely occur principally by impact loading . Impact loading causes hair breakage at lower loads than tensile loading , with essentially no increase in strain versus normal tensile testing , which produces large strain increases . L says " Impact loading " is applied stress on the strands over time , " Tensile loading " is stress/strain that challenges the fundamental strength of the strand ( example , pulling a strand from the root ) . Strain rates in impact loading are more similar to combing rates than rates of extension in tensile loading , and the looped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple extension of straight/non-crossed hairs in tensile testing . Extension or impacting hair fibers with flaws or damaged hair sections such as damaged wrapped ends produces short fiber fragmentation , while longer segment breaks may be produced in fibers with natural flaws such as fiber twists , cracks , or badly abraded or chemically weakened hair or even knots . <p> Pathways of breakageHair breakage during combing was evaluated by combing tresses and examining photographs of snags of hair fibers in combs . The resultant hair fiber arrangements suggest that breakage likely involves hair-on-hair interactions , and broken fragment size suggests that breakage occurs primarily at or near the hair-comb interface . Compression forces during combing were also measured , and impact loading of a hair fiber over another hair versus a hair fiber over a comb tooth shows that compression and abrasion are important to breakage during combing and that impact loading of one hair fiber over another during snagging is a probable and important pathway for hair breakage . <p> Brushing and combing hairDuring combing of hair , longer fiber breaks ( &gt;2.5 cm ) occur principally by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks ( &lt;2.5 cm ) occur primarily by end wrapping . Brushing provides breakage similarly but with a higher ratio of long-to-short segment breaks , and the ratio of long-to-short segment breaks ( L/S ) is a good way to follow these two pathways of breakage under different conditions . For example , bleaching hair , a longer comb stroke , increasing fiber curvature , wet combing versus dry combing , and brushing versus combing all provide for an increase in long segment breaks and this ratio , with the largest effect produced by brushing . <p> The effects of bleaching and conditioning on short and long segment breakage by wet and dry combing of tressesA recent publication ( 1 ) , provided evidence for two types of hair breakage during combing , short segment breakage ( approximately less than 1.27 cm ) and longer segment breakage . We have confirmed these results and refined the separation distance between short and long segment breakage at about 2.54 cm . Furthermore , chemical bleaching increased both short and long segment breakage while a commercial hair conditioner decreased both types of breakage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dry combing , short segment breakage increases with increasing comb strokes , that is , short segment breakage increases as combing damages the ends of the hair , however , long segment breakage does not increase with increasing comb strokes . Wet combing provided a decrease in short segment breakage and an increase in long segment breaks , but no increase in breakage with increasing comb strokes . Mechanical combing of tresses shows similar results qualitatively , however the variance was too large and adjustments need to be made to provide for a larger number of broken hairs to bring the mechanical and hand combing results in line . For dry combing , as the comb descends through the hair , hairs above it are made parallel and those beneath are either made parallel or knot by hairs looping around other hairs or hairs looping around comb teeth and other hairs several cm between the comb and the hair tips . As the comb advances through the looped/knotted hairs long breaks occur or as the comb descends near the tips wrapped ends can result . End wrapping by inertia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more severe if the hair is cut at 90 degrees versus a tapered cut . For wet combing , clumping of hairs by a capillary action produces fewer short segment breaks , by reducing end wrapping : however , crossed hair interactions occur &amp; because of higher friction more severe snags arise higher up in the tress , and lower hair breaking load due to plasticization by water , producing a larger number of long segment breaks . The very best practical way to evaluate hair strength is by counting the actual number of short and long segment breaks and by considering both wet and dry combing . <p> Interesting stuff .

Fine hair is easier to pull into one , and can look a bit more effortless <h> 4 . Hot Weather Friendly <p> There 's nothing hotter in the summer time than a mass of thick , heavy strands . The " scalpiness " of fine haired styles is actually a plus in the summer time , providing a way for heat to escape the body . <h> 5 . Shorter wash day <p> While thicker haired naturals have to divide their strands into several sections and cleanse and condition each one individually , fine haired naturals can get away with fewer section and , in some cases , not sectioning at all . Plus , fine haired section take less time to work through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detangling <p> When you have less strands to detangle , the process is much quicker . Plus , fine haired naturals can get away with finger detangling only , while many thicker haired naturals must also incorporate hair tools like Denman brushes and wide toothed combs. <h> 7 . Faster Styling <p> When there 's less hair to get through , styling tends to go faster . On fine hair a set of twists or box braids can take less than 2 hours , while thick hair styling often take 4 hours of more . Plus , thick hair can be a downside at the salon , with many stylists charging extra cash for clients with a lot of hair to get through .

Since then , I 've been diligently keeping the shears away from my hair with the hopes of obtaining a gorgeous medium-length by this time next year . <p> But as my hair has grown , I am feeling very uncertain about its texture and tendencies .

My hair has been relaxed since I was about two years old ( I am 23 now ) and even my mom ca n't remember my natural texture ( she told me that the main reason she relaxed my hair so early was because it was " difficult to manage " ) . But I took a risk because I desired something new for myself . Now I 'm not so sure if this was a good idea .

@@72561349 @1261349/ <h> 5 Ways to Make the Most of the Product Junkie Years <p> The old adage goes that you have to kiss a few frogs to find your prince . In my experience , becoming a product junkie where you end up with shelves full of hair products is a reality when you are starting out and do not know what really works . There are some people who buy new products because they want to and they like trying things . If you are in that group , this article is not really for you . If you are buying many products in order to find what works for you , then this is a guide that you can use so that you can narrow down your likes and dislikes : <p> 1 . Take a snapshot of the ingredient label We are living in a digital world and I know some of us are just too lazy to write down ingredients . Why not try the product and then take a snap shot of the ingredients label and file it under good or bad based on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you are shopping to compare to the next product you want to buy . Remember , that what counts the most are the first five ingredients after water , so there is no real need to scrutinize the whole list unless you are avoiding specific ingredients intentionally . 2 . Good or bad , nothing in between . In reality , there are some products which are not terrible but are not fantastic either . My advice is that if it does not make your hair feel lush and beautiful , file it under bad . There is no need to repurchase something mediocre . Just let it go , there are plenty more products out there to try ! 3 . Set a time limit Use it in 6 months or throw/gift/exchange If you want clutter free shelves then adopt a use or throw policy . If you still have a bottle of conditioner that is barely used 6 months after you bought it , the truth is that you do not like it . Many naturals could easily use up a bottle of conditioner within 4-6 washes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dent in the jar within a month and a good shampoo may take possibly 6 months to get to half full . After the six month mark , if you still have a nearly full product , throw it out , use it to shave your legs , give it to another natural to try , put it up for exchange at a hair meet-up but more importantly , just get it off your shelf ! <p> 4 . Do not try to fix or mix If you have a conditioner that requires a simple fix to make it effective ( e.g oil to give it slip or honey to increase moisture ) it is sort of acceptable , especially if it was cheap . However , if you have spent $10 or more on the product , then you should n't really consider looking for a fix . If you need to mix two different conditioners , be mindful that it will be really hard to know which ingredients are actually working for you . The bottom line is if the product works well with your hair then you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Buy one product from a brand at a time pick the dry hair ( leave-in ) product This particular tip is specifically for hair conditioners because these products within a brand will generally be mixed from the same base . The base will then be tweaked with additional ingredients to create the variations e.g conditioner for dry hair , for colour protection , for shiny hair etc . As a default , the leave-in conditioner tends to be a flagship product . There is a lot of effort put into creating or giving the illusion in some cases of moisture and softness . You do not need to buy several products within a brand line . Just pick up the leave-in conditioner and try it first . 87940 @qwx707940 <p> I am soo glad I read this article !

Think I will give them away to some of my newly natural friends and let them try their luck . Sigh ! Thanks for the suggestions . <p> I was practically forced to abandon my product Junkie ways , when I realised that the thing that had been causing my head to itch ( contact dermatitis ) for the past 2.5 years of being natural . Was fragrance ( natural or synthetic ) which includes essential oils. ( linalool , limonene ) There only one or two shampoos or i conditioners that I know of here in the uk that are fragrance free .

She got to my home at 6AM and worked for almost 12 hours straight . She was extremely gentle and did n't  rip through my hair or pull- it too tight , but she was meticulous with catching all my hair for a very sleek , and sophisticated look . <p> The hair she used seemed like very good quality and laid rather realistically ( the brand is RastAfri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that though she used 11 packs of hair , it was not heavy at all ! <p> My scalp troubles began the day after my braid session .

I read in the past that it has a strong scent which prevented me from trying it on my scalp . I use seabreeze , especially after working out or when my scalp feels itchy . It does a good job with removing scalp gunk but it will dry out your scalp . I also use Jane Carter scalp serum or the oil . I love the lemony scent because it deodorizes the scalp .

After letting your strands whip in the warm air this summer , it may be time to trim and dust your mane for the fall . No need to rush to the salon , you can snip away raggedy ends in the comfort of your own home and save a few bucks in the process . Here are- four simple ways you can trim your hair . <p> Stretch and Snip <p> This tutorial by NapturalElenor is straightforward and great for beginner self-trimmers . Part your hair in medium sized vertical sections . Next , spray your ends with water and detangle . Holding your hair between your middle and pointer finger , use your detangling comb to stretch your hair . While holding your hair taunt between your fingers , snip off your split or frayed ends with shears . Repeat the process over your entire head . <p> Regal Fro , who rocks her hair in a bomb afro , trims her hair by parting- it straight across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stretching the hair , she stretches her hair between her fingers until she spots the split ends . She then trims the split ends with her hair extended out , not down . This method is perfect for those who wear true afros like Regal Fro .

Only using water to detangle , take a small section of hair and twist from root to tip , making sure to smooth the hair as you twist . When you see and feel rough frizzy ends , snip them off with the shears . Finally , take out the twist , detangle again and re-twist the same section . If you missed any damaged ends the first time around , you will definitely catch them the second time you twist .

Natural Hair guru Mo Knows Hair has an excellent tutorial on trimming straightened natural hair . After blow drying and flat ironing in small sections , part your hair into four sections . Start from the crown of your head and part straight down the middle . This will ensure balance in your trim . Then in the back of your head , separate a thin vertical section of hair and place your hair between your fingers . Finally , clip one eighth of an inch of hair . Never clip from the palm side of your fingers , always clip on the back side of your fingers . After each section in the back of the head has been clipped , comb down the entire section and snip any unevenness . Repeat the process on your entire head .

Black people on the other hand ( well a good portion of us ) are not ashamed of rocking extensions , and do so in many , and sometimes bold colors .

@@72561415 @1261415/ <h> 7 Unique Advantages of Short Natural Hair <p> When it comes to natural hair some think long flowing Rapunzel like locks , reaching to the floor or in my case to the sky is the ultimate advantage , but to be honest short hair has more advantages than you think , and if it were not for my alien sized head I too may have considered a shorter style in the past , but the Lord blessed me with all this hair for a reason . <p> Short hair has been a style rocked by all , whether by choice or a transition to longer lengths . Here are 7 reasons why short hair rules . <h> 1 . Stronger Ends <p> New growth equals stronger hair simply because it has not been around long enough to be exposed to the elements , manipulation and wear and tear that come naturally as the hair ages . Basically shorter hair is stronger , period . As long as you are not causing damage to your hair by heat , over manipulation and chemicals , your ends are the strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The advantages of having shorter hair not only means less manipulation ( if you can keep your hands out of your hair in those idle moments , lol ) but also being able to withstand a little more manipulation than longer lengths . As previously mentioned new growth is stronger and can handle a little more manipulation than longer hair , which is why there are women ( like Amber Rose ) who rock short haircuts and dye their hair every color under the sun but still have healthy hair . The constant cutting of your ends to achieve a shorter look eliminates damage that occurred while using a chemical such as dye . <h> 3 . Water is Your Best Friend <p> We all know water is your best friend regardless of length but if you are a shorty , you really have the comfort of enjoying Mother Nature 's greatest gift without the process of protective styles or sectioning to reduce tangling , not to mention air-drying short hair is a dream ! <h> 4 . Protective Styling WHAT ? <p> The length of short hair is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be in friction with any clothing articles you may be wearing . No matter what your hair type texture , if hair is above shoulder length you have more freedom to wear your hair out without risking damage from friction . <h> 5 . Less Time <p> The hands of time are on your side ! With less hair you save time on everything from detangling , washing to styling . <h> 6 . Easier Detangling <p> The longer/older your strands are , the more susceptible they are to feathering ; when your ends are thinner and finer than your roots due to wear over time . Feathering leads to tangling , single strand knots and split ends .

I guess I couldve related it to Jim Crow instead of slaverybut the larger point , which I know is not popular to talk about , is that there has long been a historical and cultural expectation in this country that black people must meet the demands or whims of white people . After all , it was n't so long ago that saying no to a white person could get a black person beaten or killed . Some might say that , depending on where you live , that 's still the case .

And yes , I do believe asking to touch a black womans hair has roots in racism . People may not intend to be racist , but there 's a larger context , sometimes subconscious , that goes beyond the mere action . <p> Given the racial climate in this country , I do n't  know why Im surprised that so many people seem to feel that I shouldve just acquiesced to this womans so-called " good intentions , " and allowed her to feel my hair .

I wont get into the how and why of my haircut because I 've already discussed it on my blog , but now that I 've been on both sides of the length game , I can speak to the benefits and challenges of kinky natural hair at both short and long lengths . <p> Pros &amp; Cons of Long Kinky Hair <p> Pro : Super Fast Styling Options <p> Amma <p> The greatest benefit about having long kinky hair is being able to throw it up in a puff , bun , or 5 minute updo that requires only 3 bobby pins before running out the door . Not only are all these looks quick , but they are also versatile , being appropriate for work , a date , the gym , or even a wedding . <p> Con : Super Long Wash Days <p> I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my long kinky hair simply because I 'd have to wait for a day when I have 4 hours to spare and nowhere to be .

I completely surprised myself when I was recently able to comb through my hair with conditioner in all of 15 minutes , a process that I would have never even attempted with long hair because I just knew my arm would fall off before I could get through a section . <p> Con : Longer Styling Time <p> P Roy <p> While shorter hair makes for shorter detangling , it makes up for it by requiring more styling time than for longer hair . Sections for basic styles like twists and twistouts have to be much smaller whereas I could put- my long hair in 8-12 twists to maintain a style , I have to do at least 20 on my little fro .

I cut my relaxed ends in January of 2012 . <p> Transitioning Hair : Braidout <p> In the beginning of my hair journey , my main focus was on restoring the health of my relaxed hair . I began doing research using YouTube and found products , regimens , and techniques that were great guides for my own personal hair journey . While researching , I found out about a technique called stretching ' . This was the term used to describe waiting longer periods of time in between relaxers . So , instead of relaxing every 6 weeks , I began waiting 8 weeks or 12 weeks , etc . For my last stretch ' I wanted to challenge myself , so I set a goal to relax my hair in 6 months .

So I made the decision to continue transitioning until my hair was long enough to cover any remaining bald spots . <p> Also , from what I can recall , my hair has never been shorter than ear length ' .

But , with proper care and maintenance breakage can be minimized . Overall , I would say my transitioning experience was a pleasant one . <p> When I used to relax my hair , my new growth would quickly grow back within 2 weeks and I was n't a fan of flat-ironing my roots .

Here are eleven phenomenal black women who made a bid for the United States presidency : <p> Shirley Chisholm <p> Shirley Chisholm was the first black woman elected to Congress in 1968. - On January 25 , 1972 , she became the first major-party black candidate for President of the United States and the first woman to run for the Democratic presidential nomination . <p> Barbara Jordan <p> You might recognize her face from the United States Postal Service Black History Month commemorative Forever- stamp . Barbara Jordan was the first black Senator elected to the Texas Senate after the reconstruction and the first Southern black female elected to the U.S. House of Representatives . Although , Jordan did not physically campaign , she received a delegate vote- after being the first black speaker for the 1976 Democratic National Convention . <p> Lenora Fulani <p> Leonora Fulani was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vote in the general election . She held the record for most votes received by a female candidate until Jill Steins 2012 campaign . Fulani was the first black independent candidate and the first female candidate to appear on the ballot in all 50 states . Fulani ran in 1988 and 1992 on the New Alliance Party ticket . <p> Carol Mosely-Braun <p> Carol Mosley-Braun campaigned for her presidential nomination in 2004 as a Democrat . Mosley-Braun raised over $627,869 which at the time was the most money raised by any woman who appeared on the Democratic primary ballot . <p> Isabell Masters <p> Isabell Masters is a legend in her own right . Masters has had her name on the presidential ballot more than any other woman in history . Masters ran as a Republican in 1988 , 1992 and 1996 . She the ran in her own founded , Looking Back Party in 1992 and 1996 . She was a write in candidate in 2000 and ran her final presidential campaign at the age of 90 in 2004 and passed away in 2011 . Her husband was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American in the United States Marine Corps when he was sworn in on June 1 , 1942 . <p> Monica Gail Moorehead <p> Workers World Party candidate Monica Gail Moorehead ran twice for the presidency once in 1996 and again in 2000 . <p> Cynthia McKinney <p> Barack Obama was not the only black candidate running for the presidency in 2008 . Cynthia McKinney ran on the Green Party ticket in the 2008 presidential election . Fun Fact : Mckinney proposed a bill in Congress for rapper Tupac known as the Tupac Shakur Records Act in 2005 to promote the release of records related to Tupacs death . <p> Angel Joy Chavis Rocker <p> Very little information can be found on Angel Joy Chavis Rocker . She ran for president in 2000 as a the first black female Republican from Florida and passed away 3 years later . <p> Charlene Mitchell <p> Charlene Mitchell was the first black woman to run for president of the United States in 1968 .

She was also the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election ballot . <p> Nevertheless , this is a moment that Shirley Chisholm , who made history as the first African-American woman elected to Congress in 1968 , laid down the foundation for when she ran for president in 1972 . Chisholm also created a foundation for Barack Obama 's election in 2008 . However , the moment that she worked for has n't come yet . A Black woman has not yet made it as far as Hillary in an election , despite the fact that many have tried . <p> Thank you.I have heard of the first 4 and Cynthia Mckinney.never heard of the others .. Shirley Chisholm s book unbought and unbossed ? was really goodshe felt she received more support/had to fight less with whites than from black men .. good read.I wonder what she would think of pres.Obama.

Secondly , find a hair braider that comes personally recommended in terms of dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have the cheapest $100 Poetic Justice braid special on weekdays .

Whether you need to shell out a bit of extra money for more quality hair , or rinse your basic kanekalon hair with an ACV mixture to reduce the chemicals , do n't  sacrifice your hairs health in the name of being fly . Lastly , detangle your hair by yourself before arriving to the salon , and put your hair in twists/sections so that your braider already knows not to try for your precious baby hairs . I used this technique when I got my hair braided in Nigeria , and it did wonders to prevent any tight pulling around my edges . <p> Remember that your hair &amp; scalp still exist ! <p> The whole point of a protective style is to be more carefree with your hair maintenance , but I always shake my head at fellow ladies who say they 1 . do n't  do anything to their hair while its in braids and 2. leave their braids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first , while you do n't  need to continuously detangle your hair , it still needs moisture , particularly when intertwined with rough , dry synthetic hair !

If you 're concerned about your natural hair curling up out of your protective style when moisturized , you can use a bit of gel to smooth over the outside of your braids and tie them down with a scarf . Its also important to keep your scalp super greased , because for whatever reason , protective styles at least for me try to play my life by creating pesky flakes if I do n't  keep my scalp well oiled . Using a light oil such as jojoba or coconut on your scalp and massage every other day keeps your scalp moisturized , clean , and even promotes hair growth !

Make sure you do n't  have anywhere to go , because taking down braids and locs almost always takes at least twice as much time as you anticipate . TAKE YOUR TIME , and detangle each section immediately after removing the extensions by using a mix of conditioner , water , and oil to work through any tangles , especially to de-gunk the roots .

First up is Geniece sharing her experiencing with thinning edges . Thin Edges circa 2011 <p> My Edges Today , Due to Better Styling Choices <p> My challenges with thinned edges can be traced back to my childhood . One style common among many little black girls , 2 to 8 large braids or twists , fastened with colorful hair barrettes and bows were pretty standard in my household . I never had tightly braided styles like cornrows and yet as I grew older I would find that my edges were weak and thin . This became especially pronounced during adolescence . For me , the reason for this was primarily genetic . My mom had a weaker hairline and so I came to learn that the tight ponytails and slicked back buns girls wore in the mid-1990s ( with accompanying baggy jeans , oversized shirts and large hoop earringsthink TLC ) were styles I could only wear in moderation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was usually able to resolve the issue fairly quickly . - At night I or my mother would massage hair grease ( usually Dax or Ultra Sheen ) along my edges and twist that section into a small loose flat twist . After a few weeks my thinning sections began to fill in . When I began to wear my hair naturally , the challenges I faced with my edges did n't disappear . However , I did learn better styling techniques and ways to care for my sensitive hair line . For example , massaging my edges with castor oil and a protein based conditioner yielded great results . Moreover , wearing styles that did not tug at my edges decreased the likelihood that I will suffer repeated breakage . <p> So , how did I style my hair when my hairline suffered breakage ? First , I did n't allow the breakage to get so severe that it required disguising the breakage or changing my styling routine . The wonderful thing about natural hair is that even with breakage the thickness of my hair made any breakage seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , I generally refrained from tight- ponytails that required sleek edges . The LAST thing you want to do when in the process of re-growing your edges is to use a brush or holding gel directly along the edges . <p> The best advice that I can give regarding restoring your edges is this : ACT FAST . If you continually ignore breakage you may eventually experience traction alopecia .

@@72561493 @1261493/ <p> Although 2012 and 2013 seem like so long ago , I am still amazed at the fact that to date , I have spent more time as a transitioner than I have with completely natural hair . I transitioned for nearly 2 years ( 21 months ) , and chopped the rest of my heat damaged ends in December of 2013 . Along the route to December 2013 , I learned many valuable lessons about long-term transitioning and handling my hair . Some lessons came on the heels of mistakes , others were just learned as my transition progressed . These are n't  hard and fast rules , and since every transition is different , not all of the lessons may apply to you . Just take what you need = <p> 1 . Wash n Gos Are NOT the Devil . <p> Go to any blog or natural hair website or talk to many naturalistas , and theyll convince you that protective styling is the way to go , and wash n gos are the devil .

I find that if I use a product with a stronger hold for curls ( and scrunch out the crunch if necessary ) , my hair tends to be less prone to tangling as the curls are clumped together . If I moisturize and seal properly before applying styling product , I do n't  have to worry about dryness . Since- I ( try to ) keep my hands out of my hair , breakage does n't  really happen .

Your Go-To Products &amp; Routine Are Subject to Change <p> I think anyone who does n't  make changes to their regimen is crazy . You do n't  have to go all product junkie crazy , but there are always new ingredients , formulations and breakthroughs to try out especially as you transition . Sometimes , a product may work fabulously for a certain amount of time , but then your new growth punks it into not working anymore .

This does not mean you have to step into the typing system , unless you want to . All it really requires is a fundamental understanding of your texture(s) . If you 're blessed enough to have one uniform texture across your head , then you can skip this step . But for us multi-textured folks , this is especially critical for handling , detangling , styling and more . For example , here 's a regional breakdown of my hair . <p> Back : Longer , looser curls ( more wavy on left ) <p> Sides : Fine hair , of similar texture to the back , but slightly more curly <p> Understanding the " zones " of my hair helps me when it comes to detangling , handling and styling my hair . When I detangle , I know that the back half of my hair is going to be a breeze 10 minutes flat ( if that ) . The front half will require more time , patience , product , and delicate movement of my fingers or Q-Redew . I also know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent super-mullet syndrome , I need to twist/tuck and pin the front/center and the sides ( somewhat ) to stretch them as they dry , so they frame my face better . Understanding Your True Texture <p> 4 . Breakage is Unavoidable <p> Breakage will happen . Accept it . No matter how gentle you are , no matter how long you take to detangle , no matter how carefully you unravel your twists , breakage will occur . Now , some breakage is preventable and caused largely due to carelessness , rushing , rough handling and sticking with methods and products that do n't  work for your hair . However , - there will be *some* breakage and there is nothing you can do- about it unless you choose to- live in a bubble , in the dark and never , ever touch your hair . <p> Click here for some of my tested and true gentle hair handling techniques to prevent breakage . <p> 5 . Cheaper Isnt Always Betterbut Neither Is Super Expensive <p> I 'm the queen of the discount , especially when it comes to two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EVER pay full price for either . I live by the mantra of the 3 Cs : Coupon , ( price ) Cut , and Clearance . If it does n't  have a coupon , is n't on sale ( and it needs to be a GOOD sale ) or on clearance , I better have a DARN good rationale for needing it . I say all that to say , I hate spending more than $12 on a hair product . BUT one thing this small business spotlight has taught me is that sometimes spending the extra money is worth it . For example , my transitioning **37;1506;TOOLONG wash n go curl definers ( Obia Curl Enhancing Custard and Soultanicals Curl Blaze Hair Glaze ) are $15 and $13 , respectively . Ill shell out that dough , because the products do what they say theyll do with no fuss , and the ingredients are top of the toppiest of notch . <p> On the other side of that coin , there are the products that cost an arm , leg plus first and last months rent to purchase but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Jessies Super Sweetback Treatment . It costs about $50 for a 16oz jar and it just worksokay . Is it a good deep conditioner ? Yes . Is it the best deep conditioner ever ? No . Is it worth a tank of gas ? Absolutely not . With that being said , practice ingredient discretion and set boundaries for yourself . <p> 6 . Only Wash Your Hair When You Have the Time AND Energy . <p> unless you want to lose your hair . More times than a few , I found myself in situations where I was short on time , energy and/or patience , but my hair was chock full o buildup and needed a wash . Let me be an example of what not to do . In an attempt to save my hair from being a disaster area , more than a few times I forged ahead with wash day even though I should have put it off . The end result : I always lost more hair , caused more breakage , and ended up with a shoddy style . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing causes more harsh and forceful movements in everything from detangling to cleansing and styling . I also realized that my styles always sucked after a rushed wash day , because I would apply products and move through my hair so haphazardly . <p> The lesson here : only deal with your hair when you have the time . A bun for an extra day or two wont kill you and will cause a lot less trauma than the alternative . <p> 7 . Giving in is Okay <p> When I first embarked on my natural hair journey aka no heat challenge , I had zero concern for a texture , curls or anything . I was really just about that life of getting my rapidly thinning , weak and damaged hair back to health . Along the way , I began learning more about natural hair and eventually decided a full-out textured mane was my goal . Even though I was in pursuit of my curls , I still wanted to be able to rock straight hair sometimes ( because straight hair was all I had known in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and safety precautions , I was able to cave in a little and show off straight hair every 3-4 months . The transitioning process can be a shock and giving in to your desire for straight hair every once in a while can help give you what you need to forge ahead . <p> 8 . Do n't  Neglect Your Edges <p> Many transitioners do heavy rounds of protective styling to help ease the transitioning process and facilitate more length retention . In pursuit of your hair goals , just do n't  forget about your edges . Fall back on too-tight styles and updos that tug at your hairline . The last thing you want after all the work of transitioning is a thick , luscious mane with thinning edges hanging on for dear life . All About Edges <p> 9 . Steer Clear of Bandwagons <p> I 've talked in more depth here about bandwagons transitioners should steer clear of- and that rings true now more than ever . Every few months , a new bandwagon , method or natural hair " clique " pops up . I 'm not saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its just that some practices/bandwagons are n't  meant for ladies that are transitioning and the truth is , they can do more harm than good . <p> Getting caught up in haircare trends can happen almost too easily if you 're not careful especially , when you 're in that transitioning stage and soaking in natural hair information like a sponge . My best advice ? Get yourself a great information filter . Learn how to distinguish between solid information and natural hair folklore . <p> 10 . Transition On Your Own Timeline <p> Whenever I see a picture of transitioning hair on social media , almost as if on cue , at least one comment brazenly suggests that " you need to gon and just cut that off " . Transitioning to natural hair is frustrating enough , even without all the additional chop commentary . Whether you 're 2 weeks or 18 months into your transition , chop only when you 're comfortable . The journey to natural hair is about you what you like , what you 're comfortable with , and what makes you happy .

Crochet braids are very popular this season and natural ladies are finding more ways to keep the trend going . Crochet braids are creative and versatile , but the style does n't  last very long . This is partly because of the kind of hair that is used to create the style . Now , ladies have figured out a way to keep the style longer without having to sacrifice the look . Let 's look at how you can create a crochet braid wig ! <p> Natural hair YouTuber , My Natural Sistas has an excellent YouTube tutorial on creating both long and short crochet wigs .

Or a product you thought you 'd love turned your tresses into a tangled nightmare . Maybe your beloved kinky Curly Knot Today just up and told you , " Not today ! " <p> When your hair gets helplessly tangled , you need a few tricks in your back pocket . Before you go out and buy the Newest Super Natural Slippy Dippy Miracle Detangler with Botanical Extracts , Gold Flakes and Magic Butter , try these 4 hacks : <p> This hack has made its way around the interwebs , but its worth stating again . Using vinyl gloves just might save your hair . It is the single most effective hack Ive ever used to work through my hair . The key - is to make sure you have vinyl gloves , not rubber . Rubber gloves act just like a rubber band . Vinyl gloves , with their smooth surface make it easier to glide your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite oil , conditioner , detangler , or combination thereof . Just make sure your vinyl gloves are the right size gloves that are too big or too loose can exacerbate the situation .

Warm Conditioner <p> Jc of The Natural Haven has written previously on the benefits of warming your conditioner to render it more effective for absorbing and adsorbing to the hair . I have also found that warm conditioner takes to the hair better , helping to melt away super difficult tangles . I 've tried the same conditioners warm and at room temperature ( cold ) , and they work ten times better warm every single time . You can warm your conditioner the old school way , by saturating your hair and sitting under a dryer or steamer . You can also warm your conditioner in a microwave-safe container or in a hot water bath . If you 're a shower detangler , letting the warm shower steam work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes , the temperature of your products does matter ! <p> 3 . Let it Marinate <p> Giving your detangling product of choice a little time to work may be what 's necessary to get over the detangling hump . Completely saturate your hair , cover it with a plastic cap or bag , and let it sit for about half an hour. - Extra bonus for letting it sit with heat ( see number 2 ) ! Not only will your detangling be a little easier , but you 're getting one heck of a pre-poo treatment while you 're at it ! <p> 4 . Use Gel <p> I 'm sure this does n't  make one bit of sense . If you 're trying to detangle your hair ( likely on wash day ) , how exactly will styling gel help ? Tangles and knots are easily unraveled with products that have tons of slip . If your favorite gel or styler has tons of slip , why not use a few pumps here and there on the most difficult sections of your hair ? I 've used Hello Curly Curl Stimulator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glaze on super gnarly knots . Just make sure the hair is appropriately saturated with water first . If you 're looking for a cheaper way to use a slippery gel for detangling , whip up some DIY Flaxseed Gel . Flax seeds cost under $2 per pound , and are reusable ! Need to know how to make Flaxseed Gel ? Check out this tutorial from Naptural85. 87941 @qwx707941 <p> The Gel hack is so true . Whenever I do the wash n go style , my wash day detangling sessions are easy breezy ! ! No conditioner needed !

Loc extensions may be hard to replicate on your own , but yarn locs are the next best thing . Like loc extensions , the hair is palm rolled , but instead of adding additional hair to your hair , the hair is wrapped with yarn . <p> Getting faux locs at a salon can be quite expensive . With yarn locs , you can still achieve the look of faux locs without having to break the bank . These extensions are also much easier to achieve by yourself . I believe at some point , many have considered locs , but did n't  want the commitment . Yarn locs do n't require any commitment and when you grow tired of them , you can take them out . These simple YouTube tutorials demonstrate how you can achieve locs in the comfort of your own home . <p> Medium Yarn Locs <p> YouTuber ForeverRikk , has a great yarn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the color coffee , to create her medium locs .

Although her yarn locs took a total of five days to complete , she admitted that it should have only took her 20 hours to complete . The process may be long , but her technique is very simple . <p> Large Yarn Locs <p> Another simple and easy yarn loc tutorial is this one by Concrete Mermaid . She also used Red Heart yarn .

@@72561513 @1261513/ <p> There is some debate about whether the order in which you layer hair products affects moisture . The LOC method which was developed by Chicoro advises an order of Liquid , Oil and Cream and a modified version , the LCO method switches the cream and oil layers . <p> Many envision the layering system in true layers like this figure showing the LOC vs LCO layers.However , the reality is much closer to this figure below where the layers are less even and often intermixing . <p> The question therefore is , does it really matter which order you place the layers in if they all get jumbled up in the end ? <p> Quick Answer : <p> Yes and No Generally , as long as water is applied first , your hair will be moisturized . All other layers will help slow down the evaporation of water . The order of these layers does n't  really matter except hair may feel different depending on the order . <p> Long Answer : <p> 1 . Water first in general <p> If you are applying these layers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea to first give your hair the moisture ( i.e water ) before applying additional layers to help prevent moisture loss . There is no oil ( at least none that I have read of scientifically ) that can fully prevent water from entering or exiting the hair . However , oil layers do slow down both entry and exit of water from the hair shaft . Therefore , it makes sense to apply the water first . <p> 2 . LOC vs LCO <p> Typically , the oil and cream layer will probably mix . If you are sticking to the program and using an emulsified cream where surfactants ( e.g behentrimonium methosulfate/chloride ) are in your leave-in conditioner , then you really should expect mixing of all the layers as those surfactants help oil and water fractions mix . <p> As a result , its very likely that these sealing layers the OC /CO layers do not really act as separate layers and rather perform a general slowing down of evaporation of water from the hair . <p> 3 . Why does hair feel different though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels simply because oil feels different from a creamy conditioner . The feel of hair is a very personal thing . Some people never use certain oils or butters because they dislike how they feel . If I mention Herbal Essences Hello Hydration or Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose conditioner , there will be people who love them and people who hate them . Some will say one has no slip , which would be incredulous to someone who thinks that the same conditioner is the best thing ever for detangling . <p> If you place oil first or cream first , it probably does not really matter from an evaporation point of view. - You can easily place in a humectant or gel in the mix if you like too . As long as water is first , you should be fine either way . <p> I love to give credit where it is due , and Chicoro is now on youtube !

' <p> I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heat damaged hair is a trim . Here is why <p> 1 . Your hair is dead <p> Once your hair emerges out into the visible area of your scalp , you are dealing with a dead fibre . It is dead because there are no active growing cells in it . The implication here is that this fibre can only ever either stay in the condition it is as it emerges or wear down over time . There are no active cells within that part that has emerged to fix any damage . <p> 2. - High heat makes physical and irreversible changes to your hair at a molecular level <p> High or prolonged heat can physically and irreversibly change the natural structure of protein . Hair is made up of a protein called keratin . Keratin in hair has a natural twist in it called an alpha helix . This twist is present in all hair straight or curly . If you heat keratin to around 215-235-C ( 419-455F ) the alpha helix starts to melt . This is a a physical change and it is irreversible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keratin at a molecular level . Your hair shows you this molecular damage by not getting back into its natural curl or wave and staying straighter . <p> 3 . All damage to your hair is cumulative. - <p> Remember you have no growing cells in the dead part of the hair so if the cuticle is broken , it will stay broken . If you heat treat and damage the cortex , it stays damaged . Your hair conditioner and gentle treatment can help prolong the life of the damaged hair but ultimately it is damaged and the damage will continue to progress . <p> Do you have to cut it off ? <p> If you can deal with the multiple textures and your hair is not breaking off in pieces , you can keep heat damaged hair . If the multiple textures are driving you insane , trimming is the only proven way forward . <p> Keep in mind people have different hair textures . Coarse hair can be damaged but it can take more abuse than fine hair before being badly damaged because the strands are thicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not use flat irons and curling irons or pressing combs on my hair without causing severe damage .

I had initially been one of those skeptics who had thought that my hair was literally hopeless from all of the unnecessary trips to the salon to straighten my curlies ; every time I had it straightened , i began to notice how my curl pattern would transition for the worst , becoming looser and limp .

This particular property is referred to the hairs plasticity .

@@72561516 @1261516/ <h> 5 Ways that Weekly Deep Conditioning Can Boost Length Retention <p> As someone who gets a lot of questions pertaining to how to keep hair healthy and grow it long , I was surprised to discover- how many ladies and gents did n't know or still do n't know the importance of deep conditioning their hair on a weekly basis . It is vital in order to have the healthiest hair possible . Here are five important reasons for deep conditioning your hair weekly : <p> 1 . Nourishment for your hair Deep conditioning infuses your hair with the nutrients it needs in order to stay healthy . Your hair requires nourishment just like any other part of your body . <p> 2 . Prevention of dryness and breakage Deep conditioning helps to improve hair 's elasticity , which means it is more flexible and can stretch more before it breaks . Hair that does not get deep conditioned frequently is more prone to dryness and breakage . <p> 3. - Length Retention I often hear the saying Oh my hair wo n't grow , ' and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioning your hair , " and they 'll usually say , " every two weeks or once a month . " The truth is , your hair is always growing . Long hair is all about length retention . Deep conditioning plays a huge role in length retention because length retention goes hand in hand with breakage . The less breakage , the more hair you are able to keep ! <p> 4 . Keeps hair soft smooth and shiny Deep Conditioning is beneficial to keeping hair soft , smooth , manageable and shiny . Those are all signs of a healthy head of hair ! <p> 5 . Hair Repair If you are currently struggling with damaged hair , whether it be from heat styling , color , or just not knowing where to start with your hair regimen , make sure that deep conditioning at least once a week is apart of it . It will restore and repair your hair and you will be on your way to gorgeous healthy hair ! <p> In the video below , I share some of my favorite products that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep conditioners ! <p> http : //youtu.be/7FULFljeGiE <p> Do you deep condition weekly ?

Some naturals use semi permanents for coloring gray hair but others use it for shine/gloss.as seen in this video .

If you follow various protective styling or weave-magic Instagram or Pinterest pages , you might have heard of this look . Essentially , the Vixen sew-in is a newly popular weave installation method that applies tracks in 4 different sections , rather than the single " hive " method that is traditionally used . There is hair left out all around the edges , as well as in two parts cutting down the middle of your hair , and cutting across . here 's a video to explain : <p> While there are n't  too many examples of a vixen weave with curly or kinky textured hair ( shout out to whoever makes the video first ! ) , I do think this install method is the greatest choice for naturals who want to wear a weave that matches their hair texture , perhaps by one of these lines. - But before I get into the awesome benefits , a word of caution : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weave that is a vastly different texture than your own natural hair , the Vixen install process is actually NOT a better idea for your hair .

My hair is averse to a lot of combing and the easy clumping method for my hair is a bentonite clay rinse ( more details here ) <p> 2 .

In my case , all the gels perform to the same degree . <p> 3 . Is there no way to distinguish which gel is better <p> Yes there is !

Strange product consistency ( not be too graphic but it is a little bit like holding mucus ) d . World of Curls Gel : Slight crunch , very sensitive to humidity absorbing water from air or if misted on easily ( actually makes a good pre-wash treatment if hair is thirsty for moisture ) , sometimes does not play well with other products e .

I plan to do the MHM this month as I hope this method will really provide hydration to my hair for the coming winter . <p> The moral of the story for me was that without bentonite clay you would not have experienced such defined results . So considering this , you cant really judge the true effectiveness of the gels ? Correct me if I 'm wrong . <p> What happened a few days later ? I ask because that 's when I see the difference between gel and no gel . I can get curl definition without gel but it lasts much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I use shea moistures gel btw .

I sorta makes the twist more secure without it being tight . Check out naturallyme4cshe has great twist out vids . I am not her loljust sharing . <p> Are you coating your hands with oil before take down ? Are you untwisting from the bottom of the twist ? Are you sure not to " borrow hair " when twisting ? Those three things changed how my twist outs came out . <p> This test does n't  seem accurate . You cant see the effect of the gel by itself because you did the clay treatment . You basically did the maximum hydration method without the first step . With the MHM your hair will be defined , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hold , and frizz . <p> Even with the bentonite clay , there are still clear differences between the types of gel used .

@@72561534 @1261534/ <h> 4 Common Practices That Cause Natural Hair Breakage <p> By now , I 'm sure you 've heard all the common tips about breakage : keep your hair moisturized , be gentle , pay special attention to your ends , avoid too-tight protective styles and updos , sleep with your hair protected ( or at least on a satin pillowcase ) , and more . While those are all great things to keep in mind , I 'd like to offer 4 particular breakage culprits to be aware of , from personal experience . That 's right personal experience . I 'm not afraid or ashamed to admit that as a blogger , sometimes I make mistakes with my hair . Or even in the case of these culprits , certain practices may catch me off guard . Luckily , I 've made several adjustments and fixes for these 4 , and I 'm happy to share my findings . This is yet another reason why its so important to pay attention to your hair ! <p> Banding <p> The Scenario : <p> Banding is one of my favorite ways to stretch the front/center area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back and sides of my hair , which can make for an awkward looking mushroom-esque wash and go if not stretched some . Now , there is some cautionary information out there about banding not doing it too tight , or even too frequently , which I follow to avoid breakage . But the damage I was n't expecting ? It came during the take-down process . Sometimes , my scrunchies would just tangle in the hair with takedown , or I 'd hear a lone hair snap because it somehow managed to be caught in the other section I banded , instead of the one I was taking down . <p> The Fix : <p> Take down bands in reverse . My tangles came as a result of removing scrunchies from the bottom up . But removing scrunchies from the root and moving down ensures that the ends of the hair are still banded as you go , preventing tangle . It also gives you the opportunity to safely remove those random stray hairs that get caught , because the root is loose and it can be gently pulled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of ladies who section detangle and wash . It keeps hair out of the way while you 're working in a particular section , and also helps keep hair that has been detangled from being re-tangled . Before hopping in the shower to wash , I would always divvy my hair up in 4-6 sections , hop in the shower , and go . As time went on , I began noticing fuzzy short strands along where I would normally keep my hair separated . Because I did n't  detangle my hair prior to sectioning and clipping , wisps of hair from one section would cross and be caught in another , leading to breakage . <p> The Fix : <p> There are two fixes for this particular issue . One , stop using hair claws- ( which is what I have ultimately done ) . The second solution is to evenly part the hair before sectioning , to avoid those pesky crosshairs from occurring.I cant part evenly on my best day , so I found it was easier for me to just give up the clips and work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Many ladies opt for a pineapple of some sort at night to protect their hair and preserve styles like the wash and go . I 'm a huge fan of the scarf pineapple myself , but one thing I 've noticed as a wild sleeper is that the pineapple is prone to leaving the nape hair wide open and ripe for breakage . As the night wears on , it rides up , comes loose , and I wake up most mornings with the entire backside of my hair exposed . <p> The Fix : <p> Like the alligator- clip scenario , there are two fixes here . Both involve Doubling up . Sleeping on a satin pillowcase while pineappling will ensure that even if the scarf rides up , your hair will still be on a surface that wo n't cause unnecessary friction and rob it of moisture . The second option for doubling up involves a satin bonnet . Pineappling then covering the hair with a bonnet will allow for all of the hair to remain covered for the duration of the night . An added bonus is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there wont be any friction from the band of the bonnet . Got bigger or longer hair ? Opt for an Ebonnet . <p> Acrylic Nails <p> The Scenario : <p> I enjoy having nice hands , but my natural nails are a wreck . Occasionally , when I 'm tired of short and plain nubs , I 'll opt for a short acrylic set . If I 'm not careful , finger detangling sessions and wash days turn into a snap-crackle-pop fest . Especially on nail tips that are pointed or sharply filed square . Even if you do n't  have acrylics , nails that are broken , jagged , or not filed evenly can still cause hair to be caught and break . <p> The Fix : <p> Besides opting for rounded , squoval , or slightly duller square tips and making sure you get regular fills ( hair can get caught under acrylics if they begin lifting ) , leading with the pad of your finger is the best bet . Most tutorials for finger detangling show the separation of the hair with the hands , followed by gently raking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your nails are in great condition . But another method after separating with the hands is to use the pads of the fingers to work through the hair . This way , the pads of your fingers do all the heavy lifting in terms of detangling . By the time your nails make contact , there is less of a chance that it will snag and break hair . Of course , you can always just not get acrylics = <p> Does breakage ever sneak up on you ? What are some of your quick fixes ? 87941 @qwx707941 <p> LOL . The headband . It can cause pressure and/or friction alopecia especially if it is almost an everyday after work out style . You know it is the culprit if you see shorten hair at the front of your hairline when it used to be so long . <p> The fix ( for me ) remove the band when in the car , at home or not in publiclet hair just be FREEand never sleep in a head band . <p> Shea butter sneaked up on me .. yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the be all to all good not for my 4C curls .

The weirdest thing that I do when I wash and style my hair ( with twist outs and bantu knots ) is wearing non latex professional gloves to wash/ style my hair .

Breakage for me does n't  happen whenever I use it . <p> Oh ! and I am giving up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties ( using fold over elastic ) .

Especially if I pull wet hair back into a low puff or bun , or a pineapple , and sleep that way . The elastic in bands is too strong for my wet hair to handle . Plus , my coils tangle around the band when I remove it in the morning . My fixes : 1 . Use a silk handkerchief , or a similarly small-sized silk scarf , instead of a hair band to tie hair back/up for the night , and do n't  tie it tightly . Works pretty well overnight , for me. 2 .

If you do n't  want to cut your straight ends because you ca n't live without long hair fine , its your hair rock it how you wish but let 's not live in the land of fairy tales .

@@72561539 @1261539/ <h> The Benefits of Air Drying Thick Natural Hair <p> A central piece of advice that I 've come across repeatedly for processed hair is the value of air drying hair versus using heat .

I thought my hair would turn into a tangled bird 's nest. - However , I realized with a little modification , there were some benefits to air drying natural hair . One of the key arguments against air drying natural hair is that it facilitates knots and tangles . Without the aid of styling products , typically used in wash and go hairstyles , hair will become matted . Now , I would never advocate air drying loose , fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are ways to air dry loose natural hair , as well as some styling advantages to this method . <p> To successfully air dry my loose hair , I create four large pony tails and simply apply my favorite moisturizer to each pony tail . If attempting this technique yourself , you can- choose to use an elastic band at the very end of the hair . Sectioning the and creating the pony tails should take no longer than 10 minutes IF you detangled your hair prior to washing . As a helpful tip I strongly recommend detangling before washing if your hair meshes during the wash process . I find that air drying this way allows the length of my hair to dry fairly quickly which is great if I later want to create a fluffy large bun , or even a braid out . Typically , braid outs on my wet hair are usually pretty shrunken .

However , I think you 'll find that this technique will help those of you with thick hair to dry your hair much more quickly , while prepping your hair for stretched full styles . <p> Island girl raised in the most royal of NYC 's boroughs .

@@72561540 @1261540/ <h> 4 Scientific Reasons to try Tea Rinses for Natural Hair <p> Tea rinses are growing in popularity within the natural hair community . Green tea and black tea are generally widely available and therefore are also the most frequently discussed . Could there be some science to tea rinsing ? I decided to investigate and discovered some interesting reasons as to why a final rinse with tea after washing hair may possibly be beneficial . <p> 1 . Amino acids Stengthen Hair Theanine is an amino acid that is unique to tea . A recent study showed that a purified extract of this amino acid could penetrate fully through to the hair cortex of bleach-damaged hair after a 10 minute soak at 30-C ( Surface and Interface Analysis , pp 562-565 , 2010 ) . The study was designed to complement a previous investigation that related theanine to improving the mechanical strength of bleached hair . Even if your hair is not bleached , it is possible to accumulate damage to the cortex due to styling and combing as well as normal weathering . A tea rinse could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . Polyphenols Stimulate Growth Green tea is currently being studied as a possible candidate for treating hair loss . It is preferred over black tea as the roasting of tea to create black tea oxidises the polyphenols . Tests so far have been performed on rats as well as human hair in a petri-dish ( not on actual people ) with similar results . The polyphenols are seen to stimulate re-growth of hair ( J Natl Med Assoc , pp 1164-1169 , 2005 ; Phytomedicine , pp 551-555 , 2007 ) . If you therefore have problem spots e.g at the temples , or are experiencing hair loss , then a tea rinse may be worth a trial . <p> 3 . Caffeine Stimulate Growth Did you know your hair follicles can take up several drugs and caffeine is one of them ? Studies done once more on human hair in a petri-dish showed that the hair follicles do rapidly take up caffeine and this stimulates hair regrowth for hair previously showing signs of hair loss . ( International Journal of Dermatology , pg 27-35 , 2007 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it is brewed as well as the water used to brew the tea . In general , figures of between pH 5 and 7 are generally quoted for both green and black tea . For hair , this means that the final tea rinse will be just slightly acidic to neutral . This pH tends not to irritate the skin or disturb the hair cuticle . Naturally , you should not add a squeeze of lemon or orange to fragrance the tea unless you do actually want a more acidic brew . <p> What is your opinion about daily spritzes of green tea that has a few drops of vitamin e and a tiny bit of tea tree oil as preservatives ? I spritz this solution onto my hair and scalp before my daily scalp massage using a light oil . I do n't  rinse the tea from my hair , except , of course , until shampoo day .

@@72561542 @1261542/ <h> How Hair Grease ( Yes , Grease ! ) Can Help Retain Length in Natural Hair <p> I 'm sure many of you remember the days of being a young girl sitting between your mothers or aunts legs to get your hair done . Dax , Blue Magic , Doo Gro , or another hair grease was on the scene to replace that dry look and feel with smoothness and shine . It was a necessity . When there was no more grease left , it felt like the world was coming to an end . Well , it felt that way for me , at least . <p> Then came the wave of hair care forums and blogs that seemed unanimous in their decision that " hair grease was bad " for our scalp and hair . If you want to grow your hair long , do n't  use grease because it clogs your follicles . If you want moisturized hair , do n't  use grease because it works against moisture . Petrolatum and lanolin ( both major components in hair grease ) became enemies to black women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mango as well as oils like jojoba , olive , and coconut became our new friends . <p> But is hair grease really our enemy ? Or can it be used to our benefit . While many naturals continue to refrain from grease , some have found ways to re-incorporate it into their hair care regimen for retention of moisture and length . Let 's see how : <p> 1 . Seal the ends for increased moisture retention <p> Both lanolin and petrolatum ( again , major components in hair grease ) are able to lock in moisture very well . As a matter of fact , petrolatum is more occlusive than certain oils , including almond and avocado1 . Meanwhile , lanolin is a natural , waxy substance secreted by the sebaceous glands of sheep in order to protect the skin and wool from the harsh environment " including dryness . <p> HOW TO : To get the benefits of hair grease for moisture retention , apply moisture ( water ) or a water-based moisturizer first , then your oils and/or creams , and then hair grease . <p> Africanexport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealing : <p> 2 . Apply to edges and nape to stave off dryness <p> For some of us , water followed by an oil and/or a butter is a very , very temporary moisturizing solution for our edges and/or nape .

Removal of long-term twists/braids and to detangle <p> Hair grease can provide much needed lubrication to ease the undoing of twists/braids as well as the detangling process . It can especially come in handy if you have meshing or a stubborn tangle . With the application of hair grease , a protective film is formed around the hair shaft and allows for a reduction in friction between strands . <p> HOW TO : Apply to ends prior to undoing long-term twists/braids and prior to detangling . Ideally , do both prior to washing . <p> 5 .

Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their knowledge . <p> I think we should go back to those daysThe 70s and the Soul Train era when they had those big healthy fros.they did n't  have all these fancy products.they used Ultra Sheen Blue Magic.Royal Crown.old school products which presented some of the healthiest afros.we would do good to follow their regimen . <p> Call me a conspiracy theorist , but I 'm inclined to believe that those " un-natural " hair products of the 70s that worked great on black hair back then are not what we have today , I think alot of hair products made for black women now have things in them that may not be so good for our hair . <p> Do n't  forget the Hair Rep ! LOL , I remember being a kid and my mom telling me to go and get her caddy that held all the combs , brushes , barrettes , ribbons , and the Hair Rep in that tin can you had to open with a butter knife . Oh , the memories ! <p> You beat me to it but I was thinking the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those healthy fros playing with coconut oil and shea butter . Black people in the 70s had those big , round healthy fros , too . So did whites . Then came those damn jheri curls smdh . <p> When my sister and I were kids , my fathers family offered my mother all types of suggestions for how to care for our hairone of which was grease . The one time she used grease ( Royal Crown in the red container ) on us , we went to school with glossy , shiny hair . However , we came home with all types of dust bunnies and lint in our hair . <p> my hair actually loves grease . . but it might be how i use it , i wet my hair a bit ( wet my hand and run it through my hair in medium twists ) and then use grease and ( what i consider to be sealing ) seal in moisture , not even sure if this works , because i do use one other product , but other than water , that 's it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in its fine twisted stretched form ( not straightened , i do that like once or twice a year ) , but yea , just always used grease , maybe its just Read more + <p> Its because of the info that was spreading around when the natural hair movement started getting popular . Living a more healthy lifestyle was also popular at that point in time . <p> Just because it worked for your grandma and you as a kid , does n't  mean natural products could n't have worked even better for the same hair . Everyone who is willing should just try out different techniques and find out what works best . I know we can all agree with that . <p> Clarifying shampoos are designed to strip everything . I use Suave clarifying shampoo and that strips any heavy oil/product build up that I have . I follow that with a good deep conditioning treatment to infuse my hair with moisture again . So find a clarifying shampoo and you should be fine ! <p> I use hair grease on my edges , nape , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them moisturized for an extended period of time ( an extended period of time being beyond one to two days ) . <p> The topic of " should we use grease " pops up every few years in the online natural hair world every few years . People have such passionate stances on it too lol . I use it here and there but its not a must have for me as its well , greasy and feels a bit deafening sometimes on the hair . Meaning my hair seems coated even with a light amount . It is an awesome sealant for own hair protective styling ( twisted updos , buns etc ) . Its just ok for me . I think there are better feeling products out there that get the job done Read more + <p> I do n't  , but I 'm sure they have their place . I just do n't  like when really expensive products contain ingredients like petrolatum , because what are you paying for if they 're using the same ingredients as the cheap grease ? 
@@72561543 @1261543/ <h> 7 Drugstore Shampoos and Conditioners that are Silicone and Sulfate Free <p> There are now a plethora of hair product lines aimed at naturals but they are mostly online or in select stores . - In the future , it will be super easy to get probably any product . However , there are still many of us who do rely on drugstore products either for convenience or simply because they do actually work well . <p> Most naturals are picky about their products and top of this list is silicone and sulfate free products . Therefore , this list should help you : <p> The Nourish Spa Shampoo and Conditioner are the only set that I have found that are both silicone free and sulfate free . However the shampoo does contain olefin sulfonate as its lead cleanser and this surfactant is known to be just as irritating as- the sulfate of dread SLS . Additionally , the old trick of listing herbal extracts in water first before active ingredients is used to make the product seem more organic or natural to consumers . Both the shampoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products and assessing for yourself whether they are good or not is pretty easy . <p> Tresemme Naturals is marketed as a low sulfate and silicone free line . The hair shampoos do contain both ALS and ALES which is a combination that can reduce irritation but still cleanse well . Therefore , if you are looking for a complete no sulfate shampoo , do pass on this one . The hair conditioners on the other hand have no sulfates or silicones. 3 . Garnier Fructis Pure Clean Silicone Free/Paraben Free <p> In addition to being silicone free , parabens are not use as preservatives across the Garnier Fructis Pure Clean range . The hair conditioners are sulfate free but the shampoos in the line do have SLS and SLES as active cleansers . Athough that combination is known to be less irritating than pure SLS , the product is not labelled as nor is , sulfate free . <p> 4 . LOreal Eversleek , Everpure and Everstrong Line Sulfate Free <p> The Eversleek , Everpure and Everstrong hair conditioners are all sulfate free and in addition are also silicone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silicones such as dimethicone and amodimethicone so Loreal does not proclaim the whole range as silicone free . Per ounce they are generally more expensive than the previously listed lines but they are still not super expensive by any stretch of the imagination . <p> Suave Naturals conditioners are sulfate and silicone free , however the shampoos while being silicone free , do have sulfates with the ALS/ALES combination of cleansers similar to Tresemme Naturals . Once more , if you want a sulfate free shampoo , do not select one from this line . <p> VO5 conditioners in general do not appear to have silicones ( checked variants include strawberries and cream , champagne kiss , kiwi lime squeeze , mint tea and blackberry sage tea ) . The shampoos do use SLS as an active cleanser and are therefore not sulfate free although they are silicone free . <p> Herbal Essences is marketing these products as silicone-free shampoo and sulfate-free conditioner . I am not convinced by the marketing strategy at all because I could easily turn that bottle around and see that the hair shampoo has sulfates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and the hair conditioner has silicones ( which , again , some naturals want reduced or eliminated in conditioner ) . In truth , you should avoid the shampoo if you want sulfate free cleansing- and avoid the hair conditioner too if you want silicone free conditioning . This is no slight on the quality of the products and I am well-known for my obsession in general with herbal essences despite all the silicones , sulfates and unnatural blue hues . I do however think the marketing people failed immensely- as there is really no major reformulation ; but somehow trying to convince the consumer with labeling that it is a different product . <p> What are some of your favorite silicone/sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners ? <p> Some of these brands test on animals . If you do n't  care , how would you feel if a stranger started putting an unknown , untested substance on you ? Its disgusting . The brands listed are garnier , tresemme , and loreal . Do n't  buy them ! <p> The medications you rely on are also tested on animals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people these products are all that 's available to them or within their budget . Unless you 're willing to put up your money to give people what you consider to be the most ethical alternatives , please be a little more considerate when you lecture people about these companies practices and you order them to not buy from them . <p> You 're assuming that he/she uses and takes meds ? ! Not everyone does . I am vegan and do not use a single product that is animal tested , contains by products of or consume products whose parent company is associated with a company that does including meds/antibiotics ( bc i do not use meds period ) etc . Even my clothes ( shoes , bags you name it ) is vegan . Maybe you should " be a little more considerate when you lecture people . " <p> Well Shea Moisture products are actually comparable to the $7.50 products you mentioned . The often have buy one get one free sales which means they actually come out even less expensive than drug store brands . Example : Tresemme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moistures shampoo &amp; conditioner BOGO free would cost only $11 . <p> That 's true in terms of actual cost . But in terms of actual value , SheaMoisture provides less product overall . Shea Moisture is about 384ml per bottle which is 768ml per set . Remember I 'm in the UK . There is no deal . So I pay -24 ( $36 ) for a 768ml SheaMoisture set . I can pay -10 ( $15 ) for a 1.5 litre set of Tresemme . SheaMoisture is not a comparable product , it is more expensive over here .

I like the Loreal Silicone-free/Sulfate Free shampoo and conditioner . It is not listed here . But it does n't  irritate my scalp or break it out . It smells nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes I have to condition twice to get the hair smooth and detangled . <p> I had an eczema flare up on my scalp and an non sls/paraben mineral shampoo worked wonders with ACV/tea tree oil rinses . But those shampoos are often too expensive . I do n't  know how some people justify paying $10-15 for a shampoo . Once Shea Moisture and the rest make it the UK , its way out of my price range . I 'm a student , not a millionaire . I found that ALS is less irritating , so Ill definitely look in to the Tresemme Natural range . Plus its better value . 750ml ( 26 fl.oz ) for -5 ( $7.50 ) . <p> You all might try a really great , always sulfate , paraben , and silicone-freeAndalou Naturals .

Not all NH and SM products contain the carcinogen , be sure to read the label .

I do n't  feel like my hair is stripped of moisture when I use the shampoo , and I stock up on the conditioner because I have to condition before I wash my hair and the price point helps when I need to use so much conditioner in my monthly routine . <p> Unfortunately , Trader joes has changed the formula for their nourish spa conditioner . It has a new label which is different from the one pictured on this blog . It has dimethicone in it now which dries out my hair overtime especially since I do n't  use sulfates .

@@72561545 @1261545/ <h> 3 Haitian Traditional Secrets for Longer Hair <p> Recently , there have been whispers amongst the blogosphere claiming that Haitian women may have a secret related to maintaining long natural hair . I even found one comment that said Haitian 4c hair may even be somehow different because it shrinks less and is not so dry . While some attribute longer hair or hair with more luster to the tropical climate or diet , I focused my investigation on whether there are any traditional methods and products common among Haitians that may have a scientific benefit . <p> 1 . Moelle de Boeuf ( Bone Marrow ) <p> Yes , I will start off with one that on the surface appears quite odd . Moelle de boeuf is French for bone marrow . There are tales of grandmothers stirring up bone soup , cooling it down to allow the beef jelly to form and adding that to oil to create a hair and skin moisturizer . Commercially , there are hairdressing pomades available with the highlighted ingredient moelle de boeuf . So , what is this miracle ingredient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially gelatin ! Commercially , gelatin is produced from boiling bones much like the grandma story ! Gelatin is hydrolyzed protein and therefore can both strengthen and moisturize hair . <p> Apparently almost every Haitian will have seen or used Lhuile mascreti which is Haitian castor oil . It can be cold pressed with a yellow color or indeed have ash added to make it Haitian black castor oil . Most reviews that I have seen do say that the genuine article is supposed to have a really strong smell ( some say stink ) and therefore recommend adding an essential oil . If you are a fan of castor oil then this may be a variation that you may choose to try . As is common with castor oil , there are many who say it can help hair regrow ( no hard evidence ) as well as serve as a thick sealing oil for longer lasting moisture ( definitely likely ) . <p> 3 . Nighttime Routine <p> Moving away from products and going to methods there is a rather common night time tradition of braiding hair rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may choose to moisturize and use lhuile mascreti in the process , while others just detangle lightly and create 8-10 braids . It is common knowledge , especially if your hair is fine , kinky , long or dense that compacting it in a braid or twist before sleeping will reduce tangling in the morning . You can also utilise the process to create a fresh braid or twist out . Scientifically , the less mechanical damage your hair experiences , the more likely it is to still be on your head for years to come . 87940 @qwx707940 <p> Both my parents are Haitian and I have been natural all my life !

Personally , Izzy ( my hair ) is loving the warmer weather and the humidity , even if its making her huge . And this year , I decided to have a little fun with my hair and take part in a good ol fashioned grow out challenge ! While my hair is already fairly long , I still want more hair ( ya know , to block people out of pictures even more ) and thought that a break from the harsh winter weather would be the perfect time to refocus on my hair health , growth and retention . <p> At the beginning of June , I started a- grow out challenge- with my readers at QFTPC , and we 've been having such a grand time that I wanted to share it with you all and invite you to join as well . Well , I 'm not sure if I have totally had a grand timebut I 'll get to that nitty gritty in the update . My starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamins , my goals were to concentrate on my nutrition , keeping my ends moisturized , detangling on a regular basis , and working out at least 4x a week . So how did my first month go ? <p> Wellit was great , and not so great . When I measured my hair at the beginning of July , I got approximately 21.5 inches , which is great , right ? That 's an inch of growth in a month ! Howeverit was not without sacrifice . Shortly after I began my challenge , I switched my vitamin to Manetabolism . I was intrigued by the ingredients and amount of biotin in the product . I had never taken that much biotin before , but I have been taking biotin for years ( even before I stopped relaxing and knew jack about hair ) and never had any issues with it . <p> For about two weeks , I seemed to be okay , but thenI noticed a blemish , then anotherthen another . Now , I am not immune to the occasional breakout due to stress or a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liver can cause forehead breakouts ) , but this was odd and spreading beyond my usual trouble area . I use a Clarisonic and am adamant about taking care of my skin ( I am the moisturizing lotion shero , I attack any sign of ash in my presence ! ) , so I suspected this had something to do with my vitamin . I initially increased my water intake , but that did n't  seem to help , so I did a little research online and read that a B Complex vitamin can help balance the effect of the high dose of biotin . Enter my Super B Complex vitamin that I ran out to buy immediately . I also started splitting up my dosage of Manetabolism so I was n't overloading my body with all of the biotin at once . Oh , and MORE water . I was so full from water I would already have consumed at least 32oz before noon , which for me , is a feat . I was also using a toner mix with aloe vera juice and tea tree oil ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help ward off a really bad breakout , which seemed to help , but I was getting tired of looking in the mirror every 30 minutes to see if my skin was freaking out . <p> After another week passed , I was torn . I would think my skin was getting better , then worse , then better again . However , the straw that broke the camels back was when a friend ( I 'm paraphrasing this part to be civil , haha ) even suggested that I stop taking the pill because it was " ruining " my skin . I thought , " OMG , PEOPLE CAN NOTICE THIS ? ! " Nope . No way . No how . So my bottle and a half of Manetabolism is now sitting quietly in my cupboard and I have gone back to a regular multivitamin that Ive taken before ( Alive ! Once Daily Womens Ultra Potency ) . My skin is still smoothing out , but I 'm confident that I will be able to get it back to normal ( and thankful that I did n't  keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biotin horror stories while I was researching ) . <p> It really stinks too , because otherwise , I was having great success . My shedding decreased by about 75% when I would comb my hair previously , I was surprised I still had any hair left , and it decreased to a small handful when combing and barely any hair came out when I did a quick finger comb in the shower . My nails also grew a significant amount for a month ( I cut my nails before I started my challenge ) and I seemed to have more energy throughout the day when I took Manetabolism in the morning . It may not have been the pill , but who knows ? Oh , and I also LOVED that the pills were caps rather than giant horse pills that can potentially make you nauseous if taken without food . <p> You can check out more updates and info from my first month in my one month update here : <p> So what about you ?

@@72561555 @1261555/ <h> No More Transitioning : I Just Got A DevaCut ! <p> Okay , so maybe I 'm being a little melodramatic . But on December 5th , I ended my 21 month transition from heat damaged hair and went 100% natural . Like many transitioners , from the outset of my process , I had the end in mind . I was going to go at least 24 months . I was going to make a huge YouTube production out of it by chopping off my ends in the mirror and letting them fall to the sink in slow motion . I was going to e-mail President Barack Obama about it and ask him to hold a dinner in my honor . <p> Maybe I 'm kidding about that last one . Maybe . But as fate would have it , I did n't  make it to the 24 month mark . During the first week of December , I grew increasingly irritated with my heat damaged ends . My newly grown hair had taken over , leaving my ends looking down right janky . I had entered my " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wash and go and I could no longer stomach the thought of waiting forever for braids or bantu knots , or perm rods to dry . I had the itch , the itch to cut . <p> As my hair began to grow out , I realized a DIY cut just was n't going to work for me . My right side was full of bouncy curls . My left side had a wavy-curly pattern . The front was shrinkage city and my crown looked like it belonged to someone else . As the time drew near , I knew that- I had no other option but to get a DevaCut . I did my research and whittled it down to two options : visiting the famed " Curl Dr. " Shai Amiel in Studio City at Capella Salon or going to the Devachan Salon in Culver City . Ultimately , it boiled down to price and distance . I could drive 15 minutes from my house ( I live in Los Angeles ) and visit the Devachan Salon for $80 , or take an hour and $180 and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may pay Shai Amiel a visit , but for now his price point is way out of my budget . <p> Curious about how things would go for me , I called the Devachan Customer Service line . I explained that I was looking to get a cut , and that I needed someone who worked with highly textured natural hair . I also explained that I was transitioning from severely heat damaged hair and that while I wanted my damage gone , I also wanted to retain length . The representative Victoria seemed genuinely interested in my story and assured me that I 'd be in the best hands with Sergio , the Culver City Devachans multicultural stylist . Still nervous about the cut , I booked a consultation with Sergio so I could feel him out . <p> After mulling it over for 24 hours , I called back and changed my consultation to an appointment with Sergio . I decided to stop dragging my feet and just go for it . here 's my hair before the cut : <p> The Devachan Salon Experience <p> When I entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me feel all kinds of special ) . My jacket was immediately taken to coat room and in exchange I was given a champagne-colored satin robe . Fancy ! I was offered water or tea , and then moved on to my consultation with Sergio . He went through my hair and inquired about how much I wanted to cut , if I wanted bangs , how to handle my multiple textures and more . He made me feel completely comfortable and confident that he would be able to handle my hair . He also promised not to cut my hair super short ( which was a huge concern of mine ) . <p> After that , we went right into the cut ( yes , while my hair was in a dry state ) . With the Devachan method , hair is cut curl-by-curl ( literally ) while the hair is dry . Not dry and straight , but dry and textured . The rationale for the dry textured cut is that the hair is elongated . When wet , there is the chance that too much hair will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might have bargained for . For someone not concerned about length , that probably is n't a big deal . But I have a big head . Length is definitely a concern and one of the reasons I transitioned instead of big chopping . here 's a little chop action ( and yes , that 's Sergio behind me ) : <p> And immediately following the cut , before washing and styling : <p> After the initial cut , I was escorted to perhaps the most luxurious wash area I had ever seen . I laid back- on something like a chase lounge- with super comfy curvature . There were also super posh curtains that could be pulled for privacy but totally not necessary . Laying comfortably on my back , - a styling assistant- began the process of educating me on the Devacurl products , practices and methods while cleansing , detangling and conditioning my hair . <p> I did n't  feel like product was being pushed on me at all ! She explained each- product that was used ; - what it was and what it did . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baking soda and DevaCurl No Poo- to remove buildup and help with my scalp psoriasis . DevaCurl One Condition was used to cowash the length of my hair , which tends to be dry ( she told me my hair was dehydrated , which was interesting ) . For deep conditioning , she used DevaCurl Heaven In Hair . Overall , I really liked how the DevaCurl products made my hair feel . I- did n't  feel like the styling assistant was doing any- damage or yanking to my hair , even- while detangling . <p> While soaking- wet , - she applied DevaCurl- BLeave-In and DevaCurl- Ultra Defining Gel to my hair to set the style , and scrunched the excess water and product out with a DevaCurl microfiber towel. - I was then taken under quite possibly the most futuristic-looking hooded diffuser- ever on earth . Once my hair was dry , Sergio went in again with the shears to clean up anything that had been missed or overlooked . <p> The final look with their products ( this was my next day hair ) : <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and styled with my own products : <p> Now I 'm 2 months in the game , and looking something like this : <p> All in all , I do n't  regret a single thing about getting my DevaCut . Styling has been amazing , and I am something like a wash and go proat least for my hair . I thought my world would dramatically shift in some ways after my cut ( click here to see what that 's all about ) . Sergio encouraged me to come back in 4-6 months , so we could get some more shaping action going . And I 'm certain that I will . Atleast , after this- Manetabolism Challenge I 'm doing ends . <p> Here are my takeaways from the Devachan Salon Experience : <p> Pros : <p> Consultations with stylists are free-99 . <p> The staff and stylists were incredibly friendly . <p> They will do everything in their power to make you feel completely comfortable . <p> They take the time to understand your hair before jumping right in to the cut . <p> They consult with you along the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , style , and how much is cut . <p> The scalp cleansing felt like the most heavenly massageever . <p> The ambiance was nice , clean , and had an upscale feeling . <p> There is no set price stylists range from $80 to $150 or more depending on popularity , experience , etc . <p> They did my friend Megans hair for free ( washed and set , no cut ) while she waited . <p> here 's my final recommendation : By all means , have them use the DevaCurl products on your hair . You can even purchase the ones you like in-salon . But I highly recommend that within the next day or so following your cut , to start over with washing and styling your hair with your own products to get a true feel for the cut . I liked my cut the day of , but I did n't  LOVE it until I washed and styled with my own products . 87941 @qwx707941 <p> Wow they did a great job .

Sets offer a longer lasting styling alternative to braid outs , twist outs and bantu knot outs smoothing the hair and creating uniform curls of various sizes , blending textures and damage , and even setting the stage for stretched hair that can be straightened or styled with minimal to no heat . <p> However , the products you use to set your style are important . Gels can leave flakes or too much crunch , while butter blends and oils will make the hair soft ( with results that wont last as long ) . Somewhere in the middle are water-based foams , mousses , and styling lotions that hydrate and moisturize the hair , while using lightweight styling polymers ( like polyquats ) for hold without crunch . Here are seven great options all under $10 ! <p> ApHogee has a wide range of products that work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styling . The Style &amp; Wrap Mousse contains Keravis protein ( more on that here ) , essential amino acids and ingredients like cetrimonium chloride that makes it ideal for roller and silk wraps .

It provides softness , shine , hold and heat protection all in one thanks to glycerin , shea butter , macadamia oil , and babassu oil , and honey . This mousse is ideal for taking your hair from highly textured to sleek and straight . This foam can be used for roller sets before straightening or wrapping , or as a source of heat protection while your rods dry underneath a hooded dryer . <p> This foam provides shiny , soft , moisturized , and well-defined rod and roller set results .

From their original blue formula to the brand new Wrap Me Foaming Mousse , which Lottabody product to use on your curl set is all about preference . Their setting lotions tend to be concentrated , and you are able to dilute them according to your personal preferences . The foams are pre-mixed and ready to use . I 'm personally a fan of the Carrot Seed &amp; Keratin Setting Lotion for rod and straw sets . <p> Although marketed as a gel for wash and go styles , the Condition &amp; Sculpt has the consistency of and behaves more like a setting lotion .

Formulated with all naturally derived ingredients , including coconut oil , glycerin , shea butter , and hibiscus extract , the Frizz-Free Curl Mousse will hydrate and nourish the hair . It provides great shine , but only a very soft hold . If you 're looking for your hair to get way bigger as the days go by , this is the one ! Also great for wash and go styling on types of hair that are weighed down easily . 87941 @qwx707941 <p> Ive tried majority of these Foam Wrap Lotions and I have to say that my favorite from Nutress .

@@72561558 @1261558/ <h> 8 African Traditional Secrets for Long Healthy Hair <p> It is often said that with slavery came a depletion in knowledge of hair maintenance . However , traditional African techniques of hair maintenance are actually being used as we speak ! Here are some new and old favourites : <p> In truth , I have not found evidence that Rooibos tea was used on hair traditionally in South Africa where it originates . It is certainly a popular caffeine free tea drink . Scientific studies have shown that rooibos tea contains antioxidants and even has antimicrobial effects . It is gaining popularity among naturals who want to use tea rinses on their hair for these reasons . <p> This is a traditional oil from Mozambique and South Africa . It is popular as a skin moisturiser but can certainly also be processed to a food grade standard and eaten . Like pretty much all natural oils , it contains a large amount of oleic acid and is not ideal for people with scalp problems ( e.g eczema , dandruff ) . It is also known to contain antioxidants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is commonly made from oil ( shea butter commonly and plant ash . Some say it is gentler than traditional soap but it is important to remember that soap is soap and it will always have a high pH . If that is something you are sensitive to , then do not use it . <p> I will not harp on too much about these as they are pretty common knowledge . The one thing that is consistent across the continent is the use of oil to help maintain hair moisure . This is perhaps the bigger and more important story . If you are experiencing dry hair , do try to include an oil/butter within your moisturising routine . <p> I have previously talked about the use of butter ( as in real actual edible butter ) for hair care in Ethiopian communities . Thanks to a documentary on traditional people there , I have realised that the butter they use is what we refer to as ghee which is a type of clarified butter that you can find in Indian food stores . The butter is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its used to strengthen hair which is possible in part due to the fat in butter , much like in coconut oil , is unsaturated <p> 7 . African threading <p> African threading is experiencing a renaissance thanks to youtubers such as Nadine of Girls love your curls who has featured a more modern interpretation that does not involve fully wrapping hair in thread and creates a more twisted style . This technique was used traditionally in West and Central Africa to wrap and protect hair as well as create intricate styles . Today , it is used in a similar manner and in addition is a way to stretch hair with no heat . <p> 8 . Braiding <p> Intricate braiding is a feature of many traditional and modern African communities . There are many African women who traditionally ( and in modern day ) chose to wear their hair short as it is convenient and fuss free . However , from the Himba women of Southern Africa to Ethiopian tribes of Eastern Africa and even to the Nigerian women of Western Africa , there are many communities who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . Braiding long hair is as much for beauty as shown in the attention to detail as it is for maintenance of hair length .

For skin , it clears black spots but you need to moisturize as its drying , for me at leat . <p> Do NOT use ghee in your hair . I 'm Ethiopian and we do not use ghee .

However , not every natural will religiously oil their hair on a daily basis . Daily hair oiling , however could be beneficial for some as : <p> 1 . The extra oil layer will help to block moisture loss from hair ( J Cosmet Sci , pp 135-145 2007 ) . 2 . If you use a penetrative oil like coconut oil , you will have hair that is more resistant to breakage during daily styling or washing ( J Cosmet Sci , pp 203-208 , 2011 ) . 3 . Oil can enhance hairs feeling of softness . <p> How to Oil Hair Daily <p> There are three main ways that you can choose to oil your hair on a daily basis : An excess of oil applied to hair overnight which is washed or rinsed off the next day A small amount of oil applied to dry hair at the tips ( last 3 inches or so ) A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daily moisturizing routine involving water or a water based product as well . <p> Is Daily Oiling For You ? <p> 1 .

@@72561561 @1261561/ <h> 4 Jamaican Traditional Secrets for Longer Natural Hair <p> In previous articles , I discussed Haitian and African hair traditions and their possible benefits from a scientific stand point . Today , I take on Jamaican traditions of which there were so many . Sadly , I could not find substantial evidence for favourites such as Jamaican ginger or herbal hair washes but who knows , maybe in time there will be some research ! Here are 4 that I found evidence for : <p> I found it interesting that coconut is sometimes referred to as dread nut in Jamaica . Dread coming from the Rastafarian dreadlocks and nut being of course that coconut is a nut ( technically a drupe , but we can say nut ) ! There is a long history of coconut products being used to maintain natural hair and coconut milk is definitely up there in the list . It is made by adding water to the crushed coconut meat ( white part ) to extract a mix of oils and proteins from the meat . You can purchase prepared coconut milk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coconut milk is regarded as a- conditioning treatment for hair as it has a high oil content . It is often used as a final rinse after washing hair . <p> Castor oil is hugely popular in the Caribbean and one of the most popular varieties is JBCO . Its darker colour arises from a traditional process of adding ash of the castor bean into the extracted oil . This is said to increase its mineral content ( magnesium mainly ) . Of course you will have heard stories of JBCO being excellent for regrowing hair at the temples or increasing strand thickness . While there is no definitive proof that it can regrow hair or increase thickness , it is definitely the case that castor oil is a very viscous oil which forms a thick layer on hair to help reduce loss of moisture . 3 . Beeswax <p> Beeswax was traditionally used in Jamaica to help the matting process when locking hair . It is a notoriously difficult product to use on free natural hair but it is a good alternative to gel for those who like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural wax and contains some fatty acids which are similar to those found in natural oils such as coconut oil or shea butter . It will melt in your hand and a pea sized amount would be sufficient to slick a full head . As it is a fairly heavy product which does not transfer easily once applied to hair , it will be able to act as a sealant but can also attract lint , so regular hair washing or limited use would be advisable . <p> 4 . Hot Oil treatments Many cultures around the world do practice hot oil treatments and Jamaicans are definitely among them . The general practice is to use your favourite oil ( a mix of coconut oil and JBCO seem popular ) heated up in a water bath and then applied to unwashed hair for about 1 hour before rinsing off . You can naturally substitute the oil types to whatever oil you prefer . Hot oil treatments are recommended for dry hair to help increase the oil level on the hair enabling it to be able to maintain more moisture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My 88 year old grandma used Tuna , Aloe , castor oil coconut milk and oil when she was growing up . If you werent exposed to it , fine , but you cant just get up and discredit the whole article . ? unnu annoy me sometimes , always proving the " closed minded " Jamaican sterotype . <p> Oh , sorry , should have the read the comments before posting ! I 'm first generation Jamaican-American , but I never heard of using coconut milk for hair growth from family . However , I use it anyways mixed with henna weekly . <p> Jamaican in her 50s here . We grew up using coconut oil , castor oil , sinkle bible ( aka Aloe Vera ) and Tuna . We would rub hibiscus in our hair to color it black . We used to make our own castor oil from the bean . Most everyone wore their hair naturally and we used other " bush " recipes to condition and style .

We can use it in homemade conditioners and in homemade shampoos . There 's not many of us still using the blue magic and more and more of us are stepping away from the creamy crack . <p> You are wrong ! Some of this article is true . Do n't  let us down being ignorant to the practices . Maybe the coconut milk is the same thing as the oil that is made from boiling the meat . There is a thin line between how that is made and what was outlined in the article . <p> wow , half of the comments on here are unrelated to the content of the article . I agree that one can not write a separate article for every African country . And you cant really group them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And to be honest , I found that article on Africa funny because those practices are rarely used . Relaxers and weaves have taken over , dry unhealthy hair is now the norm . Though there are a few women with healthy hair , the ones with unhealthy hair far out numbers them all.http : **32;1638;TOOLONG <p> Why cant they be grouped in cardinal directions ? Where I am , if you reference North Africa versus West Africa , people will know that you 're talking about Libya , Tunis , or Egypt versus Ghana , Cameroon , or Nigeria . I recognize that this does n't  help to diminish the view of Africa as a place without distinct cultural boundaries , but I thought it might be slightly better than barely distinguishing cultural boundaries at all . I 'm from the U.S. , so this is a genuine question . <p> I am Jamaican and though i did n't  use castor oil before going natural . I am very familiar with it because my mother and grandmother said it was used in their hair as children . All the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used in my hair when i was a child .

I am not the child if a Jamaican living in a foreign country , I was born and bred here . I have to just say how poorly researched this article is . Most of the things spoken about are not utilized in regular hair care here . The first time I heard about JBCO was through browsing hair websites.Most of us do not put coconut milk in our hair . The truth is the most common hair products we use are imported and alot of people utilize manufactured and synthetic hair oils.However there has been a recent growth of awareness Read more + <p> What 's wrong with being a child of a Jamaican living in a foreign country ? ?

I actually did n't  know there were different kinds of castor oil until this jbco trend . Lol . <p> Dani , is it fair to say that different people from different parishes in different generations in Jamaica do different things ? People in the countryside tend to use more natural products , especially in our grandparents generation and beyond . However , people in Kingston and other " town " areas will use more foreign products because it is more readily accessible . Correct ?

I 'm Jamaican too and I 'm from St. Catherine where castor oil was popular when I was growing up some 30 odd years ago .

I have not hear or seen anyone use it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen people use it to rub down babies , to put in ones hair especially in the East Indian community . Castor oil was taken when you wanted a clean out or as we say " a purge " which is now called dextoxing . I know beeswax is utilized in the locking hair . <p> I am jamaican living in jamaica . The most popular thing used here for natural hair is the aloe vera plant . Ppl use it to wash their here . Castor oil was never very popular . What it was big for was " washout " i.e. laxative . No one uses coconut milk/ oil in their hair traditionally . Those were for cooking . Beeswax definately used for twists and locs And hot oil treatments were done with commercially prepared oil treatments . And these treatments were mainly for processed hair , not naturals . What most jamaicans practised for natural hair was shampoo , condition , and the use of blue magic or purlene hair food . <p> I am Jamaican as well and I totally agree with you KB . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 or 6 and my Mom never used it that much either . I would only use the hair food or Dax in my hair , and wash it with shampoo and conditioner .

Read more + <p> I absolutely love what coconut oil does for my hair ; the moisture , shineeverything . But it wreaks havoc on my skin , so I had to discontinue it . JBCO is a nice thick oil , but I did n't  notice any changes in terms of hair growth . I hope others are having success with the products though . <p> Um .. why all the bitter Bettys ? ?

In all honesty , I grew up in Jamaica , and never used castor oil for my hair back then . Never heard of anyone using it then either .

Just read the article and state what traditions you do , heard of , or never do . No need to be so sarcastic some of you . Just chill . <p> everything that was mention in the article are correct except for dread nut .. in Jamaica is it just coconut .

Now that means I was stating that my mother and her siblings are all Jamaicans . Not that ALL Jamaicans used them while growing up . <p> In answering the question , I so use coconut oil in my hair , my skin , and I cook with it .

@@72561562 @1261562/ <h> Is It Safe to Dye Natural Hair After Using Henna ? <p> When I began henna-ing my hair over two years ago , I did it for one reason : to help thicken and strengthen my severely heat damaged strands . Over time , henna proved to be effective at not only that , but at helping to ease the flaking caused by my scalp psoriasis . But as with all treatments that help with psoriasis , they lose effectiveness over time and require you to switch things up . So a few months ago , I began phasing out my monthly henna sessions , in favor for a DIY mix ( glycerin + alcohol-free witch hazel + sea buckthorn oil ) to help soothe my scalp . <p> I knew that while actively henna-ing my hair , I could not use permanent dye because henna deposits a red stain that resembles a red cellophane . Additionally , there were other dangers that lingered which kept me from even remotely considering the possibility of coloring my hair permanently . However , since- I had n't  hennad my hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enough of the deposits had washed away ( I wash my hair twice a week ) for me to be able to safely dye my hair ? Let 's find out ! <p> The Dangers of Henna x Dye I began searching ardently for an answer to my question about whether I could change my hair color with henna deposits remaining ( even though I had n't  used henna in months , monthly use for two years had a cumulative effect and my hair held a beautiful red tint that was primarily visible in sunlight ) . For weeks I searched popular henna informational sites , lurked on forums where women posed the same question , talked with my Devachan salon stylist , and even consulted with the manager at my local Sally Beauty ( who attended cosmetology school ) . All sources provided the same answer : NO . <p> The rationale was that the metallic salts in some henna ( primarily " compound " henna that produces colors other than red ) would react terribly with the ammonia from hair dye , and cause my hair to wither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn raw sewage green . <p> I readily understood all of the warnings , but I was n't totally satisfied with the answers . For one , I 've never used any compound henna EVER . Ive been using Jamila Body Art Quality henna ( which is 100% pure lawsonia inermis with NO additives , fillers , PPD , or other compounds ) since March of 2012 . Even- when I first experimented with henna in January and February 2012 , I was using Light Mountain Brand , in red ( the only version that was 100% henna with nothing else in it ) . Any residual Light Mountain brand most certainly would be gone after more than 2 years , and well , Jamila is the pure stuff . Plus , I did n't  intend to use any dyes containing ammonia . I 'm a little adventurous , but not insane . So I set out to do what any good blogger or investigative reporter would do : experiment . <p> The Experiment After looking over color options and the most popular ammonia-free dye brands , I settled on Garnier Olia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although my color goal was definitely Kelis-inspired : <p> I would later learn , that it was totally wishful thinking to expect this amount of color change with ammonia-free dye , but well discuss that a little further down . My color of choice was Light Natural Auburn , 6.43 . <p> Instead of slapping the dye on my head and praying for the best , I gathered shed hairs to test . I followed the instructions to a tee mixing together a 1:1 ( drop ) ratio of developer and color . I let the dye sit for the recommended 30 minutes , rinsed it from the test strands , and even conditioned it with the after color conditioner from the kit . Here were the initial color results : <p> Not too drastic , but promising enough . However , - I was n't satisfied with the color just taking . I wanted to make sure that my hair was n't going to disintegrate , so I monitored it for the next few days . Satisfied that all was well 3 days later ( yes , I kept a bundle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded to move forward with coloring the front section of my hair . <p> The Dye Job I followed the instructions from the Garnier Olia box to a tee . At the 30 minute mark , I made a mad dash for the shower , rinsing completely and conditioning twice ( once with the conditioner from the box which was wack , and the second time with Eva NYC Therapy Session Hair Mask ) . Here were my results : <p> I mentioned earlier that my goal was Kelis-esque , but there were a few factors that kept me from that . One , ammonia-free dye will never make dark hair significantly lighter than it already is ( and even if it could , I would n't want to risk anything super harsh such as blonde ) . Two , I believe the previously deposited henna played a huge role in not lifting my color too much . The roots of my hair ( which are henna-free ) are much closer to the color indicated on the box , as opposed to the length of my hair which still contains some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hair , I have detected no awkward color changes , breakage , or texture changes . I was so encouraged by my results ( and the fact that they seemed to brighten as the week wore on ) , that I went ahead and did my entire head ! Why not ? Its summertime ! I enlisted the help of two more boxes of Garnier Olia Light Natural Auburn , 6.43 to get the job done , carefully avoiding the section of my hair that was already colored . Want to see the results ? Head on over to my Instagram ( @maneobjective ) for pics ! <p> In Conclusion .. <p> My hair is still going strong ! So can you color over henna with permanent dye ? This blogger says YES ! But with a few provisions : <p> Using permanent dye is only safe over henna that is pure , 100% lawsonia inermis . Body Art Quality is even better . <p> Ammonia-free dye is the safest bet for the health of your hair . The results wont be as dramatic , but nothing is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow . <p> Do not exceed the maximum processing time indicated in the instructions . They exist for a reason . 87941 @qwx707941 87940 @qwx707940 <p> Very helpful .

@@72561563 @1261563/ <p> Over the course of the re-evolution of natural hair , shampoo by and large has gotten a bad reputation . It has been written off as harsh , drying , trifling , scalp irritating , and more . Trust me , I 've had some less than savory experiences myself . But fortunately , as time moves along and the concern for kinky and coily hair rises among product manufacturers and small businesses , more shampoo options that are SLS ( Sodium Lauryl Sulfate ) and/or sulfate-free become available . <p> You do n't  have to dramatically shift your regimen to incorporate shampoo . If you are a fan of regular co-washing or natural alternatives like ACV or Clay , you can definitely still utilize those for the bulk of your cleansing . However , if you are beginning to feel like they just are n't  getting the job done , or you feel like you may have misjudged shampoo , now is the perfect time to switch it up . In fact , there are some substantial benefits to the occasional ( or regular ) shampoo : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Natural Haven , " In the grand scheme of things , shampoo will remove more oil and dirt than conditioner , conditioner will remove more oil and dirt than using plain water . " Translation : working shampoo into your regimen ( at whatever frequency you feel comfortable with ) will catch all of the product , dirt , and oil buildup that co-washing can leave behind on your hair . <p> 2 . Clean Scalp Healthy hair grows out of a healthy scalp . In order to optimize healthy hair growth , the scalp needs to be free of clogged follicles that can occur as a result of sebum production ( which is good ) combined with product buildup , environmental dirt , and oils applied to the hair/scalp ( which is bad ) . When follicles are clogged , it can cause flaking of the scalp , and even stall hair growth . Conditioner can remove *some* of this buildup , but not as effectively as a shampoo that is designed to do so . <p> 3 . Conditioners &amp; Deep Conditioners Will Work Better Without getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slightly negative charge that is enhanced by use of a shampoo with a negative charge ( anionic surfactant ) . Conditioner has a positive charge ( cationic ) , and of course , opposites attract . The ingredients in your regular and deep conditioners are designed to stick to the hair ( adsorb ) , smooth the cuticle , fill in chipped areas ( if there is protein ) , and can do so better when exposed to completely clean hair and scalp . <p> If you 're looking to dive into shampooing again , here are a list of more gentle cleansing ingredients to look for that are likely to not strip your hair as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate ( SLS ) <p> I can personally vouch for this one . This shampoo has quickly become one of my favorites , and for good reason . It leaves my hair feeling clean , yet super moisturized and not stripped in the slightest . It has tons of slip , making it really easy to work through wet hair . Many naturals sing its praises and they 're absolutely telling the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are incredibly gentle and mild , and wo n't strip the hair . Both of these shampoos got me through the first year of my transition . They are both affordable , and accessible and the 32oz Allafia bottle will last you a lifetime . <p> 4 . Koils By Nature Refreshing Anti-Dandruff Tea Tree Mint Cleanser <p> Another personal favorite of mine . Koils By Nature is known for knockout products , and this shampoo does not disappoint . It has great slip , and cleanses but does n't  strip the hair . The tea tree and peppermint essential oils are a bonus , especially for those with itchy scalp . <p> 5 . Qhemet Biologics Egyptial Wheatgrass Cleansing Tea <p> The Cleansing Tea is especially mild , but still very effective . It does not have as much slip as some of the others mentioned here , but it is still a great contender especially if you like the Qhemet Biologics line . A small amount of the Cleansing Tea goes a long way , so an 8oz bottle will last for months . <p> Camille Rose Naturals is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have not personally tried this product , the ingredient list looks stellar . Gentle surfactants , humectants ( honey and glycerin ) , essential and carrier oils. - If you have tried it , let me know ! I 'm on the hunt for some . <p> Final Tips <p> If you 're still a little hesitant to try shampoo head-on , here are a few tips that will help you ease into the suds : <p> Pre-poo your hair with oil , conditioner , or a mixture of both . Using oils like Coconut Oil will help prevent protein loss , and conditioner can help prevent your hair from becoming more stripped than it would be without it . 87941 @qwx707941 <p> Ive been only co-washing for the past couple of weeks and it works well on my hair , but my daughters scalp is still flaky . And I noticed it getting flakier after every weekly co-wash . So I went and bought Shea Moistures Sulfate-free , black soap shampoo for dry scalp and I will use it on her next wash day . I 've used it before on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it alleviated her dry scalp . Her hair definitely needed more conditioning/moisture , but the balance of that and cleanliness is necessary ! ! <p> I have tried cowashing in the past and did n't  really care for it too much . While I did notice my hair did n't  feel so dry I really did n't  feel like it was clean . While this may be a great method every once in a while , I am still a fan of sulfate free shampoo and conditioning afterwords for about 5-10 minutes under a heat cap . This way I feel my hair is clean and still maintains its moisture . <p> I confess that I am one of the naturals that still uses shampoo . Yes , I tried co washing . I tried ACV . I tried baking soda . For me they just do n't  do the work specially because my hair likes heavy oils like Canola that are not water soluble .

I do n't  get any build up and can stretch up to 3 weeks between cowashes . I also stick to water and oils for moisturizing and sealing so maybe that has something do with it . <p> However I will be starting a workout routine soon so I 'm sure my hairs needs will change . But for now I am happy without shampoo . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your logic is really great : " Shampoo alone makes my hair dry so I 'm not going to follow the rest of the steps to moisturise it , I 'm just going to not wash it at all and let it stink ! " <p> What a rude and presumptuous comment , what makes you think she was n't using conditioner after or that her hair stinks ? What works for you does n't  have to work for her , and for all we know her hair could easily be healthier than yours . <p> I use4 shampoo when I do my deep conditioners , but other than that if I feel like there is build up on my scalp I use apple cider vinegar . I may use a clay wash that I saw on Naptural85 . I do have to say especially while I was transitioning that shampoo actually made it more difficult for me to do my hair . once I started co-washing it made things so much better . I have n't given up on shampoo altogether , but I do n't  really use it all that often . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a no go for me . I need the shampoo b/c my hair itches way to bad if i just co wash for now I co-wash my 3 year old b/c he has locs and he hates when it gets washed so its a one step process and his hair is very clean b/c i use mimunally product in his hair throughout the month . It just depends on your hair needs . <p> I feel I need to use shampoo because my head just does n't  feel clean . I make sure to use natural products though , like pro naturals argan oil shampoo and conditioner which are sulfate and silicone free so less chemicals on my hair . <p> i do n't  use store bought shampoo anymore and do n't  miss it . Mostly co wash with shea moisture conditioner and the rest DIY with ingredients like shea butter , rhassoul clay , argan oil , ACV , essential oils , nettle leaves I pick and infuse in my ACV . Real hippie stuff ! Once every 2 months or so i use a shampoo bar that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works well for me and my scalp is clean , hair is thriving . I am really happy not to buy so much stuff except the shea moisture for now . <p> I find that clay works really well . But sometimes when I experiment with different products/conditioners , the clay ca n't wash some products out . In those instances I have to revert to shampoo . If I stick to products with no cones , the clay works really well . <p> Yes I workout too and use regular shampoo . I do detangle beforehand .

I feel that all it does is sit on your hair . You think it feels softer &amp; more manageablebut in essence the conditioner is just trapping dirt . I love shampooing my hair , and my hair loves it too . Immediately my hair becomes softer &amp; more manageable after a good washalso it has more shine to it . I use Giovanni Tea Tree Tripple Treat shampoo . Its not harsh at allbut it cleans my hair well , not to mention the cool , minty feeling on my scalp after using it . <p> I learned this after about 9 months of co-washing .

My point was that using less product kind of goes hand and hand in this discussion . Most strict cowashers know that you really ca n't be successful with the routine if you use lots of product .

Really ca n't fault it at all . <p> Yep . I learned this a year ago when I decided to try co-washing as my only cleansing method . That did not work out for me . I started pre-shampooing using coconut and olive oil when washing with the Loreal sulfate free shampoos . I am quite happy with the results . <p> Loved this post ! Just recently I realised that even though I 'd been mixing full strength ACV with cleansing conditioners &amp; alone , my scalp still did n't  feel completely clean . I used the Kinky Curly Come Clean ( which has C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate ) , worked it down to my ends &amp; my hair &amp; scalp felt amazing ! My scalp does n't  feel " suffocated " anymore . And my hair looks shinier , &amp; even had less tangles than normal . I think that for me , alternating KCCC with an ACV/cleanser blend is a good balance . 
@@72561564 @1261564/ <p> Split ends and breakage are the bane of length retention . However , sometimes hair just naturally will split and break even with the best care possible . This article is intended for those who really are doing everything right ( gentle handling , happy with your wash and moisture routine ) , but still see split ends and breakage . If you have fine hair that has multiple kinks and a tight curl , you may be used to seeing these tiny wisps of hair when you run your hand through/over your hair or when you comb/detangle . Your hair is highly susceptible to splitting and breaking as a result . However , it is still possible to gain length provided you deal with the hair fiber correctly . Here are some tips : <p> 1 . Reduce overall styling time of free hair The less you manipulate your hair , the less damage you do to it . The highest amount of breakage outside of detangling tends to be seen when hair strands are being styled while free . Therefore reducing this overall styling time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lady A : Wears a twistout regularly . It takes 3 hours to install initial twists and after that point daily styling requires 10 minutes in the morning and another 10 minutes to prep at night . Over the course of two weeks , just under 8 hours are spent styling free hair . <p> Lady B : Wears own hair twists which take 3 hours to install . The style is kept for 2 weeks at a time without undoing the twists . Over the course of two weeks , 3 hours are spent styling free hair . <p> Lady C : Wears box braids which take 10 hours to install and the style is kept for 8 weeks at a time without undoing . Over the course of two weeks , 2.5 hours are spent styling free hair . <p> I have used typical styles and times in the examples above . The point of the examples is simply to say , reduce the time you spend styling your free strands of hair and reduce the likelihood of breakage of those strands . 2 . Never go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tendency to split/break , the more frequently you need to trim . Hair is predictable , if it snaps easily because it has kinks , it will always do so despite your best efforts as the kinks will always be there . Trimming should be a constant and consistent part of your routine to make sure that the broken hair is under control . Split ends or fibrillated ends from breakage will form a hotspot for pushing breakage further up the shaft . I would recommend a dusting routine where you cut off a quarter of an inch every 2 months or so . Please pick up a ruler and look at a quarter of an inch , it is not much at all , just enough to pinch off the broken ends . If your hair is long enough , a search and destroy routine can work too , but you should do it thoroughly and frequently e.g once a month . <p> 3 . Wet hands not wet hair Many naturals will naturally begin styling by getting out a spray bottle and misting hair . If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is counterproductive as hair only shrinks and it becomes more difficult to part or separate strands BUT you can work around it . A slight amount of water is all that is needed to make hair more flexible . Mist a small amount of water onto your hands , enough to get them moist but not enough to drip water off . Apply that small amount of water to a section of hair ( if you work in quarters , apply to one quarter ) , taking care to smooth it from root to tip . Give it a minute or so to sink in then immediately start working on the section . Reapply water to your hands should your hair stop being flexible . <p> Do you find yourself dealing with breakage-prone hair ? What practices have you implemented in your regimen- to combat breakage and split ends ? <p> My hair is very fine , kinky , 4c/4b , Its extremely fragile and breaks quite a bit . Ive been using amla oil for a month and the shedding and breakage is 80%-90% better . It smells kinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a day . <p> Finally something for the fine highly textured girls . I am a fine 4c hair girl here . My strands are so fragile that even with the best practices it still breaks . I am going to implement the more frequent trimming AND i need to add that styles that are as low manipulation to take down as possible are good too . I find that tiny little box braids require so much manipulation of the ends that they are n't  worth it . I make braids with twists down the last two-3 inches of hair and pin them up 50% of the time . But honestly , Read more + <p> Hi , fellow 4-Cotton-er here Just a few things Anything besides your actual hair is heavy ( to the root ) and pulls at the root .

I currently have crochet braids so I can play with the crochet hair without causing any damage to my own hair . I also make sure to examine my ends and trim accordingly . <p> #3 Especially ! My hair shrinks up to 75%-80% of its true length and this has been so helpful to me and I try to spread the knowledge it makes de-tangling a breeze because your hair stay relatively stretched yet lubricated enough to de-tangle gently . Same goes for conditioner just a small amount for finger de-tangling ! 
@@72561568 @1261568/ <h> 5 Steps to See Hair Length Gains in 2 Months <p> It is roll call time ! We are getting to the end of the first quarter of the year and the question is.is your hair longer now than it was in December ? If your answer is yes , well done ! If your answer is no , then this article is for you . If your desire is to finally see your hair gain length , then here are 5 steps that you can take to achieve that goal : <p> 1 . Give it time - 2-3 months <p> It is difficult to see hair growth on a week to week basis . Sometimes it is also difficult to see on a monthly basis as not all parts of the head have hair growing at the same time . However after 2-3 months , hair length gains are generally unmissable . You need to measure your current length and that is it , no more measuring until your 2 or 3 month set period is over . <p> 2 . Stop trimming . Opt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends with hair that curls perfectly and tend to become scissor happy , this could be a big reason why you are not seeing length gains . Sometimes , none of that hair that you are cutting is damaged , its just older and needs a little extra conditioning , moisturizing or just to be tucked in . If you are not seeing hair length gains , opt for a search and destroy method during the next 3 months . In this period , only hair with a visible split should be cut off . No splits , no cuts . <p> 3 . Low maintenance AND No manipulation <p> For the next 2-3 months choose a hairstyle/s that you would consider low maintenance and either low or no manipulation . Low maintenance means that you will not require more than 5 minutes to style the hair and be presentable . If you require more than 5 minutes , it is not a low maintenance style . <p> A low manipulation style is one that needs a small amount of detangling for example a wash and go on hair that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one where the individual strands are not handled on a daily basis , therefore detangling is not required . Examples include own hair twists/braids , braids or twists with hair extensions , wigs and weaves. - If you can keep a no manipulation style for 2 months without taking it out ( except around the perimeter which often needs redoing every 1-2 weeks ) , you are well on your way to a longer hair length . <p> 4 . Find a washing routine , stick with it <p> If you are going to keep a no-manipulation style , never neglect your hair . You should continue to wash and condition it as you normally would , whether this is weekly , fortnightly or monthly . You should not increase or decrease your frequency as even hair washing does count as hair manipulation . <p> 5 . Keep your free hair stretched <p> If you want a break from a no-manipulation style then make sure that you always choose a stretched style to showcase your free hair . Stretching your hair minimises tangles which can cause breakage and damage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curlformers or African threading will generally yield the least damage to your hair . <p> Ladies , have you tried these tips before ? How do you break out of plateaus ? 87940 @qwx707940 <p> I wet bun everyday . I conditioner wash/detangle in the shower .

But since I first went natural ohhhh so many years ago , the one thing , that I have always found to be a great way to curl my natural hair are perming rods . <p> You might have thought perming rods were only- for old ladies who want to get a perm . That is not their only use . I have found that perming rods are a great way to create various natural hair styles , especially if you are new to curling your own hair . <h> Perming Rods On Natural Hair 101 <p> Now if you are wondering how the heck to use perming rods do n't  worry . I struggled myself on where to start when curling with perming rods . <p> If the perming rod is thin , its much easier to use on short natural hair . As the diagram below shows : <p> - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colors above . When deciding which ones to buy , I would suggest that you look at the diameter thickness instead . <p> If you have never bought your own perming rods , I would recommend you start with the thinner ones , especially if your natural hair is in its TWA ( teeny weenie afro ) phrase or just a little bit longer than that . <p> Even if you natural hair is bra-strap length , I would still recommend the thin perming rods . The only issue is your hair will take longer to dry . <h> Benefits of Using Perming Rods On Natural Hair <p> The main thing I love about using perming rods is that , you are able to curl your hair fairly easily especially if you are new to curling your own natural hair . Why is it so easy ? Well , because you can roll your natural hair around perming rods and then secure these with a rubber band . <p> It does n't  matter if your technique is n't perfect right away because a certain amount of your natural hair will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The other thing I love about perming rods is that you can use them to create so many natural hair styles , like : <p> the twist and curl ( which is when you curl the bottom of your twist and unravel your twist ) <p> Here are a few styles that I have created with perming rods , on my own natural hair . <p> Finger Coils <p> The Twist and Coil <p> Mind you these are just a few of them and I will continue to create even more styles . <p> Besides being able to create all of these styles , the other thing I love about perming rods is that they are fairly cheap to buy . <p> So when you are buying them you can get several packets to ensure that you will have enough to be able to sufficiently set your entire head .. <p> Be sure to go and grab several bags of perming rods , as the more you have the better . <p> Have any of you used perming rods on your natural hair ?

Love your hair <p> here 's a tip I git from my sister-in-law who its a professional stylist . Lotta Body ( hold ) and Motions styling mousse ( smoothing ) . <p> After shampoo and conditioning , apply your leave-in conditioner then for each section apply the mousse , then spray on the lotta body . I use this for my rod sets and my hair look like its relaxed . You can still apply your moisturizer ( oil or spray ) each day . <p> UGH ! So , I purchase the perm rod rollers ( in every size ) .

If your hair is longer than 5 ' you may just need to wrap your braid around the perm rod better , or use a more narrow rod .

Thanks in advance . <p> I could never sleep with those things . Thankfully twist out give the exact same look and takes less time ( imo ) and 100% easier to sleep on .

@@72561576 @1261576/ <h> 5 Ways Henna Can Treat Your Hair and Scalp Problems <p> Though henna 's intended use is for creating intricate , yet beautiful designs on the body , women have been using the natural plant-based dye to remedy other issues with their hair and scalp . Different cultures have been taking advantage of this plant for centuries . Once discovered that henna left a red stain behind when left on objects - or bodies for long periods of time , people started using the plant to dye their hair and finger nails . Aside from natural dye , henna can be used to treat persistent and chronic scalp conditions . <p> Psoriasis <p> Psoriasis is a skin condition that can cause itchy and red patches to develop on your skin and even your scalp . While henna is not medically prescribed by doctors to treat psoriasis on the scalp , it has been used by psoriasis sufferers for years . Because henna has anti-fungal properties , it has been known to keep the scalp free of redness , flakes , and itching that is caused by psoriasis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psoriasis sufferers since the condition causes the skin to become fragile over time . <p> Dandruff <p> Like psoriasis , dandruff can cause unseemly itchy flakes on the scalp . Dandruff is often the result of a fungal infestation . Henna 's antifungal properties keep the flakes and itching at bay . When applied , the natural hair dye binds itself to the keratin that 's in your hair and creates a protective layer . This protective layer relieves your scalp of irritation . Dandruff is caused by excessive oiliness on the scalp . Henna actually reduces oil , thus reducing the dandruff . <p> Seborrheic Dermatitis <p> This is a skin condition that I have personally been suffering from for years . Seborrhea dermatitis is a skin condition that causes the oily parts of your body to produce too much oil . This excessive amount of oil turns into itchy , scaly , bumpy , red painful patches . Even after all of the dermatologists and prescribed medications , I always go back to henna to help clear up my dermatitis when I have a flair up . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since dermatitis is suspected to be caused by a yeast fungus called malassezia , the antifungal and antiseptic properties that are in henna are probably what causes the condition to subside until the next flare up . <p> Hair Loss <p> Not only is henna used for dying the hair and treating the scalp , henna can also be used for hair growth . Will it grow your hair to extreme lengths in a short amount of time ? Probably not . It does n't work over night . However , I can vouch for it contributing to the growth of thinning or broken hair . When I first began my henna journey , I was using it to help strengthen my hair . Because of my Seborrheic Dermatitis , I was losing hair . The dermatitis caused thick and large flakes on my scalp . When I removed the flakes , my hair came out with them . I did my research and henna was listed as a natural option for people with hair loss . I started applying the henna every month and slowly noticed my hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great for women who have thinning hair . Henna creates stronger strands of hair and promotes growth because of its antifungal/antiseptic properties . If your scalp spends less time fighting off dandruffs , dermatitis and psoriasis , it has more time to focus on hair growth . <p> Conditioner <p> Henna is a natural hair conditioner . Some like to mix their henna with coconut oil/milk or olive oil for added benefits . However , henna is an excellent conditioner all on its own . Henna is what I would call a deep conditioner because in order to see all of its benefits , it needs to be left on the hair for a few hours or more . I usually sleep with henna in my hair overnight . I have even heard of some women leaving henna in their hair for two or three days . After washing the henna out of your hair , you will notice a difference . Your hair will feel heavier , softer and you will notice less breakage . <p> Keep in mind that henna is not to be used without fully doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be followed in order for you to get the best use out of henna . For example , henna should be mixed to a certain texture ( pudding ) and it should be applied to wet hair .

There are a host of other things to take into consideration before applying henna . Make sure the proper research is done before you decide if henna is right for you . 87940 @qwx707940 <p> I have used henna for the almost 4 years .

Amidst all of the advice , methods , regimens and products , sometimes the most confusing thing about the journey is knowing when to chop . Theres pressure on all side . Some fellow naturals think transitioners are dragging their feet , clinging on to their relaxed and heat damaged ends like some sort of security blanket . <p> Trust me , I know the feeling . I was consistently pressured via social media . People would tell me that I needed to go ahead and cut my hair . I respectfully declined each and every time , refusing to acquiesce to anyones wishes but my own . <p> For whatever reason , transitioners can decide to hold on to their ends for as long as they choose . Maybe you 're not ready for all-natural hair . Maybe you 're not ready to embrace full shrinkage and enjoy the extra length your ends provide . I transitioned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before chopping my ends in December . My goal was to transition for two full years , because I 've only had short hair once in my life . However , my hair and patience had other plans . <p> One piece of advice that I often share with transitioners is to begin with the end in mind . When you set out on your journey , have a goal ; whether its time , getting rid of old hair color , or achieving a certain amount of growth. - I did n't  make it to my goal of two years , - but that 's okay . Even if you do n't  stick entirely to your goal , things always work better when you have something to aim for . <p> With that being said , when should transitioners chop ? When is it time to draw the line and let the ends go ? There 's no cut and dry answer , but here a few signs- that will help you determine when you might be just about ready to make that move : <p> 1 . Breakage and thinning are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some thinning and breakage is to be expected . We know the line of demarcation between the new natural and old damaged ends can be very fragile . Continuously handling transitioning tresses while incurring minimal damage can become increasingly difficult . If you reach a point in your journey where your ends are constantly snapping off and your hair experiences severe tapering or thinning , it just might be time to cut your losses . In this extreme case , a trim is not going to solve anything . Chopping is the only way to preserve the health and integrity of the rest of your hair . <p> 2 . You 're losing patience . <p> If you 're at the point in your transition where you 're beginning to loathe certain parts of your regimen , you may be chop ready . If your preparation for detangling requires you to drink two Red Bulls , listen to 30 minutes of turn up music and have a pre-game huddle with your products , chopping may be in your near future . If you need to do a transitioning style like twist and curl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you choose to sit at home with Netflix instead of going out , you 're a chop candidate . These may be extreme examples , but there is something to be said for reaching the point where you absolutely have zero patience for putting up with your transitioning hair . <p> Around October , I really started losing patience with my hair . I had long since given up styles in favor of wash and gos , but even those were getting on my nerves . The time it took to detangle those dreaded damaged ends was wearing on me . The fortitude to do satin strip braidouts , bantu knot outs and other styles was virtually nonexistent . Impatience for your transitioning hair opens the door for lax practices that can result in unnecessary damage to your hair . <p> 3 . You keep trimming . And trimming . And trimming . <p> Getting scissor happy is probably one of the clearer signs that the chop may be near . When you continually trim away at your damaged hair in such a small amount of time , you 're pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice a week suggests that you 're trying to keep your transitioning hair for as long as possible . The message you 're sending to yourself is , " I 'm tired of looking at this damaged hair , " and you 're already taking action . Right before it was time to chop , I found myself trimming my ends every week for a month . That was easily 2-3 inches in one month . <p> 4 . You 're no longer enjoying the journey . <p> The moment transitioning stops being a fun , exploratory journey where you 're learning and growing in how you manage your hair denotes the end of that phase of your natural hair journey is likely near . The transitioner journey is a unique experience full of twists and turns ( literally and figuratively ) . There will be days where your hair amazes you and days where your hair gets on your last nerve . Although the roller coaster ride wont last always , it should be like an exciting courtship period for you and your hair . But once it turns into that stale , dead end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be time to let those ends go . <p> - At the end of the day , you 've got to chop when you 're ready and not a moment sooner .

I do n't recommend doing this esp if your face structure needs a long hair . <p> I think i 'm in phase #2 where i 'm losing my patience ! Only problem is my natural hair has grown for only barely an inch . It really bugs the hell outta me . I 'm thinking of getting a pixie cut just to get rid of it but i 'm really not confident about it . <p> All this reminds me of my journey .

When I finally decided to transition from a relaxer , I transitioned for about two years with braid extensions , cutting off an inch of relaxed hair whenever I gained an inch in new growth .

@@72561578 @1261578/ <h> 9 Tips for Handling Natural Hair with Two or More Textures <p> Typically , when I talk about managing multiple textures , I 'm referring to transitioning and the delicate dance between old , damaged hair and new growth . This time around , I 'm talking about all natural hair although some transitioners could surely stand to benefit . One of the limitations to the texture typing system ( 2a 4c ) is that it fails to take into account naturals that are challenged with managing multiple textures . Its really difficult to take a one size fits all approach to haircare , when on the same head you can have hair that ranges from 2c to 4b and none of it is damaged ! <p> Although texture typing can be useful in some instances , I 'm hesitant to label myself because my textures are personally all over the place . The right side of my hair tends to curl , whereas the left side is more inclined to wave . The back half of my hair has a looser texture and less shrinkage ( around 30% ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , the front/center has a tighter wave , and the crown is kinky and frizzy . If I had to label it , I 'd say my hair is a mix of 3a,3b,3c , and 4a . I say all this to say , having several different textures on one head of hair is completely normal ( although the picture-perfect selfies on Instagram would lead you to believe otherwise ) . <p> So how do you manage multiple textures on one head ? It can get a little frustrating , but with some trial and error , and a little ingenuity , you will be able to work with what you 've got and make the most of every style . <p> 1 . On Wash Day When it comes to managing multiple textures on wash day , the same general information holds true . Handle with care . Cleanse gently , and deep condition often . For hair that is more coily and kinky than loosely curled , extra , extra gentle care is required . Each bend , whether it be zig-zag or spiral , is a structural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working cleansers and conditioners through , take a little more time and use a little less force on those more tightly wound sections . Also , put your deep conditioner on those areas first , so they can remain on the hair the longest . The extra few minutes of deep conditioning will help soften , hydrate , and keep the hair pliable which sets you up for great styling . <p> 2 . Styling <p> Hair pinned back to dry <p> When it comes to managing multiple textures , finding styles that work all the way around can be a challenge . Texture blending styles like satin strip braidouts , and bantu knot outs can definitely be useful . but you should n't feel pressured to rely on those styles if you like to wear wash and gos . If you opt for a texture-blending style like those mentioned above , make sure your hair is 100% dry before take-down . To get more stretch from twist-outs , use Naptural85s method and stretch them across your head to dry . If you 're like me and really just do n't  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go works perfectly fine with multi-textured hair . If I just wash , add product and go , my hair will shrink into a mushrooom-esque shape while it dries , because of my previously mentioned multi-textured struggles.So typically , for the first day or half day of my wash and go , I will wear the front/center sections pinned back to help stretch the roots and make that mushroom shape go away . <p> To help get a handle on uneven shrinkage , diffusing is also really helpful . Just be mindful of scrunching the diffuser full of hair up toward the scalp , which facilitates increased shrinkage . Instead , lay the diffuser flat against sections of hair , moving it around until the hair is dry to your preferred amount . <p> 8 . Nighttime Preservation <p> Banding + Pineappling <p> Nighttime routines are where things get a little tricky for managing multiple textures . Pineappling can result in uneven stretching , bonnets equal uneven smooshing , and sometimes satin pillowcase only is not an option . This is where creativity and really knowing your hair comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , the back half of my hair will stretch more ( thanks to where the knot is tied ) while the front draws up into itself . This is problematic for me , because my mornings will inevitably result in even more uneven hair . To help combat this , some nights I sleep with the front/center of my hair banded , and the rest scarf pineappled . This method works great to help more shrinkage-prone areas of the hair " catch up " with the looser hair . For more on this approach , see my Nighttime Routine video . Preserve multiple texture blending styles by following the regular scarf pineapple , or tying the scarf over the head old-fashion styled . <p> 9 . Lastly , one of the biggest lessons I learned about managing multiple textures is to do as much as you can in the way of refreshing and moisturizing during your nighttime routine .

I mostly do protective styling with cornrow braids and when I give my hair a break I take it down in a braid out . <p> I hate when I wash my hair because my hair has 3 different textures , so the only way I do it , is to braid my hair , and wash my hair in the braids without any box braids and moisture it.Do you think that 's a good thing , because to me it made it easier for me . <p> My hair is crazy and i am crazy in love with it .

Every natural hair blogger/ youtuber would pineapple at night ; i tried it repeatedly and the looser texture at the back of my head would just stretch and the front would stay the same .

@@72561580 @1261580/ <h> 4 Ways to Rehabilitate Natural Hair After Using Heat <p> Before I get any further in this piece , let me make one thing abundantly clear:If your hair is heat damaged , nothing , I repeat , nothing I mention after this sentence is going to help restore your curl pattern . Damage is damage is damage . Trust me . I know from experience . <p> Moving right along <p> If you follow me on Instagram ( why do I feel like 87% of my articles start that way now ? But I digress ) , then you know I spent the better part of a week with straight-esque hair . I flat ironed my hair after a 4 month hiatus from heat , and I was semi-pleased with the results . On the plus side , my hair was thick as all get-out . On the down side , I experimented with a Redken product at the recommendation of someone from Ulta and I HATED it . Like , nothing redeeming about the product . Somewhere in the middle of the road , I 'm toying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and straight hair againunless I find a hairdresser that can flat iron the crap out of my hair without damaging it ( highly unlikely ) . All that aside , I am always happy to report successfully straightening my hair and being able to bounce back without a curl out of whack . Of course , I still have the same heat damage Ive always had , but nothing new . How ? Well , there are two steps : Step 1 : Prevent it in the first place . Click here to read about how I prevent heat damage when flat ironing . Step 2 : Rehabilitate those curls and coils . <p> Were here to talk about step 2 . Luckily , step 2 only consists of 4 really easy parts , which you- probably do in some form or fashion already . But to rehab the hair , kick each one up a notch . Ready ? Let 's explore . <p> Part I : Water-Based Pre-poo . <p> There are a million reasons why the pre-poo is important- to natural and transitioning hair . But in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When hair is straightened , we tend to avoid water or water-based anything to prevent hair from reverting to its natural state . That 's all well and good , until we start talking moisture . There 's only so much serums ( many of which are silicone-based anyway ) , oils , and butter whips can do . Our hair needs and craves true moisture from water . So to stave off breakage and prepare the hair to return to normal , a water-based pre-poo is in order . It does n't  have to be anything fancy or complicated , your favorite conditioner will do just fine . Right now , my personal pre-poo preferences are Kurlee Belle Banana Nut &amp; Avocado Deep Treatment and Soultanicals Knot Sauce . Both are super duper slippy , and contain amazing ingredients . Do n't  worry , an in-depth review is coming soon . Whatever product you choose , make sure it is water ( or aloe vera juice ) based . As an added bonus , if you 're able to steam the hair then do so . Pack in as much moisture as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-pooing , but you can find a list of alternative ways to get your steam on here . <p> Part II : Really Clean Your Hair Post straightening stint is really not the time for a cowash . Let 's face it : you 've got buildup . If you 're anything like me , you probably used 2-3 products to protect and straighten , added oils and serums throughout the week to maintain softness , and sweated to high heaven at the gym . With all that going on , a cowash is not going to cut it . At the very least , you need a diluted shampoo or shampoo bar . Something that will produce some sort of lather , and lift up everything you 've put down . For this step , I personally enjoyed using Obia Natural Hair Cares Coconut Shea Shampoo Bar or Soultanicals Honey I Shrunk the Frizz Strand Poo Bar . Gentle , effective cleansing without drying the hair . Of course , Soultanicals review coming soon ! <p> Part III : **35;1702;TOOLONG Condition Of all the steps , I think this one is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your hair , deep conditioning is a must-do . Preferably , a deep conditioner known to moisturize , penetrate , and nourish the hair and scalp . On top of that , the longer you can let it sit on the better . Yes , most deep conditioners are going to do their repairative work within 30 minutes . But I personally believe that the longer your hair can sit in a wet/dampened environment slathered in conditioner after a straightening binge , the better off it will be ( just not overnight ) . This particular time around , I have been boo-lovin on All Things O Natural Natty Cupuacu &amp; Rhassoul Deep Conditioner ( review coming soonI promise ) . I sat with that tootsie-roll smelling , slip-havin , moisturizing , deep conditioner in my hair for 2 hours . Then , I rinsed it out , turned around and slapped some more into my hair as a leave-in base for my wash n go . Which takes me to my next point <p> Part IV : Give Your Hair A Chance to CHILL After you 've done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a vengeance , you might be tempted to go straight into another style , or even stretch them out a little . Do n't  . You just spent so much time pouring back into your hair what it has missed out on . Give it some time to absorb the goodness of being back to normal . If you can , try and stick with a one-and-done style like a wash n go . Or a bun . Something that requires minimal effort and manipulation . My style of choice is a wash n go , featuring the aforementioned DC and Soultanicals Curl Blaze Hair Glaze ( my new MUST HAVE ) .

Any reason that this happens to me ? <p> The best suggestion I have is to get your hair professionally straightened , or use top of the line hair products . My and my daughters curls always bounce right back with NO effort after we have our hair done in the salon . Then we wash and go , or twist/braid for a break in between the straightening ( like a month in between ) for rest and rebuilding . After the straightening-just soak with water in the shower , condition , rinse , then L.O.C. We deep clean and mask after the hair has a few days of rest . <p> The end of last summer I made the mistake of getting the Brocato straightener instead of the Keratin straightener Its been almost a yr and I still do n't  have my curl pattern back Please HELP I want my curls back <p> I cant believe no one mentioned protein treatments !

There is a such thing as over conditioning , &amp; it feels too soft &amp; stretchy . After an Aphogee 2 step treatment , my hair is stronger &amp; my curls pop !

@@72561581 @1261581/ <p> Recently , social media has been abuzz with word and photos of a revolutionary system that allows natural women to go from textured , to straight , and back to textured hair in the blink of an eye . That system is the Texture Manageability System by Beautiful Textures , subsidiary of Strength of Nature . If you follow popular bloggers like @tarenguy , @msvaughntv , - @lexiwiththecurls , and @chimeedwards on Instagram , you saw that this product unveiling came with a Miami getaway , videos , salon events , and a photo shoot . <p> All of those things are fab , and I 'm really happy for the ladies involved ( I really am and I 'm claiming my own big opportunities in 2014 ! ) , but at the end of the day one question remains <p> Is the Texture Manageability System worth it ? <p> Let 's explore . <p> I received a Texture Manageability System ( TMS ) as a part of my March OnyxBox . I could n't pass up 3 full size products plus the TMS for only $15 . Beyond the product junkie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious about TMS and all the social media fanfare surrounding it . I needed to know how it worked , why it worked and if there would be any adverse consequences ( because of course , no brand is going to tell you what 's wrong with their product ) . I was also curious to see if the system would allow me to wear flat ironed hair for more than a week ( which is what I typically get when I straighten using my own methods ) . <p> The system consists of a shampoo , leave-in conditioner , and anti-reversion shampoo and conditioner duo . There is also a pamphlet for instructions and general guidelines based upon texture and desired goal . Warnings of not using too much heat reappear- throughout the literature . But , before I get into my own analysis , let 's start of with what Beautiful Textures has to say about their product ( via beautifultextures.com ) : <h> ReversibleG Straightening Texture ManageabilityG <p> This revolutionary system has created a totally new category in hair care . Never before has hair been able to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's the flexibility to FlipG back-and-forth from curly to straight and then back again , and if you have relaxed hair the system extends the time you need to touch-up between relaxer new growth applications . <p> The secret is the Inner-ActiveG Leave-In Conditioner , which is infused with essential oils , natural butters and amino acids , and has no harsh chemicals . The Inner ActiveG leave-in conditioner penetrates the hair , causing it to elongate and soften while making it easier to detangle . Once the detangling process is complete , the hair is blow-dried and flat ironed , creating beautifully straight , touchable soft hair with unmatched body , movement and shine all in a fraction of the time of most traditional straightening methods . <p> Now in four quick steps , curly girls can go from natural curls to straight styles and back again without compromising or permanently altering their curl pattern . The system gives ReversibleG Straightening that lasts up to 6 weeks , plus the benefit to stop damaging your hair from daily heat straightening , or the choice to stop using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Texture ManageabilityG System gives you the choice to go back to natural at any time because the Inner-Active Conditioners do not permanently change your hair texture . <p> Marketing jargon aside , what does TMS actually do and how does it work ? I stayed up late one night doing research , and reading information from a number of cosmetic chemistry sources . Heres what I came up with ( you can catch this excerpt on my Instagram as well ) : <p> The active ingredient in TMS is in the leave-in , which is glyoxyloyl carbocysteine . There is some interesting data from a cosmetic chemistry conference about what it does to curly and textured hair . Long story short , the Texture Manageability System is a low pH , formaldehyde-free , amino acid-rich protein treatment that deposits inside the cortex , closes the cuticle tightly/fills stress cracks , and makes hair super shiny and strong . When combined with heat , the deposits inside the hair cause a reversible , structural elongation of the cortex . Essentially , this thing is a huge deep conditioning/protein treatment activated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did what I customarily do when trying any new product a patch test . Here were my results using the shampoo and leave-in ( via Instagram ) : <p> I was able to easily straighten this small segment of hair with slightly lower temperatures ( around 370 , I normally straighten at 380 degrees Fahrenheit ) . The hair felt soft and silky , and had great shine . I immediately washed it twice with tgin Moisture Rich Sulfate Free Shampoo , which resulted in a frizz-free , somewhat elongated version of my texture ( which is where the " manageability " part comes in ) . To completely remove the system from my hair , I followed up with Lawrence Ray Concepts Complete Cleanse Shampoo , which contains SLS . My hair returned to normal , but still possessed the shine and softness . At this particular point , I was convinced that nothing terrible would happen to my hair , so I made plans to straighten it that weekend . <p> Before I get too far into the results , let me highlight a few things about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use entirely too much heat ( they warn strongly against that in the literature that comes with the kit ) and end up with heat damage , any loosening of your texture will revert with several washes . <p> Your texture wont 100% revert immediately . Again , in the literature they tell you that you can use the product to achieve a looser curl pattern if you do n't  want to wear your hair straight . <p> Reversion requires several washes with a SULFATE-CONTAINING shampoo . I make that distinction because there are some bloggers ( no shade ) who are showing their reversion results with sulfate-free shampoo . If you use a more gentle cleansing agent , the looser curl results last longer . Using a more clarifying product with sulfates will help remove the Inner-Active Leave-In more quickly . <p> I straightened my hair with TMS ( video coming soon , I documented ev-er-ry-thang ) just to see if it would live up to all the hype surrounding it . In the meantime , here are my preliminary thoughts : <p> Cleansing Shampoo <p> Its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can understand the rationale for wanting to make sure hair is completely clean before any heat styling . Made a mental note that *if* I decided to use TMS again , I will be swapping out the shampoo for one that does n't  dry out my hair as much . <p> Inner-Active Leave-In <p> Very liquidy , and comes with warnings of not over-applying . The bottle is slightly more than 1oz , which can lead a heavy-handed naturalista to believe it is not enough . Believe me when I say it is MORE than enough . I used 75% of a bottle , and I think that was too much . Goes on easily , and is able to be worked through the hair while WET . But once it dries , forget about it . For whatever reason during blow drying , my hair became tangle city even though I had detangled prior to washing , and during deep conditioning , which brings me to my next point- <p> There is no deep conditioner . Or heat protectant. - <p> To me , the absence of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaring weakness . Whether I use TMS or not , I always , always , alllllllllllways make sure I have a deep conditioner on deck preferably one with cetrimonium chloride and protein . To make up for that lack , I deep conditioned with Eva NYC Therapy Session Hair Mask after shampooing and before applying the leave-in . And even though the Inner-Active Leave-In may offer some heat protection , I did n't  fully trust it . After transitioning for 21 months from heat damage , there was no way I was leaving this one up to chance . I incorporated Tresemme Heat Tamer Spray and Garnier Fructis Marvelous Oil serum during blow drying and flat ironing for added protection . <p> - <p> The Straightening Process <p> TMS was supposed to help cut down on the straightening time . And whatever strides I made in flat ironing my hair more quickly were canceled out by the obscenely difficult blow drying session . As I mentioned previously with the leave-in , working it through the hair is easy when it is damp or wet . But after you leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that is out the window . My hair was tangled and felt coated , which made it difficult for me to work through and blow dry . That feeling dissipated somewhat once it was time to flat iron which I think can be attributed to the Garnier serum . Here were my results : <p> For those that are curious , I flat iron on 380 degrees Fahrenheit . That is the temperature that I have deemed safe for my hair without heat damage with proper protection . After flat ironing , my hair was soft and shiny with movement but it typically does when I straighten it . The major difference though ? In the following days , my hair did feel coated and I definitely experienced some reversion in the form of poofiness ( which I expect from natural hair that does n't  have heat damage ) . At the end of 3 days , I found my straight hair to be more of a hassle than my curls ( imagine that ) , and went on a mission to revert . <p> It took me 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern restored back 100% . You can read all about wash day number one here , and wash days two and three here . All and all , I 'm glad I tried the Texture Manageability System if for no other reason than to quell my curiosity . Will I use it again ? Probably not . I 'm not interested in " managing " my texture , and even though the smoothness and shine was nice , I can get that from a good deep conditioning. - So to answer the question posed in the beginning is the Texture Manageability System worth it ? For me , not really . But of course , each head of hair is different . <p> There are some ladies who will sing the praises of TMS , others who disagree with the notion that our hair needs to be " managed " , and some who wont care either way. - Which category do you fall into , ladies ? <p> - Would you try Texture Management System ? <p> Note : Straight hair can be a hot-button/polarizing issue for us . Please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx707941 <p> Honestly I have found that if you add the deep conditioner to Creme of Natures Argan oil perm it lowers the ph balance .

To each its ownbut I will keep using the natural products I make on my hair and limit the use of commerical products with the exception of those that rely on mostly natural ingredients . <p> Yup .

They found a way to gain more access to women with natural hair . I have read an article and watched a review of it on Youtube . It to me is just a Brazilian straightening treatment under a new name . I knew someone who used the Brazilian straighten treatment . It has the same steps .

Thank you , but no thank you ! <p> Thanks for your input on this product . I have been curious . To answer your question No , I have zero interest in putting any chemicals in my hair for the sole purpose of altering it in anyway . Those days are behind me . I have a healthy head of thick hair and I am more then happy to work with what I have . <p> 3 washes ? sulphate shampoo ? that 's too much work for me .

Also , the woman who wrote the curly nikki articles seems very bitter about her own hair and seems to believe everyone with type 4 feels the same . <p> You 're right Nooni . There is no formaldehyde . If I read the article correctly , I believe it said that when high heat is applied to the active ingredient in the leave in conditioner ( glyoxyloyl carbocysteine ) it acts as a carcinogen very similar to formaldehyde like formaldehyde in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CurlyNikki.com and although the author of that article seemed to be bias against straight haired naturals , I feel she did a better job explaining that the TMS is a straightening system no different than a keratin treatment or a brazilian blow out and can have some serious health risks .

You may not see the big deal now but who knows what the long term effects could be <p> I personally tried this product last week and it did exactly what it said it would do . I straightened my hair after being natural for 2.5 years and my hair is beyond thick and coarse . It made my hair soft and shiny , I trimmed my hair and it reverted after one wash this week .

I get bored too soon after straightening my hair . Its only smooth and silky for like 2 seconds before it poofs up and moreover , my hair is dry and crunchy for weeks after straightening even if i wash and condition . Its not worth the hustle .

Yes , you 're using heat but its controlled heat and its evenly distributed throughout your head so there 's no direct heat to burn your delicate strands . <p> Hi ! ! !

@@72561582 @1261582/ <h> 6 Signs That Its Time to Take Down Your Protective Style <p> The key to effective protective styling is having the patience to keep a style in for an extended period of time . But its just as important to know when to take it down . Here are 6 signs that you 're due for a re-set : <p> 1 . Your ends are snapping . The objective of protective styling is to preserve your ends , so if they start breaking you are defeating the purpose . Ends breakage typically happens when your protective style is too dry . Try pulling lightly on your twists or braids from root to tip . If there are broken ends in your hands , then its time for a re-do . Note : If you are wearing a cornrowed or flat twist updo style , your are particularly susceptible to ends breakage , as most of the hair is hidden and tucked away , and ca n't be properly moisturized by a spritz . <p> 2 . Your hair is tangling . Your hair is constantly shedding and those detached hairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tangling and shedding . Feel your protective style for any bumps or inconsistency that could be a sign of a clump of tangled/shed hair . Note : Tangles due to she 'd hair typically happen closer to your ends . <p> 3 . You no longer feel good about the way the style looks . The length retention/protective styling journey can be a challenging one . It takes focus and discipline , so its important that you keep yourself motivated . If you are hanging on to a style that is no longer attractive for the sake of retention , you are making an already challenging journey more difficult . If possible , try re-doing your edges to get them crisp again . But if you are rocking a style , like a bun or cornrow/twist updo that ca n't be partially re-done , just let it go . Feeling bad about the way you look for the sake of length retention is not worth it . Note : A little fuzziness does not mean a style is unattractive . It is important for long-term protective stylers to learn how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not retaining moisture . Natural hair needs immersion in water to be properly moisturized , and spritzing can only do so much . If you are sleeping with a satin bonnet , and spritzing regularly but your style still feels dry , then you need a re-boot . If your twists or braids can tolerate a weekly or bi-weekly deep condition , incorporate that into your protective styling regimen . But if you 're wearing a style that ca n't be immersed in water without being ruined , you 'll need a re-boot . Note : Lack of moisture leads to breakage . So no moisture , no length . <p> 5 . Your roots are tangled . Its exciting to feel your roots getting looser as the new growth comes in , but keep in mind that the new growth is coming in tangled . If your roots have grown out in excess of a half inch , you might consider taking your style down so you can detangle the new growth . <p> So how long is too long ? As with most things related to natural hair care , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styling gurus like Cipriana of Urbanbushbabes.com , do so for one month at a time . Extreme protective styling gurus like Chinwe of Hair and Health and Domineque of LongHairDontCare2011 keep protective styles in for months at a time , but do styles like box braids and twists that are good for long stretches . They also regularly re-braid or re-twist their edges . The six factors above come most into play beyond the 1 month mark , so if you plan on keeping a style in for longer than that , make sure you have a game plan . 87940 @qwx707940 <p> I used to keep my weaves in for 3months at a time , I would notice alot of hair growth but a ton of meshing and shedding probably breakage .

I might have loose curls but my hair is dry and very long and my hair is much healthier when I just leave it loose and free .

I think ppl need to assess whether this is necessary for their hair growth before jumping into it , especially when a lot of these styles look tight and itchy . My hair just grows . Isnt that what hair does ? Maybe this would be harder to do Read more + <p> My hair is basically permanently in box braids ( with extensions ) which I redo every four to six weeks ( eight max ) .

This also helps remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion .

@@72561583 @1261583/ <h> 5 Easy Fixes for Dry , Frizzy Ends <p> There are any number of causes for fuzzy , dry , frizzy ends from split ends and single strand knots to damaged cuticles . Rough handling of hair , inadequate moisturizing , color damage and normal wearing of the cuticle can cause rough ends that make detangling seem like a nightmare and length retention an impossible task . <p> Whenever my ends start getting rough , I notice more wisps of hair as I handle and detangle my hair . That 's my cue to get it together , and get back to the things in my regimen that keep my ends soft , smooth , and strong like the rest of my hair . <p> Below is a short collection of tips to help you manage dry , frizzy , fuzzy and rough-feeling ( and sometimes looking ) ends feel free to follow whichever combination of tips works for you , and add your own ! <p> 1 . Introduce a brush or comb into your regimen occasionally . I am an avid finger detangler , but on occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll bring in the reinforcements and use a comb or detangling brush to help smooth and for lack of a better term , " straighten out " tangled and jumbled up ends . After finger detangling in small sections , take a moderately wide tooth comb like this one ( teeth too wide apart defeat the purpose ) or a Denman brush to smooth out the ends of your hair . This works best with hair that is saturated in regular or deep conditioner . <p> 2 . Use a smoothing deep conditioner . Smoothing deep conditioners are typically marketed as a step in the process of blowing out and straightening the hair , thanks to the penetrating conditioning agents , smoothing polymers , and proteins . These same ingredients make a great treatment for rough and frizzy ends . You do n't  have to use a separate deep conditioner or your ends , you can just treat your entire head of hair to a smoothing deep conditioning treatment every two weeks to every month to keep the problem ends at bay . Silk Elements Kera-Minerals Smoothing Conditioner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eversleek Conditioner are three great smoothing treatments under $10 . <p> 4 . Tuck them away . This is probably my least favorite piece of advice , because I am in no way a fan of protective styling . My twists only last two days before looking a mess . My scalp psoriasis wont allow for styles and braided updos that can have hair tucked away for weeks at a time . And personally , I think my forehead is entirely too big for regular bunning . But if you are not sensitive to any of my predicaments , then tucking the ends away for a few days or weeks at a time can help the ends of your hair recuperate . Just be sure to follow steps 2 and 3 for maintenance ! 5 . Get out the scissors . Sometimes in spite of your best efforts , your ends are too far gone for conditioners and moisturizers to help . In these cases , the best thing you can do is make the decision to chop the problem ends , or gradually trim them . As I follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a monthly basis . My ends are n't  split and my single strand knots are few , but I aim to gradually rid myself of problematic , tangly ends . My personal timeline is three months .

Looking forward to ending my frizzy ends frustration lol : ) . <p> I wound up cutting off about 3 inches . : ( . Now a month later , my ends were becoming hard dry and frizzy again . This past week , I 've included a fine toothed comb in my regimen , after using a wide toothed comb and oiling my hair . So far it seems to be working . <p> I have 4a natural hair which I 've been wearing in a twist out . Cuz Ive worn pony tails so often , my hair broke off in the back . My hair has been soft and moisturized , but lately my ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . Nothing , so far , has worked . I even thought about slightly relaxing the ends ! . I 'm going to try this first , before I chop 2-3 inches off ! <p> Brushing has been working for me too ! I have been using a paddle brush gently on my dry hair for about the last 2 weeks and my hair is smoother and definitely stays detangled longer . I do n't  always wear a scarf to bed and the brushing also removes any lint that I pick up from my pillow case ! <p> Tip no. 1 really works . I recently started using a brush to smooth out jumbled ends on damp hair . It works , and in addition for my 4a hair it helps define my curl by reducing frizz . I think the frizz comes from the hair strands recoiling separately so that they bunch and tangle instead of clump and coil . I think that 's a result of dense hair and mixed strands ( fine/medium/coarse ) . <p> Last month I got a trim and it made a dramatic difference ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its shinier , less tangles , and retains moisture more . Since the trim Im making an effort to deep condition once a week . <p> Yea I start looking at my ends to see if I should trim around week 6 . My hair is 4c and fine and for some reason I get tons of fairy knots if i do n't  keep my hair stretched . If its not stretched for a while then I trim at week six . If stretched , then I trim around week 8.

A B12 supplement alone is n't going to work as good as a regular multivitamin or prenatal vitamins . I love prenantals because they contain collagen . <p> You should try misting your ends/hair with water . I mist my hair with water twice a day and cover with a plastic bag while dressing for work or in the evening . My hair is n't saturated just lightly misted . <p> I 'd recommend spritzing them daily and then using a butter and oil whip to seal in the moisture . I like to use glycerin + aloe vera juice + water and I make a shea whip with shea + coconut oil + castor oil .

My hair is coarse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finer hair you may want to use oils like apricot or avocado and use butters like mango or cocoa . <p> This was really helpful . I think I 'm experiencing global breakage as my length has been stagnant . <p> I 'm a big fan of deep conditioning with clay . So far my experience for my coarse hair is that rhassoul is good for strengthening and kaolin clay is very gentle . Clay paired with honey really ca n't be beat in terms of conditioning .

@@72561592 @1261592/ <p> The first thing that pops into my head when I think about youtuber Karen of Glamfun is of course the very catchy tune , Wash and Gos do n't  work on nappy hair. Recently , - she has been in the spotlight for her hair struggles and decision to relax her natural hair . She spoke in depth to BGLH on that in this interviewthis is not the topic of discussion today . - Instead , I want to do an analysis of what I learned from her discussion on the serious level of breakage she experienced . I think her experiences can be a great learning tool for anyone with 4c hair specifically , as well as broadly speaking to anyone trying to retain- length and constantly succumbing to- setbacks . <p> 1 . Doubt is a very good thing <p> Karen was given a diagnosis of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia and she doubted it . I am a scientist and not a dermatologist but I 'm with Karen in doubting the diagnosis . From my point of view , Karen had breakage after her hair was grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is some association with trauma to the hair follicles leading to a scalpy appearance , not so in Karens case . The dermatologist suggestion of relaxing as a remedy is not ideal as relaxers are suspected to be- a possible cause for tram , triggering that type of alopecia ( J Clin Aesthet Dermatol. pp 37 " 40 , 2012 . ) . Therefore , if you doubt what a medical professional is telling you , do get a second or even third opinion . <p> 2 . Breakage happens even to the most seasoned naturals <p> Chery of chery818 is an example of how a seasoned natural with years of experience and very long hair can experience breakage . Do n't  make the mistake of thinking serious breakage is a newbie type of error ; and those who- are 2-3 years into their- natural journey are less likely to experience it . Typically , 4c hair is- more susceptible to breakage . When coupled with length , there is more potential to knot within coils and kinks . <p> 3 . Why is your hair breaking ? Erm .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago with this exact title . In short , its safe to say that most of the time when you experience hair breakage , its because of something that you , - as the main handler of that hair are doing . It is a simple answer , almost too simple for some but it underlies an important an inescapable truth which is that ultimately , you as the main handler of that hair , - have to troubleshoot and find out what you are doing wrong . Big emphasis on " you . " <p> 4 . Absolute fail safe methods Leave your hair alone ( 2+ weeks ) <p> Karen noticed that when she placed her hair in braids for a while and left it alone , it grew . For 4c hair , leaving your hair alone is an absolute fail safe method to retain length . For most 4c naturals , this means protective styling for 2+ weeks at a time by some means e.g own hair braids/twists , well installed extensions , well installed weaves , cornrows under a wig etc. - I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunning , twist outs etc but if you are able to see low to no breakage , then it is a fail safe method for you . New methods such as the maximum hydration method have reports that some users with 4c hair experience less knotting and breakage . I would not label this method as a proven fail safe method but I would say that if you are an experimentalist , try it and observe the level of breakage for yourself . <p> 5 . Sticking points / Plateaus <p> For many 4c naturals , there are specific points when hair is more liable to experience high breakage. - The two most common ones are : <p> hair ca n't get past neck length <p> transitioning hair from APL to BSL <p> In both cases , trying a fail safe method for a period of 6 months to 1 year could dramatically change your fortunes . <p> Its frustrating that she basically says in order for me to retain length I need to put my hair up , so I cant wear my hair out regular in its natural state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing ? Black women myths kill me ! <p> Anyone know/recommend the softest marley-type kinky extension hair for braiding ? I find most are so rough and synthetic feeling or prone to tangling . A good one would be really helpful for protective styling . <p> I think I 'm having problems with my transition from APL to BSL . I guess I need to try leaving my hair alone more or something . I will have to figure it out . here 's a link to another article on breakage . <p> To avoid breakage I simple braid my hair into braids , morning and at night spray my hair with water massage my scalp then apply castor oil then wrap it up with a silk head wrap . I only wear a wig when going outside . Every two weeks I rinse my hair with acv and condition and then deep condition my hair . With this routine I found at that my hair retains moisture and breakage is less compared to when I braided my hair for a weave my hair was so dry and I suffered breakage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agree and have found the same . Trouble is in the hot summer months wigs are n't  desirable for a cool head . What to do ? I 'm still searching for a braider who does n't  yank the living daylights out of my hair roots ! <p> I actually prefer protective styles , but find that my hair mats at the roots if left in place for more than a few days . Does anyone else experience this ? If so , are there styles that make it less likely ? <p> Ive been natural for too long ( 6+ yrs ) since the 9th grade I 'm now a sophomore at Howard University . I 've experienced the most breakage with braid and twist installments . When it comes to take down time my hair snaps closes to root and mats up . Ive tried washing and everything else while I have the braids/twists in . Also the braiders/twisters seem to be heavy handed with my hair , which is fine . More breakage . So now Ive moved on to putting my hair in lose mini twists and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been working like Read more + <p> I 've had similar experiences when I take down my braids/kinky twists , even when I remember to keep them moisturized . When you say " loose " mini-twists , are you just talking about regular 2-strand twists ? How do you keep them fresh-looking for 4-6 weeks ? ! Mine start looking a mess by the beginning of week 2 LOL . Please pass along your wisdom ! : o ) <p> Check out mstanish . She has an awesome tutorial for what I mean by loose twists . Also ciprianna from urbanbushbabes she rocks them too . LONG ... So her hair is thicker than mine and densely packed . Basically make your twists based on your hairs needs . Also instead of braiding at the roots I twist tightly . It looks better to me . Big tip I work with stretched hair using african threading . And after finishing each section re-thread the section of minitwists to keep them stretched until you ; re done . Keeping them fresh . Hmmm . Well as my twists get older my hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I agree with JC . When I BCed in 2012 and protective styled continuously for 5 months , I retained every inch of growth I got . And now , during this transition , whenever I find that my hair is starting to break a bit too much , I just braid it up , cover with a wig and forget about it . I read online somewhere that if you are actively growing out your hair , its good to forget about looking cute : D. And I have taken that as my motto , when I really need to retain , I forget about looking cute , Read more + <p> I completely agree with Carlee and Ms LiLi . I find long term protective styling boring and I find my hair looks thinner when I take it down . What 's the aim of putting away your hair for weeks at a time ?

Many naturals do long term protective style and manage to still moisturise hair . Routines for this are sometimes daily , every three to four days or once a week . The big variability you find is because every person has different needs and NO ( in caps ) , it is not a rule that you need to moisturise every day . I do urge you .. especially those who are struggling to read the 4c case studies here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective Read more + <p> Completely agree with Carlee . Putting our hair " away " is not helpful because the reason type 4 hair breaks is usually a moisture protein balance or rough handling issue . How will we ever learn to care for our hair if we always leave it alone . And if we grow hair down to the floor , at some point we have to handle our hair routinely . And if you have not learned your hair while its shorter your only going to ruin your progress with longer hair . I say , learn your hair , what it likes and does n't  like . Always assess it to make sure it Read more + <p> I also agree . I love me some twists but they and other bounded up styles can be murder on my 4c strands if I do them continuously .

Long term protective styling is great but I also believe in low manipulation styling as well ( including twist-outs , buns , braid-outs , etc ) . I 'm strongly against re-twisting and re-braiding natural hair regularly ( especially every night or every other night ) .

If you have a tried and true co-washing conditioner then by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different ways for different people . As with all things natural do what works best for you and your hair ! <p> When it comes to conditioning properties , slip is a must . Whether you 're looking to finger detangle with conditioner , or just cleanse , the product must be workable and able to be distributed smoothly throughout the hair . Emollients in hair conditioners do the best job at creating slip coating the strands and allowing them to glide past each other . Some of the best emollient ingredients in conditioner are dimethicone , cyclomethicone , cetyl alcohol , stearyl alcohol , cetaryl alcohol , and oils like coconut , jojoba , and olive . <p> Luckily , the silicones , fatty alcohols , and oils listed above are base ingredients in most conditioners . The more of them that you find in the top five , the better off you 'll be . By far , the slipperiest conditioner Ive encountered is Tresemme Split Remedy around $5 for a 25oz bottle. - <p> Thanks to Chaz Dean and a slew of others , there are plenty of folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have to buy a cleansing conditioner ( which tends to be more expensive than your run-of-the-mill conditioners ) . Now , as with all things natural do what works for you . But do n't  be duped into believing that the word " cleansing " before conditioner makes it more effective . Conditioners clean in two ways through cationic ( positively charged ) surfectants and oil solubility . Some examples of these gentle surfectants areStearalkonium chloride , cetrimonium chloride , dicetyldimonium chloride , behentrimonium methosulfate , behentrimonium chloride , and stearamidopropyl dimethylamine . In terms of oil-solubility , the fatty alcohol crew ( cetyl , cetaryl , stearyl ) makes another appearance . Each of the ingredients is capable of breaking down sebum and other oils on the hair . An added bonus cleanser present in some conditioners is EDTA a chelating ingredient that lifts mineral deposits on the hair . If you live in an area with hard water ( hello , Los Angeles ) , a conditioner with EDTA can help lift those dry , damaging hard water mineral deposits . <p> Again , most conditioners contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My favorite fatty alcohol + cationic combo ( and it even has EDTA ! ) is present in Aussie Moist , ringing at the register for around $6 for a 29.2oz bottle . <p> In Natural Hair 101 , we learned that true moisture comes from water . Obviously , plenty of conditioners ( but not all ) are water-based but this is n't a necessity for co-washing , because your hair is soaked in water anyway . The moisture most naturals look for from co-washing takes place after the conditioner is rinsed away . This is where penetrating oils like Coconut , Olive , sealing oils like Shea or even Jojoba ( which is the oil closest to our own skins sebum ) and humectants like glycerin or glutamic acid come in handy . <p> Hair generally carries a negative charge .

@@72561601 @1261601/ <h> Spotlight on Apricot Oil <p> When it comes to natural hair , oils are all the buzz . We are always on the prowl to seek out the latest and greatest , most cost effective , and amazing oils to take our coils and curls to the next level . Sometimes we seek out the standard like coconut or olive oil . Other times , we want the exotic and expensive . <p> On a recent excursion to Vitamin Shoppe , I spent some time poring over their available spread of oils . I usually spend my time checking out supplements , or keeping a narrow focus on certain oils like Castor or Sweet Almond . Checking out what- else they keep in stock was definitely a- new experience for me . While trying to decide how to spend my $10 rewards certificate , I came across a huge bottle of Apricot Oil for $12.99 . Although its not super exotic , expensive or rare , its not one that gets a lot of shine ( no pun intended ) . After some in-store research and at-home use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me share why . <p> Apricot Oil ( Prunus armeniaca ) is pressed from the kernels of the Apricot fruit , and is light yellow in color . It is slightly nutty , and similar in viscosity to sweet almond oil . Apricot oil is high in oleic and linoleic fatty acids , which have all sorts of wonderful benefits for hair , scalp , and body . <p> Oleic acid is commonly known as an omega-9 fatty acid with wonderful emollient properties . Emollients are ingredients that when applied , make hair and skin softer and more pliable . While emollients do not truly moisturize ( meaning they do not penetrate the hair ) , they do increase the hydration level of hair and skin by preventing evaporation . Lineoleic acid is the fun stuff , and definitely the star of the show . Lineolic acid is an omega-6 fatty acid with a laundry list of benefits internally and externally . According to a study at the University of Maryland Medical Center , omega-6 fatty acids can stimulate hair growth . Also an emollient , lineolic acid helps control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fatty acids in Apricot Oil come together to serve three wonderful functions at the molecular level : <p> Cement : They shape the substance that seal scales of the hair cuticle , in the same way that cement keeps together the bricks in a wall . Because the scales are " cemented " together , they make for a smooth surface , which enables the hair to protect itself against external aggressions , and to reflect light ( shiny hair ) . <p> Barrier : Also known as sealing . They prevent the water that was absorbed by the hair from evaporating . <p> Sponge : Fatty acids are also mild humectants . They are able to absorb small amounts of water from the airs humidity in order to help maintain hair hydration . <p> Apricot Oil is also rich in Vitamins A &amp; E. Vitamin A supports skin health and repair , a wonderful property for those suffering from dry scalp , psoriasis , dandruff , or eczema . Additionally , it can help soothe irritated scalp , and soften fine lines in the skin . Vitamin E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair loss . When combined with fatty acids , Vitamin E acts as a preservative preventing free radicals from eliminating their effectiveness . It also prevents UV damage , which is just in time for Spring and Summer ! <p> To sum this thing up , Apricot Oil will make for a great pre-poo , as well as a mix-in for your conditioner , shampoo , deep conditioner , and leave in . It helps promote hair growth , as well as length retention . You can even use it on your skin to help soften and retain moisture . If you are suffering from dry or flaky scalp , or dull and dry hair , Apricot Oil may be just the thing you need to restore moisture and balance . <p> As with all oils you intend to use on your hair , scalp , or skin , you will reap the most benefit from those that are : <p> Virgin or Pure : Meaning that the oil was obtained by mechanical processes , without industrial refinement or chemical additives . <p> Cold Pressed : Meaning that the seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oils without heat . Cold pressed oils best retain the nutrients , vitamins , and fatty acids that provide the benefits you seek . Heat diminishes their presence and effectiveness . <p> Organic : Which guarantees that there is has been no fertilizer , no herbicides or chemical pesticides in the environment where the product source is cultivated . Because those elements are soluble in greasy substances , they end up in the raw product ( unrefined/cold pressed ) . Only industrial refinement can then eliminate the impuritiesthen the oil itself loses its effectiveness . Talk about a vicious cycle . 87941 @qwx707941 <p> Thank you for this extremely brilliant blog . This is the right place where there is something for everyone !

@@72561605 @1261605/ <h> 3 Ways to Retain Moisture at Night Without a Hair Bonnet <p> Silk scarves or satin hair bonnets are almost always recommended by pretty much every natural to help take care of your hair at night . Some give them credit for reducing breakage , helping to preserve hairstyles and even for helping to moisturise hair while you sleep . However , what happens if you forget your hair bonnet or what if scarves and bonnets are more a source of frustration rather than a helpful hair aid . You may find that your scarf always slips off at night or your bonnet is not kind to your edges or you do not like the look of a scarf or a bonnet . No matter what your reason , here is a guide on how to survive without the bonnet . <p> 1 .

You can also do the pineapple , large twists or large braids or French braids on hair that is in smaller/mini single strand twists or braids . <p> 2 . Use a satin pillowcase or cover your pillow with the silk scarfSilk scarves and satin bonnets are thought by many to be softer less abrasive surfaces for hair to rest on . If you are not wearing one , then your next best option is to cover your pillow with the silk scarf or buy a silk pillowcase .

Many natural oils can be comedogenic meaning they can cause acne . Covering your hair allows some of this oil to be absorbed by the scarf or bonnet and therefore without this absorption , you should be aware that even more oil will be transferred to your pillow and therefore to your face . <p> Ladies , are you a fan of hair bonnets ?

@@72561606 @1261606/ <h> 5 Signs You 're On Your Way to Long Hair <p> Long natural hair is not something that happens quickly , it will take between 3 to 5 years to have that much desired hair down your back . If you are just starting your journey or if you have made some mistakes and wish to redirect your energy into results , here are some of the small but highly significant steps that will mark that you are on the right path . <h> 1 . No pain when handling your hair <p> As a child I learned to grit my teeth and bear the pain as my hair was combed with a fine toothed comb . My hair also did not gain length and often post combing it was easy to see why huge hair balls always followed . It still remains very common to hear the word tender-headed especially in salons when in truth hair is being ripped out and hence the reason for the pain . You are making significant progress when you get to a point where you no longer associate pain with the detangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull ache/soreness ) associated with combing and this is related to the fact that they are more sensitive to even gentle tugging , however pain should never be the result of combing. <h> 2 . No hair on the floor <p> The less the hair you see on the floor or on your clothes when combing , the better . Ideally you should only see hair in the tool that you use to detangle ( so if you are finger combing , shed hair will be unravelled with your fingers or if you are combing with a brush/comb then the shed hair should be trapped with the comb ) . If you have a good method of combing that suits your hair texture then you will be able to greatly minimise breakage . <h> 3 . You are patient <p> Patience is a big part of handling natural hair . It is required in every aspect from the shorter periods of detangling and styling to the long term period of growth and retention where you have to give your hair enough time in appropriate styles to gain length . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried , the easier you will find it handle as futile attempts will be eliminated . For example , you can easily style your hair in 5-10 minutes but patience dictates that you must select what works best for your hair . It is easy enough to make a quick bun on dry hair but this will not work when hair is wet for someone with high shrinkage . In that case , it may be easier to place 5-6 twists on wet hair and pin them up into a style . Later when your hair is dry , you can style as you please . <h> 4 . You accept that your hair can not do everything <p> Natural hair is versatile and in general can be styled in almost any way . However , not all hair can do everything well . Some people can wash their hair every day and it will look perfect . Other people simply can not do the same as their scalp may become progressively drier or if their hair is longer , daily washing is unsuitable as it increases tangling . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . If your hair feels brittle or breaks after even a low heat blow dry , you may have to accept heat is not for you . Some people can sit in protective styles for months while others would either get hair unravelling or matting if they attempted to do the same . You have to do what works for you . <h> 5 . Your product hunt is over <p> You need to experiment with products to find which ones best suit your hair . There does come a point though when you eventually find your favourites . You can purchase other products because you want to try them out but it is out of curiosity and not out of necessity . You know what works for you and for what reason . For example if your hair feels particularly dry , you know which conditioner to pick out of your arsenal and how long to leave it on your hair for best results . If you need to add oil to your hair , you know which one or which combination to use and how often . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather help it to stay in good condition ( i.e take care of the cuticle and maintain moisture ) . <p> lately ive been washing my hair every other day and my hair has never looked better . its also so much more easy to manage than its ever been , and i think i 'm well on the way to retention . i only finger detangle , so i rarely see breakage and even when i do its very minimal- like only about 3 or 4 hairs , but that breakage stems from my last run with the flat iron when i did n't  comb my hair out straight- and i ended up flat ironing bent angles and curls into my hair which gave it serious weak Read more + <p> All of these apply to me except the patiience part .

Humans shed 50-100 hairs a day . If you are seeing hair on the floor that have a white bulb at the end , that is normal . If you are seeing broken hairs then that is breakage .

However , I am deeply aware that for most consumers when purchasing a product from a company using the words for curly hair , botanical , natural or organic , there is an expectation of many natural unadulterated ingredients . <p> However I would urge you not to trust labels as they are often about marketing rather than genuine differences . In this article , - I am taking many firm natural favorites to task . This does NOT mean that they are not good products or do not work well . My aim is to get us all to question what is the definition of natural and does it really matter or do certain products just work well because of their key ingredients ? <p> Consumer Trickery Listing extracts first <p> I really deeply dislike it when extracts , which typically are not more than 1% in content within the product are listed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list and just read it as water . Many extracts are leaf , bark and fruit-based and if they were present in high amounts , you should expect the product to have a green or brown tinge to it but often hair products are in the white to cream spectrum . Many companies list extracts first as they give the product a perception of being more natural it is much more attractive to read organic peppermint extract , organic chamomile than it is to read C14-C16 olefin sulfonate yet it is the latter that is actually the key ingredient and that you should really know about to assess whether the product works . <p> Repeat after me Water must always be the first ingredient in a water based conditioner let this be your mantra .

@@72561613 @1261613/ <h> 5 of The Best and Worst Detangling Tools for Fine Natural Hair <p> This is a very subjective post but I feel that I am an authority on the subject of detangling fine hair because I have a lot of it . It takes ages to detangle and I have been in this game for over 10 years , constantly trying different things . Now , were talking fine individual strands , not overall hair density . I am also skipping out finger detangling . I fully endorse it . It is the best thing ever , but if you have limited time , it will not work . So- here 's the list starting from best to worst : <p> 1 . Hercules S+gemann Magic Star comb <p> Taking its rightful place in first position ( I really can not sing the praises of this comb enough ) is the Hercules S+gemann ! It is a seamless , rubber comb that unlike the flexible combs and brushes touted to be less damaging is completely stiff ! It is the closest that a comb will take you to finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like your fingers , stopping wherever the hair is too tangled to proceed . It works well on dry or wet detangling . Ita not as beneficial in the mini or jumbo rake size for clumping curls , but my hair does not clump , so I do n't  care . If your hair does clump , there are smaller combs from the same manufacturer that could work post-detangling . <p> It is cheap and cheerful but not often seamless . You should pay close attention to the finish of the teeth , skipping those that are raggedy and avoid those with decorative painted tips since that paint will chip over time. - I found that shower combs unlike the Hercules S+gemann , are not that great on dry hair , but conditioner combing is easy breezy . <p> Sitting right in the middle of the rankings is the Goody ouchless comb . It is seamless , but a little strange as the teeth have no points and are rod-like . Additionally , - the spine of the comb is flexible . I have managed to break this comb twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better than a shower-comb , but it costs more . <p> We are now entering into the devils territory . I have yet to find a brush that will not split my fine hair and the Denman D3 did not disappoint . It was stealthy too , because at first , it works beautifully especially with conditioner combing as it has nice firm well shaped bristles and decent spacing . However , a week or two later , I had split ends galore . Some naturals modify the Denman by taking out some of the teeth and say it works just as well without splitting . This was not my experience . I do not think this brush is badly made , I just think it does not suit fine hair . Medium and thick strands.go for it ! <p> This shredder wreaked havoc on my fine strands . Mid shaft splits , split ends , breakage .. all within just two detangling sessions . The claim is that the flexible teeth work to stop hair breakage , but I experienced- the exact opposite with horrific immediate breakage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made- and some were rough and snaggle prone . I know some naturals love the tangle teezer but if you have fine hair , steer clear . On a positive note , it works wonderfully on a long haired cat ! <p> I totally agree ! ! I also have fine 4ab strands , &amp; I quit using my Denman . Damn thing . I called it THE SHREDDER ripped out my hair even after I removed teeth &amp; rows . I use a Magic Star jumbo rake &amp; the mini LONG ... Excellent for detangliing without ripping ! What kind of Bass do you use ? <p> I 've always used a paddle brush mainly because I wore weaves and eventually when it came time for my natural hair it was the only brush I had . I used it in the shower occasionally separating in 4 sections and brush from the ends up after I apply my conditioner and just brush all of it while I rinse .. Head full of 4A natural hair ( in between apl &amp; bsl ) and I 've been wearing quick weaves/sew-ins for least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never from my paddle brush . <p> I 've heard wonderful raves about the Hercules comb , but are they really that much better than the bone seamless combs ? I have several bone combs , but I 've been exclusively finger detangling for a year . I think I need to change my routine , because I 'm not seeing the length retention I expect . So I 'm wondering , is the Hercules comb better than the bone combs ? <p> This comb is the TRUTH . I bought the combo pack that has the Jumbo ( pictured above ) and the mini version . I also bought the HS13620 Detangling Styler Comb . It gives and little more of a finished look and detangles a little more deeply . The combs have no seems , they glide through your hair , and are antistatic and super sanitary . They do n't  react with anything and they are very sturdy ( which I need because I have broken three combs in the past ) . After two uses , I have noticed little to no hair come out during detangling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tangle teezer . I know a lot of girls claim that it broke their hair off . It actually helped me . Cuz with combs I had a tendency to just pull it through rough tangle areas . With the teezer it made me stop and concentrate on these rough areas . But I only used it after I had washed . I used rhassoul clay as as **30;1773;TOOLONG . So I never have to detangler my hair because the clay stretched it . I use the teezer to clump my curls when I want ultra defined twist outs . Also I went from shoulder length Read more + <p> Depends on your hair &amp; how you use it . I do what tc said . Use the Sagemann first , then the Teezer or use the Teezer with a head full of condish.Another way is to section the hair into manageable sections &amp; use the Teezer on each section with or without condish . My brother uses his on his beard . I had to get him his own because he tried mine once &amp; then kept stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumbs down for saying this , but I ca n't help but feel like the finger detangling craze , is just that , a craze . Much like the Denman and tangle teezers had their run a few years ago . I 'm not saying that finger detangling is awful . On the contrary , I believe in it and use it myself . But only as the first line of defense in a series of tools ( including a modified Denman ) aimed to detangle . here 's my take : I exclusively detangled early in my hair journey literally spending up to 8 hours detangling on any Read more + <p> When you finger detangled , did you use an oil ? I had the same problem the first time I finger detangled , but then I used coconut oil and it worked out pretty well ( afterwards I put on a shower cap and allowed the oil to penetrate my strands over night ) .

Sometimes I use a Ouidad Double Detangler , a very large heavy wicked looking comb with a double row of teeth about an inch apart . <p> The key to detangling is not to allow my hair to become tangled and gnarly in the first place . However , when Im lazy and slip , the only tools I use are my fingers and shears ( for those gnarly knots ) . Ive been finger detangling for so long , that my hair pretty much remains clumped until I physically separate them . I may need to cut three ( or fewer ) knots in any given session .

But once I learned about finger detangling , I have n't felt the need to use any comb in my fine kinky hair ( except when using curlformers or roller setting , which I rarely do ) . <p> I have fine 4a/b hair and the tangle teezer was a godsend for me .

@@72561616 @1261616/ <h> Getting From TWA to BSL : The Skills You Need to Master <p> There are many naturals searching for the perfect regime and set of products , often turning to other naturals to adopt what appear to be successful routines . However , hair has different requirements depending on how long it is , so it is actually not wise to follow the regime of someone with very long hair when your length is shorter . The skills that you have to maintain your hair at a TWA are different from those you require when it is 5 years old and getting to BSL or longer . Here is my guide to the skill set that you can master at every length : <p> While hair is short it is easily styled as a wash and go giving you the opportunity to see how your hair shrinks , whether it forms curled spirals or not and whether or not it is the type that will progressively get drier when left open . Kinkier and finer hair textures will be more prone to breakage at this stage because hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair when wet and dry is a key skill that helps to prevent breakage . <p> Key Mistake : One skill that you really can not learn at the short hair phase is detangling . In general , most short hair will be detangled very easily especially if you choose to conditioner comb . You are unlikely at this stage to experience severe tangling or knotting unless you dry comb hair . Never carry on the detangling method of short hair to longer hair stages without reassessing if it really works for the length . <p> 2 . The awkward mid length stage ( 6-9 inches ) <p> Skills to learn : -Detangling Styling -Damage prevention <p> The time to master detangling is at the mid length stage when hair is long enough to form complex knots and tangles especially during a shampoo and conditioner wash . This will be the stage when you learn whether or not you can wash your hair free or if you need to place it into twists or braids to control it . You will also learn if you prefer to dry detangle prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn too if you need to finger comb exclusively or if you can continue to use your comb or brush . <p> Styling will also come to the forefront as you will learn whether or not your hair needs protective styling . You will soon learn what styles suit you and which ones work when you need to be fast or when hair is not fully dry . <p> Key Mistake : The main error that many naturals make at this stage is over use of heat and over stretching hair . At this stage hair will be a nice full shoulder length but shrinkage may make it look exactly the same as a TWA or neck/ear length . This tempts many to straighten hair more often than they did before or be more aggressive when stretching hair out . This can cause cumulative damage that eventually causes breakage and prevents hair getting into the next phase . Damage prevention is therefore a key skill that should be gained at this stage . <p> Once your hair starts grazing APL , the one fact that you should clutch firmly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have much more difficulty maintaining moisture than it did when it was shorter as it probably has fewer cuticle layers . You may find that products that had no real effect previously e.g using hydrolysed protein may now actually be necessary at every wash to give your hair moisture and strength . You may find that you require more intense conditioning sessions ( with heat or for longer times ) while previously when your hair was short , daily co-washes were enough . You may find that although water and oil was sufficient to moisturise your hair previously , you now require a leave in with humectants to help you . <p> Key Mistake : The main error of the long hair phase is not wanting to trim hair . Naturally if you have been careful with your hair at the awkward phase , you will have less damage and less need for trims . However if your hair naturally breaks easily or you constantly see split ends , get into a dusting or trimming routine that works for you . <p> Ladies , what skills did you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 87940 @qwx707940 <p> This article was very helpful .

I would also add to the APL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fine , naturally porous strands in the back ( always have ; I do n't  use heat , combs , or chemicals ; I finger detangle and protectively style , as well as deep condition and do protein treatments ) .

Protein followed by moisturizing conditioner has also helped . <p> I realise that the aloe vera in my spritz bottle is the key to pre-detangle my hair , then i detangle it with KCKT which i found has truly save time on detangling . I can do it in 10-20min in 4 sections , it really is a breeze compared to coconut oil or other conditioner/leave in. 
@@72561617 @1261617/ <h> 5 Ways to Protect Your Hair While Swimming <p> Summer is here in its full glory and many of us will be dashing to the ocean to cool off or kicking our swimming exercise routines into full speed . The worry many naturals have is how best to protect hair while swimming . This article is all about the science of what can happen to your hair while swimming and how you can minimise damage . <h> The Water <p> 1 . Ocean water The main risk with ocean water is salt water drying on hair . The salt residue can make hair feel and be drier than it should be . In general rinsing hair ( and skin for that matter ) post swim is enough to prevent this.2 . Pool water The general risk to hair is chlorine as well as potential acidity of water although well maintained pools will generally keep pH to a level between 6-7 . Chlorine can affect hair by dissolving the oil that keeps the cuticle layers together ( J Soc Cosmet Chem , pp 359-370 , 1987 ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water with hair which is detailed further below . <h> Minimising Damage <h> 1 . Keep it in perspective <p> Even the most active swimmers do manage to maintain their hair I am talking about professional swimmers spending 4-6 hours per day every day in a swimming pool . In that group there are those whose hair does not need extra attention and there are those whose hair does need extra care . The main thing to take home is that you can maintain beautiful hair and still enjoy swimming . Do not worry excessively about damage . <p> The second part of keeping it in perspective is styling your hair for swimming . Do not use twists if they unravel easily or mesh when wet . Do not go for free hair if it shrinks heavily and will require a lot of gentle manipulation and time to style post swim . Pick a style that will allow you to move easily from wet hair to styled hair post swim ( i.e a style that you can work with when hair is damp ) . <h> 2 . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously talked about the acidity level in water and in general most public swimming pools will not tell you how acidic the water is . However if a pool is badly maintained you will be able to see it and smell it . Chlorinated pools generally are a pale blue in colour and the scent of chlorine is generally not overpowering . A badly maintained pool will generally have a green or yellow tinge to the water and often the chlorine smell hangs heavy in the air . My advice is to always look at the water and avoid swimming in badly maintained pools ( noting that good chlorination and filtration is essential for killing germs in the pools ) . <h> 3 . Protect your hair before swimming <p> With chlorinated water you are aiming to minimise the amount of water contacting your hair . The techniques commonly used to do this include minimising water entry using a penetrating oil such as coconut oil , wetting your hair before you get into the pool ( give it 15 minutes to full absorb ) and applying barriers to the hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mineral oil , silicones ) . Some swimmers like to apply hair conditioner but in my view , this is a very weak protection as most hair conditioners are very soluble in water and will wash off in the water . <h> 4 . Wear a swim cap <p> Swim caps in general can not keep off all water away from hair , but they do protect hair from the full onslaught of the water . For swimmers wearing extensions or with locs , a BGLH reader recommendation is my swim cap which is a larger adjustable cap . <p> The idea is not to keep your hair dry but simply minimise contact with the water and avoid the water rubbing against your hair as you move through the water . <h> 5 . Take care of your hair post swim <p> Take the time to really rinse your hair after swimming . Rinsing is the most underestimated procedure but it does help get rid of a lot of chlorine/salt water before it has a chance to dry or bind to your hair .

As always , I hope this topic will help she 'd some light on a popular topic not only in the natural hair community , but , well , almost every hair community . <p> FRIZZWHAT EXACTLY IS IT ? <p> I define it , in simple terms , flyaway hair that has been lifted from the normal curl , wave , or coil . Its the hair that , so to speak , goes against the grain of the masses. What it is not , is - hair that is naturally curly , wavy or coily paired next to a picture of the same person with straightened hair . Its where hair that normally clumps , waves - or coils fail to do so . You may also experience frizz when shorter pieces of hair separate from the normal curls , waves or coils . See my examples below of my hair when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( because humectants attract moisture to the hair it can cause swelling which causes the hair to dry and frizz . Its best to use products that contain humectants as leave ins during cooler months ) <p> Over manipulation and constant touching of the hair ( guilty me ! ) <p> FRIZZ .. WHAT CAN HELP ? <p> Go easy when styling the hair . When undoing styles such as twists for twist outs or braids for braid outs , be sure to coat hands lightly with a butter or oil to minimize frizz . <p> Check your ingredients and be mindful of humectants during warmer and hot months . If you do use products containing humectants , you can follow up by using anti humectants such as products or raw ingredients such as ; shea butter , mango butter , castor oil , coconut oil , olive oil , to name a few . <p> Try to eliminate excessive HIH ( Hand In Hair ) Syndrome .. that 's a hard one for me too <p> Keep hair moisturized . Check out my step by step on a moisturizing tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly moisturized . <p> Step 2 3 : Working in sections ( if the hair is long enough ) apply moisturizer to your hair making sure to coat each strand . Then apply an oil , butter or your- Natty Butter- to seal/lock in moisture . <p> Step 3 : Be sure to moisturize your edges and ends as well . They can become dry and brittle leading to breakage <p> Step 4 : Twist , braid or apply any protective style of your choice . Nice moisturized , sealed and protected hair . I wear my hair in this manner throughout the week allowing me to retain moisture , minimize breakage and retain length due to its low manipulation . <p> Step 6 : When unraveling for styling , be sure to apply some butter or oil to your hair to undo any style . This way , you minimize the amount of frizz and friction caused . AND , as a bonus , you may get a few days worthy of rocking your favorite style ! <p> For the most part , I experience low frizz by following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicing low manipulation styles . Keep in mind , though , even keeping hair in protective styles such as braids and twists for a long period of time can create not only frizz but the potential for the hair to loc . As mentioned above , I make sure when unraveling my twists , I apply my Natty Butter onto my hands , rub in to melt , then unravel my twists or braids for a great twist out .

@@72561619 @1261619/ <h> Curl Activator Gel : Old School Product , 3 Brand New Uses <p> In the 1970s and 80s the Jheri curl was in and the wet look was perfected with curl activator gel of course . Unfortunately , many people still link curl activator to this wet look and avoid it as a result . However , it can be a very useful product especially if your hair is prone to dryness , the key is simply to know how much to use and when . <p> 1 . Using Curl Activator as a Moisturiser There are two tricks of the trade in getting curl activator to work as a moisturiser . The first is you need to apply it to hair that has some water on it . This can be wet , damp or misted hair . The water is essential to stop the product just sitting on hair and giving it a greasy look . The second trick is to use very little of the product . The more you load on , the more wet your hair will stay and therefore look . Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , focus on spreading it thinly and evenly . You can use additional products such as oil or if you wish another moisturiser over the curl activator . <p> The Downside : Curl activator does induce shrinkage and if you are keen to wear your hair in a stretched out style , it is best to avoid it . If you are however intending to do twists , braids or a tucked in style where shrinkage does not matter , curl activator will be good . <p> 2 . Using Curl Activator to detangle hair Yes , you can use gel to detangle your hair ! As curl activator is not a drying gel and can have good slip , it is possible to use it to detangle your hair . In this case , you can use a lot of the gel to ensure good coverage before either finger detangling or combing . The trick of the trade here is to work in sections and apply the gel onto only the hair you are working on . Twist or braid the detangled section afterwards to cut down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activator is water based , highly water soluble and very easy to rinse off after detangling . The Downside:Curl activator does soften hair and as a result when hair is breaking during detangling , you may not hear a snapping noise at all . Be very careful when finger detangling , combing or brushing to avoid any unnecessary extra force on the hair . Do not repeatedly run the comb through the softened hair , stop detangling once the strands and separated enough . <p> 3 . Using Curl activator as a Curl enhancer If your natural hair forms clumped spiral curls , it is absolutely possible to use the curl activator to enhance those curls . Curl activator is very good at creating shrinkage due to the high water and humectant content . This shrinkage is an essential component in getting the curls to the right conformation to create the clumped spiral so do not fight it . <p> The Downside : Most curl activator gels have very little to no hold . If you would like to keep your clumped curl style for several hours , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . Alternatively , you could use a curl activator gel that tends to dry a little more and has more hold for example ecostyler gel or fantasia ic gel . <p> I have a question . I did n't  do enough research as I should have done and so I went to a salon and used the curl free products they had . Now after researching , I found that the stylist might have used the care free curl chemical re-arranger , does this mean my hair is no longer natural ? I feel so disappointed . I like the curls and everything but I just feel bad thinking my hair wont be kinky anymore . I know the chemical wears out in about 3 months or so but it still leaves hair a bit straightened .

@@72561621 @1261621/ <h> 2 Ways To Prevent Combing Damage and Breakage <p> There are many challenges with natural hair and often when polled naturals are most concerned with two things dry hair and finding the perfect hair conditioner/conditioning routine . Combing damage rarely makes the top of the list but yet it is the one factor that causes the greatest amount of breakage and is responsible for stagnant hair length . <p> Combing is a necessity if you wish to have free natural hair but it certainly needs to be carried out carefully and purposefully . This is the get smart guide to combing and how to avoid the two main damage culprits . <h> 1 . How to stop unnecessary fraying of your hair <p> The Damage : - The more times you comb your hair , the more stress you are applying on it physically and therefore the more likely it is to break . Studies on hair also show that combing hair leads to loss of protein which is thought to be small parts of the hair cuticle chipping away . <p> How to identify it : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 months or more ) or hair starts becoming shorter when it has not been trimmed , numerous split ends soon after trimming , mid shaft splits , hair snaps easily with very little stress . <p> The Solutions Reducing the overall need to comb your hair is the most effective method . This means that if you can keep a protective style for 2 weeks , you avoid combing in that time and preserve your hair strands . If you can only keep it for a few days , this is still less burdensome than daily styling . <p> -If you do not already do so , always start with the widest spaced comb before using a finer tool . Finger combing allows more serious tangles to be identified and eases the way for a wide spaced comb to separate the hair strands . Using a brush or finer toothed comb is optional after . Remember that if you can skip a tool , do so , less is more . <p> -Use hair conditioner or a slippery oil to ease friction between your combing tool and your hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> -Once your hair is combed/detangled , stop combing . Keep the hair detangled by twisting it up or proceeding to your style . If you have straightened your hair , do not unnecessarily comb or brush it just because it is easier . Remember each run with a comb is stress and protein loss . <h> 2 . How to avoid forming complex knots <p> The Damage : - Complex knots form as a result of several hair strands intertwining against themselves . These complex knots are unique to kinky curly hair simply because the twists in the hair allow this interaction to happen . Complex knots often have to be cut out so that hair can be combed freely once more . <p> How to identify it : - Complex knots are obvious and difficult to avoid completely . You should be concerned however if you need to cut out several knots ( 10 or more ) on a regular basis ( every time you detangle , every time you wash ) <p> The Solutions -Never pile your hair while washing it and if your hair has many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted or braided sections will greatly help reduce the ability of the free hair to interact and form a complex knot . <p> -Prevent your hair from shrinking fully if you are not intending to wear your hair short ( i.e- - intentionally keeping a TWA ) . The more strands can intertwine , the more they can form complex knots and shrunken hair is the perfect way to encourage knots . <p> -Never comb dry hair aimlessly . If you are in a hurry to style , it would be better to avoid combing all together rather than randomly pick at sections of your hair . Opt instead to finger comb lightly and go for an easy style such as bun or puff which is more forgiving- - for hair that has not been thoroughly detangled . Remember that accessories can easily change the look of a hair style . <p> Ladies , do you experience breakage when you comb your hair ?

Are you tired of breakage , unable to get products to work well or do you have unexplained shedding ?

However before you pull out the scissors , consider this : <p> 1 . Your hair may not be that damaged It is a rare thing to have 3-4 inches of split ends without having in some way severely abused the hair . Think , regular high heat , bleaching or regular super rough detangling where you hear strands popping every pass of the comb . If you have not done this , then the likelihood of having inches upon inches of damaged hair is quite low . Your problems with breakage ( which some people mistake for shedding ) may actually be more of procedural issues such as finding the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may require more/less protective styling . <p> 2 . Even if your hair is damaged , it may be possible to hold on to the length If you are certain that your hair is irreparably damaged , it may still be possible to keep the length and over the next few months do strategic cuts to get rid of the damage . Keeping the length of damaged hair is a good exercise in learning to handle damaged fibres and therefore learn how to be very gentle to your hair . The extra length will also come in handy when it comes to achieving some styles . <p> 3 . You may simply just be frustrated Picture the scene Over the course of several months you have tried and failed to achieve a particular goal whether it is growing hair to a particular length or cutting down on detangling time or reducing tangling of hair .

Analyse whether you should protective style and what style you should pick If you have been living in protective styles kept in for weeks at a time and see no progress in the length of your hair , you need to consider changing the type of style that you are doing and the time you spend in that style . For example , twists are almost always the go to style for many naturals but they can be terrible for high shrinkage hair that is washed frequently , braids are a better option . Equally , some hair can actually benefit from little to no protective styling . If you can wear your hair open and have no real need to detangle it on a daily basis , protective styling may not be for you at all . <p> 5 .

I would skip the pre-poo , and run straight into the shower and proceed to douse and detangle my hair with half a bottle of Aussie Moist ( the big bottle ) . This worked for a while ; until I got tired of buying a new bottle of Aussie every week . I started realizing that my hair was n't retaining as much moisture and would still feel a little parched even after deep conditioning . After a little brainstorming and evaluation , I reached the conclusion that my hair was feeling wack because I stopped pre-pooing . <p> So I started back up and my hair has been on point ever since . <p> Before I get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little and break it down : <p> Pre-Poo : A pre-shampoo treatment consisting of- a water-based conditioner , oil , or DIY blend that is applied to the hair before washing . Pre-poo treatments can sit on the hair anywhere from 20 minutes to overnight , depending on the hairs needs . Your preferences , hair type , and hair needs will dictate what ingredients or products you pre-poo with . <p> Often times , not pre-pooing can be to blame for some of hairs biggest problems breakage , dryness , brittle ends , rough-feeling hair , and uncontrollable frizz .

Pre-poo treatments ( when done with oils , conditioners , or DIY blends that penetrate the hair ) restore hydration levels in the hair and help prevent moisture loss during washing . The end result ? Hair that does n't  feel stripped after it has been cleaned . <p> Improved Styling- <p> Because pre-poo treatments help the hair hold on to more moisture , styles come out infinitely better than they would have otherwise . Whether it be a twist-out or a wash and go , hair that maintains proper moisture levels always comes out better.Wash and gos are less frizzy , and kinks , curls and coils will clump together for improved definition .

Right now , since the sun is out more and temperatures are warming up ( while the air remains dry ) , I 'm combining the Infusium- with conditioners for double duty benefits . <p> Lastly , a few pre-poo tips : <p> Oil pre-poo treatments should sit for a minimum of 30-45 minutes , but work best when done overnight to allow enough time for full penetration . <p> Kill two birds with one stone and use your pre-poo product to gently detangle your hair . <p> Pre-poo with heat or steam for added conditioning benefits when possible . <p> Have fun !

@@72561633 @1261633/ <h> What are Silicones and are they Good for Your Hair ? <p> There are a lot of- great hair products- available to help us achieve the perfect do . However , it does make you wonder if you can put too much stuff on your hair ? Do certain ingredients build up over time ? Silicone is a very commonly used hair care ingredient . so let 's take a closer look at how it works . <h> How do silicones work ? <p> While often maligned , silicones are actually one of the most effective ingredients in both hair and skin care products . Silicones work by covering hair with a thin hydrophobic ( waterproof ) coating . This coating serves several purposes : <p> Reduces the porosity of the hair , which makes it less likely to absorb humidity ( Which is why its great for smoothing and straightening ! ) <p> Reduces moisture loss from the inside of the hair ( Great for conditioning . ) <p> Lubricates the surface of the hair so it feel smoother and combs easier ( Makes your hair feel slippery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your hair ? <p> It really depends on the type of silicone . There are several different silicones used in hair care that exhibit different properties . <p> Cyclomethicone- is one of the most commonly used silicones in hair care . Its a volatile silicone , which means it evaporates and wont build up on your hair . It gives a silky , smooth feel and leaves the hair with incredible slip when wet and is found in both leave-on and rinse-off products . <p> Dimethicone Copolyol- is a water-soluble , lightweight silicone that provides very little buildup . It is often used in conditioning shampoos . <p> Amodimethicone- ( or silicones that have " amo " , " amine " or " amino " in their name ) is a different kind of silicone that is chemically modified to stick to your hair better . That means it conditions well but it can also be more challenging to remove . Amodimethicone is commonly used in leave-in conditioners . <p> Dimethicone- is sometimes referred to as a silicone oil . Dimethicone coats hair , providing great shine and conditioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insoluble , it can be difficult to remove . - Additionally , this heavy coating is more likely to attract dirt and pollutants from the air , making the hair feel weighed down. - Dimethicone is often found in serums and other leave-on products . <h> How can I deal with buildup ? <p> Wash your hair ! Any decent shampoo will wash away silicone . However , if you are a heavy user or products containing silicone ( particularly those with dimethicone ) , you may have to lather , rinse and repeat . If you want the benefits of silicone without the weight , look for lightweight silicones , as mentioned above , like cyclomethicone and dimethicone copolyol . These ingredients wont build up but still give you some conditioning and shine benefits . <h> Bottom Line <p> I personally find the benefits of silicones to far outweigh any negatives . Silicones are very effective conditioners , provide great shine and can help smooth and straighten hair . If you are concerned about buildup and weigh down , be sure to look at the label to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use them the " lighter " ones do n't  do enough good , and the heavier ones weigh my hair down too much .

And , while Angela seems to have been blessed with very strong hair , the fragility of many black womens hair ( including mine ! ) prevents them from attempting weaves without causing significant damage to edges and ends . <p> The bigger question ( for us , anyway ) is if Angela Simmons , and the many celebrities who are flaunting their real hair these days , have such strong and long natural hair , why natural styles are never an option ? <p> We appreciate and applaud that celebrities ( from Toya Carter to Keke Palmer to Lil Mama to Christina Milian ) are revealing healthy natural hair beneath their weaves , but we also wonder why its only good enough for a quick Instagram photo here or there , and not to rock on the red carpet like our girl Teyonah Parris : 87940 @qwx707940 <p> Not every critic is hater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they please and I do think her hair is really pretty but I really do n't  get just showing pics on instagram and never being photographed publicly .

All that manipulation is TRAGIC on the ends . Its not so much hiding as it is a versatility measure . And remember not all stylists know how to handle natural hair <p> Truth is , no one has to explain their hair choices . Maybe she has to protect her hair from herself . I know I do because when Im stressed I pull . No one knows what shes doing from day to day .

For some of us there is the transition , for some we 're dealing with medium length hair that does n't past the arm pits , for some it 's learning to handle all that hair , because it 's so super longbut still there are those , like myself that have the TWA . Our hair is super short , but there are still things to be mindful of . <h> 1 . Moisturize Daily <p> Moisture is key in hair growth . You ca n't expect hair to grow that has never been wanted . Think of your hair as a plant fiber , if that plant is n't watered , it 's not growing .. same with our hair . It needs some moisture . Good sources are water , aloe vera juice , or you can see some suggestions here . Also note that , while the TWA is the shortest hair of the bunch , it 's actually the most dry . The moisture dissipates very quickly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tresses are feeling supple . <h> 2 . You Still Need to Protect the Ends ! <p> So yes , the main thing about having a TWA is not worrying about it brushing against the collar of our shirts , or brushing against rough materials , but friends , let 's face itwe ALL sleep ! At night , a TWA rocker can do so much damage . If you 're sleeping without protecting your hair , watch out ! You 'll soon see serious damage . Point is , even though our hair is very short , we must keep it protected to keep the longevity of it . See my post on protecting the hair at nights <h> 3 . Co-Wash and Clarify Washes <p> No matter what you do , you must cleanse your scalp and your hair .

I was going to do the transition for another 6 months but having relaxed hair and natural was a MONSTER ! So , off with my hair I went. Read more + <p> I cant twist my TWA .

@@72561641 @1261641/ <h> How to Reduce Breakage in 4B/C Natural Hair <p> Last weeks post on how to breakage proof hair brought up a question on the tiny wisps , coils or cs . If your hair has tight curls and is kinky , you will almost definitely have seen these tiny little bits of hair . If you have not , then try to wear a white t-shirt or cover your shoulders with a white towel the next time you are detangling . These tiny wisps are indeed a form of breakage which can be greatly reduced but not prevented altogether . Here is why : 1 . No action needed : Tiny wisps as a normal feature As stated in the introduction , if your hair is kinky and has tight curls , this type of breakage is a feature . You can almost always be able to get a few wisps simply by running your hand down your hair . The reason for this is that kinky hair is just more susceptible to this type of breakage . You can read a more detailed breakdown here . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c-shaped coils when you run your hand over your hair , you should not worry much , it is not serious . <p> 2 . Breakage reduction : Tiny wisps seen during dry handling ( combing or styling ) If you see a breakage collection of over 10 tiny c-shaped coils when you comb ( including finger combing ) or style your hair , then you should be concerned about breakage . Some common reasons for seeing multiple small c-shaped curls include <p> -Overdetangling : I can seriously recommend that everyone should read Genieces piece on why some natural hair really just does not need to be detangled such that you can run a comb through from root to tip several times . In some cases it is counterproductive and encourages your hair ends which are repeatedly combed to break off . <p> -Rough handling : Please remember that no matter how gentle you think you are , your hair is the judge . Many finger combers think they are gentle by default but this is not true . If you are seeing many tiny little wisps , then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently and reconsider what you are using to make your hair more flexible ( sometimes oil is not enough , a mist of water or a little conditioner may be needed to make hair flexible ) . <p> -Heat use : I still remember the days in the salon when I would have my hair blow dried and see a million little curls on the floor and thought it was normal . Of course , I also thought neck length was normal too . If you see these tiny curls when using a heat tool even at low heat , consider the fact that your hair perhaps is not suited to heat treatment . <p> -Lack of moisture : Simply dipping your hands in water and running them over your hair prior to styling can really help in terms of making your hair just flexible enough for styling without creating unnecessary shrinkage . This little bit of flexibility will help to counter breakage as the hair is able to bend and twist more easily for manipulation . <p> In practice , it is more common to see breakage in long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling . This is because water changes the balance between flexibility and strength of hair . More water means greater flexibility but a matching decrease in strength allowing the hair to break easily closer to the root when tugged . If you do see tiny wisps during wet handling or conditioner combing the most likely reason is that you are repeatedly combing the same area too many times . If you have only done 2-3 passes and end up with breakage , consider perhaps that your hair is no longer suited to conditioner combing . You may need to try a drier method for example undiluted conditioner without wetting hair with water prior to application or a mix of conditioner and oil or using oil on its own . I do not encourage using protein treatments as they are just a temporary fix to breakage , finding the real mechanical cause will help to make length retention the norm . <p> hi , I love your website ! its always so helpful ! ! !

Yee ! <p> Thank you for mentioning overdetangling . I did this last month when I was wearing a stretched-out style ( braidout updo ) . Normally I finger-detangle but in an attempt to make sure my coils were completely combed out prior to styling I took , in order , a shower comb , a slightly-less wide-toothed comb , and a Denman brush to my hair ( which was wet and had been soaking in heavy , creamy conditioner for at least 30 minutes ) .

I have found a hairdresser that i trust and I get my ends dusted every 8-10 weeks . My breakage is pretty much non-existent , just the odd shed hair . I really feel like that has attrubuted to my hair growing thicker and stronger . I finger detangle my 4C hair every day with the odd occasion where I 'm feeling fancy and feel like using a wide tooth comb . I would say the finger detangling/dusting has definitely reduced the amount of breakage that I experience . But every head of hair is different you just have Read more + <p> I agree with regular trims I see reduced breakage but I think with hair that is both kinky and fine rather than medium or thick it is much harder to avoid this breakage because finer hair can break much more easily <p> I like that you mentioned gently finger detangling just a little bit ever day . <p> Most articles warn against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having my hands in my fine hair . However , I find that if I do a bit of light finger-detangling every day ( with a bit of a light oil , like grapeseed or coconut ) , then I have less major tangles come wash day . <p> My 3c hair likes to tangle at the ends , and I find that detangling a little bit every day helps to stop some tangles before they get even bigger . <p> The only time I haven seen fewer of those Cs and wisp are back earlier this year when I was moisturizing my hair like every other day . In the summer during high humidity I see less wisps too . I think mine are moisture related more so than anything else . Its hard with fine hair to draw the line at what is too much product wise .

Detangling on DAMP hair with coconut , olive , grapeseed Read more + <p> Yes . I usually add the oil first to avoid hydral fatigue ( over absorption of water , causing damage to the cuticle ) and then add the water . Doing it in this order is what makes it a pre-poo for me and not just another moisturizing session . When I used to put the water before the oil I noticed that the oil was n't coating my hair as well . <p> I use this rule ( sometimes I break it ) Do n't  handle your hair with any tools unless it is wet . This rule has helps me stave off some serious damage . However , if I do comb my hair while its dry , I do detangle with my hands first then I comb in sections . <p> I handle breakage on my 4c by keeping my hair moisturized and starting at the very , very ends of my hair . I adopted Naptural85s method of detangling ( pushing down hair at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every pass ) . Those little " wisps " are most likely little curls that wrap around the brush/finger or knots at the ends because 4b/c hair is super curly at the ends . Moisturizing the hair and smoothing out the ends is key for me . <p> I use both combs and brushes . I use combs to untangle tangled hair . I use brushes for styling and a more thorough detangling . I only do this with damp hair with conditioner in it . This method has been really great for me . So on wash day ( one to three times a week ) , I shampoo and condition .

@@72561642 @1261642/ <h> 8 Ways to Combat Dry Ends <p> What causes dry ends ? Sebum is the hair and scalps natural conditioner. - In straight hair , this oily substance can generally move down the shaft to the ends fairly easily because of the direct path. - The hairs close proximity to the scalp as well as continual brushing and combing also aid in the transport process . As for textured hair ? That is another story . <p> The coilier your hair , the harder it is for sebum to travel down to the ends. - Heres my analogy : Imagine oil running along a straight road versus a path full of turns and twists . In the latter case , the oil may slow down or even get caught at each curve . By the time it reaches its destination , only a fraction of the oil will remain . There is also the possibility that it may never reach its destination . This process is basically what curly , coily , and kinky hairs experience . Additionally , factor in a minimal brushing/combing routine and the reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands up and out away from the scalp ) . We ultimately have a case in which sebum just barely reaches the ends of our hair , if at all . <p> Now the explanation above is just- one- of many causes of dry ends . Other reasons are listed in this post- on moisture and length retention . <p> How do you stop dry ends ( due to inadequate sebum ) ? Since sebum may barely , if at all , reach the ends of textured hair , it is necessary to quench and condition those ends . Here are some methods that work for me and may hopefully work for others : <p> 1 . Discard harsh regular shampoos Shampoos with SLS and other strong ingredients strip my hair ( including my ends ) of their natural oils . The shampoo I use on a regular basis contains more gentle substances . Other options to explore are conditioner washing or using homemade natural cleansers instead of a shampoo . Some people also do a treatment with oil at a warm or room temperature prior to washing to minimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot oil treatments . ) <p> 2 . Lather once when you shampoo Minimal lathering equals minimal loss of whatever sebum is on my ends . <p> 3 . No direct shampoo on the ends I rarely expose my ends to direct shampoo . I just focus on the scalp and let the water and lather run down the rest of my hair . <p> 4 . Saturate the ends with moisture and conditioner Pay the most attention to your ends while conditioning and moisturizing . <p> 5 . Invest in good products Each individual head of hair is different , but this- post- may be a place to start in terms of what sealants , moisturizers , and conditioners to try . <p> 6 . Eat foods containing omega-3 and vitamin A Few people realize that foods , such as salmon , cantaloupe , and flaxseeds contribute to sebum production . For the omega-3 post , click- here .

Cheers <p> Its hard to work out if I 'm low or high porosity even after reading that article some time ago . My hair is 4c , fine and dense . When washed it takes about 5 mins to get wet fully . It dries within about an hour after being wet . When air dried , it dries rough and extremely dry . I have never tried lightly blow drying . I find that if I oil rinse , my hair often dries softer than if I just use deep cons . Deep cons do not easily penetrate my hair .

I think its a better gauge than hair typing . Once I discovered I have low-porosity hair , I switched up my regimen and realized I did n't  need to close my cuticles with cool water after conditioning ( which is normally recommended ) . Now I use a warm water rinse to open my cuticles so that my leave-in can better penetrate my strands and that has been a miracle for me . Also , the Cherry Lola Treatment has been great for my hair <p> I have low porosity hair and I 've tried a modified " cherry lola treatment .

I use a mud wash to cleanse and apple cider vinegar to clarify . I also spritz my hair with water and seal with jojoba/castor/argan oil mix daily . My ends are much happier now . <p> Mud washes are wonderful . I use it 1 a month to give my hair a treat . Terresentials was the bomb.com but I refuse to buy anymore because of that dang shipping .

I spray and seal usually every other night . I think finding what oils and products work for YOUR hair is key . <p> I started going to a trichologist after reading a book called " 7 Myths about black hair .

I remember reading that in The Science of Black Hair . I often use tea tree essential oil on my scalp if I have to use anything to combat any irritation .

Every day , there seems to be a new set of " rules " for naturals to abide by and it seems like the more we understand about our hair , the more obscure those rules become . Do n't  worry I 'm not here to trick you into believing that you need to hang upside down off the side of your bed for 20 minutes every night to stimulate scalp circulation , or to coat your hair in bacon grease for extra moisture and shine . I 'm simply here to suggest that there are certain practices we naturals sometimes skip ( I 'm guilty of many of these too ) , to the detriment of our hair . <p> With folks running around working overtime , in school , raising families , running businesses and others professing themselves to be " lazy " naturals , cutting corners in hair care is bound to happen . Here are five habits to get out of before its too late : <h> 1 . Set It &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of infomercials in my day ) . For many naturals , especially those transitioning , wigs and weaves are a go-to style . Unfortunately , some of us become so concerned with the hair on the outside that we forget allllllll about the hair underneath . By far , wigs are the best protective style to wear . But all that protection is for naught if your actual hair becomes dry , brittle , and breaks from neglect . Even worse ( and more gross ) , dirt , sweat and other moisture can become trapped under wigs and weaves and have your scalp smelling like death . So even if you do decide to go the full coverage route , please make time to take care of your natural hair underneath . How frequently you wash , condition , and re-moisturize your hair depends on how much you sweat , among other factors . <h> 2 . Shoddy Wash Jobs <p> The whole point of cleansing hair and scalp is to make sure they 're well , cleanright ? If you have already made up your mind to cleanse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shampoo , sulfate , sulfate-free , apple cider vinegar , baking soda , Aztec healing clay , or anything else be sure to do a thorough job . While it is important to remove buildup from your hair , getting the buildup off of your scalp is equally as important . If you always co-wash , or use a lot of silicone products that are prone to building up , clarifying your hair and scalp regularly is especially important ; so as to not suffocate the follicles . How to best accomplish both without totally stripping your hair is totally up to youand your hair ! - <h> 3 . Skimming on the Conditioner <p> I was also guilty of this one , especially since I began co-washing with the awesomely luxurious Aussie Moist . I figured since I was washing my hair with conditioner , I did n't  need to waste more time conditioning it . There was nothing particularly wrong with my logic per-se , but I did notice that I had to re-moisturize my hair quite frequently . Then a few weeks ago it dawned on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added moisture retention . I began slathering my co-washed tresses with Shea Moistures Raw Shea Restorative Conditioner and havent looked back since . My hair is softer , smoother , and I am not re-moisturizing nearly as frequently . If you moisturize and seal after your co-washes and you are still having trouble retaining moisture , this could be your culprit . If regular conditioning is n't doing it for you , kick it up a notch to deep conditioning or add your favorite oils to your current product and see what happens ! <h> 4 . Half-Hearted Detangling <p> This one scares me the most . I try to detangle , co-wash , and condition my hair weekly but sometimes , I do it a little more frequently . My hair likes to tangle itself just for funsies , and I am deathly afraid that I 'll randomly wake up one morning with one giant dred . I say all this to say if you 're going to detangle your hair , do it right . Be thorough . If you use a wide tooth comb , make sure that comb is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you finger detangle , be especially meticulous . Do n't  do a rush job because you 're tired , or do n't  have enough time . If you do n't  relish cutting knots and chunks of un-detangleable hair off of your hair , commit to quality detangle time . Grab a season of Family Guy or turn on a Law &amp; Order SVU marathon ( my personal preferences ) , and get going . <h> 5 . Not Covering Hair at Night <p> I used to be suuuuuuuuper guilty of this one . Sometimes , you 're just so beat at the end of the day that taking the two , five , ten or twenty minutes required to protect your hair in a scarf or bonnet seems to be an impossible task . Or maybe you just perfected your wash n go routine and want to make sure your curls stay poppin for the rest of the week .

@@72561648 @1261648/ <h> Curl Activator Lotion on Natural Hair ? Why Yes ! <p> As most of my readers already know , I am a 4b with very thick , shoulder-length ( un-stretched ) hair and I am a BIG fan of moisture . <p> I am also a fan of curl activator gels ( like Long Aid Curl Activator gel ) and alcohol-free holding gels ( like Eco Styler ) . When I was transitioning and hunting for an all-day moisturizing product , I gave the jheri curl juice ( in the form of Carefree Curl and S-Curl ) a try , but it was sticky and gummy in my relaxed hair , so I gave it up . As a new natural , I gave S-Curl another try and this whitish liquid of relatively thick consistency worked pretty well when sealed with shea butter . But it was n't a stand alone product and then ( as now ) , I want to have as few products on my hair as possible ( even though I own many , lol ! ) . Last week , I was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the low , low price of $1.25 , so I decided , almost 3 years since my last unfortunate curl juice experience , to give it a shot . And I am so glad that I did ! <p> First off , the product smells really great ! A combination of floral and fruity with a thin-ish consistency and a pinky/orange color . I can apply this to damp hair alone ( or as I prefer , under a curl activator gel ) , bun my hair and have moisturized strands until my next wash 3-5 days later . It has n't  yet ceased to amaze me how smooth my hair ! And it is so soft that it almost seems to be a different texture but not so soft that it breaks easily . The only downside ( for some , not me ) is the frizziness that this causes . But I do n't  mind fly-aways , I love volume , and I embrace the fuzz . If I need to look put together , I simply spritz my hair and smooth the edges of my bun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denman brush . <p> My hair has never retained length so effortlessly before and I have 4-6 hours to spare each week from not braiding/twisting . I had always prepared myself for the inevitable fact that as my natural hair got longer it would be more difficult to manage . I am so happy that , with the time saved thanks to my tension-free bun , and my new favorite curl activator lotion , that is not the case . I spend an hour and a half on my hair per week , tops . From wash to condition , to detangle to moisturizing and bunning . That is a fraction of the time I used to spend on washing and styling for twists ( 6 hours ) . <p> Ladies , have you tried curl activator juice or lotion on your natural hair ?

Fresh off of Valentines Day ( or Singles Awareness Day ) , remnants of love are everywhere : in the form of slowly withering flowers , teddy bears , half-eaten candy , and cancelled dinner plans . Valentines Day , although a commercial holiday with ( what some believe to be ) the sole aim of making money , is still a great time to learn about love . Not just relationship love , friendship love , or family love , but self-love . And what better place to start with love than our hair ? <p> I 've said it several times before , the transitioners journey is a special one . As comforting as it can be to retain or maintain length while the natural hair comes in , it can be a frustrating process that leaves you staring at your scissors , flat-iron , or perm kit more often than not . I 'm here to encourage you to hang in there ! Here are five challenges transitioners often face , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : <p> Challenge #1 Balancing Multiple Textures <p> Of all the challenges , this is the most difficult that transitioners face on a regular basis . When it comes to detangling and cleansing , it seems as though naturalistas with more uniformed textures have an easier time especially with tools like Denman brushes , Tangle Tamers , and more . Even finger detangling can be a challenge for transitioning tresses . Rather than lament on how so-and-so on YouTube makes their detangling process look like a breeze , take stock of your own situation . First of all , get excited about the progress you 've made . Even if you 've only been transitioning for two weeks , you can still see a noticeable change at the roots of your hair . If you 're farther along , check out the cute natural pattern you have coming in . Instead of engaging in deficit thinking ( i.e. what you do n't  have ) , get excited about what 's there . So what if you ca n't rock a wash n go yet ? There are plenty of 100% naturalistas that ca n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles and techniques that allow you to take advantage of your transitioning tresses . In fact , when I rock a satin strip braidout or straw set , no one can even tell that I 'm transitioning and that makes me feel good at times when I 'm frustrated with the multiple texture thing . Find your stride , and keep it moving . <p> Challenge #2 If Only My Curls Looked Like . <p> Stop . Right now . We transitioners loooooooove to spend our time scrutinizing our half-curly/half-straight tresses , while simultaneously oogling the bountifully thick coifs of our favorite bloggers and vloggers . Yes , their manes are gorgeous . Their tresses are fierce . Their color , coils , and kinks are to die for . I understand , believe me , I do . However , worshiping another womans hair while looking at yours in disgust is a recipe for transition failure . See , we transitioners are in prime position to learn a great lesson about hair . Because transitioning is such a long and drawn out process , we have no choice but to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might as well learn to love itright ? As transitioners , we have a wonderful opportunity to embrace our hair on good days , and bad . The texture you have is the texture you 're stuck with you may as well go ahead and love it . Like the old song says : If you ca n't be with the one you love , honey , love the one you 're with. - <p> Challenge #3 Dealing with Damage- <p> As transitioners , we should understand from the outset that a certain amount of our hair is damaged , and predisposed to more damage despite how much we scale back heat use , and how much we protectively style . Transitioning hair is more sensitive . It is more prone to split ends , dryness , and that line of demarcation between new growth and damaged hair is a beast . Transitioner hair tends to be trimmed more frequently . Due to all these factors and more , transitioners should n't expect to retain absurd amounts of length . Once you have accepted this , you can move on to loving your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair is , discover a sense of accomplishment and excitement in finding the best detangling and styling techniques and products that help you minimize hair loss . My post-detangling hairballs are my personal bench mark I am obsessed with making the amount of hair in my hands smaller and smaller . Also , rather than get discouraged every time you do a trim , think of it as making room for newer , healthier hair . <p> Challenge #4 : Backsliding- <p> Over the past year or so , I have noticed a pattern with my hair . It starts trippinnnnnnnn OUT at about the midway point between flat-ironing sessions ( usually 1.5-2 months ) . No style seems right , hair products and tools wont cooperate like they normally do , and detangling seems to be a nightmare . At these particular times in our journey , we transitioners are especially vulnerable . Rather than hunker down and see it through , that flat iron starts to look more appealing . The creamy crack itch begs to be scratched . During these times , it is especially important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place . Maybe it was for a personal challenge . Or perhaps you damaged your hair to the point of no return . Whatever the case may be , continuously reiterate to yourself why you chose to embark on this natural hair journey . I am a visual and tactile/kinesthetic learner , meaning I process information best by seeing , touching/feeling , and doing . So for me , whenever I start feeling frustrated and tempted to prematurely straighten , I go in the annals of my phone and pull up a picture of my hair from January 2012 . It was thin , damaged , breaking , and super unhealthy . Then , I touch or play with some of the curls/coils that have grown in this years time . Usually , that is enough to satiate my desire to straighten , and get me excited about what the future holds for my hair . <p> Challenge #5 Just Cut it Already ! <p> Pressure . So much pressure . On so many of the blogs and on Instagram , I see Natural Hair Deputies prodding and pressuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . I understand , everybody just wants everyone to embrace their God-given texture and rock it boldly . Trust me , I do tooeventually . Somewhere between the urging of others and our own frustrations , reaching for the scissors can be all too tempting . But what we all must keep in mind that the natural hair journey is a marathon for some , and a sprint for others . Everyone must go at a pace that is comfortable for their own progress and success . So do n't  you pick up those scissors unless you 're at a length you 're comfortable with , and you 're ready to make the chop . Otherwise , you are walking someone elses journey and not your own . Stay true to you . <p> What other transitioner challenges have you learned to love your hair through ? 87941 @qwx707941 87940 @qwx707940 <p> My biggest problem is that my hair has multiple textures and trying to find the right styles ( outside of my beloved blowouts ) is a challenge . I tried flat twists/twist out and used perm rods on the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a section of my hair in the back that is more 4b/c with very little curl pattern and the front and sides which have a slight wave into a full curl . Ugh <p> It is SOOOOO nice to realize that I am not the only girl going through this . I really felt all alone because I am not near any peple who can help teach me about my hair in its natural state . I deal with the temptation to backslide too , but it helps the temptation that I could never do a relaxer on my own lls . I do n't  want to cut it all off ( and trust me I have gotten that more than once ) , because I just wish It would grow . Then Theres the issue of having like 4b in the middle Read more + <p> I have a major problem transition right now ; I have seborrheic dermatitis and my hair breaks right from the root because of this , so in certain places I am bold . I have no idea what to do with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing well ( at least the parts that have hair ) but it looks terrible . Does anybody have any clue as to what I should do ? <p> It was actually pretty funny reading these challenges because I 've been transitioning for 2 months and this past week my hair has been driving me completely crazy ! It just does n't  want to do anything . I finally figuring it out . img/img <p> Thanks for this article ! I 'm learning to not be so anxious and enjoy this journey to my natural curls . My plan was to go at least a year before cutting off the relaxed ends and almost pulled about the scissors the other day ! I 'm off the ledge now ! Thanks ! <p> What I am finding to be a challenge is the guilt I feel when thinking of protective styling through a weave install . I feel like I 'm NOT acknowledging the natural code or something . Ive been relaxer free for over a decade now but the time it takes to prepare hair . OMG ! ! ! I 've always loved cleansing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm using rollers and I think I 'm going to try the curlformers . The knots I 'm experiencing are too much for me . At this point , I think Im gon na just braid/weave for a minute to spare my Read more + <p> Hey . Girl do n't  feel bad about using weave . The point of being natural is that you do n't  have chemically processed hair where your hair texture is being altered . It is not anyone business of how you chose to rock your natural . Wearing a sew-in is a protective style as long as you take care of your hair and scalp while wearing the sew in ! ! Do you ! ! <p> LOL at " that line of demarcation is a beast " I find if you apply a thick conditioner direction onto the roots like how you apply a relaxer and smoothing it through to the rest of your hair prior to washing your hair really detangles tight roots and keeps that beast at bay . <p> O.M.G ! ! ! I am going through every challenge in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy .. it is harder and requires more work then I ever imagined . Not to mention all of the extra time you have to put in compared to having relaxed hair . I was actually going to relax my hair when I had reached my 1 year mark .. but reading this articale encourages me to continue . Looked at my old pictures and suprisingly my hair looks as thick as I wanted to when starting my overall hair journey . Loved this ! ! <p> PREACH ! I am going through all of that right now ! Well except the just chop it part . If I did then it would be a long pixie cut and I think I have to round of a face for that . I 'm doing this a step at a time , so I know I have a long journey ahead of me . <p> As a newly natural woman , after thirty-one months of transitioning , I 've dealt with all of these transitioning aspects . But , the important thing is to have patience . Once you are patient , transitioning gets better . 
@@72561653 @1261653/ <h> Dry Hair Solutions : The Baggy Method Explained <p> The baggy method is a moisturising technique that some naturals find effective . In simple terms it involves using a plastic bag ( saran wrap , grocery bag , sandwich bag or plastic shower cap ) to wrap around hair soon after moisturising it to help the hair retain that moisture . The method works by making water which would have otherwise evaporated , condense and stay as a liquid barrier near the hair , ready to be taken up when needed . <h> How does it work ? <p> The moisturising effect of the baggy method is reliant on body heat ( which condenses the water ) and the length of time that the hair is covered . Some naturals will use the baggy method for a few hours a day ( 2-3 hours after work ) , overnight and some will even do it all day under a wig , turban or scarf . The length of time is really dependent on the individual as some people will find that the baggy method causes them to sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a moisture boost between washings ( instead of wetting the full head ) rather than a daily technique . <h> Modifications to the baggy method <p> The general basic method is to cover the whole head in a plastic bag . This is usually done by naturals with shorter hair or where the style does not permit you to create separations . There is a modification to this method that is designed to lessen potential sweating and focus moisture on the ends of hair . Hair can be separated into 2-4 sections and each section wrapped in plastic . Some women also use this modified technique to be able to wear the plastic bag underneath a phony puff/ponytail ( i.e a ponytail or puff attachment ) . <h> Problems with the baggy method <p> For some , the baggy method will not be successful as it can cause scalp itching ( especially if the whole head baggy method is used and/or your skin is quite sensitive to the extra moisture ) . For some individuals , the baggy method may always leads to soaking wet hair instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the baggy method is used for a shorter time ( 2-3 hours ) or if you naturally do not lose body heat fast/sweat very little .

Some people have to understand that hair is suppose to be " dry " and you should need to moisturize it everyday or every other day or as much as you need to . Some people mistake their texture for dry hair as well . The baggy method is something I definitely wont ever be doing . <p> yeah baggying overnight is just gross for me. my hair smells and its just WET which I personally do n't  like . Today I baggied for about 9 hours under my beanie but my hair does n't  smell , my scalp does n't  itch even though its about the same time it would take if I slept on it . Its what I 'm comfy with anyway . My hair has been really dry so I 've been baggying a couple days a week and deep conditioning twice a week . My hair should be well moisturized and happy very soon . I made sure to do a very mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioning my hair immediately after washing it . I slather on conditioner and go back to showering , covering my locks with a plain old plastic grocery bag secured at the nape with an elastic rubber band . I condition for about 10 minutes in the steam of the shower . before I get out , I rinse and wrap in a toewl . Excellent results . <p> I get the itchy scalp side effect when I baggy with soaked hair ( deep conditioning overnight ) , but I typically rinse my hair out the next morning , so the itchiness goes away . However , when I do a minimal spritz and then baggy , I do n't  get the itchy scalp , and my WnGs last several days well moisturized . I got the idea to do that from Naptural85s video on how to maintain a WnG . You can watch that video here : LONG ... The key is the amount of water you put on your hair before you baggy ! <p> Second that idea , I use the same method for my WnG as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and small amt of conditioner ( usually I use about the size of a almond for each side ) , hair in loose ponytail with a scrunchie , plastic bag and my satin scarf I am good to go for the night . Leaves my hair moisturized not wet and good for this dry Chicago winter . Makes my WnG last about 4 days if I am consistent . <p> I am very confused why does n't  one just apply a good daily leave in or spritz and then seal ? Using a humectant like veggie glycerin will allow the hair to retain moisture . I have very dry , coarse , 4c hair and I never need to baggyi do n't  even need to moisturize everyday now . Also , why do naturals only rely on " wash day " or co-washes to give them moisture ? what is all this about " if you need a moisture boost in between washes " i thought our hair would need moisture more than once a weekand thus the need for a daily spritz ..

You are not the only one . <p> Ill try to answer however since I am not an expert I will call on others to give their input . 1 . Applying spritz and seal is indeed a good way of moiturizing.the baggy method is just ANOTHER way . If you live in a hot climate like me by midday the effect of the spritz is goneif i leave the baggy on then the hair is moist throughout . 2 . You have to remember that everyones hair is different .

Trust me this keeps the hair super moist and reduces split ends and knots by a million times .

I will be trying it with oil on dry hair and see how that works for me .

Works wonders . Do this once a month or every other month . <p> I use it overnight for my locks , like Nimi , I use this to protect my pillowcase from all the oils as well ! However , I have been using this for just about two months now I am definitely noticing a difference in terms of breakage ! <p> I have never used the baggy method because any extended period in a shower cap causes my hair to my smell . I can only imagine the stench of baggying overnight , so for me the cons far outweigh the pros . <p> So very true . I tried it overnight and my head was sweatyyes the hair was moist but i was not having the smell .. so then i had to have an unscheduled wash ! ! ! . I saw however where Chicoro placed the bag over just the endsand even covered them up with something so that she can go out ( to work etc ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as I find suitable covers that will match clothing without looking too obvious . I only do the complete baggy when i plan to wsah the hair next morning . <p> I thought the BM was like : damp your hair , apply a leave in then an oil or butter whereas GHE just wet or not your hair apply or not oil and put your bag on your whole head and that 's it . Now I 'm a little bit confused but wtv , sometimes when I 'm beign lazy and have neglected my hair , it needs extra boost and so I lightly damp it apply an oil sometimes I do n't  and put the bag on for few hour to a night .

@@72561656 @1261656/ <h> 8 Ways to Make a Twist Out Last a Long Time <p> The twistout is one of many hairstyle options one can do to maintain healthy hair . It requires no heat usage , thus preventing heat damage . It can be worn for days at a time , therefore requiring little mechanical manipulation to our tresses . With the twistout there is no tension on the scalp , and thus no damage to the hair follicle . What 's more ? It is a cute , summer hairstyle for any length of natural hair ! Here are 8 tips to help your twist outs last longer . <h> 1 . Twist on 90% wet or damp hair . <p> Twisting on dry hair will produce a twistout that only lasts for a short period. - Rather , it is important to twist on wet or damp hair in order to achieve optimal definition and a long-lasting twistout. - Avoid twisting on hair that is 100% wet ; fully wet hair is more prone to breakage via tension while twisting. - Also , allow the hair to dry completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mixture of a butter and gel <p> Using a butter ( e.g. , shea , mango ) in combination with a gel will not only make for a very defined twistout , but one that allows for maximum wear. - The butter-gel combination will provide a soft hold for your twistout while locking in moisture. - However , be sure to avoid alcohol-based gels , which can dry the hair . <h> 3 . Coil the ends of the twists <p> For some naturals , twisting down to the very ends of the hair can lead to twistouts with frizzy ends. - An alternative method is to twist until just before you reach the ends of your hair and then coil these ends around your finger. - If your ends do n't quite coil with this alternative , then try twisting them very loosely as compared to the rest of the strand . <h> 4 . Wear smaller twists and for a longer period <p> The bigger your twists , the less defined the twistout , which in turn leads to quicker reversion of the style . Additionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quickly your twistout will revert as well. - The longest-lasting twistouts are achieved from wearing small to medium-sized twists for a minimum of 3-5 days to set . <h> 5. - Do not borrow while twisting <p> While twisting for a twistout , do not borrow hair from one of the two strands along the way. - This tactic is usually done to compensate for a twist that started off with one big strand and one small strand. - However , undoing such a twist can lead to a disastrous , frizzy twistout. <h> 6. - Do not over separate the twistout <p> Separate each twist into two sections , if possible , or up to four sections at the maximum. - Any further separation can contribute to frizz and shorter wear of the style . <h> 7 . Avoid humectants and re-moisturization ( if possible ) <p> Try to avoid moisturizers that contain humectants ( e.g. , glycerin , propylene glycol , etc. ) , which are meant to draw in moisture from the air and thus , may shorten the duration of your twistout. - Additionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order to do this , moisturize before taking down your twists. - If you happen to be a natural whose hair can not survive without humectants or re-moisturization while wearing a twistout , then choose health over duration of the style . - Frizz can still be minimized by opting for a light moisturizing spritz instead of a moisturizer you must apply by hand . <h> 8 . Secure the twistout before you sleep <p> For those with medium to long hair , put your twistout into 10-12 loose , big twists and cover with a satin bonnet. - In the morning , just undo the big twists and fluff your original twistout into place. - For those with shorter hair , there is no need to retwist prior to bedtime. - Simply cover your twistout with a satin bonnet. - In the morning , remove the bonnet and fluff your hair. - These methods will help to minimize frizz and reversion . <p> Do n't  forget do rope twists will also maximize a twist out . that is twist the individuals strands the opposite direction of the twist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to three day twist out if I do the method even when I do n't  use product . Also three strand twist also seem to be secure especially if you want to do n't  very small twists . All those recommendations are sound . <p> Great info ! I love twist outs ( on other people ) mines never seem to turn out right but after reading the above I see where I may have made my mistakes.What would be a good light moisturizing spritz ? Thanks ! <p> Shea Moistures Coconut and Hibscus Curling Souflee is nice I use that with their Curl Enhacing Smmothie and my hair is still mosturized after a week . Use the souflee sparingly as a little bit goes a long way . <p> I did Bantu knots this week and took them out . Did n't  quite get the definition I wanted , but now realize I did n't  add gel to the mix . Used to use it on my hair when it was shorter and my twists came out lovely ! <p> After washing and conditioning , I put my hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about half hour to an hour and then twists my hair in smaller sections . It is mostly dry by then and stretched . Twisting on wet hair leaves my twists outs too tight and defined in my opinion . <p> I usually just twist using a butter of some sort , but I may try using gel for more hold . <p> Thank you SOOOO much for this because I LOVE wearing my twists out but I am constantly learning something new about what my hair WONT dolol but with this list I realize it was because I was doing certain things wrong . So THANK YOU for this ! I just LOVE everything about this site ! You guys are the best natural hair care site out there ! = No lie ! = Thank you ! <p> I never thought about why my twist outs or braid outs would get so frizzy , but now I know that it was because I would remoisturize my hair after I took the twists down . I also am guilty of borrowing hair from other strands as I 'm braiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem when I undid them . 
@@72561657 @1261657/ <p> In the natural hair community , there are two streams of thought when it comes to " going natural " the big chop , and transitioning . I 'm sure you already know about the big chop , which involves lopping off all of your hair into a short cut and growing it out . Transitioning is well , a gradual transition to going natural . So what does that mean exactly ? It means that in pursuit of natural hair , you make the conscious decision to stop the practices that got your hair in the position its currently in . So if relaxer damage has your hair looking thin and brittle , you stop relaxing . If you have heat damage , you stop frying your hair with the flat iron . If you have color damage , you let go of the hair dye to get your hair back to optimal health . When you transition , you coddle along your tresses , both natural and damaged , growing out your hair until you are ready to cut the ends off . Transitioners enjoy the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth stages that can frustrate many big choppers . <p> Whether to chop or transition is a decision of a very personal nature and totally depends on your preferences , comfort level , and the condition of your hair . If you are used to having longer hair , chopping may be too traumatic and could inadvertently lead you to returning to straight hair . On the other hand , if you 're used to experimenting with your hair , and openly welcome change chopping could be for you . If your hair is falling out faster than you can pick it out of the comb , you may not want to transition some situations may be too severe for you to continue to hold on to your hair . Use discretion when deciding . <p> How Do I Transition ? <p> Honestly , transitioning can occur consciously or by happenstance . I personally transitioned on accident ( seriously ) . In March of 2012 , I embarked on a 3 month " no heat challenge " in an attempt to get my hair right . After that 3 months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . Rather than give up on all the progress I had made , I kept the party going , and transitioned completely for 21 months ( I just chopped my hair on Thursday , December 5th 2013 ) . Here are some of my updates from transitioning : <p> As far as relaxed hair is concerned , the transition looks a little different . While relaxed , many women " stretch " the periods between touch-ups , effectively growing out their roots . This is essentially the premise of transitioning from a relaxer . The only difference is , the stretch is indefinite . There is no relaxer touch-up . The new natural hair just keeps growing , and growing , until you 're ready to rid yourself of relaxed ends . <p> So , how exactly do you transition ? I cant tell you what to do every day with your hair , or exactly what products to use . That entirely depends upon your preference . But I can leave you with a few pointers : <p> Relaxed ladies , throw away the creamy crack . Do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold it for you . Chuck it . There will be days when you feel like going back so do n't  make the mistake of leaving a tempting tub of relaxer around . Heat damage sufferers , you do n't  have to throw away your tools ( unless its time but well get to that later ) , but they do need to be stashed out of sight . If you can find someone to hold on to them for you , that 's even better . During the first 3 months , my sister needed to borrow my flat irons , and I just left them with her the entire time . Even if I wanted to straighten , I 'd have to go all the way to her house ( traffic and parking were terrible ) , and that effort required alone was enough to derail that pursuit . <p> If you 're just starting out , focus on practices , not products . Make the necessary changes and get the right tools that will serve you better in the long run . Trust me . Product will ALWAYS be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillowcase , scarf , and bonnet . Now is the time to learn how to properly moisturize and seal your hair . Now is the time to clean house , and get rid of products that will no longer serve your hair . Learn whether you can wet , dry , or damp detangle , and if fingers or a wide-tooth comb serves you better . <p> TREAT THE LINE OF DEMARCATION LIKE IT IS HAIR ATTACHED TO A NEWBORN BABY YOURE TRYING TO NOT WAKE UP . That may seem a little extreme , but I am so serious . The line of demarcation for transitioners ( heat damage or relaxed ) can literally make or break your transition . That line where new natural hair meets damaged is the weakest point along your hair shaft . It can break in the blink of an eye , and some of your hair will . I 'll say it again : some of your hair WILL break . Not because you did anything wrong , but because you do n't  live in a dark bubble and never touch your hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends upon how you treat your hair . If you learn proper moisture techniques ( click here for that info ) , and treat your hair like it is attached to a newborn baby that you 're trying to not disturb while sleeping ( I 'll tighten that simile later ) , you wont have to worry about excessive breakage and hair loss . <p> How Long Should I Transition ? <p> How long you transition is totally up to you . Some transition for as little as a month , and work their natural hair from there . Some ladies transition for years , and others fall somewhere in the middle . Do n't  feel pressured or rushed to chop your ends any sooner than you 're ready . Once I hit the year mark , folks were always asking me when I was going to cut . My answer never changed : I do n't  know . When your hair reaches a comfortable length , and you 're really ready to let go then you can ! Some things to take into consideration when deciding how long to transition : <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of growth is half an inch per month . Your hair may fall above or below that rate , and that is definitely a contributing factor to how long you should transition . Although variables will invariably ( haha ) enter the equation , you can always roughly guesstimate that to end up with 6 inches of new natural hair , you 'll need to transition for 12 months . <p> What styling options are you looking for ? If you 're one of those lucky gals who can protectively style for months on end , then your transition may be a little more seamless and can go on longer . For those that cant ( like me ) , determine what style options you 'll be comfortable with rocking . The more options you have , the longer you 'll be able to muster transitioning . <p> Cut hair shrinks up a little more . I learned this lesson recently . I had gotten so used to my heat damaged ends elongating my hair , that when they were gone , the ends of my hair curled into themselves instead of just hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go about half an inch or so past that point . <p> How much patience do you have ? Transitioning is literally a waiting game . Sure , you can do things like scalp massages , use essential oils , take vitamins , and work out to help accelerate hair growth and health . But they are n't  gon na give you 15 inches of growth overnight . The more patience you have with your hair growth process , the longer you can transition , and vice versa . <p> A continuing theme in a lot of the e-mails I receive is an expressed desire for a curl or texture to return . Unfortunately , if your hair is damaged , that is not the case . There is no treatment you can do , no product you can buy that will make your curl return to you . Damage is damage is damage . Now , there is a caveat to this . Let 's say all along your hair has been healthy and textured , and you decide to flat iron it one time on a temperature that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coils do n't  spring back to normal ; they 're a little drab and stretched-looking . To help rehab your hair , you can pick up an intense restructurizing product like ApHogee 2-Step Protein Treatment , or try any of these steps . Even with protein and moisture restoring products , there is no guarantee that your hair will be as it was before . But if you 're a chronic straightener ( like I was ) , or had a relaxer , neither of these treatments will do anything for you . Instead of wasting time and money on products that wont do anything but disappoint you , focus on what is working well for the new curls coming in that are replacing the long gone ones . <p> Just in case you *might* be in denial , here is what heat damage looks like : <p> Your hair may have some curl or wave to it . It may not even be as badly broken off , or brittle . But if it looks nothing like the roots of your hair , it is indeed damaged . Case and point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these tresses . Heat damage occurs when utilizing heat styling tools ( either one time or on a repeated basis ) that are in fact too hot for your hair . Too-hot flat irons , combs , and curlers basically melt the protein in your hair , causing it to become weak , thin , brittle , and prone to breakage and splitting . Because it is melted , your curl is gone , and it becomes difficult to absorb and retain moisture within the hair . <p> Just in case you *might* be in denial , here is what relaxer damage looks like : <p> Notice the difference between her natural hair and relaxed ends ! Yours may not be as severe , but always remember : damage is damage . Not to mention the scars , baldness , and burns ! Relaxers cause a swelling of the hair cortex , separating protein bonds . The broken bonds realign themselves into a straight configuration . If it sounds a little unclear , click here . Jc does a better job at breaking it down than I do and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in denial , here is what color-treated hair damage looks like ( yes , there is such a thing , and it is just as bad as any of the two above ) : <p> Yeah , she 's white but you get the point . You see what those ends look like , and I 'm sure most of her hair looks just as bad ( not trying to be rude , just stating likely facts ) . Hair color ( especially bleaching , blondes , or lighter colors in general ) works by lifting the cuticle , and dissolving the melanin that gives hair its color . Thanks to these raised cuticles , dryness , difficulty with moisture retention , weaker hair , and breakage is almost always on the menu , to some degree . Jc explains this one better to .

@@72561658 @1261658/ <h> Should Natural Hair Be Trimmed Wet or Dry ? <p> Youve seen the stylist in your neighborhood salon approach a head of wet dripping hair , with scissors in hand , and start to work his or her magic . But have you ever wondered whether trimming the hair while wet is the healthiest thing to do ? <p> For straighter hair types , wet cutting may not be very problematic . Straighter hair is not very vulnerable to " shrinkage " and porosity issues , all characteristics that are found exaggerated on wet , textured hair . So , for those of us who are chemically relaxed , color treated , or have curl patterns that are n't  exactly uniform dry trimming is actually the best method of hair trimming . Why ? <p> 1 . ) Imagine cutting a wet piece of paper , and then cutting a dry piece of paper in the same way . You 'll easily see that the cut on the wet paper is not a clean one . Your hair is really no different . Wet trimming can actually damage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving them more vulnerable to splitting later on . The damage is even more likely if your scissors are the cheaper variety ( less than $10-15 ) , non-hair specific shears , or good hair shears that need to be sharpened . <p> 2 . ) Hair appears much longer when wet . So , a dry cut or trim will give you a better feeling of the actual , final length result . If you trim wet hair , you 'll appear one length while wet and then once the hair has fully dried , you 'll see that your hair is typically much shorter than you would have expected due to shrinkage . <p> 3 . ) Differences with porosity and texture throughout your hair make dry cutting the better , more precise option . With porous or textured hair , some areas of the strand may lengthen more than others when exposed to water . More porous areas will lengthen the most , while less porous areas will resist that extra lengthening . Also , tighter coiled areas may not " release their curls " fully , as looser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use your wet hair as a guide , you may end up with uneven hair in some places . <p> As a final note , if you are chemically relaxed and are some weeks post relaxer , you must take into consideration the differing growth rates in different areas on your head . Some areas , generally the crown , will experience faster or more noticeable growth than other areas like the nape . It is always advisable to relax or straighten your hair first , then attempt your dry hair trim . <p> Thank you so much for the information .

@@72561659 @1261659/ <h> 6 Steps to Longer-Lasting Sealed Ends <p> There is nothing more frustrating than sealing your ends only to have them look like tumbleweeds a few days later . Now since I wear my hair in updo protective styles 24/7 my tumbleweed moments have become a distant memory but I can relate to all of you who love to wear your hair out or rock protective styles freeform . The featured picture above shows my ends in two different states . The Before ' picture : <p> is the end of one of my twists just washed with conditioner , then immediately ends are sealed , left to air and worn down for two days . The After ' picture : <p> These are my ends two days later done with the same exact steps and treatment except tweaked with a special technique I created . If you are experiencing dry ends just a few days after sealing I may have an easy , longer lasting solution that will work for you . <p> Our ends tend to go haywire on us quickly because they are the oldest ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the curlier the strand the more difficulty sebum has lubricating your ends . Sebum is the natural oils your sebaceous glands secrete to lubricate scalp and hair . Sebaceous glands are microscopic glands in the skin throughout most of the body , but mostly populated on the scalp and face . They actively moisturize our hair but , because of the curly road sebum has to travel , it may not even reach your ends . Remember , it is much easier for the oil to run down a wavy or straighter strand versus extremely curly which is why it is important to have a regular sealing routine . <p> Now you may be thinking YES , I have implemented a regular sealing routine into my regimen but WHY after just a few days have my ends turned into tumbleweeds ? How can I assure a longer lasting sealing routine ? Below is the breakdown of the WHY and what you can actually do about it . <h> Dry , Frazzled Ends <p> As I mentioned earlier the Before ' picture is the end of one of my twists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , left to air dry and worn down for two days . YES , just after two days of wearing my twist down ladies , my ends take on a very straw like feeling . Now for those of you who know me , you know good and well I do not wear my hair down , but I wanted to demonstrate the effects wearing my hair down have on my ends , even when sealing . So , if your hair is relatively healthy and you are experiencing a similar affect your ends may not be damaged , but just appear to be . <p> Part of the reason is porosity levels and density of your individual strands . Even though my strands are normal porosity levels I still deal with absorption issues . My hair is a sponge so products dissipate very easily , add the fact that my strands are super fine and can fray on my clothing , and this translates to ends breakage if I wore my hair down on a daily basis . Of course you can seal every other day , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 5 years ago I created a technique which I call Operation Protective Seaweed ' , consisting of 6 , quick and simple steps for refreshing your ends and turning those tumbleweeds into seaweeds . <h> Operation Protective Seaweed <h> Tools &amp; Ingredients : <h> Water <h> Your favorite sealing product <h> Steps : <p> Water : Take one sectioned off twist and saturate your ends with the water bottle . To keep the rest of your hair dry place the nozzle directly above your ends . <p> Drain : Once your ends are fully saturated with water , squeeze the excess water from your ends with your fingers only . Draining the excess water from your ends gives them a longer lasting seal . When you place any type of product on soaking wet hair the product will most likely drip away and not have a chance to hold on to your ends and create a barrier to protect them . <p> Product : Generously place your favorite oil or butter onto your ends <p> Bobby Pin : Now place your thumb in between the bobby pin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobby pin like this : <p> Placing your ends along one side of the bobby pin creates a miniature size clamp . Once you have finished wrapping , place the bobby pin in the chunky twist right above the wrapped area . This assures extra hold . Remember that the hair is at a more fragile state when wet due to water weight so the wrapping should be firm but not tight . <p> Air Dry : Let ends air dry and unravel . Before you unravel I would recommend placing extra oil or shea butter on the wrapped ends before removing the bobby pin . As I mentioned before your ends should be firmly placed around the bobby pin but not too tightly . If done correctly you should be able to slide your ends from the bobby pin by unclamping the bobby pin , and sliding your ends gently from the pin . Depending on the bulk of hair you have wrapped around the bobby pin your ends might resemble this coily pattern once they have fully dried . The After ' picture is the natural pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twist at a time . This way your ends are guaranteed to have the same results and benefits versus trying to do all your twists at the same time . Also let ends completely dry before you remove the bobby pins . Less manipulation and making sure ends are completely dry will only increase better results . <p> Keeping your ends tucked and left to air dry after you have sealed versus leaving them down- and left to air dry produces more sound results in a longer lasting sealing method . This method I created is just another version of the tucking method but amplified for- even longer lasting sealed- ends- <p> Thanks for this tip !

Pay special attention if you have finer hair , and if you notice a protective style is weighing your neck or some of your hair strands down , consider pinning your hair into an updo to cheat gravity . <p> Protective Styles Can Mess Up Your Routine <p> The most dangerous thing about protective styles is that they make us lazy with our hair .

But did you know that they are also great for the health of your hair ? Let 's explore . <p> I 'm about to get a little science-y for a secondjust hang with me . Omega 3 , 6 and 9 are all fatty acids two of which are considered essential to human body functioning ( 3 and 6 ) . All three are molecular chains of oxygen - - - <p> The differences between the three and how they perform in our bodies are at the molecular level .

Let 's take a quick look : <p> - Still with me ? Good . Now that you have a feel for what omegas are , let 's talk about what they do for our bodies and our hair . <p> - Omega-3 <p> Omega-3 fatty acid is considered one of the essential fatty acids , because our bodies can not make it . It is chiefly famous for being an anti-inflammatory agent , which can ease any number of medical conditions . Additionally , it counteracts the pro-inflammatory properties of omega-6 . In terms of hair benefits , omega-3 : <p> Omega-9 is a non-essential fatty acid , because our bodies are able to generate it from unsaturated fats . Omega-9 helps regulate bad cholesterol and supports immune function . Omega-9 in the hair : <p> Controls water loss in hair <p> Makes hair softer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your diet . Chances are , something you 're eating is getting you enough already ! <p> Getting omegas in your body is one thing , getting them on your hair is another .

Or , if you already have a favorite oil , see how it stacks up ! <p> Isnt it amazing what a little omega can do for your hair ? - I shared the information below in my post on Apricot Oil , but its always good to keep this at the forefront of your mind when choosing oils . When the fatty acids in oils come together , they help serve three wonderful purposes : <p> Cement : They shape the substance that seal scales of the hair cuticle , in the same way that cement keeps together the bricks in a wall . Because the scales are " cemented " together , they make for a smooth surface , which enables the hair to protect itself against external aggressions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrier : Also known as sealing . They prevent the water that was absorbed by the hair from evaporating . <p> Sponge : Fatty acids are also mild humectants . They are able to absorb small amounts of water from the airs humidity in order to help maintain hair hydration . <p> This is no news bulletin to most naturalistas , but for those that are newly natural or transitioning , remember this important information when purchasing oils . Make sure your oils are : <p> Virgin or Pure : Meaning that the oil was obtained by mechanical processes , without industrial refinement or chemical additives . <p> Cold Pressed : Meaning that the seeds , nuts , or kernels are pressed to release their oils without heat . Cold pressed oils best retain the nutrients , vitamins , and fatty acids that provide the benefits you seek . Heat diminishes their presence and effectiveness . <p> Organic : Which guarantees that there is has been no fertilizer , no herbicides or chemical pesticides in the environment where the product source is cultivated . Because those elements are soluble in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( unrefined/cold pressed ) . Only industrial refinement can then eliminate the impuritiesthen the oil itself loses its effectiveness .

@@72561663 @1261663/ <h> 6 Ways Moisture Impacts Hair Growth and Length Retention <p> One of my friends recently decided to become serious about her hair health . Her goals are to increase the fullness of her hair by minimising breakage and increase her length retention . She diligently did her reading up on the internet and came to me with questions about moisture . I realized on speaking to her that moisture can be a complete red herring for some naturals . There is the perception on natural sites that eliminating dry hair is the path to full and long healthy hair . I think that this is only a partial truth , there are certain aspects of handling natural hair where moisture has no role . This is my breakdown of what moisture can and can not do . <h> 1 . Moisture will not help your hair to grow <p> This is perhaps one of the biggest misconceptions about moisture . The level of water in your hair has no influence on hair growth . The growth rate of your hair is determined genetically and can be influenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow your hair to grow at a normal rate , it is usually in starvation or deprivation of protein when your hair will slow down , stop growing or fall out . Having moisturised hair will not help your hair to grow faster . <h> 2 . Moisture can play a role in helping retain growth <p> The real role of moisture is in mitigating damage to hair during handling . This has a valuable role in ensuring that hair growth can be retained as less damage to the strand means that the hair can continue to be present for more years . <p> Handling hair is not restricted to just washing and combing , it is also crucial when styling both free hair and hair in a protective style ( e.g braids and twists ) . A little bit of water helps to make hair more flexible allowing it to be manipulated without breaking . Dry hair will tend to snap easily even with gentle force , therefore moisture is important even in a protective style . <h> 3 . Moisture can help your hair look and feel better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much . The look and feel of moisturised hair is much nicer than very dry hair which has a tendency to look dull and brittle . <h> 4 . You can not eliminate dry hair <p> If your hair is naturally dry , it will always be dry because added moisture is temporary . For some naturals , hair can be dry as a result of using certain products e.g a drying shampoo and eliminating that product is able to restore moisture . However , the vast majority of people with natural hair , will tend to have naturally dry hair . The reason why the term moisture routine exists is because adding water to hair and keeping it around and in the shaft with oils and moisturisers is a task that has to be repeated several times as hair switches from its moisturised state to its default dry state . The only way to influence the level of water trapped inside your hair or on its surface without physically adding water to it is to change the external environment i.e high humidity = moisture heaven . <h> 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your goal is to showcase as much length as possible or if you are aiming to stretch your hair , you have to bear in mind that added moisture brings in shrinkage . Some styles require that you use less moisture for example if you are maintaining a heat straightened style or some naturals who wear twists as a protective style , may find it easier to maintain the style for longer and reduce meshing/ matting by reducing shrinkage due to frequent water addition . <h> 6 . Moisture routines vary <p> There is no set formula for maintaining moisturised hair . There is no rule book that you have to apply water , oil or a moisturiser every day or every other day . For some naturals , it is sufficient to shampoo , condition and apply a leave in once a week . For other naturals , it is a routine involving misting hair once or twice a day and using an oil or butter to help maintain the moisture for longer . For others it is a rotation between shampooing and conditioner washing . In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to experiment to find the products , washing and moisturising routines as well as frequency that work best for your hair . <p> Ladies , do these 6 facts ring true for you ?

@@72561664 @1261664/ <h> How to Deal with High Porosity Hair <p> Natural hair can be a challenge to deal with ( depending on thickness , length and the time you have available ) , but add high porosity levels to the mix and you have a whole new game . Stay with me as I break down the three hair porosity levels and offer three helpful tips that will ensure some successful results in maintaining your hair ! <p> Porosity simply refers to the condition of the cuticle layer . There are three levels of porosity low , normal and high . <p> Low- porosity hair- is when the cuticle of the hair shaft is very compact and does not allow moisture to easily enter or leave . The overlapping scales ( in the photo above ) make up the outer layer of the strand , with the cortex layer inside . Hair with a low porosity level is more resistant to chemicals and tends to reject product rather than absorb it . This explains why some individuals have to wash their hair more frequently because they experience much more buildup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strands rather than being absorbed by it . <p> Normal- porosity hair- permits moisture to pass through the shaft into the cortex as necessary , but not too much . <p> Now- High- porosity- strands typically results from irreparable damage to the cuticles caused by chemicals , heat and harsh treatment . The damage creates holes and spaces along the hair shaft . High porosity strands are capable of soaking up drastically higher amounts of water . This can spell disaster for the strands when wet because the weight of the water absorbed by the hair causes it to lose elasticity which leads to breakage . <p> - Strand Water Glass Test <p> To find out the porosity of hair I found a helpful test on KisforKinky.com . You take a strand of your hair ( make sure your hair is clean of any product to ensure accurate results ) and place it in a glass full of water ( cold water is fine ) . - Normal to low porosity- strands will float , but if your hair is of high porosity it will sink to the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to float .

Overall , my hair takes a while to dry which is the total opposite of high porosity .

@@72561671 @1261671/ <h> Is Conditioner Meant To Be Left in Your Hair ? <p> This is a question that I have been asked several times and topped the recent poll with nearly half the votes wanting to know the answer ! I must clarify first and say that when you wash your hair , you should rinse out all the conditioner thoroughly ( for reasons known as potential itchiness , personal experience here , some science to follow ) . The question posed here is whether you can then use a little bit of conditioner afterwards as a moisturiser or on a daily basis . The answer to this question is- yes you can use conditioner as a moisturiser but with caution . <p> So there are two main types of conditioner 1. - Rinse out- conditioners ( heavier type that is used after shampooing to add softness typical ingredients include fatty acids , surfactants and oils ) 2. - Leave in- conditioners ( much thinner and lighter , typically contain humectants such as glycerine to help moisturise hair ) <p> Now , leave in conditioners are a no brainer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rinse out conditioners are a little more tricky . They can be used but be aware <p> 1 . Using a silicone heavy conditioner ( silicone in one of the first 5 ingredients ) is not ideal unless you shampoo your hair . Co-washing your hair will simply not do . 2. - Conditioners which contain protein ( hydrolysed protein or amino acids ) have been shown to cause irritation- and itchiness in some people ( contact urticaria is the medical term ) . - ( Allergy. 53(11):1078-1082 , 1998 ) . 3. - Hair conditioner can contribute to build up. - This was explained in a very intricate study- ( Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists , pg 205-214,1989 ) . The science behind this is that the hair conditioner has positive charges and the shampoo has negative charges . Depending on the amount and type of shampoo , the hair conditioner can either be removed or the shampoo can simply attach to the hair conditioner and cause build up . Naturally if you have been applying hair conditioner to your hair on a daily basis , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So what precautions can you take if you want to use heavier conditioner as a daily moisturiser ? <p> 1. - Do n't  put the conditioner on your scalp , - try as much as possible to target the ends of your hair ( leave the scalp and the first 1-2 inches alone ) . 2. - Read the- ingredient list- and if you are a no shampoo person , avoid silicones in the top 5 list of your conditioner . If you shampoo , then no worries here . 3 . Pick a conditioner without proteins. 4 . Rinse your hair thoroughly on your wash day . 5 .

There are two sides to the baking soda story and here are the facts for you to weigh out <h> 1 . Irritation <p> Pro : - Shampoos contain surfactants which remove oil from skin and hair and cause irritation . For example a clarifying shampoo rich in SLS can be very irritating even within the ideal pH range of 4-7 .

Although shampoo is within the pH range of 4-7 , it does contain negative charges from surfactants which may lift the cuticle . Whether you choose to use shampoo or baking soda , - a hair conditioner is useful to correct this potential damage . <p> Anti : Outside the pH 4-9 range hair can experience structural changes ( for examples cuticle lifting externally and some changes to the inner fibre ) ( J Soc Cosmet Chem , pp 393-405 , 1981 ) .

Gentle and Minimal Manipulation <p> Be gentle with your hair and be mindful of how the tools you use affect your hair .

Most effective detangling process for me and least time comsuming in the over 1 year Ive been natural . <p> I agree with protective styling for retaining length but not necessarily for anti breakage . I mix the majority of my hair care products so my tip would be to find a conditioner you like that is really good for detangleing and mix it with 3 parts water and 1 part aloe vera juice , then every morning I spritz before I leave out for work or to start the day . Helped me ALot with moisture especially since i got my hair colored a few months ago . <p> My anti-breakage tipBe gentle while detangling .

@@72561683 @1261683/ <h> PH and the Cuticle <p> *Originally published on July 30 , 2010* Theres been a lot of discussion lately about the pH of various products and how they affect the cuticle . <p> We all know that the pH of relaxers is very high ( frequently above 10 ) and can actually have a disintegrating effect on the hair . But what about other products like baking soda ( 8 ) , apple cider vinegar ( 5 to 7 ) and aloe vera juice ( about 3.4 ) ? <p> The Natural Haven addressed this topic in a recent article . To give some reference : the pH of water is 7 . Anything above 7 is alkaline , below it is acidic . The lower the number the more acidic it is , the higher the number the more alkaline it is . The pH of hair ranges from as low as 3 to as high as 6.7-6.8 . <h> Q1 : Does pH raise or close cuticles ? <p> There are two authoritative studies on this with pretty similar results . There is very little change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 . Hair protein resists changes due to acid or base . Tests were performed using hydrochloric acid ( powerful acid ) and sodium hydroxide ( a strong base ) . <h> Q2 : Do the cuticles not open at high pH ? <p> I insist on using correct terminology . The cuticle is not a door that can open and close . It is a protein whose structure can be affected causing it to lift . Yes the cuticle does lift around a pH of 10 . <h> Q3 : Are you really saying that hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide really do not affect hair ? <p> In the range of pH 4 to 9 yes , there is not much change to hair . In fact soaking hair in water ( yep plain ole water ) for a long time ( circa 10 minutes is long ) actually yields greater change to the step height ( see above ) than acid or base . <h> Q4 : What happens outside the pH 4 to 9 range ? <p> At both low and high pH there appear to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is thought to be a result of the acid or base changing the protein.Very high pH can actually dissolve hair . <p> And since were on the topic of pH , I wanted to share some information I found via LongHairCareForum.com . Now to give some perspective , alot of this information is dated ( 1999 ) , so I do n't  know if these pH levels still maintain , but it still gives pretty sobering insight . <p> The information gathered came from September 1999 edition of Consumer Reports and is not reported in any particular order . Its corresponding pH balance follows the product name/description . <p> HEY ! What 's wrong with a little coo talk , you think its not going through the minds of people in the military after watching the rape of their country coupled with the lack of respect they get from Washington for all their hard work ? pandora bracelet <p> THIS all makes plenty sense . I realized my personal aloe mix ( curl/coil Sculpter ) made my hair less bushy and frizzy but even watching kimmytube or learning about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even wearing my hair natural . As long as ur ingredients are n't  extremely basic r acidic ur good . <p> Its possible that cuticle changes are n't  the whole story when it comes to hair and pH . The cuticle itself may not have lifted , but there 's more to hair texture and manageability than the position of the cuticle . <p> I used to pH test all my products after reading about and watching the KimmayTube videos . I believe pH balance had a positive effect on my hair . I do n't  need to test the pH of products anymore because I have found the products my hair likes and all of them are pH balanced . I use ACV and black tea as a final rinse and it does make my hair smoother . Not everyones hair is the same , most naturals rave about coconut oil but I can only use if it is mixed with another oil . I think it is important to Read more + <p> The Natural Haven says : " In fact soaking hair in water ( yep plain ole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is long ) actually yields greater change to the step height ( see above ) than acid or base . " <p> If this is true , then does 20-minute deep conditioning treatments do damage to the hair , do frequent spritzes of water throughout the day do damage , and does wearing a plastic cap all day under a winter hat do damage to hair that has some kinda conditioner slathered all over it ( if water is one of the first five ingredients ) ? <p> This article was published in 2010 . Have you guys seen kimmaytubes most recent video on how she controls her hair with pH ? She shows how taking her hair from acidic ( pH 4-5 ) to neutral ( pH 7 ) dramatically changes the appearance of her hair from smooth to bushy . I 'm pretty sure that if the scientists from whom the research this article is based on saw that video they may have to rethink some things . Science is not infallible , that why its science and the way kimmaytube conducts her videos they can be taken as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + <p> What I 'd like to know is what type of hair were these studies done on . It is observable that some hair is weaker than other hair and could respond dramatically differently from other hair to the same chemicals . My hair feels amazing after using ACV , which as this article says is at a PH of 5 to 7 , while aloe vera juice does make a difference but not as dramatic as ACV . And no I am not saying it does anything to the cuticle , because I do n't  know that it does , but it makes my hair smoother and shinier ( which Read more + <p> Why not just use a porosity control product , like Roux , or Joico ? Those would have done the same thing .

Seems like there are some sad people out there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Apparently people are really passionate about pH . Just because there are good products that lean towards the alkaline end of the spectrum does n't  mean they do n't  have other beneficial qualities or that you have to stop using them . Obviously relaxers are very alkaline , which may be a contributing factor to why they 're so damaging for most hair ; but just because water usually has a pH around 7 and hair around 5 does n't  mean you stop using water . That being said , I 've been adding aloe vera juice to my leave-ins ( Knot Today or Giovanni Direct ) and actually noticed a big difference in Read more + <p> I normally do n't  write a second comment on these kind of things because over the past year and a half , I 've realized that naturals love , love , love to argue but the NaturalHaven bases her " facts " on the opinions of certain scientist , just like Kimmaytube has based her " facts " on an opinion that has been generated through a scientific observation using actual PH strips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an experiment , observe , and record my results- that too could be called science . Science is never pure fact . <p> Thank you for the article , this proof that there is no substance behind this theory . Its just that , a theory , and a wrong one at that . <p> Sadly , there are people that just do n't  get it . They do n't  want to . They never planned to . They will continue to blind themselves to truth and fact . I do n't  know what 's more sad , that fact that Kimmays theory has been disproven by a SCIENTIST , or the fact that everyone is IGNORING the fact that its been disproven by a SCIENTIST . : ponders : <p> Thank you for putting up evidence against the falsehoods of certain people .

It makes lot of sense that PH affects our hair . I learned from Kimmaytube that water has a PH of 7 , which means that even though we always say water , water , water this can cause our cuticles to be lifted so after we rinse our hair we should use something that brings the Ph of our hair back to what it is suppose to be , which is a 4.5-5.5 in order to close the cuticle again .

@@72561684 @1261684/ <h> How To Take Down Braids and Twists Without Experiencing Breakage <p> Long term protective styles which are kept in place for several weeks are excellent for promoting hair growth retention. - - After keeping a style for that long , the horror story- - is to end up having a difficult time taking down the style and ending up with hair on the floor rather than on your head . Here are my tips on how to minimise breakage from long term protective styles and keep the hair that you worked hard to retain . <h> 1 . Know your limits : Do not keep the style for too long <p> Depending on your hair texture ( whether it is kinky or curly or both , whether individual strands- - tend to mesh or not , whether your strands are fine or average or thick , whether your hair shrinks when washed or not ) , you will have a limit as to how long you can keep the protective style . For most textures this is 2-4 weeks for twists or cornrows , it is important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twists- - and therefore if your hair tends to mesh , it is important not to keep the style for overly long especially if you are regularly wetting the hair . For braids this can extend to 8 weeks depending on the hair texture ( kinky hair usually handles braids better ) , braid size ( small braids usually last longer than thicker ones ) , installation and care for the hair around the perimeter ( redoing the perimeter every 2-3 weeks is usually advised ) . <h> 2 . Condition your hair before the take down <p> Most naturals tend to wait to take down the protective style before giving hair a proper wash and condition . My tip is to do this on the day before the takedown. - - If you normally condition your hair for 10-20 minutes , then try to go for 20 minutes . If you like to deep condition with heat , then do so . The reason for conditioning prior to taking down is to essentially use the hair conditioner to soften hair and add moisture to it . The day immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be moisturised but not wet . It will also have deposits on the surface from the conditioner which soften the strands which further allow them to bend easily. - - Hair is therefore in the most ideal state to resist breakage from the comb stabbing at the braid/twist and also any stretching and pulling . You can wash and condition your hair again once the style has been taken down especially if you have smaller twists or braids and may therefore not have accessed your scalp properly . <h> 3 . Unravel rather than comb <p> You can use a- rat tail comb- to undo your protective style but if your twists or braids were properly installed it is often much kinder and gentler to unravel your hair . In a good installation the two strands that are wrapped around each to make a twist or the three strands for braiding are kept separate without needing to feed some hair from one into the other . This minimises meshing of hair which can be further aggravated by washing and shrinkage of the protective style . If you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond- - 2 inches of your ends ( often it is hard to avoid meshing at the very end ) , you- - should consider practising and perfecting your installation technique . <h> 4 . The usual suspects <p> Slip is essential especially at the ends of twists or braids . Use whatever is your favourite product which will allow your hair to feel slippery and let strands glide past each other . This can be oil , leave in conditioner , diluted rinse out conditioner , spray bottle with water and oil or a concoction of your choice . <p> This was a very helpful site , Im about to take down kinky twist that I have not washed &amp; had in for almost 3 months . I am very nervous , I want to lose as less hair as possible . I am definitely going to use the conditioner suggest in hopes at minimizing the loss &amp; breakage . Thank you again everyone . <p> No matter if you wear your braids or weaves for more than 3 months or consecutively without giving you hair a break-safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove their hairstyles and make mistakes that cause the hair at the roots to matt or tangle with the ends . We have to train hairdressers how to prevent these horrible mishaps . We only use the Take Down Remover/Detangler because it works on all types of hair textures and types . <p> I usually lose a bunch of hair when I just rush through it or try to comb down the twists , whether they are synthetic or my own hair . I probably should be taking them down with my hands after conditioning . I used to just spray with water and now I 'm thinking it might be smarter to do the deep -con prior to take down , especially before a trim . I used to compensate by waiting a day or two and then doing an intense moisture treatment . These tips seem much smarter ! <p> I would think so if its within the same month . The hair has already been pulled and tugged on for the individuals so I usually rest about a month before I let someone tug on my head again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes the stylist will do them too tightly and this can result in more breakage than what would come from the manipulation alone . <p> Hello very cool web site ! !

Gon na try that next time = Before I braid , I shampoo &amp; deep-condition my hair . Additionally I use a cream/styler to create twists , then I braid extentions into each twist , so that helps to keep my hair moisturized for the duration of the protective style . Plus it makes the take-down process much smoother , &amp; I notice less shed hair on the sink/floor since doing my protective styles this way .

I was wondering how your readers keep their edges smooth . Also , my hair is coily should I just come to terms with the fact that my edges will never be smooth ? Or are there healthy ways to achieve this . <p> I use those little nail brushes , the ones for keeping your nails clean . They are n't  as harsh as regular brushes , and with some pomeade and aloe vera gel it works . I wear a scarf over it to really help it lay flat until I 'm ready to leave the house . <p> You can achieve slick edges ! ! ! LOL I 've been using ORS Edge Control and it works very well on my 4b kinky and very coily hair . I do n't  brush it in at all because that 's just not necessary with this product I just use my fingers to slick it on and it works ! Hope that helps ! 
@@72561686 @1261686/ <h> A Scientific Analysis of Hairfinity Vitamins ; Do They Really Work ? <p> I could really rip apart the Hairfinity clinical study but I do n't  want to . I want smaller companies to continue to do experimental work to substantiate their claims and having a third party like myself denigrate those efforts is counterproductive. - I also understand the cost of making a good scientific study and that it can be more than what a small company can afford . If this was a University-led study or a large company like LOreal , there would be no holds barred in my critique . This is as gentle as I can make it . <p> The ingredients <p> The ingredients label lists a variety of common vitamins with substantially above recommended daily intake of the B vitamin family . B vitamins are known to be essential for a variety of biological functions including increasing cell numbers and cell growth . Although it is not something you can see obviously , hair is composed of cells and hair growth means increasing cell numbers and cell growth . Will high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , as B vitamins are water soluble , you should expect to see the excess passing out in urine . <p> The active ingredient is listed as capilsana complex which is defined as a mix of MSM ( methylsulfonylmethane ) and hydrolysed collagen . <p> Important : Please do not substitute this general information for a doctors advice . Do not take this pill if you are pregnant or intending to fall pregnant as it has high vitamin A levels . Collagen is an animal derived protein so if you are vegetarian or if you do not eat some types of meat for religious reasons , this pill may not be for you . Due to the above average B vitamin levels , your water intake should be increased . If you are on a low protein diet or have kidney problems , consult your doctor first . <p> The - reason for the clinical study <p> In the clinical study report , MSM is highlighted as a key ingredient of hairfinity pills . Hairfinity states that MSM has potential to increase the hair growth phase but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to do the clinical study . <p> Analysis of the study <p> The reporting of the study is very poor for a variety of reasons which I will list . The impact of this is that I can not say whether or not it was a good study and importantly whether or not the results of it are valid . <p> Here are the issues : <p> 1 . There is missing data <p> For example , hair length measurements - to assess hair growth are taken after 15 days , however , - the graphs show only a single measurement every 30 days . It does not make sense to me . Should I double the number to get the monthly growth ? If I do , then the growth rate would be astronomical about 1.25 inch per month without the supplement and going up to 2-3 inches per month with the supplement . If I do not double the 15 day measurement , the numbers are still grand 0.75 inches per month without the supplement and 1-1.5 with . - Is this real ? <p> 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls are everything . In order to know if the effect of hair growth is only from the pill and not from other factors ( e.g change in weather , diet etc. ) , it is necessary at the very least to have a comparison group who do not take the supplement throughout the 90 day study period . This instance was not reported . <p> 3 . The study has only 25 participants <p> This- is a very small group ; which is not ideal , but more importantly , the gender , age , ethnicity , nutrition , activity level etc of the participants is not mentioned . These are all important factors to judge how biased the study was . It is not accurate enough to mathematically calculate bias with just 25 participants ( Yes , you can calculate bias ! ) . <p> 4 . The study does not mention which part of the head was used for hair growth measurement . <p> We know that different parts of the scalp can grow at different rates so a direct comparison needs to be done from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 5 . The method used in the study to measure hair growth length may not be good enough . <p> The usual technique - in hair growth studies is to shave a small section of hair to the scalp and then record hair growth from the scalp . This eliminates issues like hair breakage due to combing . The method used in the hairfinity study is a hair dye method in which existing hair is dyed and hair growth is then measured from the scalp to the dye mark . There is a large potential for error with this method . Fading of the dye over time as well as being able to accurately measure from the scalp to the exact point where the dye is could both potentially pose a challenge when seeking to attain results . <p> There are many simple procedures that if properly implemented , could have improved the overall study . I would venture to say that a lot of the issues within the study arise because of- - how the data was presented , which I think was for simplicity rather than accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate a general message . If there is additional data , I would be happy to look at it and make a better assessment of whether the study results and the resulting claim that the supplement can increase hair growth are at the very least valid . <p> Do the studies done by product companies- themselves- hold a lot of weight for you in terms of your decision to buy ? <p> Everyones experience is different when it comes to any type of pill . for me it worked . It has helped me grow my hair . Before my hair was so unhealthy it was breaking off , it was always knotting and splitting it was BAD ! I took hairfinity and it gave my hair the nutrients that it needed to grow and to be healthy . Ive been using it off and on for 2 years and I have n't had any issues when it comes to breakouts , but I know that there are some people that have . So for ME it works . <p> Thank you for this article . As an analytical chemist myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial is a joke , and no certificate of analysis is issued upon request . Are they even doing any quality control ? If so , what are the parameters . I looked for a patent for this product and it does n't  even exist . Are they fulfilling the FDA requirements for nutraceuticals ? So many unanswered questions ? What about manufacturing ? I hope it is being processed in a controlled cAMP facility .

In 2013 , for two months ; I saw about 3 1/2 inches and last year for four months but saw only about 3 inches . I really wanted it to help with my hairline after I had my daughter in 2013 , I suffered post partum alopecia . It help with that some . But are they worth the cost ; no .

And I got them BOGO free . <p> Let me say this first , this product absolutely works . Now , I tried this product for one month only and decided to stop using it because I started having abnormal breakouts about a week after starting the product . They were the big ones too , not a small normal pimple . I increased water intake hoping that that was my issue , I normally juice , eat veggies , and sometimes seafood and I did n't  switch that up . I eventually started taking them every other day until I was completely out of them to avoid shedding like some others who had side effects of this product Read more + <p> Hmm some of these comments in favour of the product sound suspect.its like the company has got its interns to post comments .

No amount of marketing and celebrity paid endorsements is going to change that . <p> My hair normally grows 0.3inches per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly 0.55inch growth . Which is average growth , yes but not my average growth so to me it was quite significant considering . I 'm A science student too so I know that there needs to be control factors .

I did not change ANYTHING in my hair routine however I had my hair in braids which does n't  contribute to hair growth but does reduce hair breakage . However it was the growth I measured Read more + <p> I tried it for two months and saw no difference in anything . no negatives either but no increase in growth I had my regular growth that was fine , and did n't  see any increase in growth .

For the first three questions you asked The answer is no I did not change anything not add anything . Also , I already drink a lot of water so that did n't  effect the result . The first time I took it , it was summer But Ive taken it random times since then . I usually do it for two months and stop for one or two . I cant say what my growth rate was before it after but u do know this The first time I took it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for you analysis . I took Hairfinity Vitamins for three months after reading all of the rave reviews.Perhaps I did n't  take it long enough for my hair because I did not experience a significant difference in growth . I may try them again for a six period to see if there is any change . <p> Add me to the list as one of the participants , cause I have used Hairfinity for over a year and with only one set back , my hair grew healthy and I for one could say yes it works , Ive seen length and shine . <p> How ironic I just did a video about my experience with biotin ( still working in it . Check back on my blog , jumibearz.weebly.com , for more updates ) . I was interested in buying Hairfinity/Manetabolism but I had to do some heavy research before I jumped the bandwagon .

I personally feel that being active and eating healthier have done more for my hair than biotin or any other supplement ever has . My hair has grown sooo much in the past year just from eating more vegetables and getting off my butt for a few hours at least twice a week . Plus , by working out , I 'm taking care of all of me instead of just my hair .

JBCO sheds hair like crazy and causes alot of thinning out because of its high ash content .

I do n't  think its wort it . <p> Well when I stopped taking it I did n't  have that issue .

My sister used it as well . She was n't drinking enough water and when she started taking the pills &amp; the increase in biotin caused her a few dizzy spells so she increased her water intake and she was fine . It made her hair thicker too . <p> It did that to my hair too . And I NEEDED IT ! Its like any other product its not going to be the same for everyone .

It seems too good to be true that simply popping those pills has such amazing results the world does not work that easy !

I , for one , prefer to spend the money on buying nutritious foods that fuel my body . <p> Before I took it , I watched A LOT of YT videos of people that took it . Some of them just talked about it and others had pictures and documented their journey which was nice . I also looked up every ingredient on the internet .

For those who do n't  , let me just say the comb has become a distant memory.comb what , comb who ? - All jokes aside for my hair I feel finger detangling on dry hair has become a necessity , not an option at this stage of the game . <p> Type 4 hair is the most fragile of all hair types because every curling point along the strand is a potential point of breakage and the curlier the hair the more potential points of breakage . In additiona , we curlies have to factor in dryness that results from a lack of sebum traveling down our highly textured strands . ( Sebum is an oily substance , released from microscopic subaceous glands on the scalp , that lubrciate the skin- and hair . ) <p> Given these factors I prefer finger detangling , and I personally have seen a huge improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finger detangling . But I 'm not here to delude you finger detangling does add more time to your detangling sessions and I know this is not what most people want to hear but sometimes more work is required to reach your personal hair goals . <p> Fingers can feel more tangles that you can try to undo as opposed to a comb that sometimes will not pick up until it is too late and SNAP your strand . Now I tried finger detangling years ago and it was an epic fail and this was only because I was not properly and thoroughly taking the time to completely detangle my hair . The result was patches of dreads in some areas of my hair which eventually I had to cut out . Now I have mastered my detangling method so well I can take a section of finger detangled hair and run a fine tooth comb clean through ( I would never suggest a fine tooth comb ya 'll , just making a point ) . If you have never tried finger detangling and want to give it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detangling a small section of hair run a wide tooth comb through that section to test your work . If it goes through , then you 've done the job right . If not , you have more work to do . <p> Although finger detangling is my preferred method , I know that time is a prohibitive factor . Keep in mind that longer hair equals more work and time and if you do n't  want to put in that time , shorter hair might be the best option . But if you take the time to master finger detangling it can change the life of your hair . <p> Do you detangle with your comb or your fingers ? Which method do you prefer and why ? 87940 @qwx707940 <p> Finger Detangler all the way !

I lose less hair that way . I finger detangle , in sections , as I do my oil wash pre-poo ( I use amla oil ) . By the time I get to rinsing out my Deep Conditioner , I lightly comb through a section at a time with my shower comb . I lose little if any hair .

Its much easier for me to detangle when wet , but even then I use a comb . I find its easier than anything else . I comb my hair under running water .

This is my go to hairstyle in the summer from now on . <p> Love ! I have already tried them with marley hair and they were wearable ( in a bun only , lol ) . I am going to try them again tho . Hopefully more successful second time around . For those who do n't  like the twist method because of the hold , i was the same way . Check out blackonyxs installation on YT .

@@72561692 @1261692/ <h> How to Trim Transitioning Hair <p> There is tons of information out there about how to tell when your natural hair needs a trim . Tapering ends . Rough ends . Breaking ends . Splitting ends . Ends that wo n't stay twisted or braided ( that unravel ) . <p> The truth is , for a transitioner , all of that is a part of the daily deal . By virtue of transitioning from damaged hair , transitioner hair is tapered significantly from the newly grown natural hair . Because the hair is damaged by relaxer or heat , they are likely dry , and can be rough . And of course , there is the ever-present breakage , and not the slightest chance that a twist or braid will hold up without something holding it together . <p> Well , why not just cut it all off then ? <p> I 'm sure some of you are thinking that very thing right now . The truth is , not everyone wants to just big chop . I certainly did n't  . In fact , I transitioned for 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were more boring days than glam , but I do n't  regret the decision one bit . The payoff was worth the sacrifice , for me . <p> But back to the topic at hand . There is a wealth of information on trimming natural hair , and very little for transitioners . The first step to getting a handle on trimming transitoner hair is understanding the signs of needing a trim : <p> " lone ends " : This is the transitioner equivalent to tapering ends . Naturally , all hair experiences some tapering as it ages , this is a cumulative sign of aging , worn cuticles , breakage , and a general weathering of the hair . For transitioners , this often leads to what I like to call lone ends . Hair is tapered , but in an extreme sense to the point of only a few hairs in an area reaching a certain length while the others fall behind . In other words , your tapered ends are tapering themselves . <p> super tangled ends : Transitioner detangling is notoriously difficult . The damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making raking fingers or combs through a complete challenge . If you notice that your detangling sessions are now more difficult than ususal , it is a sign that a trim is in order . <p> How Often Should Transitioners Trim ? Inside of your first year of transitioning , barring any major incidences of breakage or hair fall that would suggest a more immediate need , trimming every 3-4 months is sufficient . Of course every head of hair is different , and you should always assess your own hair and hair goals to determine what trimming schedule best suits your needs . If you are looking to get rid of more hair sooner , trim more frequently . If you are more inclined to hold on to length , opt for less frequency . <p> Long-term transitioners ( 1 year plus ) - often find themselves being a little more vigilant about trims , and doing them more frequently . This is because of the one-two-three punch of ends being weathered , damaged , and well , holding on to them past their prime . They tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After about a year and 3 months of transitioning , I found myself trimming away at some ends almost every 2 or 3- weeks . In between trims , I did mini search and destroy missions . Part of this was my ends needing more trimming , because they were breaking- more rapidly . The other part was sheer impatience I was able to see more of my natural hair texture , so I got anxious . Especially when I began wearing wash and go styles . - As I said previously , be sure to assess your own hair and hair goals to determine what trim schedule works for you . <p> How Much To Cut ? This is also another one of those things that depends upon your hairs needs , and your own goals . It also depends on how comfortable you are individually with cutting your own hair . Some transitioners start of small , snipping away half an inch or less of hair . This is totally fine . With my less-frequent trims during my first year , I never cut more than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trims were all around half an inch . <p> There is also the issue of the mini-chop . There are many transitioners who grow impatient and frustrated with their hair , and in an effort to rid themselves of more damage , they chop three or more inches of hair . While this can be incredibly beneficial , I do not advocate doing self mini-chops for a number of reasons . One , it is incredibly difficult to mini-chop accurately meaning there is an increased likelihood that your cutting will not be consistent , and you will end up with unevenly cut hair . If it is not in your budget to seek a professional for a cut , at least have a trusted friend or family member help you out especially at the back of the head and in the crown . <p> How To Cut : Now that you 've determined that you need a cut , and know how much to cut , there is the little matter of how to cut . Many naturals show how they trim their hair to create certain shapes and styles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different , because more than style and shape , it is about getting rid of damage in a progressive sense . To trim your hair , you 'll need- 4 things : <p> Dry or damp hair . Do n't  cut your hair while soaking wet . When our hair is wet , it is more weighed down and elongated . There is a lot of potential to underestimate how much you 've cut , and when it shrinks up , you 've got much shorter hair than you anticipated . This has happened to me a few times . <p> Hair styled how you normally wear it . If you wear your hair stretched , make sure it is stretched before you trim . If you wear wash and go styles , make sure your wash and go is styled and mostly dry . The idea here is to trim your hair according to how you will achieve the best results . Regardless of your style , make sure hair is detangled as much as possible . <p> Method 1 : In a small section , take your hair and place it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Close the V , and- at a 90-degree angle , gently smooth your fingers outward along the length of your hair , stopping just before- where you would like to trim the ends . Snip the ends from the bottom up . Repeat this process throughout your head , stopping frequently to ensure that you are not cutting unevenly . <p> Method 2 : Separate your hair into a number of small or medium sized loose twists . At the end of each twist , snip away the pieces of hair that are left hanging with nothing to twist around . This method does not guarantee the most even trim , but it will certainly rid you of the most damaged hair . <p> Method 3 : If you do n't  trust yourself with methods 1 or 2 , the 3rd way is to incorporate scrunchies . Use several ouchless scrunchies to create multiple ponytails across your head . Gently slide each scrunchie down to the point where you would like to trim . By double-checking all the scrunchie end points before cutting , you can practically guarantee yourself an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can always use the search and destroy method .

@@72561698 @1261698/ <h> 7 Ways to Use Castor Oil On Natural Hair <p> Castor oil contains vitamin E , minerals , proteins , antibacterial and anti-fungicidal properties . Scientists attribute its healing benefits to its unusual chemical composition , which consists of a triglyceride of fatty acids with ricinoleic acid of up to 90 percent . In addition to healing benefits , castor oil also contains anti-inflammatory properties , all of which are related to healthy hair growth . Here are 7 ways to incorporate castor oil into a healthy hair regimen . <h> 1 . Added Shine <p> According to researchers studying the light reflected from hair samples , castor oil hair treatments were found to increase the luster of hair . This effect is caused by castor oils ability to coat the hair shaft , sealing in moisture and creating a silkier surface . Dull hair may benefit from the use of castor oil hair treatments , either in conditioners or in the form of a hot oil treatment . For optimum shine , use a hot oil treatment once per month or moisturizing treatments weekly . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalp . <h> 2 . Improve Scalp Circulation <p> Castor oil on your scalp can help to increase circulation . The strengthening effect it has on hair follicles can stimulate hair growth in cases of alopecia , or hair loss . <h> 3 . Prevent Hair Loss <p> The antifungal and antibacterial properties in castor oil are useful in combating scalp infections , such as follliculitus , ringworm and peidra . Infections and scalp disorders are major causes of hair loss . Pathogens and micro-organisms such as viruses , bacteria , fungus and parasites can attack your skin and scalp , leading to bald patches and impeding hair growth . <h> 4 . Control Split Ends <p> Castor oil as a conditioning treatment can help reduce split ends , which in turn prevents hair loss and breakage . Omega 6 essential fatty acids , vitamin E , proteins and other nutrients in castor oil can penetrate dry and damaged hair , smoothing rough cuticles and helping the hair shaft retain moisture . Castor oil has a viscous consistency , so mixing it with lighter oils such as olive and jojoba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hair . <h> 5 . Sealing <p> Castor oil is a popular ingredient in hair products formulated for highly textured hair because it is known for its ability to seal moisture in the hair , combatting the natural dryness of these hair types . Apply it after moisturizing with a water-based product for a long-lasting seal . <h> 6 . Treatment of Dry Scalp or Dandruff <p> Castor oil contains fungicidal , germicidal and insecticidal properties , making it an effective treatment for many causes of dandruff . In addition , castor oil hair treatments seal in moisture when applied to either the hair or the scalp , making it an excellent scalp moisturizer . If you have dry scalp or dandruff , apply castor oil directly to dry areas prior to washing or shampooing the hair . <h> 7 . Moisturizing Scalp &amp; Thickening Hair <p> Omega 6 fatty acids in castor oil help keep your scalp from drying out , while regular use of castor oil may encourage thicker hair growth . Unrefined castor oil is preferred over refined types , because it contains more nutrients and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scalp massages to stimulate hair growth and keep your hair soft and manageable .

I use it on my edges to thicken up more , and when I do n't  have any of that left then I will use Wild Growth Oil in the white bottle .

@@72561700 @1261700/ <h> 4 Methods To Trim Natural Hair <p> We can agree that some people do not need to trim their hair often while others really need to in order to keep damage at bay . The way you choose to trim your hair is entirely dependent on you , your hair goals , your hairs rate of damage and your skills . Here are 4 video tutorials describing the main ways to trim natural hair : <p> 1 . The Search and Destroy Method <p> This is the most time consuming method but it does have the added benefit of conserving the most hair . You need patience and diligence to filter through individual strands and cut away only damaged split ends or knots . You will need good light and a mirror or two if your hair is not long enough to pull down and see the individual strands . Entertain yourself with a movie ( or two ) if necessary . <p> 2 . Trimming individual twists or braids <p> If you do not have time for a search and destroy then this method may be for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair from the end of medium to small twists or braids .

The straight hair trim <p> It really is not necessary to straighten your natural hair for a trim . However , if you happen to have straightened your hair or you regularly wear your hair straight , then trimming it in this state has the advantage that shrinkage is eliminated . Less shrinkage means hair is easy to handle and you never cut off more than you intend to . If you are looking to have an even hair cut , then this too is the method for you <p> 4 .

My sections are probably similar in size to the individual braid/twist trim . I do not trim in braids or twists because the pattern of the twist or braid does not allow for the ends of all the hairs to culminate at the end of the twist or braid . So i do it in loose sections while twisting . I will part a section to twist , trim it , then twist it . I trim as a part of my protective styling process every 4 months . <p> I trim just about the same way ( more often , because my hair is fine and prone to damage ) .

But before you call up your stylist , you should know protective styling is not a 100% guaranteed path to long hair. - Protective styling can be a hit or miss ; it could also be beneficial or detrimental depending on the individual and/or style chosen . <p> So when is protective styling not protective ? <p> 1 . You do n't  take care of your hair while its being " protected " . - I can say that the main reason MOST Black women wear synthetic hair is convenience . - Some women live by the mantra of : " I 'd rather wear a wig or weave because I wo n't have to deal with my hair for the next 3 months . " To that I say , I 'm sorry but- your hair still needs care ( wash , deep condition , and moisturize ) while its being protected . <p> 2 . Your REAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine. - Its not uncommon for women to purchase all sorts of products to help with the maintenance of their braids and weave and almost nothing for their own hair . They think as long as the weave or braids look okay , then their hair underneath is okay . <p> Its important to acknowledge the weave on your head is not YOUR hair . The hair that 's growing out of your body should take- precedence over what 's wrapped around it or what 's worn on top of it . There 's no reason why you should n't wash , condition and moisturize your hair while its under a weave . The- end result of failing to do this can result in dry and weak hair which will easily break off- when the style is being taken down . <p> 3 . Your stylist trims the hair that 's sticking out of a braid ( corn rows , singles , twists e.t.c ) to give - your style a more polished look. - Please DO NOT let your stylist do this to your hair ! Instead , tell her to take her time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " later on . When your stylist trims the hair that 's sticking out , they 're actually giving you a- messy haircut- which might be noticeable after you take the style down . Shes also putting the aesthetics of your style over the health of your hair . To avoid this , you could stretch your hair out with African threading or do a blow-out so your hair is less frizzy and ready to be styled . <p> 4 . Your braids are too heavy. - I still do n't  understand why anyone would carry 20 pounds of hair on their head and think its stylish . When the hair is parted in very small sections and braided with a heavy piece of synthetic hair , your hair will end up being pulled from your scalp , thus resulting in bald spots . - Long box braids are okay if your hair is parted in large sections . If you must do long and chunky braids , I suggest you- opt for lighter hair such as Marley hair . <p> 5 . Your braids are too tiny Again , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the style stylish , but quite frightening . Hair that is parted in very tiny sections and braided with a heavy braid can be- easily pulled and uprooted each time the braid is manipulated- and put into different styles . Additionally , depending on how long you keep the braids in and the amount of care you give your hair while its braided , it might be difficult to detangle the hair and remove build up when its time to take down the style . <p> 6 . Your braids are too tight We all know the consequences of tight hairstyles , so I do n't  need to elaborate on this . <p> 7 . You cut off your own hair when taking down your braid&lt; <p> I still remember the time one of my sisters gave herself a- messy haircut when she cut off her hair with the braid , with the hopes of- reducing the time spent on loosening her braid . If you do n't  know the length of your hair , its best to probably cut only a few inches of the braid off and spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved a lot of time dealing with your hair during the weeks you had your hair put away . No need to be lazy = <p> 8 . You have an impatient and ignorant Stylist There is nothing more detrimental to the hair than an impatient and ignorant hair stylist who insists on combing dry coily hair with a fine tooth comb or thinks its ok to do a blow out on dry hair with the wrong tool and without a heat protectant . How about when they are so impatient with our coils that they would rip through the hair when parting and styling it only because we chose to wear our hair in its coily state ? - To avoid any hair tragedy , its best to AVOID these type of hair stylists . And if you are visiting a stylist for the first time , ( even with a reference from another natural ) I recommend you stretch your hair before going so its easier and faster to work with . <p> 9 . You do the same style each time While there 's no scientific proof for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braids , million twists , and any other type of braided hairstyles every single time you style your hair can- weaken the strands. - Cornrows do n't  pull on the hair or weigh it down as much as single braids does , so its best to rotate between these types of hairstyles . <p> 10 . You keep the style in for way too long ! Hair kept in braids , particularly heavy and tiny ones for a long period of time will eventually be weakened and thus shed in chunks or even break . This is especially true when cleansing , conditioning and moisturizing is not performed whilst the hair was in braids . The length of time your hair can handle a protective style will vary from person to person . I have found that I achieve the greatest benefits with protective styling when my hair is left in braids no longer than- 5 weeks. - Anything after this time frame often results in excessive breakage regardless of me being diligent with cleansing and moisturizing . <p> Take Home Point Whatever style you choose to protect your hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break in between styles. - These breaks will allow you to properly wash and deep condition your hair while its out and free . You 'll also be able to try out different hair care recipes , techniques , styles and products in your hair . Most importantly , - it will allow you to get to know YOUR hair at its current length .

Its just that most people tend to think of braided extensions and weaves as protective styling .

While in many ways she was a pioneer in her own right , the history of our hair is as rich and diverse as it is beautiful . As Black History Month draws to a close ( not really though , this thing is all day every day ) , I could n't resist the opportunity to take some time out and capture the essence of a few enterprising people and brands in the natural hair world . This list is by no means comprehensive and complete , please feel free to mention more pioneers in the comments ! <p> Annie Turnbo Malone ( 1869-1957 ) <p> Born in 1869 to former slaves , Illinois-born Malone was truly a pioneer in black haircare . She had a particular affinity for hairdressing and chemistry , and by the age of 20 had developed her own shampoos and scalp treatments to grow and straighten black hair . By 1902 she had become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products .

Walker . Malone would go on to become one of the nations wealthiest black women , a leading entrepreneur in cosmetics , and generous philanthropist . Her Poro brand grew internationally by 1926 , with outlets in North and South America , Africa , and the Phillipines , and over 70,000 employees . At the height of her empire , Malone was worth over $14 million a considerable amount of wealth , even by todays standards . <p> She developed Poro Products for her hair care and beauty product line , the Poro System for merchandising , distributing and marketing , built her own million-dollar building aptly called the Poro Building and established the Poro Colleges of Beauty Culture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salon and sales business . Her goal was to produce a sales force network of agents to spread the Poro System .

After spending 14 years as a mechanic in the Air Force and with Lockheed International in Ontario , Dyson decided to switch careers and enroll in beauty college in Ontario in 1969 . As a part of his cosmetology education , Dyson realized that in more than 1,600 hours of classroom instruction , only one hour had been devoted to hair cutting styles and techniques for black hair . After graduation , Dyson went on to work for Seligman &amp; Latz , which owned salons in department stores nationwide , including the salon inside of May Co. in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles . It was at this particular salon that Dyson developed the thermal blow-drying technique , which consisted of attaching a nozzle to a dryer and blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was set on curlers underneath a hooded dryer . While working at May Co. salon , Dyson developed training programs for styling black hair .

This idea came to fruition with him at the helm of Seligman &amp; Latz-owned chain , Soul Scissors . Dyson was the first president and chief executive of Soul Scissors , which expanded from Oakland to D.C. and grew to include 55 salons across the country. - - <p> Anu Prestonia <p> Since 1978 , Anu Prestonia has been a force to reckon with in the realm of natural hair . Prestonia has loved doing hair , - particularly braiding and natural hairstyles since childhood . In 1989 , she opened the award-winning , famed natural hair salon Khamit Kinks in NYC . Prestonia has a number of accomplishments and accolades under her belt , as well as magazine features , and an endless roster of loyal celebrity and high profile clients including Oprah and Stevie Wonder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the popular natural hair styles we see today , including Senegalese Twists ( Prestonia literally flew to Senegal to learn the techniques ) , Trini Braids , Goddess Braids , and many more .

Inspired by the transformative power of nature and botanicals , Prestonia and her Essentials line seek to provide ingredient-conscious support and solutions to meet client needs for quality hair care . <p> Lisa Price <p> - <p> In the early 1990s , Lisa Price worked on the set of the hit sitcom , The Cosby Show . In her free time , she would experiment with homemade beauty and perfume concoctions , and shared them with friends and family . When production wrapped in 1992 , Price devoted more time to her kitchen mixes , creating products such as Love Butter , Hair Milk , and Black Vanilla Hair Smoothie . She would sell her products at flea markets in Brooklyn , but eventually ended up running a storefront out of her living room as word of mouth spread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daughter . Her loyal customer base exponentially grew , and went on to include celebrities such as Jada Pinkett-Smith , Erykah Badu , and Rosie Perez .

To date , the Carols Daughter brand has 9 stores nationwide , more than 80 employees , and does millions of dollars in sales each year . Regardless of how you feel about her products , it is undeniable that Lisa Price has helped pave the way for natural hair products in the mainstream arena . <p> Chris-Tia Donaldson <p> Most naturals know Chris-Tia Donaldson by her increasingly popular line of hair products , tgin .

Upon graduating from Harvard Law School , Donaldson wore a wig for over two years at her first law firm to conceal her natural hair and assimilate into what she believed was the acceptable image of a Black woman in corporate America . After nearly being let go at her first job , Donaldson made a firm decision to embrace her true and natural self , as a corporate lawyer , author , and entrepreneur . Donaldsons book , Thank God Im Natural : The Ultimate Guide to Caring for and Maintaining Natural Hair is in its fourth printing , and her Thank God Its Natural ( tgin ) product line launched in 2012 . <p> Chicoro <p> - <p> After struggling with growing and maintaining her own hair from childhood , - Chicoro embarked on a self-help journey to better understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment in college where two inches of her hair literally snapped off in her hand , Chicoro decided to do her own research about growing long , healthy hair instead of relying on the abundance of misinformation that existed .

This book and her many methods within it have been adopted and re-shared by everyone from Jc of The Natural Haven to Curly Nikki . <p> Leila Noelliste <p> I promise , this is not a shameless plug . Although Black Girl with Long Hair did not come into existence until 2008 , Leila Noelliste is inarguably one of the most influential pioneers in the area where new media and natural hair intersect .

Although there were a few blogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the void was clearly evident .

@@72561706 @1261706/ <h> 4 Benefits of Essential Oils for Hair Health and Growth <p> Essential oils in my book are a source of huge fun as it feels like a beautiful fragrance has been trapped in a bottle . Essential oils can be extracted from a wide range of plants ( flowers , seeds , leaves , peel ) . They evaporate very easily ( volatile ) and generally have a strong scent ( aroma based oil ) . As essential oils are highly concentrated in aroma and are volatile , they are in most instances diluted in a carrier oil . A carrier oil essentially carries the essential oil to the skin or hair . A suitable carrier oil will have little to no fragrance of its own for example jojoba oil , sunflower oil , grapeseed oil , sweet almond oil etc .

This is not acceleration of hair growth but rather supporting hair to regrow . For faster growth , a study performed on mice showed that Jujuba oil ( also know as jujube or red date oil ) stimulated minimally faster growth of around 1 1.5 mm more per month compared to no essential oil use .

I definitely want to incorporate essential oils into my hair care , but I 'm concerned about the quantity of oils to use . How much is usually recommended 3drops , 5drops ?

You can add less if you want a lower fragrance or a little more if you want a stronger one but you should be careful not to go too much over the 10 drops . <p> It is actually a matter of experimentation of finding the perfect smell . I tend to find that fragrances like ylang ylang and vanilla help to reduce the scent of stronger fragrances live lavender or thyme . However it is truly your choice and your experiment . <p> I love my essential/carrier oil mix of rosemary , lavendar , cedarwood , and thyme in olive oil . I have just recently added peppermint and tea tree oil to the mix , and I am looking forward to using it in the future . 
@@72561707 @1261707/ <h> How to Use Sulfur for Hair Growth <p> Sulfur is a naturally occurring mineral , and the third most abundant in the human body behind calcium and phosphorus . In the body , it is a necessity for proper synthesis of proteins and enzyme , vitamin conversions , joint health , metabolizing amino acids , hair , nail , and skin health , and more . <p> What Does Sulfur Do for Hair ? Sulfur is often referred to as one of the building blocks of hair , with good reason . Our hair is comprised of a durable protein called keratin , which is high in sulfur content . Sulfur is required for proteins ( like keratin ) to maintain their shape , which contributes directly to the overall health , strength , and elasticity of hair . More exciting is that there are studies indicating that sulfur has positive effects on hair growth . The life cycle of your hair consists of 3 phases : growing , resting , and shedding .

But nothing could rid her of the scaly white flakes that sat sometimes visibly on her scalp or shoulders . <p> She saw a brochure a few weeks ago on a study that aims to help black women who wrestle with dandruff . She joined a study under way at St. Louis University . <p> " Dandruff is a nuisance and affects peoples lifestyles , " said Dr. Jeaneen Chappell , a researcher and resident in dermatology at St. Louis University School of Medicine .

" African-American women do n't  have dandruff because they do n't  wash their hair , " Chappell said . " Its because they do n't  want to use the most common treatments . " Dandruff is caused primarily by a fungus called malassezia , Chappell said .

The reason most black women tend to not have long hair is because of poor maintenance not genetics . Regardless of race , some people grow long hair while some do not . <p> There was an article on here awhile ago that explained the hairstyles African women wore before being colonized . African women over the entire continent of Africa had long hair , so if it is in the genes , then genetically , all women of African descent can grow long hair . Some people from east Africa have a looser hair texture which is easier to take care and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also have thick , tight curls like West Africans . <p> there is a point in what you say , most africans you see in media have short hair but when I was in africa I did not see one african woman with svaved head , most of them had braids or in a updo . I have seen pictures of my father during the 70s with a big afro and my grand mother also has long " natural " hair though she use heat on it once a week , and they are all south west africans . <p> But how many Black women are actually growing their hair naturally ( no relaxers , no heat ) ? And how many of them are using healthy protective styles ? I do n't  even think you can look at afro-textured hair women in Africa because so many traditionally cut their hair for cultural reasons . I say look at the female children ( which sadly I think is not going to be possible with mothers relaxing their hair so early ) , boys and men .

I 'm currently experimenting and taking MSM as a aid for hair growth and many other things as well . I like the concept of " terminal length " it explains the hair growth process a bit more .

I wish there was some way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i really want to reach apl . <p> No no no ! ! ! You missed the point entirely . She was saying that terminal lengths do exist , but it follows from the fact that since most people reach their terminal length at 2-6 years , then most women can achieve anywhere from 1-3 feet of hair ( that means around bra-strap length at the least for the hair at the nape of the neck ) .

@@72561713 @1261713/ <h> 5 Warning Signs of Bad Natural Hair Products <p> Are you planning to try a new product soon ? My general ethos is that if you are curious about how a product works , you should buy it and try it . I do however think that there are some red flags about certain products that would make me question their claims or efficacy . Products that make my blacklist include : <h> 1 . Any water based conditioner which does not list water as the first ingredient <p> I have previously stressed that the vast majority of hair conditioners contain a large amount of water . It would not be uncommon for a conditioner to be 90-95% water. - - There are exceptions for conditioners that are pastes e.g mud based blocks or washes such as Ojon , rhassoul- and bentonite clay. - - If a manufacturer is not honest enough to list the ingredients in the correct order , I do not trust that the product really is what they say it is or does what they claim it will do . <h> 2 . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sometimes used by manufacturers to disguise other ingredients in the product such as preservatives and mineral oil . My suspicion is raised further if the word fragrance appears towards the top of the ingredient list because most genuine fragrances based on citrus extracts or essential oils tend to be added in tiny amounts . As an example , perfumes for use in hair products are often dissolved in mineral oil bases with a small amount of preservative . If only a little is used this would not be a worry or concern to me but if the word fragrance appears in the first five ingredients , I would be suspicious as perhaps the mineral oil content of the perfume is actually a major ingredient . <h> 3 . Any shampoo which does not contain an oil or silicone <p> Shampoos can be very drying as a result of their ability to strip oil . In order to mitigate the drying effect most commercial store bought shampoos will contain a silicone of some sort ( sometimes water soluble -identifiable by amine or amo within the name ) . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shampoos will instead contain a small fraction of a natural oil or butter. - - This small addition of oil changes the shampoo from a potentially super drying formula to one which cleanses but does not become overly dry . <h> 4 . Any product which is not a leave-in and contains mineral oil in the first five ingredients <p> Mineral oil is much maligned in the natural world but it is very effective to help seal in moisture and block humidity . It is therefore quite appropriate as a leave in product or as a post-styling product for straightened hair . I would however say that there are more useful and potent oils that work better in shampoo and conditioners . I would not select a shampoo or conditioner that contained mineral oil in general but the big red flag is mineral oil in the first five ingredients . My preference is for ingredients that would perform a major function such as penetration for repair and moisture , additional slip for combing and creating a permeable barrier for moisture . For these functions a natural oil or butter or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product with an ingredient list that is missing or incomplete or too short <p> With the exception of traditionally made soap , all hair products need to have an ingredient list . Soap which has added ingredients for a function e.g oil , glycerin , fragrance or colour needs to have an ingredient list . Any product sold without clearly stating the ingredients is not worth a purchase . You have no clue as to what is in the bottle or whatever is claimed by the manufacturer is really true . If you are looking to purchase a shampoo or conditioner and the product claims to contain a particular ingredient but you can not see it on the list , just avoid purchasing it . If a water based conditioner has fewer than 5 ingredients listed , be really careful before purchasing as this is an exceptionally short list . <p> Thank you for this article . I know its pretty old . I like how realistic it is , example " Any water based conditioner which does not list water as the first ingredient " . Some articles put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural " ingredients work for my hair and I have tried a few of them . <p> I agree with everything except a portion of #5 . A short ingredients list is not necessarily a red flag particularly in lines created by small businesses . When it comes to my hair products I believe less is more . If the first five ingredients are the most important how many more should there be ? <p> It is interesting that you mention that you are transitioning . This list is intended for people with natural hair , if your hair is relaxed you may find that mineral oil actually works well as a conditioner . Relaxed hair does not hold moisture as well as natural untreated hair will . Products that coat hair and do not penetrate like mineral oil are great for relaxed hair in a conditioner as they will help towards protecting moisture from escaping . <p> I like that JC mentioned that these can be red flags , although the best way is to try out the product for yourself . I only say that because the products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they leave me with awesome results . <p> Very informative article ! I will keep all this in mind . Regarding number 5 : Theres a particular hair product line geared towards naturals that has been out for YEARS but still do n't  have any ingredient information listed ont heir website or on their products . I emailed them a couple of years ago to ask about it and they said theyd be adding it on their website soontill this day nothing ! I do n't  get how they expect anyone ( especially a very informed natural hair community ) to just slap their product on their head while not knowing what is in it and hoping Read more + 
@@72561717 @1261717/ <h> 7 Ways to Break Out of a Styling Rut <p> When styling natural hair , it can be easy to fall into boredom and repetition . You find yourself doing the same tired style over and over again and before you know it , you 're none too happy with your hair . Due to its texture , natural hair is insanely versatile , and there are always new styles coming out of the natural community ! Here are 7 ways to break out of the styling rut , should you find yourself in one . <h> 1 . Modify hairstyles that you love <p> You might be browsing through photos thinking , That style looks amazing , but my hair is too long/short to do it. But there are plenty of ways to modify styles ! For example , If your hair is too short to gather into one , try flat twisting it to the center or if a style requires you to have a short afro , try working with your hair while its in a short , shrunken state . If the necessary modifications are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a family member or friend that 's good at doing hair . They can help you figure out how to achieve the look you want . <h> 2 . Go to the Salon <p> Natural hair culture is very do-it-yourself , but there 's nothing wrong with going to the salon from time to time . Many stylists whether they specialize in natural hair or not are good at cornrowing , braiding and flat twisting . If you 're unsure of the stylist , meet with them before hand to lay out exactly what you want . If you do n't  trust the salon prep , ask if you can show up with your hair already washed , conditioned and ( if necessary ) blowdried . And do n't  be afraid to ask them to be gentle ! Even if you have to say that you have a medical condition that requires gentle handling ( and hey , its true if you count tender-headedness as a medical scalp condition = <h> 3 . Build an inspiration board <p> Sites like Tumblr and Pinterest are perfect for keeping track of styles that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps you 'll see a pattern . You might find that you 're drawn to styles that are highly detailed , or looks that are big and out . Perhaps you like styles that are more geometric , or looks that are more reserved . Figuring out what you love is half the battle . <h> 4 . Do the opposite of what you normally do <p> here 's an easy tip just take the plunge and switch it up ! If you normally wear your hair up , try an out style . If you normally wear your hair out , try an updo . Break through your reservations and try things youve always wanted to try , like a new color , a second big chop or locs . Learning to have fun with your hair is essential . <h> 5 . Start out as a copycat <p> YouTube and blogs are full of naturals with incredible styling skill . Start by mimicking the styles they do , then branch out and add your own twist . Many natural hair styling gurus got their start by copying former gurus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cheat with heat <p> When used safely and sparingly , heat styling can be a fun way to switch things up . Plus , its great for trimming and length checks . Many naturals notice that straightening natural hair gives a smoother , shinier finish than when their hair was relaxed . Now , if you 're going to a stylist for this make sure you go to one that knows how to work with natural hair ! This is definitely a situation where you want to be super picky about the stylist you choose because heat damage is irreversible ! <h> 7 . Go for extensions <p> Extensions are a great way to play with length and volume . You can add pieces to a section of your hair , or do a full set of twist or braid extensions . Keep in mind that , if not properly applied , extensions can lead to traction alopecia . Furthermore , the extra hair can expedite the drying out of your strands . Be sure that your extensions are not too heavy and that you are moisturizing your hair frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rut when you get bored with your hair ? <p> keep posting regularly with fresh new content . this will also show readers that you care about your blog and are working hard to keep providing them with new information . poor quality content if the content you are providing your readers <p> I definitely get frustrated with my hair because of the severe shrinkage in my crown . I will try some copycatting right away , tho. : ) I will say , I am a hairstylist and I completely agree with the treatment of naturals in most salons . Having been on both sides of the fence , I provide my clients with the best of both worldsAnd in my opinion , caring for my natural clients has increased the care I give my relaxed clients . <p> Cosign w/Deanna !

@@72561719 @1261719/ <p> Blog reader Charese has given me another reason to use my microscope , yay ! She asks , I 've heard many people say that hair shears are superior to paper scissors and the hair trimmed with anything other than hair shears will soon split again . Is this true ? Are hair shears so sharp that cutting paper or fabric with them with ruin them ? Finally , is there any difference between a cut made with $5 shears vs. say $90 ones ? <p> The Experiment The natural thing to do was to experiment ! I used my own shed hair for the process . I snapped it with my hands , cut it with blunt scissors , a sharp pair of paper scissors and with hair shears ( which cost about $25 ) . I then looked at each cut end under the microscope . <p> The Results First , if you did n't  think snapping your hair is bad , well here is the proof ! It is terrible for your hair , creating a fibrillated end that is just ripe for splitting . Cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are signs of damage to the cuticle where the scissor repeatedly rubbed against the fibre before cutting ( highlighted within the white circles ) . <p> Hair cut with a sharp pair of paper scissors and hair cut with shears both produced a nice clean end . I would say though that this was just a single hair strand and I would subjectively prefer the hair shears when cutting more hair as the blades are slimmer which would prevent hair getting caught . Paper scissors have thicker blades so when handling a small fistful of hair , may not work so well . <p> The Conclusion Do you need to purchase an expensive pair of shears ? Perhaps not , unless you are a hairdresser . They are often more expensive because the blades are thinner and they may be lighter but sturdy and therefore can be used more times before becoming blunt . They can also often be professionally sharpened . Cheaper shears will still do the job , they will just blunt faster ( I had a $10 pair that lasted about 2 years , my $25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced soon ) . <p> The bottom line is : cut your hair with a sharp pair of scissors .

You are right , having a dedicated pair of shears for hair only is important . Hide them when they are not in use if you do not live alone , to prevent any mishaps .

@@72561721 @1261721/ <h> 4 Keys to a Healthy Scalp <p> Your healthy scalp is the birthplace of your healthy hair care journey . It is helpful to think of your scalp as the " fertile ground " from which your hair will sprout and grow . If properly tended to , your hair will thrive . Maintaining a healthy scalp is very important for optimal hair growth . <h> The Functions of a Healthy Scalp <p> The skin cells on the surface of the scalp naturally shed as new healthy scalp cells are formed . The scalp cells are shed as minute particles that are invisible to the naked eye . This process is so highly synchronized that it often goes undetected until the process is thrown out of sync . When the scalp skin cell replacement process is disrupted , dandruff and other scalp issues arise . <p> The basic life of a cell , whether it be the hair cells replicating within the follicle itself , or the cells present on your scalp , involves several basic functions . All cells need a supply of water , nutrients from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to " respire " and eliminate waste . Frequent hydration through the process of shampooing and conditioning will help keep this process in good working order . <h> What is a healthy scalp ? <p> Healthy scalps are those where the skin is toned , pliable , and stimulated . A toned and flexible scalp indicates a healthy network of connective tissue and nourishing blood vessels , and a pliable scalp skin allows for better circulation to the hair follicles . A healthy scalp is also a clean , stimulated scalp . Here are the top 4 ways to maintain a healthy scalp : <h> 1 . Clutter Free is the Way to Be ! <p> The scalp is an extension of the face . Just as pores can become clogged on the face , the follicles of the hair can experience the same type of obstruction if products are placed directly on it . This is especially true of heavy oils and greases . However , many women of color in particular are known for religiously slathering heavy oils upon the scalp . When products are allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions become unfavorable and problems with dryness and growth will arise . <p> The scalp produces its own perfect oil , sebum , and does not need help from us via topical products . Some notice that their scalp is chronically dry and flakes , but this condition is only aggravated by the addition of products onto the scalp skin . It creates a vicious cycle of dryness . The scalp will produce less sebum to compensate for the products you are putting on it . And without this constant even production of sebum , the function of the scalp is thrown off balance . Dandruff and dryness return from the lack of sebum production , and then we tend to want to put more oils on the scalp thinking this will help . Then again , the scalp cuts back on sebum and dryness returns . The scalp , like any other skin needs to be able to respire ( perspire ) etc . With heavy concoctions on the scalp clogging the pores , an unhealthy environment for growth is created and the function of the scalp is hindered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hydrate the scalp is simply through frequent washing and conditioning . This keeps the scalp skin clear of any obstructing clutter and keeps it moisturized and supple . <p> For moisturizing and styling , apply your products from the newgrowth all the way to the ends avoiding the scalp as much as possible . Some product will inadvertently touch the scalp during the normal course of moisturizing , but avoid actively going through and coating the scalp with heavy oils . <h> 2 . Keep Your Hair Products Gentle ! <p> Avoid stripping shampoos with harsh , primary detergents like ammonium and sodium lauryl sulfate . Use clarifying shampoos sparingly only once or twice per month , and moisturizing shampoos for weekly cleansing . If you are a swimmer , make sure that all traces of chlorine are removed from the hair with a chelating shampoo like Paul Mitchells Shampoo Three immediately , and then follow your washing session with a moisturizing deep conditioning . Those who workout and sweat heavily should rinse the scalp with cool water to remove drying salt deposits on the scalp after those activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shampoos , make sure that conditioning products are thoroughly rinsed from the hair . Lingering bits of conditioner upon the scalp can masquerade around as dandruff and appear flaky . Proper and thorough rinsing of the scalp is critical . <h> 3 . Avoid Sources of Extreme Heat <p> The heated air from blowdryers and hooded dryers are major moisture depleters for the scalp . Be sure to direct blowdryer heat down the hair shaft and not directly toward the scalp . This also prevents roughing of the- cuticles- from improper air direction flow . Avoid exposing the scalp to temperature extremes . <h> 4 . Balance Your Diet ! <p> Maintaining a healthy diet is imperative for proper scalp care and hair nourishment as new hairs leave the follicle . Your hair and nails are the last parts of your body to receive nutrition . Once the other vital organs of your body ( brain , heart , kidneys ) have received their nutrition , then and only then does the body supply the hair . The follicle supplies your hair with all of the nutrients available from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once your hair leaves the follicle , it is no longer living , and no longer continues to receive any benefit from a late change to a healthy diet . Without the continued nourishment from the follicle and scalp , the hair is on its own at this point . <p> Vitamins and minerals are essential for hair growth and your overall health in general . Nutritional imbalances may result in inadequate nourishment to our scalps which may hinder hair growth and scalp health . Crash and fad dieting are major scalp health destroyers . This type of dieting often leads to nutritional deficits and triggers hair and scalp problems . Vitamin and mineral deficits have a strong impact on the overall strength and integrity of the hair . <p> Adopting a proper diet will not only benefit your hair , but also benefit your overall wellness . A diet high fresh fruits and vegetables is best . Foods rich in B vitamins : nuts , peas , beans , whole grains are also musts . Lean on a diet that consists of unsaturated fats . Research has shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function . <p> For the best scalp care , avoid smoking . Smoking constricts the arteries and the small blood capillaries , while slowing down blood circulation . Regular exercise will help improve the condition of your hair . Physical activity reduces stress and increases the blood flow to the extremities , including the head and scalp . <p> This is what I did:1 . Do n't  use any heat on your hair for the whole summer- I guess this one does n't  rlleay apply anymore since summers over , but you can still just do this during a random 3 months . No straighteners , blowdriers , curling irons , etc . My hair had basically stopped growing for a little bit but once I did this , it started to grow . And it was healthy . I do n't  have any split ends or hair damage . 2 . Eat right , drink lots of water , and exercise3 . Massage your scalp- I 've heard this helps your hair but I personally do n't  know.

@@72561722 @1261722/ <h> How to Cut Down on Shedding <p> I 've noticed that a lot of hair has been coming out when I detangle my hair . I 'm just not sure if I should be losing that much , maybe I 'm a little paranoid . But if it is breaking , I really want to handle it before it goes haywire . Sometimes even when I slightly manipulate it , I 'll see some falling out.Some hair background : - I wash my hair twice a week , deep conditioning when I do . I use an all natural shampoo and only shampoo once per session . I use burdock root butter from Qhemet for moisture and the balm for my scalp . Shea butter , too . I use a leave-in treatment . Oh , and also , I have no skills when it comes to styling , so I just rock a twist-out fro-ish thing . I think my texture is 4c , though the back and sides are a bit softer . Middle is waaay kinkier . I 'm attaching a pic of the hair I shed when I detangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is normal to lose 50-100 hairs a day . This number can vary depending on how often you comb your hair . Of course , this is not something you can easily tell just by looking , especially with the texture and thickness of natural hair . The easiest thing to do is to keep track of your shedding for a few months at a time , especially if you are a recent natural . You may need to get used to what your natural-shedding looks like in contrast to relaxer-shedding . Shedding can increase at certain times of the year , can be linked to changes in a womans cycle and after child-birth ( hormonal ) , medication , illness , malnutrition , or stress . <p> Try reducing the frequency of hair washing. - Twice a week is not a lot , but it is more necessary if you have a lot of product buildup . Many naturals do n't  realize it , but with curlier textures washing is actually a lot of manipulation , especially due to the tedious process of detangling . This does n't  matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , I washed it almost every day with no problems . But with longer hair , this type of manipulation can lead to breakage , especially with the use of shampoo . Cut the shampooing down to once a week or try- co-washing . My hair thrives better with co-washing . It also retains more moisture and stays softer . I do an occasional shampoo or co-wash with baking soda only if I have a lot of product build-up . Does your shampoo have sulfates in it ? Because that can also dry out the hair . <p> For your hair type , - the less you comb the better . This does not mean you should neglect detangling ; because this may result in knots and tangles leading to breakage when you finally do detangle. - It is up to you to decide which detangling routine works best and to pick styles that discourage tangling. - Continue with the deep conditioning for moisture with every wash . If you re-twist many times during the week in preparation for the twist out , this may add to manipulation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be behind any breakage . If your moisturizers are working well for you , I would n't change a thing ! You may find it helpful to mist your twists each night then seal with oil to keep your hair hydrated . <p> If the shedding gets really bad , try a light- protein- treatment . And sometimes a good trim helps with shedding. - There is no need for concern unless the shedding increases or if your hair comes out in chunks just by pulling at it . In that case , I would suggest visiting a dermatologist or trichologist . <p> Ladies , do you experience shedding when you detangle ? How do you deal with it ? <p> I do experience shedding when I detangle . I have a special detangling brush that 's supposed to put less pressure on hair , but years ago I lightened and heat processed way too much and my ends are paying .

@@72561723 @1261723/ <h> 3 Ways To Decrease Shrinkage in Natural Hair <p> Shrinkage is an important issue in caring for natural hair . I am all for embracing shrinkage but this does not mean that I will allow my hair to fully demonstrate just how good it is at doing- this. - Controlling shrinkage does not mean hair has to be stretched out to full length all the time . It actually means learning when hair will shrink , how much it will shrink and how you can reduce this to a manageable level. - Controlling shrinkage has three main benefits : <p> 1 . Easier time detangling <p> 2 . Easier styling by being able to control the amount of stretch . <p> 3 . Breakage reduction i.e learning when your hair will stretch without breaking and when it wo n't <p> Here is how to minimise shrinkage during each of the three basic steps of a simple hair routine : <h> 1 . Cleansing <p> The starting point of most hair routines involves dissolving oil on the hair so that it can be washed off with water . In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar or soap of your choice . <p> - Controlling Shrinkage : - Shrinking during this step is generally expected but can be controlled by loosely braiding or twisting hair in large sections ( between 8 and 15 ) . This will generally prevent hair from fully coiling and tangling once it is in contact with water . It is best not to fight shrinkage beyond what braiding or twisting can do at this stage as although hair tends to feel more elastic when wet , it is actually weaker . <p> Optional Add-ons : Prior to washing , using a penetrating oil such as coconut oil can help control the amount of water that gets into hair . However , - remember that it may not be easy to see a visible impact as when hair is soaked in water , there is no oil that can fully prevent its entry into hair . <h> 2 . Conditioning <p> This is the backbone of most natural hair routines . After cleansing , a rinse out hair conditioner ( this includes deep conditioning ) is used to repair , soften @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conditioner can be used to give added softness and control moisture loss . <p> - Controlling Shrinkage : In this step , the hair conditioner selection does matter . The reason many people with natural hair like thicker conditioners is in part because of the weight of the conditioner . The extra weight allows hair to hang a little more than it would if the conditioner was lightweight . Additionally , if you choose to detangle hair while it has conditioner on , select one with good slip to allow you to reduce the time spent detangling and handling wet hair ( slip means hair can easily slide through the tool of your choice fingers , combs or brush ) . - Twisted or braided sections as described in the cleansing section can also help . <p> Optional Add-ons : - Some ingredients in hair conditioner can help in an indirect way to controlling shrinkage . Surfactants such as behentrimonium chloride make the hair softer and therefore curls and coils can be gently stretched out with minimal force . Proteins- repair defects in hair and therefore - help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Trying out and finding an optimal hair conditioner is definitely worth the effort . <h> 3 . Styling <p> This is the step where you can apply ultimate shrinkage control as hair is moving from a wet state to a dry state . - Do you know why your hair takes on the shape of rollers during a roller set or twists during a twist out but once you spray water on it , it goes back to its original shape ? The answer is shape memory. - Hair can be stretched out and take on the shape of whatever is causing the stretch as it dries . This shape change is temporary and the hair will return to its normal conformation provided it has not been damaged ( i.e not too much force used to stretch or high/prolonged heat ) . - Therefore the stage where you are drying is the point at which you can impact shrinkage the most . <p> Controlling shrinkage : This section focuses on heat-free methods ( i.e excluding blow drying and flat ironing ) . - If you want- to showcase your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch it while it is about 70-80% dry and then allow it to dry- fully before undoing and combing out or twisting/braiding out . The shape changer/stretcher in this case is the braid or twist. - You can also use rollers , flexi rods or curlformers ( which are super easy to use ! ) to stretch out your hair . If you are intending to do a protective style with stretched out hair , you can stretch with any of the previously mentioned methods ( braid/twist outs , roller sets or curlformers ) . <p> Optional- Add-ons : - Shrinkage control only lasts as long as moisture is not added to hair . - This includes environmental moisture like natural humidity or artificial ( from your bathroom ) . - For free hair , maintaining a set style , will usually require you to keep your hair quite dry . Oil applied prior to styling will help reduce moisture take up from the air . However , remember that the drier your hair is , the less elasticity it has , therefore avoid stretching it any further once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use products to set your curls ( works best with hair that can clump/form spiral curls ) . - Styling gels and conditioners can add weight to hair and help hold/enhance natural curls . This method relies on allowing quite a lot of shrinking to occur as the curl should not be disrupted as it sets . <p> Ladies , have you tried any of these methods ? How do you decrease shrinkage ? <p> Ugh I 'm so frustrated with my hair , I live in a very humid area and the minute I step out of the house my hair soaks up all the water in the air , shrinks up and as a result looks super dry ? ? ? ? All I do right now is throw it in a high bun which I 'm really getting sick of <p> Shes right glycerin is great for moisture but when its humid and you want to keep a stretched style stay away.The glycerin will attract the moisture from the humid climate and cause your hair to shrink BUT you hair will feel like butter(literally) . <p> When its humid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I use more butter based product to help keep the extra frizz/shrinkage away . <p> Glycerine . Is a humectant . The culprit that attracts moisture from the hair and ruins your stretched styles . Its a good thing normally . But I do n't  assume people want to put effort in to stretch their hair into a huge fro and then 6 seconds later its half of what it used to be . For stretched or straightened styles try not to use products with glycerine or other humectants in it . <p> I love- receiving questions and have no problems answering inquiries about my natural hair journey . - I probably have more questions than answers. - This is why I love my fellow natural hair enthusiasts like Black Girl With Long Hair . I often stalk her page because she always has the best and most informative material pertaining to the world of natural hair .

Because it seems like the most sensible thing for me to do is do a twist-out after i co-wash to keep it somewhat stretched out . BUT I LOVE HOW MY HAIR LOOKS WHEN I WASH AND GO ! Then , also , sometimes , my twist-outs look a mess . <p> So just switch between them ! You do not have to protect your hair all the time . Do the wash and go when you want to and have time to deal with the shrinkage after . When you need to be efficient and quick , go for the twist out . If you have a length goal , why not protect for 3 weeks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about balance and having fun ! <p> This was very helpful because my hair is always stuff in the same twa but my hair is actually so much longer than it seems but bc the curls are so tight as soon as it gets any wet or moisture its back to the twa ! ! Thank you for the info ! Ill def try this out ! <p> Banding seems to help many . I tried it once but you have to remember to not make the ponytails too close to your scalp . I think I was ripping out my poor edges . Braids work better for me than anything else . Twists are good too but my hair is at a stage where twists unravel by themselves . I do n't  have time for that nonsense . Lol . <p> I sit under a hood dryer for about 30 minutes on low then I use my shea butter mix and put my hair in about 6 to 8 braidsthis method for me has prevented shrinkage real badplus I do n't  like going to bed with damp hairin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is full with very little shrinkage <p> Interesting , I generally do n't  worry about shrinkage , but it appears that shrinkage control is in contrast to having moisturized hair . If water is our friend , then shrinkage control would summarily be bad for our hair . <p> I agree with BJ and AJ . It is all about balance . Constantly wetting your hair without stretching it can lead to more knots and tangling . So what good is the water if it leads you to cutting your hair ? I think that there is a really big difference between wet hair and moisturised hair . Moisturised hair is completely dry to the touch but retains flexibility and elasticity because the internal water absorbed by the hair has been trapped and therefore feels more supple and often softer . I think that it is quite difficult to explain what moisturised hair is in Read more + <p> I do n't  think that this assumption necessarily follows .

I constantly keep moisture in my hair , but I do n't  let my hair just shrink up to my ears , which is what will happen if I leave it alone ( Im APL stretched ) . I think its really dependent on the type of style you choose to do to stretch the hair , and whether its Read more + <p> I think this is true to an extent . However , in my case , if I do n't  try to prevent shrinkage , I wont be able to retain length because of all the little fairy knots I 'll have to cut out . I just make sure that after I wash my hair , I use a product to help to seal the water in for as long as possible . Then when it gets dry , I either decide to wash it or wet it and go back to preparing it for a stretched style . <p> here 's something that I was reminded of this past summer : Keeping hair stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-humectant . After trying several different leave-ins with no success , what finally worked for me and my water-loving hair was petrolatum ( aka Vaseline ) . When I could , I bought some mineral oil-based grease ( for the first time in YEARS ) and got the same result . Score one for the old school ! <p> Ditto for me . People side eye old-school vaseline and mineral oil , but I got ( and still get ) very good results.If anyone can recommend a natural alternative , I 'd try but coconut oil , olive oil , and shea butter are not the ones . <p> Anita Grant does a " no petroleum jelly " . I bought a sample size like a month ago because the harsh weather in the UK had my hands bleeding and cracked . Its really good at creating a barrier . It looks and feels almost exactly like Vaseline . HTH . <p> Yeah but castor oil is n't good for me if I want my hair to stay stretched especially in the summer . It is a humectant so my hair just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . A nonhumectant oil that is heavy would be better . I would use a light oil , petroleum , or shea butter . <p> I did forget to add banding in the last section , it is definitely an option for some women . <p> I think the reason why I forgot it is because it is not really a consistently successful method . Sometimes it gives hair indents which you do not want and then you have to rewet and braid/twist all over again . <p> I twist my hair ( usually 6 large twists ) when I wash my hair to minimize shrinkage , tangles , knots , SSKs , etc . It has helped my hair retain length because I have much less breakage than just letting my hair " go " . Its bra strap length at this point and stretching help with the care and management of my hair .

What touched my edges every 24 hours ? My bonnet . I swap my bonnet with an extra-large scarf now and again . When I use the scarf I do n't  tie it too tightly and I make sure the edges are past my edges ( on my forehead ) . I do n't  do the satin pillowcase b/c I get hot enough as it is with something on my headthat pillowcase is flint to fire for Read more + <p> When I first went natural my edges was thinning out a little due to wearing too many headbands ( my hair in the front was so much shorter than the back because the relaxer broke off all my hair ) and slicking my edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of times you wear tight headbands around your edges 2 ) stop slinking your edges with a brush especially after wetting your hair . <p> I have to agree w/mango abt oil applied to scalp , though I do n't  discount the experiences of others . I too have thinner edges than before due to years of relaxers and weaves and BABY my perimeter like nobodys business . <p> If you see no growth , even with low manipulation , some have heralded taking BIOTIN pills , though NOT rubbing the oil on the scalp.Research the MUA boards for reviews : <p> I used to be embarrased bout my edges . Now , Ive come to terms with them . I 'm also better at styling around them . <p> My edges looked more thin when I first BCedI guess it was the contrast with the short fro and the sparse edges . Approx 2 yrs later , its a little better and my edges have retained a bit of length ( not new hair regenrated from chemically-damaged folicles ) .

I have put my hair in twists for the past few months ( on and off ) and theyve begun to thicken up and grow out ! I also massage mahabhringaraj oil on them every other day to help them remain healthy . I also tuck the ends under if I 'm wearing a bun up and no headbands or heat ! <p> I have had thinning edges for years now , mostly at the area near my temples . To me those areas look almost bald . They are also very tender sometimes , and can feel sore if I touch it too much . I have been natural twice in the past 5 years , and during that time , my thinning areas have not gotten any better , but they have n't gotten too much worse either . But I 'm making it a point to keep better track . I do n't  know what the cause of my thinning edges is ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Read more + <p> Probably not hereditary . One of the reasons that castor oil ( black castor oil ) works so well is because it is an antibacterial and antifungal agent . I had thinned edges and thin spots for years ( on a formerly dense had of hair ) from getting a " dry " curl in the eighties . Suffered hair loss ( from the root ) was never bald , my hair just thinned out . Found out about jbco on the net last year and I kid you not , within 6 months , my hair was back with a vengeance after 20 years ! I no longer deal with tender scalp , itchy Read more + <p> I do n't  use brushes anymore I have now trained my hair to slick down with the use of my fingers only.I still use gel.really do n't  see butter/oils giving me that sleek look that I so adore.but I always apply water , then oil , then my gel then I go back over the gelled area with water then I tie down with a scarf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some topical aids do just that.aid . I used bjco for 2 months on ONE side of my head to see if I was wasting money and time . I had very noticeable growth and fullness on the side that I applied the oil to . The opposite side remained see-through until I started applying the oil to that side . After 6 months , both sides have filled in so beautifully . <p> Thanks for pointing this out . Its a silly myth that keeps getting passed around . However , Minoxidil is applied topically and can reverse recent hair loss that is related to androgen levels . So do n't  try to self-treat with thatthe mode of action is different . The thin edges can be caused by trauma to that arealace front wigs , weaves , braids , and overly frequent and harsh touch ups can be culprits , so if any of these are part of your current or past regimens , that could be why you do n't  currently have a lot of hair left there .

I will say that when I was a little girl , while she was not gentle with the comb outs , my mother never pulled my hair back too severely . It was just something I got used too . <p> @Curly Q and Shones : Can you explain what the castor oil does exactly ? How do you apply it ? And what is diff between cold pressed and not cold pressed ? I am always looking for something to combat dryness . <p> Oh yeah , and I do n't  know the diff between cold-pressed and not . But it sure as heck helps alleviate dryness . I just rub a bit on with my fingers along my hairline , usually before I go to bed , but I 'm going to try twice a day now . I 've heard dozens of people sing its praises , and I figured it ca n't hurt , so I 'm trying it out . <p> I assume that while it does n't  grow the edges it preserves the damaged area from more damage . I suppose it also does n't  hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in , thereby stimulating the follicles in the area . Those would be my guesses . <p> I think for me , it also keeps me focused on that area so I remember to baby it more . <p> I bought a big bottle of castor oil and I put it on my edges at night well see what happens . How often should one apply the castor oil ? <p> I 've always had thick hair and thin edges , but I 'm working on it . And lately Ive been using a very soft elastic I found to pull my hair up into my first puff ; no gel or anything , just gravity . Hairs still somewhat short , but I 've found this elastic to be very gentle and its not pulling anything . <p> Aside from modifying your styling practices , the next best thing is time . The hairline is fragile and maybe its just taking a little longer to recover after years of chemical treatments etc . Keep up with good haircare practices and hopefully soon all will be well . <p> I honestly do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . BUT , I noticed while I was still relaxed that yes , wearing my hair back in tight buns , braids and ponytails did tend to thin my hair a bit .

@@72561727 @1261727/ <h> Natural Hair Type Guide : Which Type Are You ? <p> Over the past few months several readers have asked us to break down hair typing . Whether or not you feel that hair typing is important , the fact remains that it can be difficult to follow along with online discussions without knowing the various texture references . After some searching we found NaturallyCurly.coms hair typing guide to be the most comprehensive although it does not include a type 4c category so we 've included excerpts here . <h> Type 4 Kinky Hair <p> Type 4 is kinky , or very tightly curled , with a clearly visible curl pattern Circumference : Crochet needle or even smaller The hair is very wiry , very tightly coiled and very , very fragile Type 4 hair can range from fine/thin to wiry/coarse with lots and lots of strands densely packed together Type 4 hair has fewer cuticle layers than any other hair type , which means that it has less natural protection from the damage you inflict by combing , brushing , curling , blow-drying and straightening it Type 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual hair length <p> There are two Type 4 subtypes : 4b : Has a " Z " pattern , less of a defined curl pattern .

I have never seen a z-shaped strand ! I think that 's how Andre Walker described it because he has never really dealt with 4b hair . My 4b sections are really tightly compacted and they never clump . But the pattern of the individual strands is like an irregular s-shape with tight coils at the end . I will be so glad when there is an updated definition for 4b hair !

Now in terms of a strand having irregular bends ( as opposed to regular symmetrical turns as in curly or coily hair ) , absolutely . No zigzags , though . I remember when NaturallyCurly folks coined the 3c designation . Its hard to say exactly where 4c came from but at one point Nappturality members were using the term CNapp ( where C = cotton or cloud ) to describe that texture . There 's even a board , CNappyMeNow , that focuses on that texture . For the Read more + <p> Good point I totally agree with you about the irregular bends as opposed to z-shaped . Be sure to take the texture typing survey on naturallycurly.com if you have n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have a better idea of how to classify and/or describe our hair . <p> Thank you ! Because I swear , I 've looked at my strands when finger detangling , and I have yet to find a z-pattern . According to what NaturallyCurly has , I 'm predominantly 4b with patches of 4a at the nape of my neck and parts in the middle of my head . But even still , they 're oddly shaped Ss ( as in S-shaped and backward S-shaped , a couple C-shapes ) , not sharp Zs . <p> I think I am the only one that I know with actual Z-shaped strands ! My hair looks crimped + frizz . They do clump when they feel like it . And the crimps are tight in the back and sides and loose in the front and middle . So I have to agree with the above ladies , this is not a common thing . <p> I have patches of z strands . While most of my hair makes coily corkscrews , some definitely do n't  . They look like frizzy jagged waves . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and the sweetie pie is my Zoe . = img/img <p> I always read that they were straw sized . To me Tracee Ellis-Rosss hair definitely is not pencil sized those curls are larger . I 'm not big on hair typing because the descriptions never match the icons they show representing that hair type . <p> I like your coils too , reminds me of my mothers but she ca n't bear to grow out her hair , she keeps chopping off and prefers it short . But my sister and I ( when we were little ) used to play in it alot , cause it felt soft like down . <p> lol same here , I 'm a type 4 overall , that 's where i stop caring . My hair and everyone elses is too unique to start compiling heads into A , B , Cs especially when everyone has multiple textures ! When you go beyond the general types people start getting touchy and upset because they do n't  see their hair type included or they ca n't figure it out.its just not that serious .

IDK I think overdefining hair types is just another way to make this Read more + <p> What is the point/benefits of hair typing ? To me it brings out the fact that we are not truly happy with our natural hair . Does knowing the hair " type " help one to care for their hair better ? What 's the obsession with curl pattern ? I think styles like twist outs came about as a result of people without any curl pattern trying to have some sort of curl pattern in their hair . I think all natural hair is great , whether straight , curly , kinky etc . <p> i feel the exact same way as you ! for years i 'd never heard of such a system and i continue to fail to see the point of why it is relevant at all . except just another means of dividing people into categories , the way i see it . when someone says " my hair is 4c " or " my hair is 3b ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still havent told me much about your hair . curl pattern , in my experience , does n't  have a whole lot to do with much of anything as relates to hair care . two people can have Read more + <p> I 'm so confused by hair typing . I 've always had natural hair so I was really intrigued when I learned about this but I have yet to find anyone with hair like mine . 3C describes it best but my hair does n't  look like anyone I 've ever seen pictured with it . My curls are big and corkscrewy , but my hair is not fine in the slightest . Its course to the max , and it puffs from the middle . I could never wear my hair down and itd lay down and swoosh like Tracy Ellis Ross ! Lol . I du n no . I wish I had a Read more + <p> That is the one flaw with the hair typing system . It stereotypes visual aesthetics with physical attributes . It deosnt mention how no matter how big or small your curls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair density can be thick or thin . <p> and of course , to be " politically correct " , 4c was left off . Nobody wants to be considered 4c , which I think it ridiculous . Your hair is your hair , whatever type it may be . Due to what is sitting on top of my head right now , I KNOW that hair gets kinkier than that , haha ! My definition of 4c hair ? well , it would be similar ( considering the description above is very broad ) but it would be a little more extreme especially concerning fragility and " curl " pattern . <p> I love my 4c hair . I have discovered by trail and error what my hair loves and when I treat it well I can do rock some wonderful styles . I put my hair into plait extensions from Jan to beginning of March and I missed my hair so much , never again , I love the feel of my 4c hair . <p> In doing some digging I learned that Andre Walkers hair typing system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually does n't  include a 3c or 4c . NaturallyCurly.com members added on a 3c , and NC.com included it in their official typing chart . I guess somewhere along the line other naturals added on a 4c tag to describe extremely kinky hair types , but it has n't  been added to the official chart . <p> I am also a 4c and only detangle after DCing my hair , I think everyone is different . For example I tried the Kimmay leave in conditioner and my hair was dry and brittle even though I tried various conditioners and oils . <p> Ladies , I was thinking the same thing . My mind went : Red alert , Red Alert , major malfunction , at least for me and my 4bc hair . Ladies , if you do n't  know who Ms. Cipriana is and you are blessed with 4b/c hair get on over to urban bush babes . EVERY thing she suggests has worked for me . No matter what I try , I always go back , this time , I stayed ! <p> I see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detangle . I 'm in the camp of 4b/4cs that must detangle on damp , conditioner-soaked hair . " Dry " detangling used to work when my hair was shorter , but does little for me now . As a matter of fact , I think this is more of a fine vs. coarse and high density vs low density characteristic than a hair type characteristic . : o ) <p> I agree with Leila. 10 years ago my hair fell into the definition of 4a because it had a curl as oppossed to z strands . Fast forward to 2011 and many people would have been considered 3b are now 3c and those in 3c are now 4a which means 4as have moved to being 4cs . So I actually think summarising as type 4 is a better alternative . Even better would be a system which classed hair by things that make a real difference curly or kinky or kinky curly , fine or medium or thick strands , easy to wet or Read more + <p> Totally posted that comment on the wrong section . I did want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detangle with coconut oil because it works for me . I do spray my hair with water though to give it some flexibility in the process but it is not wet . I can actually also detangle with conditioner too but my hair has a million percent shrinkage which I am not prepared to deal with . I agree with Loo , I do think that people with fine and very kinky hair may find that dry detangling works . People with medium sized to Read more + <p> So glad that you put in ur 2 pence . Just yesterday I was looking for definitions to separate kinky vs coily vs curly . Your blog just covered kinky and curly . Is there really a coily ? How different is it from the others ? <p> Thanks Naturallyblessed I appreciate the compliment on my work . I do not post photos of myself or family on the net , it is just a privacy thing for me . Carribeancurl I think that coils are simply very tiny curls . In the same way people talk about finger sized curls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think coils are essentially very small diameter curls . Coily hair is definitely curly but could also be kinky too . If I wet my hair completely and allowed it to shrink it would form coils in parts ( I already put up high Read more + <p> Exactly how I feel as a type 4a . Our hair is said to be the most fragile , and Jc of the Natural Haven showed that hair is weakest when it is wet . So what is with the only detangle while loaded with conditioner and soaking wet nonsense . Everytime I did that , I lost a lot of hair . I mean a lot of hair . But with dry/damp detangling , the amount of lost hair is very minimal . <p> I 'm mostly 4b with some 4a curls and I have to detangle on damp hair loaded with conditioner and oil . Detangling my hair drywell let 's just day i might as well get some scissors and give myself a hair cut . LOL . Funny , i actually find the 4b hair sometimes easier to detangle than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That 's interesting because with me it is the exact oppposite . When my hair is dry I can literraly hair the strands rubbing up against eaach other , they more easily tangle with each other rusulting in knots , spilts and other natural disaster . Just goes to show how even among similair hair types you really need to figure out what works for you. : <p> I agree Naptural85 is not a type 4 at all , her curls are so defined , even when she had a TWA she has lovely curls , I know they say that 4c hair if moisturised turns into 3c/4a but I use the LOC method which really moisturises my hair and it is n't like Naptural85s . I would say I am a 4b/c , if I put gel in my hair then I get defined curls with loads of shrinkage but when I wash my hair oh yes , 100% 4b/c . <p> I always find hair typing helpful . For instance , if I 'm looking for advice on youtube , its helpful to know if the person has similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the advice will work . Having 4A hair , if I watch 3c videos , my results will more than likely not match their results . It also helps when forming " hair crushes " and having hair aspirations . Coveting a texture you do n't  have will just leave you feeling depressed and thinking the grass is greener elsewhere and that YOUR hair is n't good enough . Looking at people with gorgeous locs Read more + <p> I kind of feel like their definitions of 3c , 4a and 4b are very broad , which is n't necessarily a bad thing . Since a z-texture is the most highly textured you can get , and they describe that as 4b , then what they consider 4b most women would consider 4c , if that makes sense . <p> It seems that most naturals are some sort of combination of 3c , 4a and 4b . <p> Yes , my daughter is definitely a 3c-4a . Its very confusing for me , even though I have done lots of research since she was little , on how to care best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; I had to teach myself how to care for &amp; style her hair . <p> From what Ive read the 4c type is like the 4b type except there is no discernible pattern , its like a ball of cotton whether its dry or moisturized . I still do n't  know what type my hair is other than to say its a 4a-4b mixture ? LOL ! ! My hair kinda looks like Shingai Shoniwa when its dry but looks like Esperanza Spauldings when properly moisturized . Go figure ! img/img <p> I found that picture of hair types a while ago and it kinda helped me figure out where I stand . 
@@72561732 @1261732/ <h> 7 Hair Straightening Methods Evaluated <p> People with curly or wavy hair will pull , blow , iron , treat or do practically anything else to get straight hair . That- ca n't be good for your hair health , right ? Some treatments are n't even good for your personal health as- Del- over at- Are You A Beauty- recently reported in her piece about the Brazilian- hair- straightening- system . <p> We here at the- Beauty Brains- thought it would be helpful for you to know the 7 most common ways to straighten your hair and the pros and cons of each . <p> 1. - Hairdressings &amp; Silicone Creams . This is a classic hair product based on oily materials like petrolatum , mineral oil , and lanolin . Silicone creams work the same way but contain materials like dimethicone or cyclomethicone . Apply the product all over your damp hair and comb straight . The oils coat your hairs preventing them from curling up when they dry . The most famous of these types of products is- VO5 Hairdressing <p> Evaluation : Incredibly effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The downside is that your hair will feel greasy , get dirtier faster , and can look weighed down . The effect will last until you wash out the product . <p> 2. - Brushing and blow drying. - As hair dries , it tends to curl up . This is a direct result of the water content and the chemical bonds existing in the- hair- fiberproteins . If you can hold your hair straight with a comb and blow dry it , it will hold that position . It 's a bit like using an iron to straighten the wrinkles in clothes . <p> Evaluation : This method is simple , moderately effective but depends heavily on the skill of the person doing it . It 's much easier for a stylist to do than for you to do it on your own hair . It is slightly damaging , will not work on extremely curly hair , and frizzes out in humid weather . It will leave your hair feeling more natural than hairdressings or styling products . So , if you do n't want to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combing out those curls . It may take some time but it should work . <p> 3. - Flat Iron . If you have really curly hair and the blow-drying + combing method does n't work , try using a flat iron . After washing your hair , you comb it and use a flat iron to get it dry and straight . It uses the same principle to get your hair straight but it is more intense and effective on nearly all hair types . Here 's a short video showing how to- straighten hair with a flat iron . <p> Evaluation : Flat irons will work with almost any hair type . If you know what you 're doing it can be done relatively quickly . Unfortunately , it is more damaging to your hair than a blow dryer and will frizz out when humidity is high . Once you 've bought your- flat iron- it 's a relatively inexpensive way to get a straight hair style . <p> 4. - Styling products . If you do n't like the greasy feeling of hairdressings and do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styling product straightening might be for you . These products coat the hair with polymers that rigidly hold the hair straight . Things like- hairsprays , gels , mousses , and putties can all be used . <p> Evaluation : Styling products are effective but require some skill in applying and shaping your hair . They will hold the hair straight better than the blow drying or flat iron methods . The effect will last only until the products are washed out . The primary downside is that your hair may not look and feel natural . <p> 5. - Brazilian Hair straightening . This method is the hottest new hair styling treatment in salons . It even made it into a story in the- New York Times . Your stylist applies a keratin protein formula and uses a flat iron to get your hair straight . Theoretically , the protein will crystalize on your hair and keep it in a straightened state . You are then encouraged not to wash your hair as frequently because you 'll reverse the effect . <p> Evaluation : This procedure works but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hair a few times the protein will come right off and your hair will return to it 's natural , curly state . There 's also the issue of a significant amount of Formaldehyde being included in the formula . It should n't be a problem for you but I certainly would n't want to be the stylist who gets exposed many times a day . This procedure works but you can get the same effect using a flat iron , styling products and less frequent hair washing . <p> 6. - Japanese straightening system . This is a more permanent way to remove the curls from your hair . At &gt;$500 per treatment , it is the most expensive of all the methods outlined here . For the- Japanese straightening system- the stylist applies a special formula all over the hair . Then they use a flat iron and neutralizing solution to get the hair straight . With proper care the effect should last for 6 months . <p> Evaluation : The high price of this procedure has kept most people away from repeat procedures . While we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description of how it 's applied sounds suspiciously like a hair relaxer . The fact that a neutralizing solution has to be used suggests a bond-breaking , chemical reaction . Kudos to the inventor for convincing people to spend that much money on a less harsh version of a hair relaxer . This procedure will permanently get rid of those curls but it 's expensive and incredibly damaging to your hair . <p> 7. - Relaxer . If you want straight hair there is no more effective method than getting your hair relaxed . In this procedure a caustic chemical is applied to your hair and a chemical reaction occurs .

@@72561734 @1261734/ <h> What is the Maximum Length Your Hair Will Grow ? <h> The scientific answer " or is it ? <p> Many women will by now know that hair will on average grow for between 2 to 6 years . This figure is widely quoted as the average length of the anagen phase ( when hair is actively growing during its growth cycle ) . This would therefore translate to a maximum hair length from anywhere between- 8-12 inches ( shoulder to armpit length ) - at the low end to- 24 to 36 inches ( waist length to tailbone length ) - at the higher end- - This all assuming a yearly average growth rate of between 4 and 6 inches . <p> However what many people do not know is that the widely quoted scientific figure is in fact based on 2-3 small scale studies which account for as few as 2 individuals . There are in fact no studies which actually track a reasonable group of individuals over a period of years to firmly determine how long the hair growth cycle actually is . <p> Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be considerably wrong . One interesting study which measured hair length of visitors to US theme parks and hair lengths recorded online on long hair sites , came to the conclusion that the average normal length of the anagen phase could be as long as 12 to 14 years . This translates to 48-72 inches at the low end and- - 56-84 inches at the high end . Both of these figures translate to a maximum hair length of- below tailbone to ankle length and beyond . To be clear , this means that the average person can grow hair to well below tailbone even with a 4 inch per year hair growth phase . <p> The scientific truth is that the maximum hair length that a human being can achieve is not well established and human hair may keep growing for 6 years or longer . <h> The hair care factor <p> Hair length is linked to genetics- but this only determines how fast and how long your hair will grow . It does not account for how well you handle it . Sometimes women look at other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this can be hugely erroneous . If the vast majority of women in your family have very short hair without intentionally cutting it , it does not mean that their hair is incapable of achieving longer lengths . It may in fact indicate that the methods that they use to care for their hair cause it to break . <p> In addition , if you happen to be the only one in your family whose hair appears not to be able to achieve a longer length , the fact is that your hair texture is probably quite different from your other family members . It may be the case that the standard routine used by the rest of your family does not apply to you . This is especially true if your family is of mixed heritage . <p> Once hair is outside of the follicle , the onus is on the owner to maintain it . The less damage it sustains , the more likely it is to be able to achieve its maximum length ( i.e still be present 6 or 12 years after emerging . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain length , you need to change what you are doing at that length in order to help it overcome the breakage . 
@@72561735 @1261735/ <h> Banana , Avocado &amp; Egg Masks : Good for Hair or Just a Hassle ? <p> I 'm a huge fan of DIY when it comes to hair care . Not only does it allow you to save tremendous amounts of money , but you have more control over what ingredients go in ( or on ) to your hair . Plus to me , its fun to experiment , blend , and test out . If you peruse the web , you can find tons of recipes for everything from deep conditioners to styling gels . And for the most part , they 're pretty awesome . But there are those recipes ( especially for deep conditioning and repairing ) that make some claims that can seem pretty loftyat least for food . Were going to explore four of the most popular food masks here . <p> Oat flour masks , conditioner mix-ins , and more are touted across the interwebs as an instant hair thickener . <p> How its Done : Mix in a few tablespoons of oat flour ( I tried Bobs Red Mill ) into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour , and some of your favorite oils ( or water ) . <p> What it 's Supposed to Do : Allegedly , the lipids and the protein in oat flour bind to the keratin in your hair , making it thicker and shiny . <p> Does it Work ? : Sounds good , right ? Simple , inexpensive , and miraculous . Unfortunately , this food additive works in theory only . On the molecular level , the particles of protein within oat flour are too large to penetrate the cuticle of hair . Translation : the protein wont stick to or thicken your hair . All the good stuff goes down the drain . However , a product with hydrolyzed oat flour or oat protein has an altered molecular structure that allows for penetration and promotes thickening of hair . Spare yourself , and leave the oat flour in the kitchen . <p> If Youre Going to Try it : Be prepared to do at least two or three washes or co-washes . Walking around with little brownish-white granules in your hair probably is n't such a great idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banana hair mask as the miracle that will moisturize and reverse damage to hair . And let 's face it , who does n't  at least trust Dr. Oz a smidge ? Besides , how terrible could a banana be ? <p> Does it Work ? : In theory , I could understand how all of the vitamins , nutrients , and enzymes could work to nourish and soften hair . In all of my research , I found no evidence to refute any of the claims made . For now , I 'll file this one under yes . However , it may not be worth the hassle . <p> If Youre Going to Try it : You may be better off with something pre-mixed , like baby food bananas . In my experience ( and there are a plethora of people on the web who share the same story ) , what seemed like a great idea became an impossible task . Despite how well whipped my banana mask was , I ended up with bits of banana stuck all up and through my hair . Like , hopelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingernails could n't help . Stuck as in I had to wash my hair several times over the course of two days to get all of it out . Of course after so much post-washing , any benefits I might have gained had long gone down the drain . <h> Avocado <p> This creamy green fruit has found its way onto many a head of hair over the years , and is a touted ingredient in tons of moisturizing hair products . <p> How its Done : Mash an avocado into a paste , and add enough water ( or anything you like , really ) to make a creamy mask . <p> What it 's Supposed to Do : Moisturize , soften and shine hair . <p> Does it Work ? : In one word YES . The oils in avocados are one of the few that can penetrate the cuticle and actually moisturize hair . Therefore , the ability to soften and moisturize hair does n't  rest only on how avocado coats the hair , but the moisture will remain after the mask is rinsed down the drain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use a soft , ripe avocado . They are easier to work with in terms of making a paste for a mask . Alternatively , if you 're a bit concerned about mashing avocados in your hair , you can opt for avocado oil and reap similar benefits . <h> Egg <p> Eggs are famously high in protein , sulfur and biotin . Protein and sulfur are the building blocks of hair , and we all know the role biotin plays in hair growth , health , and strength . Knowing this , why wouldnt you scramble a few eggs on your scalp ? <p> How its Done : Whip up a few eggs , and apply to scalp . Alternatively , you can combine with other ingredients to potentially pack a bigger punch . A common mix-in is avocado . <p> What it 's Supposed to Do : Strengthen , shine , and prevent breakage . <p> Does it Work ? : Remember what we said about oat protein ? Just because you slather it on your hair does n't  mean your hair is going to soak it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slabs of beef , and get no protein out of it . If the protein does n't  have the necessary molecular weight , your hair cant use it . As far as the sulfur content goes , there may be a little benefit there . Lastly , there is no scientific evidence to support that the hair or scalp can absorb biotin . In my opinion , you 'd be better off eating the egg than making a mask of it . <p> If You 're Going to Try it : Be sure to rinse your egg mask with cool water " not warm or hot .

They are parasites of convenience and self preservation . <p> Here are 4 reasons why naturals are more prone to lice now than ever <p> 1 . More women and children are deciding to wear natural hairstyles , which provide an environment free of harsh chemicals for the lice 2 . We are using lighter forms of hair moisturizers , including water based moisturizers that do n't leave hair coated with a film of oil . This allows lice to easily attach their nits ( lice eggs ) and move up and down the hair shaft 3 . Many naturals do not use heat frequently , if at all . And heat kills lice 4 . We believe that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ignore signs of the parasite <p> Head Lice Facts Adult lice ( singular louse ) are approximately the size of a sesame seed and have claws at the end of their 6 legs . They range in color from gray to a reddish brown depending on when they last fed on blood . They survive by feeding on blood from the scalp . Nits are laid on hair strands at a rate of 6 to 10 per day and remain attached with a special glue the mother louse creates to prevent detachment during hair washing and combing . Nits are generally white or clear , and laid a quarter to half inch away from the scalp for warmth . Because nits contrast with darker hair colors they are often confused for dandruff , however dandruff can be blown away or easily removed and nits can not , since they are basically glued to the strand . It takes about one and a half weeks for the nit to hatch and another week and a half for maturation and the ability to reproduce . The life cycle of a louse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until forced off by the host . <p> How Lice Spreads So now that I 've got you itching , let me explain how it spreads . Lice generally affect children aged 3 to 12 . Most kids this age are in the school system and very friendly and curious with one another ; rubbing heads together , sharing hats and brushes and having sleep overs . Lice do not fly , jump or hop but can be flung off the hair during brushing . They leave a host when the opportunity presents itself , particularly when space on the scalp becomes too crowded . Lice can live up to 2 days off of the host . Lice are hard to see because they move quickly , they are typically identified by the presence of nits . <p> How Do You Treat Lice ? There are lice and nit killing shampoos called pediculicides on the market , as well as metal lice and nit combs . Suffocants such as petroleum jelly , mayonnaise , thick conditioners and tea tree oil can also be used . Heat is another option , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I have also found dead nits on human hair mannequins used at my cosmetology school . <p> Do you have any stories to share about lice ? Do you know of any people of color who 've had lice ? <p> Not sure I agree with no 1 .

Apply it the night before the wash to allow it sufficient time to penetrate into the hair . Coconut oil will protect the cuticle from expanding excessively as water is taken up from the wash and protect your hair from losing its protein . <h> 4 . Words of Caution <p> a . ) Shampoo is required If you are not using a cleansing product ( shampoo or soap ) , and you are strictly co-washing , you should watch out for build up if you regularly use any oil in your routine .

I use it to sometimes cool my scalp ( thanks to the specail protein it has ) , condition , straighten my hair when needs be , overall to protect hair during winters .

It is a very deep , profound love affair . <p> Its my favorite pre-shampoo treatment ( often times I 'll use Vatika oil instead , which is coconut oil , but even better ) , and I also use it to make homemade oil infusions . I can take advantage of it becoming solid in cooler temperatures , because it makes it easy to " scoop " when I make homemade pomades ( basically , its my base for when I make my healthy version of hair grease ) , and I find it less messy than dealing with liquid oils . <p> The best way for coconut oil to benefit your hair is to eat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablespoon , daily . ( So , if you weigh 150 poundstake 3 tablespoons everyday . ) If you 're overweight ( and you stop eating sugar and processed foods ) you 'll lose weight , and you 'll notice that your new hair growth is a lot softer and happens faster .

It is a big misconception that fat equals unhealthy . In truth there are many people who are slim but consume a lot of saturated fat and therefore end up having heart attacks at 50 . <p> I would personally say that it is not really good to say have a tablespoon of saturated fat every day when someone may already have high cholesterol , diabetes or atherosclerosis and not know it .

It helps prevent bacterial , viral , and fungal infections , as a result of its antimicrobial component , lauric acid , which is found solely in coconut oil and in breast milk .

@@72561740 @1261740/ <h> 10 Major Culprits Behind Hair Breakage <p> Get your mind out the gutter . I do n't  mean like that . Some people look at shoes and clothes , others at teeth or tattoos . I look at hair . And right about now , the trends I see in hair are absolutely alarming . Perming like there 's no tomorrow . Weaving with reckless abandon . Pulling braids and buns back so tight , they gave it a name ( traction alopecia ) . In this post , we will be taking a look at ten silent killers that wreak havoc on our hair day in and day out . Many of them are seemingly innocuous , and we do n't  think about the damage we are causing until we see hair in the sink and our overall length shortening . Others , are more obvious . As you read , I hope you learn something and leave some things on the store shelf where they belong . <h> 10 . ) Pulling hair too tight . <p> Whether you 're putting your hair in a ponytail , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling on your hair . Some of us tend to pull harder than others especially when it comes to those gosh darn edges . Nothing is more annoying than a lumpy messy ponytail when you are going for a sleek look , but think about the undue stress you are causing your hair ; especially your edges . Yeah , remember when folks used to say " She do n't  got no edges " ? They have a name for it now . Traction alopecia , and its very real . Do n't  be fooled into thinking its just a Black womens hair issue any woman that styles their hair off of their face ( or gets braids/weaves ) is at risk . Avoid tugging ponytails and other hair inside of clips/fasteners outward ( to tighten it ) . Remember to always keep your edges moisturized . To compensate for that pull-back , try using a product that will make your edges cooperate without having to secure them so tightly ( like- Ecostyler gel ) . Lastly , dont- ever- go to bed with your hair still in a ponytail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a too-tight ponytail or a slicked-back to hell look is one done with the wrong kind of equipment . Hopefully , you know by now that rubber bands are not a good look . Wan na know why ? Place a rubber band on your forearm ( near your elbow ) and push it down to your wrist . You feel those arm hairs catching ? Just imagine that on your head . Please also know that all scrunchies are not created equal . Metal fasteners get easily caught on hair and will yank it out just as much as a rubber band ( and quite painfully so ) . Do n't  believe me ? Go into the bottom of your hair drawer and see how much hair is balled up on your old metal-fastened scrunchies . I highly recommend Goody Ouchless Ponytail Holders , which can be found virtually anywhere . Right now I 'm trying out Scuncis No-Slip Evolution Hair Ties ( which I will write a review on later ) . <h> 8 . ) Big Perm . <p> You can smell perm being mixed up from 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does serious damage to your hair . When you apply a perm to your hair , you are allowing carcinogenic ( yes , a- study published last month- has found a link between perms and fibrous tumors ) chemicals to penetrate your hair shaft and literally break the bonds that create your hairs curly texturepermanently . Any chemical , with lye or not , would have to be pretty darn strong to bend genetics . This is what makes perms especially damaging to our hair : hair that is naturally curly is inherently weaker ( because each bend in your strand of hair is a potential breaking point ) , and we protect these breaking points by making the natural hair as resilient as possible and essentially shielding the weak points . When you perm , you basically expose the weak points and make them weaker . Not to mention , if you leave it on for too long you will have no hair . <h> 7 . ) Doing too much with dye . <p> I know , I know , - you 're trying to keep up with Beyonces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine . Do you know what price your hair is paying for your coloring whims ? I know , because I did it . More than once . And each time , I regretted it ( until I got bored and did it again ) . If you are a natural blonde , then you have nothing to worry about . But for those of us with darker colored hair , you have to lift that natural darkness off before you can entertain a brighter hue . Just in like #8 , were playing with genetics here . Blondes and bleaching are TERRIBLE ( did I mention TERRIBLE ? ) for any texture of hair . It is the most difficult color to achive , and requires higher concentrations of ammonia which strips your hair leaving it dry , brittle , and porous . Translation : if you are going for a light hair color , see a professional . However , if you are looking for a little tint and some great shine , cellophane and henna are two great options . <h> 6 . ) Being heat-happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to swallow . I can stay away from the perm , I can even not color . But no heat ? Absolutely gets me every time . I 'm not saying to give up heat completely just be very careful and monitor your intake . When going from natural to straightened , be sure to use a heat protecting spray or serum along the way . I am a fan of Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray and Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Anti-Friz Serum . Also , avoid unnecessary heat whenever possible . If you can avoid blow drying and air dry your hair instead , do so . Instead of automatically cranking your flat iron up to 450 degrees , start off at a lower setting so that you can achieve the same results without overdoing it . <h> 5 . ) Underconditioning . <p> Oh , if I could only write conditioner a love song I have a special love affair with conditioners , and you should too . Conditioners are really your hairs first line of defense in terms of moisture and strength . Whether you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioner should always be your second step . I also try to deep condition monthly , to give my hair a little extra lovemy special way of saying " I 'm sorry for all the crap I put you through " . My trusty go-to deep conditioner is Palmers Coconut Oil Deep Conditioning Protein Pack . <h> 4 . ) All cotton everything . <p> Cotton may be the fabric of our lives , but it most certainly is not the fabric of your hair . Do not let anything cotton or cotton-esque come anywhere near your hair . Whether you 're trying your edges down , or covering your hair at night , cotton is not the way to go . Cotton is incredibly absorbent , and if you tie your hair up in a cotton bandana or lay down at night on a cotton pillowcase ( without your hair tired up ) , the oils and moisture will be sucked right out of your hair leaving it dry , brittle , and prone to breakage . Invest in a $3 satin scarf or bonnet from CVS , Target , Walgreens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy , skip the hair covers and grab a satin pillowcase for around $10. <h> 3 . ) Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol . <p> At least the bad ones . Alcohols found in hair products are definitely bipolar ranging from good for you fatty alcohols like cetyl to not-so-hot alcohols like SD or ethyl . For the purposes of this entry , were discussing those not-so-hot alcohols that can often be the culprits behind drying and brittle hair . These alcohols are commonly found in styling products used to provide hold like gels and hairsprays . Right now , Ecostyler gel is holding me down . <h> 2 . ) Naughty naughty petroleum and mineral oil . <p> I know , these are key staples in your favorite Blue Magic grease , and other seemingly innocuous moisturizing products aimed at providing hair moisture , growth , and repair . Do n't  believe the hype . Petroleum aka vaseline not only clogs your pores and slows growth , it also acts as a sealant . Sealants are n't  bad in and of themselves they keep moisture inside the hair shaft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your hair is already dry , and you look to a petroleum-laced product to give you moisture , guess what ? You 're in for a rude awakening . The petroleum effectively blocked any chances your hair had to soak up some moisture from other sources . Mineral oil aka baby oil may actually be the worse of the two . When I 'm going to the beach or headed to lay out near the pool and tan , I slather on baby oil , because it accelerates the tanning ( baking ) process for my skin . Just apply that same principle to your hair and.yeaaaaah . <p> And the number one most egregious offense we commit that wreaks havoc on our hair is. : : : drumroll , please : : : <h> 1 . ) HOLDING ON TO FRAZZLED ENDS . <p> More often than not , women are afraid to have a pair of scissors come anywhere near their hair in an attempt to preserve length . Unfortunately , that logic works against your hair being all that it can be . Split ends do n't  just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mosey up your shaft until it splits in two or breaks rendering your hair twice as weak . Not to mention , split-end damage hair is dull , lifeless , and does n't  hold curl or style well . Conventional wisdom dictates that you can not undo a split end . ( In a future blog , we will explore to what extent this is true . But for now , we shall regard it as such ) . All we can do with damaged ends is cut gradually , and invest more in protecting ends . Once your ends get on track , you will notice your hair is thicker , fuller , has more body , and holds curls and styles well . Traditional recommendations say to trim your ends every 6-8 weeks , but I am a fan of a more personalized approach . Assess your ends . How damaged are they ? Come up with a trimming schedule that gets them healthy on your time , and at a length you are comfortable with . 87941 @qwx707941 87940 @qwx707940 <p> I used a large elastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In October 2015 I started noticing my hair breaking on the edges .

I wear wigs and get complimented on them , but when i wear my natural hair I get even more compliments .

You touched the point of these little girls with perm and let me tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope they will find out when they get older though that its not good . <p> I definitely am guilty of pulling my hair too tight . I guess I 've assumed that because I 've never suffered any breakage that it wo n't happen , but I 'm going to be more careful when I do ponytails/buns/etc . <p> Heat is not a chemicalbut it can be an addiction . I never understood why women depend so much on heat to style their hair . Give your hair a break and air dry . Trimming your ends will not make your hair grow healthier . If you feel your hair is not growingthe main culprit is breakage from the weak ends . Trimming gets rid of split ends . <p> true true ladies , you do n't  want to forget the weaves I saw a postal lady a few weeks ago and her weave actually started behind her ears .

I have noticed that my hair around my crown breaks easily , is thinner and does not curl like the rest of my hair .

Ive been experiencing breakage at the crown for a while noweven before I started transitioning . I just walked out of the salon and my hair stylist told me that there 's nothing that I can do . The crown area is just the weakest and most coarse area of my head , smh . I think I need to work more on the protein/moisture balancing . <p> I 'm going through this process as we speak ! In April 2011 I got a sew-in that was waaaay too tight in the crown area . When I took the sew0in out , all I felt was my bald scalp . Its now been over a year and I have 5 ? in my crown area .

But the same stylist that worked as your relaxed hair stylist may not be the best for your natural hair . I know from experience that breaking up is hard to do . And if this is not the case your stylist may very well be aware of self haircare is far less costly than a sew-in and may just be preying on the unfortunate .

@@72561746 @1261746/ <h> 4 Reasons NOT to Trim Your Hair <p> Trimming is an important part of a natural hair routine helping to keep damage at bay and allowing the hair to keep gaining length . Your routine could be as simple as trimming half an inch every 4 months , regularly dusting the ends ( cutting off a quarter inch or less of hair ) or the more time consuming but more hair preserving search and destroy where only damaged strands are targeted. - Some naturals , however , can fall into the trap of trimming too much . Here are 4 instances when trimming is not necessary and possibly counterproductive. <h> 1 . You trimmed it last week <p> If you have recently trimmed your hair and you spot split ends soon after it may be the case that you need another trim , however it could also be the case that you missed a few damaged strands . Wait for at least two months before you pick up the scissors again . Constantly cutting your hair may lead to very slow or no progress . Do not obsess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is just not possible . <h> 2 . You notice one side is longer than the other <p> The purpose of trimming is to get rid of split ends and old damaged ends . You can also use it to even up hair length but- - for some people one part of their hair can grow faster than the other . Sometimes it is the front that grows longer than the back or the left side faster than the right or the crown faster than all other areas . In whatever case , it can be very- - counterproductive to keep evening out the length if all that is happening is that one part of your hair is growing faster . Natural hair worn in a curly or stretched style really does not require even length. - - As long as the ends are free of split ends or obvious damage , keep the uneven lengths and grow all the hair to your desired length before choosing to even it up . <h> 3 . Your ends appear thin/ see through but you regularly do search and destroy trims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off damaged ends , it is highly likely that your ends may appear much thinner than the bulk of the hair . In this case , it is not necessary to trim your hair to get rid of the see through ends. - - Since you are only cutting damage , it is always the case that some strands will be longer than others . As long as you are able to keep on top of damage and split ends , you do not need to trim the hair any further . <h> 4 . Your ends are dry or do not curl like they used to but you can not see split ends <p> As hair gets older , it will be more difficult to maintain moisture simply because the cuticle layers are depleted and it is easier to lose moisture . Dry ends or ends that are not able to curl are not necessarily signs that you need a trim . Examine the hair and see if you can see visible signs of damage such as split ends . If you do not see damage , all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisturiser and spending a lot time in tucked in styles to conserve moisture . <p> Are you scissor happy ?

I am a little over a year natural and I feel like the longer my hair gets , the thinner the ends look , which I HATE . My hair is 4a/b and shoulder length . When I was relaxed I would trim my hair so that it was straight all the way across .

My hair tends to grow in layers or uneven &amp; it makes me want to correct it with scissors . I remember being told if you want your hair to grow , you must cut it . So , that 's what I did .

@@72561748 @1261748/ <h> The Difference Between Shedding and Breakage <p> Understanding the difference between hair breakage and shedding is an important part of any healthy hair regimen . Many people use these terms interchangeably to refer to any hair that falls from the head ; however , this misinformed language can be a recipe for hair disaster . You must be able to properly differentiate between these two very specific forms of hair " loss " in order to effectively address even the smallest of your hair needs . This article will teach you the difference between hair shedding and hair breakage , and offer strategies to help you combat both hair problems . <h> What is Shedding <p> In its truest sense , shed hair is hair that has reached the end of its growing cycle and naturally falls from the scalp along with its tiny , white " root " attached . This is not the actual hair root that is secured deeply within your scalp , but it is the bulb- root- or base of the hair strand found on the scalp-originating end . It appears white because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in its growth cycle right before it gets ready to fall . If your actual hair root came out along with the hair , you would no longer be able to produce hair from that same place on the scalp ever again ! If a hair does not possess this white root bulb , then it is not a naturally shed hair , rather , a- broken- one . Shed hair tends to be longer in length than broken hairs which are generally short pieces of varying lengths . According to Halal , after a hair is naturally shed , it may take about 130 days for a new hair to fully emerge in its place . <p> In general , shedding should not be a major concern for you and should be seen as a sign of a healthy , normal , functioning scalp . There is no need to fear shedding unless it is tied to a medical issue . If you notice rapid hair loss from shedding or hair loss accompanied by a host of other problems , please consult a medical professional . Most shedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> What is Breakage ? <p> Breakage on the other hand is not natural , and is an indication of an imbalance of important forces within the hair strand . Broken hairs do not fall naturally from the head , but are typically a sign of mishandling or abuse . In the stages before a hair ultimately breaks , the hair first becomes discolored and experiences cuticle loss . Eventually , the fibers begin to split and ultimately there is breakage . <p> So what causes breakage ? Hair can be weakened and damaged by anything from rough handing and sun exposure- to coloring and straightening chemicals . Breakage is also more common with a hairs age ; older hairs , usually the hairs nearest the ends , have the greatest tendency to break due to normal wear and tear . When breakage is n't a response to physical manipulation and abuse , it is most often triggered by the lack of moisture in the hair strand . Other types of breakage may be caused by the over- structuring of the hair strand with protein treatments done in excess . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop breakage in its tracks . <h> What can I do about shedding ? <p> You must understand that because shedding is a natural , internal process , it may not respond to topical , external treatments . Some have praised garlic shampoos or " garlic scalp rubs " for reducing shedding , but there has been no clear concensus on the effectiveness of garlic as a remedy for shedding . Shedding is also not easily solved by protein or moisture treatments because it has nothing to do with the hair shaft itself , but is a response to hormonal influences on the hair follicle and is dependent on growth cycles . When a hair completes its life cycle , which generally lasts 4-6 years , its final act is the shedding we experience . This can not be prevented . <p> Also , our hair naturally cycles in and out of seasonal shedding phases which may last days or weeks at a time in some individuals . Research suggests that peak shedding rates occur during the fall season . A healthy head of hair may she 'd as many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this amount to be a grand stretch . You should be concerned if your shedding suddenly increases to a rate that was uncommon to you before , or if the shedding seems to be prolonged over the course of several weeks or months . <p> Do keep in mind that there are special periods in the human life cycle where shedding is naturally increased . For example , women who are undergoing a bout of postpartum shedding after having a baby may have to deal with increased shedding for several months until their normal hormone levels return . Other conditions which may increase your shedding rate are : <p> *styling methods that place stress on the follicles *birth control/menstrual cycles/menopause *pregnancy *heredity ( runs in the family ) *crash dieting/ low protein diets , poor diet *illnesses with high fever as a prevailing symptom *anemia , thyroid disorders , and a host of other chronic disorders *certain medications and major surgeries and treatments like chemotherapy <p> Please consult with a medical professional to diagnose any prolonged , abnormal shedding or other unusual scalp conditions . <h> What can I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there would be no breakage . However , we do not live in a perfect world and some breakage is bound to happen. - Hair is an extremely delicate fiber , though strong , it is n't made out of steel ! It would be very difficult to prevent every single , solitary strand from ever breaking . One or two broken hairs are nothing to be thoroughly concerned about . However , it is when you start getting hair here , hair there , 7 here , 9 there over the course of a few days that you want to start getting worried about your moisture/protein balance . If you are getting less than 5-7 broken hairs a day through the normal course of arranging your hair , do not fret . <p> Your job is simply to- minimize- the breakage as much as possible . Be as gentle as possible when handling and working with your tresses . Try to think of your hair as the rarest , most expensive fine silk head covering . Only handle it with clean , smooth , well manicured hands . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your way through tough tangles and keep your hair soft and moisturized daily . Tie your hair up at night to protect your strands from your nighttime tossing and turning . Treat your hair with care and you will see less hair where it is n't supposed to be ! <p> Ladies , what do you deal with more : shedding or breakage ? Have you figured out the reason for your shedding/breakage ? And can you tell the difference between the two ? <p> When my hair was short , normal was pea-sized . My looser textures create a more voluminous ball than my tighter textures . And of course there is a difference between shed hair and broken hair : LINK <p> Hi !

@@72561749 @1261749/ <p> A main focus of this site ( and the natural hair community at large ) is achieving hair length goals . This goal is significant because it disproves the long-held belief that kinky/curly hair is incapable of retaining length . But the pursuit of length sometimes turns into length attachment , causing naturals to feel all their beauty and worth is tied up in their long hair . This is why 12-year-old Destanees story is significant . Last month she cut off 10 inches of hair and donated it to Locks of Love . We asked her and her mother a few questions to get to to the heart of why she made this decision . <p> Destanee why did you want to cut your hair ? Is it something you 'd been thinking about for a while or was it a spur of the moment decision ?

I had been thinking about cutting my hair for a while , just not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go of their hair . What gave you the courage to let it go ? D : I was not scared of cutting my hair because I thought donating it would be for a good cause . <p> From Destanees mother Michelle : <p> Cutting hair is almost a cardinal sin in many black families , especially for young girls . What was running through your mind when your daughter said she wanted to cut her hair ? M : Destanee had been asking her dad and I if she could cut her hair for a number of weeks before we agreed to let her . She has been taking care of her own hair for a while so she wanted something easier to manage for the summer . We discussed the pros and cons with her and her rebuttal was that she had been wearing her hair in a very similar style for a number of years . On the morning of her haircut , she decided to cut it short enough to be able to donate it . People have asked me how I felt when she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that is hair grows back . <p> We often tell our black daughters that their beauty is tied up in their hair . What do you think of this mindset ? M : People say her hair is so beautiful . Her hair is beautiful but Destanee is beautiful with or without her hair being long . If something were to happen to cause her hair to fall out , would she be any less beautiful ? I have tried to instill in all my children that how you look does n't  make you as beautiful as having a beautiful spirit . <p> Michelle and Destanee <p> Destanee has shown me that she understands this by having a servant heart and doing the best she can . Des is a straight A student who actually skipped a grade this past school year . She also serves at church in the Early Elementary and Preschool areas .

Check it out : <p> Glycerin is a humectant that is commonly added to leave in conditioners . It is generally regarded as natural although some naturals debate that as it can be produced as a by product from petroleum. - It should be noted though that most glycerin does come from soap making where plant oils are used. - A second general note is that glycerin can be referred to as glycerine or vegetable glycerine or the water free form , glycerol . All of these terms refer to the same compound . <h> Benefits <p> 1. - It can be made from natural oils and is- generally considered non toxic ( only very large volumes are known to be harmful ) . <p> 2 .

It can be difficult to get consistent results . <p> 2. - It is highly soluble in water which makes it most effective as a leave in. - Rinse out hair conditioners containing glycerin may not produce the desired effect . <p> 3 .

Most moisturizers just sit on my hair shaft and clog the pores on my scalp reducing hair growth ; but glycerin does not do this .

In FL , I can use glycerin year round as it does n't  get all that cold .

But now I use it in the winter time , I just use it differently . <p> 1 . In the summer I spritz my hair with water and glycerine and head out to work . <p> 2 . In the winter I spritz my hair with water and glycerine before my showerhave a shower with my hair uncoveredlet my hair soak up all the steam from my shower .

@@72561752 @1261752/ <h> 4 Benefits of Steaming Natural Hair <p> Admittedly , I was never one for steaming my hair . until I tried it . Now , you cant get me to stop . Steaming my hair has been one of the- most game-changing practices that Ive incorporated into my regimen . I steam my hair as a pre-poo/detangling treatment , for mid-week moisture , to refresh styles , for conditioning , and more . Steaming has done wonders for me , - in terms of my transition to natural hair . I find that my hair breaks less , sheds less , my styles last longer , I spend less money on products , and my hair retains more moisture . Plus , my curls are more lively than theyve ever been . Everything a transitioner could ask for , right ? <p> What is steaming hair ? <p> Steaming involves using moist heat on the hair , as opposed to dry . Steaming the hair creates a humid environment , optimal for absorption of moisture , among other benefits . <p> Why is steaming so good for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair : <p> 1 . To add moisture without hygral- fatigue . Especially with this being Summertime and " out " styling is at an all time high , it is easier for elements ( sun , wind , etc. ) to dry out hair . To prevent unnecessary wear and tear on my tresses , I try to avoid having to restyle- my hair every day . I could n't imagine starting a fresh wash n go , twist and curl , or satin strip braidout- every day for the sake of restoring moisture . This is where steaming comes in steam allows you to add moisture to your hair without having to start from scratch , soak your hair , or ruin your style . Because hygral- fatigue wears and tears on the hair due- to- expanding and contracting ( when soaked in water and drying ) , steaming- is an excellent alternative without the damage . Steaming is also- more effective at moisturizing- than your run of the mill spray bottle , which you 'll see in point #2 . <p> 2 . To gently lift the cuticle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , getting in water to moisturize ( you 'll still want to lightly seal ) is a great benefit of steaming . Additionally , when looking to condition your hair and really- get those restructurizing and replenishing ingredients in , steaming is your best bet . <p> 3 . To promote hair strength and elasticity . Whenever you add water to your hair , you are adding moisture . Whenever your hair has the proper moisture balance , you ward off dryness , brittleness , and breakage . This is especially important for transitioners , and dealing with the line of demarcation between the natural and damaged hair . <p> 4 . Steaming also enhances your natural curl pattern and promotes clumping without sacrificing volume . One of the keys to great definition ( regardless of texture ) is moisture . Because steaming allows you to get the moisture without dunking your head in a tub of water , you 're able to walk out the door with lively and defined kinks , coils , corkscrews , and curlsand your hair is n't dripping wet . <p> There are many more benefits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned are some of the most important .

I have on two occasions spent the time steaming or doing a GHE to add moisture to my strands between conditioning and when all is said/done it seems to be drying for me ; even when doing the LOC method after . I almost feel that my normal routine of adding daily moisture bit by bit is better for me. 
@@72561753 @1261753/ <h> 5 Ways to Eliminate Fairy Knots <p> Single strand knots ( SSKS ) or fairy knots are fairly common among naturals especially as hair starts to get longer ( usually 6 inches or more ) . There are two important questions that arise when it comes to managing knots : <h> What do you do when you find knots ? <p> There are three options <p> 1 . Leave them alone 2 . Undo them 3. - Cut them <p> Of these three methods , the one that I would not recommend is leaving them alone . Knots have the ability to create more problems if left alone . Knots create an obstruction around which tangles form . During combing , - hair is also likely to snap above the knot creating rough edges and potential split ends . <p> If you can unravel a knot , it is perfectly fine to do so , some people have success with the careful use of a needle or by slowly pulling out any hair trapped within a knot . The down side to this is that if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - instead of having a clear pathway to unravel , you may end up with damage to the strand . <p> Trimming directly above the knot is the easiest option and as knots tend to fray the edges of the hair strand as they form , it is also the most effective method of preventing further damage to the hair strand . <h> How do you prevent knots ? <p> Knots form mainly in free hair which is being manipulated ( i.e detangled , combed , brushed or styled ) . To prevent knots forming there are several strategies to consider . <h> 1 . Wash in Sections <p> Once your hair starts to approach 5-6 inches in length , consider sectioning your hair and washing it in loose braids or twists . This reduces tangling and the likelihood of loops forming in the hair to create knots . <h> 2 . Use gentle cleansers that do n't  strip natural oils <p> Of course the intention of washing is to remove excess dirt and oil from the hair . But you do n't  want a cleanser that strips the strand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling means that there are no natural oils on the strand , and the cuticle is raised . The raised cuticles will tangle with each other during the wash process . <h> 3 . Increase Protective Styling <p> As free hair has a greater tendency to form knots , protective style involving twisting or braiding which protect the hair ends are better . This does not mean that you can not enjoy your free hair but it does mean that if your aim is to grow your hair longer , balance out the time you spend with your hair out with the time you spend with it protected . When your hair is out , choose stretched styles which may also help reduce knot formation . <h> 4 . Stretch your Ends <p> When ends curl up they provide the perfect opportunity for knotting . So , if you 're wearing twists or an out style ( twist out , bantu knot out , etc ) , be sure to seal then stretch your ends at night . An easy way to do this is putting in large bantu knots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter ( or your sealing product of choice ) to your ends and then roll the sections into large bantu knots . Make sure th entire section all the way to the ends gets rolled into the knot . You can also try setting your ends on rollers . When you wake up the next day your ends will be fully stretched , providing no opportunity for knots to form . <h> 5 . Special note : Oil rinsing <p> In natural forums oil rinsing ( i.e soaking hair in oil before washing ) is credited with knot prevention . I do not have a solid scientific theory or explanation for this , I would think perhaps the oil adds extra slip during the wash which may help the hair strands slide past each other instead of tangling and forming knots . - I do generally like oil rinsing for other reasons , but as this is a commonly discussed knot prevention technique , - I thought I would include it in this article even though there is no direct evidence of its working . 87940 @qwx707940 <p> My fairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I cut my hair and got rid of my scab hair , mine became almost non-existent . Of course , not every natural believes in scab hair , so my fairy knots are a mystery , lol . <p> I too pull the hair out , but only when I cant find my scissors . I pull from the root and slide out all the hair that 's tangled in the knotted hair first . I do n't  think Im damaging adjacent hairs , not sure why theyd be affected . <p> Ahh you get a wrist slap for that ami . You should not snap knots ( or your hair in general ) . Using a scissor gives you a clean cut edge which does not tend to fray or split . Snapping the knot gives you a fibrillated end which is a nice way to start split ends . <p> Pull off one knot , damage one hair . Pull off 10 knots , damage 10 hairs .

I would suggest changing up and moisturizing the ends at night only and place under a cap to mazimize effect of body heat with moisture on the hair . Minimal manipulation in the morning . Make sure you are trimming a very small amount off the ends every few months and deep condition ( perhaps , overnight once a week ) if you can . <p> I agree with your daughter !

DBryant your daughter is right , you may be causing knots by constantly handling your hair . I also agree with MsCali that twists sometimes can be a problem . Braids or even free hair may be better for your texture ( the only way to find out is to try and see you may end up going back to twists but nothing ventured , nothing gained ) .

However in its natural form ( wet/dry ) you would see no curls ( just fro ) you only see them in a wash and go . ) <p> This is an erroneous statement .

I substitute the oil rinsing for blow drying my hair 1x month to slowly heat train or heat damage ( whichever term you prefer ) over time . ALL of this combined has aided in reducing knots and I also finger detangle and snip any knots as I find them . 
@@72561754 @1261754/ <h> What is a Hair Treatment and When Do You Need One ? <p> So your hair is in bad shape , its splitting or breaking off at worse or dry and frizzy , what should you be doing ? Getting a treatment- is the answer but which one and why ? First of all know your basic facts on what a treatment is : <p> Treatments are often confused with conditioners , or the term " conditioner " is used as a generalisation to categorise four different types of strengthening and moisturising products . True conditioners are " surface acting in that they provide temporary protection and strength to the- hair . They are a bit like a sheath , in that the product does not penetrate the hair , it provides a microscopically thin protective film giving smoothness and combability . This is different to treatments which penetrate the hair , restoring and maintaining internal strength . <p> Conditioners are generally used every time you shampoo whilst treatments are applied either by you or your- professional- hairdresser when needed ( no more than once a week normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Reconstructors- which make the hair stronger and are generally protein based . These are for you if you have chemically damaged hair ( i.e. from a perm or colour ) or breaking or weak hair . They are often a combination of protein and moisture as pure protein treatments used incorrectly can leave the hair brittle . After using this type of treatment do n't  expect your hair to feel great as they work internally and you may still need a conditioner to make your hair feel- smooth . They are most often found at the salon and used during chemical processes . Do n't  use protein based treatments within a week either side of a colour as they can cause colour to fade or not take properly in some instances . <p> Moisturisers- the most common type of treatment , - balance- the moisture content of the cortex ( middle of your hair ) . Great for frizzy , dry hair and those of you with curly hair that lacks bounce . Will treat all damage conditions from chemical to physical ( i.e. from colouring to over drying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , - conditioners are : <p> Rinses and acidifiers- used to close the cuticle and seal the hair i.e. make it feel smooth and easily combed . If you have coloured hair a conditioner is a must with every shampoo to lock in your colour and make it last longer . Also if your hair is mid to long they are also necessary to nourish those areas that the natural oils just do n't  get to . Really only those of us with very short non chemically processed hair do n't  need a conditioner . <p> Thermal protectors- ( Conditioner/finishing product ) are used to prevent heat damage before it starts . If your hair is prone to damage or you use heated appliances on you hair regularly make sure your styling product contains this type of protection . <p> So how do I apply them properly ? <p> As with most products , treatments should be applied using the instructions on the pack or by your professional hairdresser . <p> The amount needed also varies greatly depending on the product and how much hair you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for longer than instructed , especially if using a protein-based treatment as these will have no extra effect , and may even make your hair brittle . <p> If your hair is in really bad shape a twice a week treatment may be needed , but generally for fair to poor conditioned hair once a week is recommended . For general maintenance go to once a fortnight or once a month . <p> Remember your hair can only take in so much extra nourishment , over doing it on the treatment side means you are wasting your- money- as it is simply rinsing down the plug ! <p> When you need to treat your hair : <p> Certain times of year and weather conditions or the various stresses and excesses that we put our hair through can lead to damaged/dry hair , and because a treament does not work over night it is a good idea to either do regular <p> Ladies , do you do hair treatments ?

After all I 'll be subscribing for your feed and I hope you write once more soon ! <p> I would love to see some examples of moisturizing treatments that are n't  conditioners . I do n't  do protein treatments they make my coarse hair hard &amp; brittle . But I 'd love to try treatments that that offer deeper moisturizing than moisturizing conditioners . <p> Thanks Lorraine ! This reinforces my decision to let my natural process happen naturally = Its funny because you are right , I pressed my hair the other day and go soo many compliments on it ! Somebody asked me , " did you get a touch-up " lol . I am so excited about this process . Thanks for the article , I am going to post this on my fb page . <p> Have you all heard of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perm and my hair stylist suggested it . I do n't  want more chemicls in my hair or something that is going to delay me seeing my natural curl pattern ( although I still plan to wear it straight sometimes ) . I saw that most treatments have formaldyhide in them which is totally out the question , but supposidly this one does n't  have it . Any suggestions ? Help this newbie to natural out ! = <p> I do , faithfully ! My hair is really really fine and pretty porous so I try to keep a good moisture/protein balance . I pre poo with an oil mix , then I cowash and DC every week religiously . My staple DCs are Aubreys , Miss Jessies Sweetback + add shea butter ( with heat ) &amp; Giovanni Nutrafix . Once a month or so I do a double protein treatment : I use Jherri Redding protein without heat and rinse , then use Nexxus Emergencee with heat .

@@72561755 @1261755/ <h> What to Expect in Your First Year of Transitioning to Natural Hair <p> Lately , I 've been getting a lot of e-mails and questions about tips , advice , product recommendations , and secrets for successfully transitioning to natural hair . Once you 've made up your mind to go natural , its pretty easy to become obsessed . And with a plethora of blogs , websites , YouTube videos , Instagrams , Pintrests , Facebook pages and Google Plusses , the world of natural hair is never more than a few clicks away . Before your eyes glaze over , or you find yourself caught in the whirlwind frenzy of products . pH balancing , porosity , and parabens , take a second and breathe . Transitioning may be difficult , but it does n't  have to be complicated . <p> FYI : I 'm not there yet ! June marks 16 months in the struggle ( lol ) for me.and I 've got at least 3 more to go before Im done . While I have n't reached the promised land yet , I have definitely had my share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of what I went through my first year of transitioning , as well as some dos and donts to help encourage and keep you on track . Every transition is n't the same , but hopefully there are some tidibits in here to help you along the way ! <p> 1 3 Months : Excited and Gullible <p> The first three months of my transition , I was doe-eyedto say the least . I spent a LOT of time oogling over the likes of Hey Fran Hey , Naptural85 , and Mahogany Curls longing for the day my tresses would hover in their territory . I also found myself obsessed with what I later found to be the biggest waste of money for a transitioner styling products . Even though I knew and accepted that my hair was heat damaged , I held out hope that some miracle potion would deliver rejuvenated curls as promised on the label . Needless to say , that did n't  happen . <p> DO : If you 're just beginning your transition , commit the first three months to developing good haircare habits theyll carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  already , sleep with a satin ( or silk , if you 're fancy ! ) scarf , bonnet , or pillowcase . Learn how to properly moisturize and seal hair . In the first three months , practices like finger detangling are n't  vital , because most of your hair will still be straight ( whether heat damaged or relaxed ) , and fairly easy to comb through . Months 1 3 is also a perfect time to clean house in terms of products . If you 're transitioning from a relaxer and you still have some creamy crack stashed somewhere , throw it out or give it away . Or , if you just so happen to have the receipt , return it . For those transitioning from heat damage , store the irons out of sight , or put them in someone elses care . If you 're giving up sulfates , silicones , mineral oil , petrolatum , parabens , etc. , chuck those products as well . <p> DO NT : Waste money or time trying to " get your curl back " . Its not coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a LONG time ago and you were too busy flat ironing or relaxing to notice . The first three months is also not the time to buy into hair typing ( if ever at all ) . Its much too early in the game to decipher how your natural hair will behave , and hopping on the typing bandwagon ( among others ) will serve you absolutely no purpose . Also , avoid immediately slapping your hair into box braids or Havana twists . With only a small amount of new growth , your hair is highly susceptible to breakage from the stress and weight of added hair at this point . Save those styles for later on down the line . <p> 4 6 Months : Why Did I Do This , Again ? <p> After the first leg of my transition was down , I found myself excited when I straightened my hair for the first time . It was longer , stronger , and thicker than what I started with . That alone kept me encouraged through month 4 , and into 5 . Then I hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My banana clips ( God , I loved me some banana clips ) would n't stay closed to save my life , and I could n't fake the funk with my pseudo wash n go anymore . I was frustrated . I had doubts . Everything I was learning seemed for naught . My hair was driving me crazy . <p> DO : When you hit a wall in your transition , change something up . This is the perfect time to start experimenting with transitioner styles that blend textures , finger detangling , protective styling , and maybe even a new product or two . This is also the right time to start paying extra attention to the line of demarcation between your new and old hair . Gentle handling , regular deep conditioning , and protective styling combined with those moisturizing and sealing techniques you learned early on will help minimize breakage . Lastly , find the best detangling products and method for you . Get a handle on it now , because as any naturalista would tell you , you 're gon na need it in the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go back to what you were doing out of frustration . Its ok to use heat seldomly ( once every 3 months or so ) , but do n't  start flat ironing on a weekly basis because you hate the way your hair looks right now . It will only lead to more damage . <p> 7 9 Months : That Awkward Moment <p> For me , months 7 , 8 , and 9 were just plain awkward . Although I was loving my hair and digging my new growth , I found myself in an unflattering in-between stage , reminiscent of wearing a training bra . Too much to not need anything , not enough for the real deal . I found myself wanting out of this stage ASAP . I buckled down on my vitamins , scalp massages , and even subjected myself to some totally unflattering hairstyles in the name of growth progress . <p> DO : This is the perfect time to adopt washing your hair in sections , to prevent re-tangling during the cleansing process . Continue to be diligent . Your hard work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleansing regularly , deep conditioning , moisturizing and sealing . If you 're into building a regimen , then create one at this point that works for you . If not , you can always go ahead and with listening to your hair and acting accordingly.To help keep your mind off of the starkly different textures , find a few staple styles that are great for blending like satin strip braidouts , straw sets , twist and curls , flexi rods , bantu knot-outs , or Curlformer sets . Master these staple styles , and make them your go-to when you get tired of buns , updos , or just looking at partially textured , partially straight hair . <p> DO NT : Start curl coveting , or beating yourself up over growth progress . Yes , Mahogany Curls , Naptural85 , Hey Fran Hey , and Chime Edwards all have GORGEOUS hair . And if you follow many of their journeys ( especially Mahogany Curls and Naptural85 ) , you 'll see that they did n't  get those amazing manes overnight . Everyones hair grows at a different rate , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get 1/4 inch of growth per month , instead of 1/2 or 1 inch . Besides , your hair might be growing faster than you know but you just cant see it because its all curled and coiled up . <p> 10 12 Months : Closer to My Dreams <p> Once I got closer to the year mark , I really hit my stride . I had a firm grasp on what worked for my hair , and what did n't  . I could do my favorite styles in my sleep . At this point , I could really see my texture coming through , and I was more committed than ever to seeing this thing to the end . <p> DO : Get ingredient savvy . Sure , over the past year you 've learned all about silicones , sulfates , parabens , mineral oils , petrolatum , and other generally " red flag " ingredients . But have you educated yourself on fatty alcohols , humectants , ingredients that penetrate , and those that repair ? Now is a great time to get beyond surface level and really understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jc of The Natural Haven , The Beauty Brains , and the EWG Skin Deep Cosmetic Database are great resources . You can also get into the DYI trend , if that tickles your fancy . Making your own flaxseed gel , whipped shea butter , oil blends , and more is a great way to save money and use quality ingredients . <p> DO NT : As you approach or hit the one year mark , try not to fall prey to product junkie-ism . Because you see your hair texture more , you might be more prone to scooping up everything that says curl defining on the bottle but do n't  . Experimenting with a product or two is always fine , but do n't  go burning through a wad of cash at this pointor ever . <p> 1 Year + : Its All Up to You <p> After you hit the year mark , its really whatever you want from your hair . If you 're ready to cut , cut . If you want to keep going , keep going . I 've personally been transitioning for 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I consider chopping the rest . Once I got to 15 months , I found myself comfortable rocking wash n go styles . I still protectively style , but not as diligently ( because I love my hair so much , I want to wear it out like all the time ) . Ive become more diligent about the connection between healthy hair and a healthy body . Regular exercise , a cleaner diet , drinking plenty of water , vitamins and supplements are all as important to me as henna treatments , gentle handling , and maintaining moisture . The only major change to my regimen Ive made is steaming my hair during detangling , pre-pooing and mid-week for moisturebut that 's a story for another time . The bottom line is , after a year all the grueling work is done . Everything pretty much runs like clockwork . Just figure out what you want to do next ! <p> Its important to remember , there is no set timeline on the following things during your transition to natural hair : <p> When to trim your hair . Trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to your level of comfort and the health of your hair . <p> When to switch up products . Switch as often as you feel so inclinedor stick to your tried and true staples for as long as you wish . If it works , it works . If it does n't  , it does n't  . <p> When to do deep treatments . The transitioning process is a great opportunity to learn your hairs needs . If you feel your hair is weak , limp , and lacks strength , do a protein treatment . If its dry , brittle and lacks elasticity , do a deep moisturizing treatment . There 's no timeline on these things . Just take stock of what your hair needs , then do it . <p> When to chop . This is perhaps the biggest one . As I become more public with my transitioner progress , I get more and more encouragement and pushes to cut the rest off . With all due respect , when I chop is my decision . The same goes for every other transitioner . Chop when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here are some things to avoid at every stage of your transition : <p> Texturizers/Silkeners . I do n't  care what you read , or what so-and-so said ; a texturizer ( silkener ) is nothing but a perm that you leave on your hair for a shorter amount of time . If you 're looking to truly embrace your natural texture , why fake the funk with a baby perm ? <p> Too much heat , too often . It has already been shown that heat damage from too high temperatures , too often damage the hair almost as much as a perm . It is perfectly okay to straighten your hair with heat safely on occasion but straightening to transition from relaxing is a recipe for danger . <p> Neglecting hair in covered styles . Box braids , Havana twists , wigs , and weaves are all great ideas for avoiding high manipulation . But do n't  forget to actually take care of the hair underneath . It still needs to be detangled , cleansed , and moisturized regularly . <p> Ridiculously expensive products . In my humble transitioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $15 on any given hair productand that 's cutting it close . More often than not , you 're paying for a name and fancy packaging . Most conditioners and styling products contain similar ingredients , so do n't  pay $30 for a 6oz bottle of styling product that you can find a comparable version of elsewhere for $8 . <p> Negativity . Do n't  let folks that do n't  have to wear your hair kill your vibe . You 're embracing your natural texture for whatever reasons YOU decided . Not to please anyone else . If anyone ( I do n't  care if its your mama or your BFF ) speaks negatively to you about your transition to natural hair , promptly show them the stadium and let them know they can have several seats . <p> Above all else , remain patient and enjoy your transition ! ! ! <p> Ladies , can you relate to this timeline ?

@@72561757 @1261757/ <h> 3 Dangers of Leaving Conditioner in Your Hair <p> This is a question that I have been asked several times . I must clarify first and say that when you wash your hair , you should rinse out all the conditioner thoroughly ( for reasons known as potential itchiness , personal experience here , some science to follow ) . The question posed here is whether you can then use a little bit of conditioner afterwards as a moisturiser or on a daily basis . The answer to this question is yes you can use conditioner as a moisturiser but with caution . <p> So there are two main types of conditioner 1 . Rinse out conditioners ( heavier type that is used after shampooing to add softness typical ingredients include fatty acids , surfactants and oils ) 2 . Leave in conditioners ( much thinner and lighter , typically contain humectants such as glycerine to help moisturise hair ) <p> Now , leave in conditioners are a no brainer , they are designed to be left in . The heavier rinse out conditioners are a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using a silicone heavy conditioner ( silicone in one of the first 5 ingredients ) is not ideal unless you shampoo your hair . Co-washing your hair will simply not do.2 . Conditioners which contain protein ( hydrolysed protein or amino acids ) have been shown to cause irritation and itchiness in some people ( contact urticaria is the medical term ) . ( Allergy. 53(11):1078-1082 , 1998 ) .3 . Hair conditioner can contribute to build up . This was explained in a very intricate study ( Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists , pg 205-214,1989 ) . The science behind this is that the hair conditioner has positive charges and the shampoo has negative charges . Depending on the amount and type of shampoo , the hair conditioner can either be removed or the shampoo can simply attach to the hair conditioner and cause build up . Naturally if you have been applying hair conditioner to your hair on a daily basis , then you will have much more of the positive charge . <p> So what precautions can you take if you want to use heavier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  put the conditioner on your scalp , try as much as possible to target the ends of your hair ( leave the scalp and the first 1-2 inches alone ) . 2 . Read the ingredient list and if you are a no shampoo person , avoid silicones in the top 5 list of your conditioner . If you shampoo , then no worries here . 3 . Pick a conditioner without proteins. 4 . Rinse your hair thoroughly on your wash day . 5 . Use a conditioning shampoo on your wash day if you are not anti-poo . <p> What is your experience with leaving conditioner in hair ? Have you got the itchies or have you had a pleasant experience ? 87940 @qwx707940 <p> Obviously this is n't true for everyone because everyones hair is different .

@@72561759 @1261759/ <h> How to Do Synthetic Locs <p> Saleemah of HydraTherma Naturals is currently rocking synthetic locs . Check out her explanation of how to apply , style and care for them . <p> Why did you get synthetic locs ? S : Honestly , I love the look of locs . I think that they are gorgeous . I 've always wondered what I would look like with them . I love the look of my loose hair so I never took the plunge and made the commitment to lock . In August , we started the Hydratherma Naturals 20 week protective style challenge . I needed a great protective style that I could wear for a few weeks and this was the perfect opportunity to try the temporary protective locs . I absolutely love them and I think that locs may be in my future one day = <p> Where did you buy the hair ? S : I bought the hair from my local black owned beauty supply store . I used regular kanekalon braiding hair . ( 3 bags for $10 ) to braid and synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrapping of the braid . Both of these hair types can be purchased from your local beauty supply store or online . The braid can also be wrapped with human kinky hair . It is much more expensive ( $30-50 a bag ) . If someone is planning to leave the locs in permanently , I would suggest using human hair because it will lock with your hair better and will give you more of a natural loc 'd look . <p> How do you put them in ? S : It is very simple but time consuming = It is basically a two step process that consists of braiding and wrapping the braid . First , you have to determine the thickness of each loc . You can make the loc as thick or thin as you want it . Your base braid will determine the thickness and length of the loc . After braiding the hair in box braids , it is time to wrap each braid with the Marley braid hair . The Marley braid hair comes separated in strips . You can use the strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly thinner loc . Begin wrapping the Marley hair around each braid from the base of the braid to the end . Be sure to wrap the hair tightly around the braid to prevent unraveling later . If the hair strip that you are using runs out while wrapping just add another strip of hair and continue to wrap until you get to bottom of the braid . Once you get to the bottom , begin to wrap upward ( to the base ) until the hair runs out . You can burn the tips for more security but it is not necessary . You can experiment with different colors to give the appearance of highlights . I used #2 and #4 colors . I mixed the colors for every other loc and it gave me a very natural look of highlights . For those who like visuals , here 's a video tutorial <p> It took 8 hrs to braid and 10 hrs to wrap ! I probably could have finished sooner but I took many breaks . <p> Are they heavy ? Do they weigh on the follicle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this style is that fact that they are a bit heavy . You can always add less hair to each section to lighten them up a bit . <p> How long do you plan to keep them in ? S : I plan to keep them in for 6-8 weeks . I do n't suggest keeping them in longer unless you want the loc extension hair to mesh with your hair permanently . I must say that the longer you wear them , the better they look . It has been a little over a month since my install and they are looking more frizzy and realistic = <p> How do you style them ? S : Because the hair is wrapped and protected , I do n't have to sleep with a head scarf at night . Needless to say , this style gets points from the hubs simply because of that . When I get up , I finger comb the locs , moisturize and seal with the Hydratherma Naturals products . I pat the moisturizer and oil through the locs and they soak up the moisture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear my locs hanging straight down .

@@72561760 @1261760/ <h> Does Trimming Hair Actually Make it Grow Faster ? <p> Here is some food for thought ! - Trimming could allow your hair to attain a longer length. - It sounds strange but what my fellow lab rats discovered is that hair will grow until it reaches a critical length when it appears to grow slowly or not at all- ( Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists , pg 155-75 , 1978 . ) . <p> To understand why this happens , I will start by explaining why hair starts to taper ( meaning the strand becomes thinner as it gets farther away from the scalp ) . Simply put , the cuticle wears away . Remember that the cuticle- is not just one layer , it has several layers to it ( jog your memory by clicking- here ) . <p> As the hair grows from scalp to tip , the damage to the cuticle increases- because the hair at the tip is older and has been subjected to more torture ( combing , wetting , drying , roller setting , heat setting .. etc ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an excellent way to possibly trigger a new longer length . <p> Q : So why trim hair if you want longer hair ? A : - Trimming hair when growth appears to be slow or stagnant can allow hair to reach a new longer length ( read the first part- here ! ) . When the cuticle layer ( outside covering of the hair ) is thinned down , it no longer offers as much protection to the internal cortex . The hair at the end therefore becomes a split end hot spot ( see the diagram below ! ! ) <p> Q : How much hair should be trimmed ? A : - The first trim depends on damage . All thinning ends ideally should be cut off , this could be an inch or it could be 5 inches . Naturally it is a very personal decision if the hair cut could result in a significant appearance change , in which case you can be more conservative and just do several small chops . <p> Q : How often should hair be trimmed ? A : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the hair grow and trim as little or as much as you like . If you are interested in getting to a new longer length then logically , you have to trim less than your hair grows . If you work on the half an inch a month- growth rate , then cutting half an inch every 3 to 4 months may be logical . <p> Q : How do I know my hair has been trimmed enough ? A : - I can only give a subjective answer to this question . I would say that after a trim , if you notice many split ends soon after , then you probably did not trim enough . If you trimmed enough , your hair should not split as much or as often as before ( at least this is my theory ! ) <p> What is your view on trimming ?

Your hair grows in cycles . The best way to make get longer hair is to keep it healthy .

However , this formula is deceptively simple because many times breakage goes completely unnoticed . There are things that we regard as normal for natural hair and to some extent they are default properties of hair. - - For example , the curlier and the kinkier the hair , the more difficult it is to run a comb through it . However in order to keep gaining length , the breakage associated with grooming natural hair needs to be tackled and minimised . This is the story of hidden breakage , how to recognize it and how to fix it . <h> 1 . Comb persistently stopping or getting stuck in hair <p> Short Term Damage : Breakage usually long strands ( i.e more than half of total length ) Long Term Damage : Creation of mid shaft splits which eventually breakWhy is it ignored : The long strands that break can easily be mistaken for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair regardless of width of curl , hair with kinks , naturals with thick- - individual strands ( often because- - it is assumed that the hair is strong and can take vigorous combing ) <p> Every single time you run a comb through your hair and it stops , you need to also stop . The comb stops because it is at a tangle. - - Pressing down on the comb is not the solution and in fact can be a reason for your hair to start breaking . The physical force could easily snap hair . Continually rubbing hair at the same spot can cause mid shaft splits in kinky hair . <p> Possible resolutions to combat this problem rely on you experimenting with your hair and finding what method of combing suits your hair . The method you choose should ideally allow you to detect tangles very early on . This could be conditioner combing , finger detangling or switching from wet detangling to dry detangling or vice versa . Hair brushes often aggravate mid shaft splits so avoid them ideally or minimise how often you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strands of your hair after detangling and see if they really have a hair bulb or not . A bulb means a real shed hair , no bulb means breakage. - - If you have many mid shaft splits , be careful about stretching and combing your hair . <h> 2 . Tiny wisps of broken hair <p> Short Term Damage : Breakage usually short strands ( i.e quarter inch sections ) Long Term Damage : Creation of torn fibrillated ends which eventually become split endsWhy is it ignored : As the hair that breaks is very short , many disregard itMost at risk hair : - - hair with kinks , fine individual strands , small or tight curls , hair that is regularly heat treated . <p> If you need to dust your clothes or counter top after combing your hair to get rid of tiny little bits of hair , your hair is breaking . Often this happens with dry combing rather than wet/conditioner combing . This does not mean that your hair can not be combed dry , it just means that in order to successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One clear indication that you may suffer from this form of breakage is if you always need to repeatedly come back and detangle the ends of your hair . The possible resolutions again lie with experimenting , your skill level and how well you understand your hair . Example solutions include encouraging your hair ends to clump ( either naturally or- + la- cipriana ) or if your hair cannot- - clump opting instead to gently stretch out the hair at the end or tuck the ends in . If your hair generally breaks in this way , avoiding heat use at the ends of hair will eliminate heat related damage that can accelerate split end formation . When unravelling twists or braids , use a proper tool that will not tear your hair . <p> Your check point : - - Wear a white shirt/top when handling your hair .

Over the years , considerable research has been conducted to better understand the oil and its benefits in hair care . Recent research points to coconut oils benefits as both a sealant and hair protein reconstructor of sorts . These protein reconstructor benefits are especially interesting in black hair care applications . Solid at room temperature , coconut oil has been used for generations by women of color in those tropical paradises around the world where coconuts are indigenous and grow freely . If their hair is any testament to the powers of coconut oil in hair care , then coconut oil had me at hello . <p> Touted early on as a nutritional power food , coconut oil enthusiasts quickly began to look into some of the other benefits of coconut oil . This article will give a brief summary of current coconut oil research findings and discuss implications for black hair care . <p> Coconut oil is a very unique hair oil . This versatile , low molecular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seal the hair , but complements this sealing capacity with a strong affinity for hair proteins not found in other hair oils . Because moisturization and hydration are characteristics of water , coconut oil can not rightfully be called a moisturizer in and of itself . It does however greatly support the moisturization of the hair fiber in ways that other oils can not and have fallen short . <p> Coconut oil benefits black hair in two important ways . First , coconut oils hydrophobic oil characteristics allow it to inhibit the penetration of water from the surrounding air and environment . Second , coconut oil is able to bind to the natural protein structure of the hair . This helps the hair retain its natural moisture content and reinforces the hair fiber , making it stronger . <p> Rele and Mohile , scientists at Marico Industries , found that while wet hair is able to absorb trace amounts of coconut oil residue into the hair fiber , coconut oil is only able to act on the surface of dried hair with no penetration into the hair fiber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oils . It simply coats and conditions the outer cuticle layer enhancing shine and increasing the hair fibers pliability . It also reduces friction and static electricity between the hair fibers . 87940 @qwx707940 <p> I really like coconut oil . I use it as a prepoo treatment and on dry hair as a moisturizer and sealant . I mainly use Vatika Oil ( from the Indian store ) for prepoo and extra virgin coconut oil ( from the health food store ) for dry hair . <p> I have just started to use Coconut Oil this month . I buy mine from Whole Foods . I use the virgin Coconut Oil . It is actually working . I use it before I shampoo my hair . I let it sit on my hair for about 30 minutes , then rinse it out and do my normal routine . It has really helped with my dandruff problem . I know longer have to hide flakes because they are no longer there . So hopefully this routine will help train my hair and keep my scalp clean . <p> I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen is dandruff control too , a lot more effective for my head than tea tree oil or apple cider vinegar ! I 'm still seeing if I like it as a pre poo or if I 'll go back to my burts bees pre-poo , but either way , I 'm definitely adding it to my routine to control the flakes . <p> I incorporate coconut oil in my daily spritz and shea butter mix in that way I can get it every day without neglecting my hairs needs . This is a good subject to share and I agree with the benefits of using pure coconut oil on our hair . You can buy it at any grocery or health food store at a reasonable price . <p> Since my early natural days , I 've used coconut oil as a prepoo and sealant mixed w/sunflower oils .

( BTW I havent been able to find 100% pure coconut oil in a BSS , any brand suggestions would be greatly appreciated ) <p> I loved and blogged about both of these papers cited in this piece because they deal with surface analysis which is really my materials science speciality I think that there is an error in this sentence here : while wet hair is able to absorb trace amounts of coconut oil residue into the hair fiber , coconut oil is only able to act on the surface of dried hair with no penetration into the hair fiber The actual experiment on penetration of oil into hair ( Ruetsch , Kamath et al ) was performed on dry hair ( coconut applied , left overnight and then hair washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different , please tell me when and how you apply coconut oil . <p> I apply it after I spritz it , to dampen my hair , or when my hair is dry .

Now because you ask about me , I normally use coconut oil in two ways : 1 . As a prewash I apply the oil liberally to dry hair , sleep with it overnight and then wash my hair as normal the next day .

@@72561770 @1261770/ <h> Rules of Engagement for Mineral Oil <p> A while back we discussed why mineral oil may not be so bad especially if you are struggling with very dry hair . However , the idea of mineral oil being a moisturizer runs contrary to the fact that many of us will have experienced dry hair as a result of using mineral oil or mineral oil products . It is perfectly understandable why many of us may be cautious even skeptical about using it . These are the rules of engagement for- using mineral oil effectively : <p> 1 . You must always use mineral oil AFTER adding water to your hair . The best process would be immediately after washing , conditioning and- adding a leave in . Add the mineral oil to slightly damp hair . Mineral oil prevents water from escaping from the hair shaft . Adding it to dry hair is a recipe for even drier hair . When it comes to moisture always ask yourself.what are you sealing in ? <p> 2 . Do not reapply the mineral oil . Your hair may normally start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add more mineral oil to your hair . Spritz it instead with water and try not to add more product to it . If you really feel that you need more product , make sure that it has a humectant- such as glycerin , honey or aloe vera which can hold onto water . You can also - repeat the wash cycle instead and then it will be fine to reapply the oil . <p> 3 . Mineral oil is generally not compatible with a no-poo routine . You do not have to use a shampoo with SLS ( sulfates ) but you should use a shampoo or soap of some sort- as part of your washing step . The shampoo will help dissolve the mineral oil and avoid it building up as a thick layer on your hair . <p> 4 . Remember the fingertip tip with coconut oil ? Try the same with mineral oil . Always use as little as possible as it spreads well and generally evenly. - A thick layer can end up causing you to have a very greasy scalp . <p> 5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil as an ingredient in conditioners and restrict its use to only the final sealing step . In conditioners oils are generally included for added slip and to protect hair during the wash . Oils such as coconut oil perform this function better . <p> 6. - Mineral oil may not be for you . - You may do all the above tips and still find that mineral oil leaves your hair dry. - Trust your hair and its response. - Mineral oil can be too heavy for some hair and opting for a lighter oil may be better for you . If you do not currently use mineral oil and do not have a moisture issue , do not try to fix what is not broken . <p> So what do you think ladies ? Would you try mineral oil ? Have you tried it using these instructions ? How was the outcome ? <p> I actually am using this product that contains mineral oil as the first ingridient .

I just plan to use Giovannis Tea Tree Shampoo ( sometimes mixed with baking soda ) and follow with an ACV rinse . Would that be enough to remove the mineral oil from my hair ! <p> I appreciate this site and I do n't  mean to be rude , but what happened to the fresh and original blog posts ?

@@72561772 @1261772/ <h> 6 Benefits of Quinoa for Natural and Transitioning Hair <p> Just when you thought there could n't possibly be another miracle ingredient on the market . here comes quinoa . Before your eyes glaze over and you skip to the next article , let me shed a little light on how this super seed can take your regimen and hair care to the next level . <p> What is Quinoa ( keen-wah ) ? <p> There is a common misconception that quinoa is a grain . Although it can replace grains like rice in meals , in truth , it is an herbaceous seed native to Central and South America . It has been traditionally used for soups , making beer and ground as meals for porridges and cakes . In recent years , it has made its resurgence in health-conscious circles as a nutrient-dense superfood . <p> Quinoa is incredibly protein dense , and is a good source of calcium , fiber , phosphorous , magnesium , iron and amino acids . It also contains powerful antioxidant compounds such as polyphenols and quercetin that help combat oxidative stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also gluten-free . <p> What Does This Mean for My Hair ? <p> The availability of quinoa presents an awesome opportunity for natural hair care , especially when it comes to protein treatments . Do n't  run off to Whole Foods to buy ingredients for a DIY Quinoa Conditioner just yet ! As JC explains here , most proteins must be hydrolyzed first ( i.e. made the appropriate size ) to be of any benefit to the hair . <p> Because it is a complete protein and contains all of the essential 8 amino acids , hydrolyzed quinoa has an enhanced ability to assist in the repair , protection and conditioning of hair . Hair treated with hydrolyzed quinoa looks and feels smoother after one use , retains moisture better , is stronger , shows less signs of damage and has better protected cuticles . Hydrolyzed quinoa is also able to penetrate the hair , strengthening it from the cortex and along the surface . Studies show utilizing hydrolyzed quinoa improved hair health and strength after one use , but increase substantially after 5 uses of products with viable amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair in the following areas : <p> detangling <p> improved shine <p> ease of wet and dry combing <p> softening <p> binding moisture to the hair <p> soothing irritated scalp <p> - What Products Can I Use ? <p> Luckily , getting your quinoa fix is n't impossible . Although many products are still using wheat , soy and oat proteins , there are a few who are hopping on the quinoa train . Be sure to check out : 87941 @qwx707941

I think if the oil coats the hair , and its smoke point is when the coat breaks then it would serve as a good heat protectant on low heat ( like blow dryers or low ( 350F or below ) flat irons , because the smoke point ( aka coat break ) of grapeseed oil is 390F .
