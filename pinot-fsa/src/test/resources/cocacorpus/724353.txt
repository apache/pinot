Henceforth the UK will be without the security and flexibility of supply offered by a large scale storage facility . <h> Life after Rough Part 1 <h> How did Rough come to be ? <p> The Rough storage facility started life as a regular North Sea gas field , beginning operation in 1975 . British Gas purchased the field in 1980 having already withdrawn one third of the field 's reserves . The company then converted the site into a natural gas storage facility which began operation in 1985 . Given the large capacity of the Rough storage facility it operated on a seasonal long-range basis , as opposed to smaller mid-range or short-term facilities . Seasonal storage sites seek to take advantage of a wide variance in gas prices between the summer and winter seasons , created by changes in seasonal demand and the availability of supply flexibility . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes which are transferred in and out ) and cushion gas . Cushion gas stays in the site to maintain the operating pressure required to allow working gas to be injected and withdrawn . The maximum volume of working gas is around 36TWh . Total cushion gas accounts for an additional 97TWh , of which around 54TWh is classed as recoverable . <h> Problems of an aging site <p> As the site aged and reached the end of its initial operational life , maintenance work became more frequent and impactful on operations . During routine testing in March 2015 , Centrica identified a problem with one of the site 's wells . As a consequence all injection and withdrawal operations ceased from June 2016 . Centrica continued with testing and in September that year permanently closed its smaller 47/8A platform . This closed off six of the site 's 30 wells and subsequently reduced the facility 's overall withdrawal rate by 8% . <p> Unable to build up supplies , reserves in the Rough site started winter 2016/17 at around 40% of capacity . Withdrawals returned at the site in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . However , the site was unable to re-inject gas and by the end of winter virtually all of the working gas volume had been withdrawn . <h> Short-term gas windfall ? <p> On 20 June Centrica confirmed the permanent closure of the facilities . After announcing the permanent closure of Rough , Centrica applied to the Oil and Gas Authority for the right to withdraw cushion gas from the site , during the decommissioning of the field . With injections unavailable , Centrica is eager to produce as much of the gas in store as possible before the site is fully decommissioned . The volume of recoverable cushion gas is estimated by Centrica to be 54TWh . This is around 15TWh higher than the maximum volume reached in any of the previous five years of operation . As a consequence the cushion gas could sustain at least two further winter seasons if recovered . <p> However , there is still a high level of uncertainty surrounding the possible recovery of the cushion gas and further details are needed from Centrica . The rate of withdrawal slows as stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw the gas as fast as seen in previous years . <p> In the second part of this blog , Utilitywise will look at the UK gas supply system going forward , assessing the impact , if any at all , of the recent announcement . We ask what will the gas system do now , will the loss of Rough really make a difference , and how will the possible use of cushion gas at the site affect supply in the short-term ? <p> For the latest industry updates , visit our blog or follow @UTWinsights on Twitter 142875 @qwx342875

@@30195312 @3895312/ <h> Triad dates confirmed <p> The Triad period has ended for another year . As usual , the season has provided its own set of challenges and possible surprises . Were pleased to say we successfully warned our clients ahead of all three Triads . <p> Utilitywise successfully called all three Triad dates and only issued 10 Red alerts . <h> Why care ? <p> National Grid , the operator of the UK 's electricity transmission network , recovers its costs through Transmission Network Use of System ( TNUoS ) charges . While the rates paid vary from consumer to consumer , at the heart of them all is the Triad methodology . The expenses that National Grid recovers reflect system investment and management needed to meet the three half hours of highest national transmission system demand over the winter . They occur between November to February each year and must be split by at least ten clear days . For many businesses billed on a half-hourly basis , TNUoS costs will directly reflect their own peak demand during the three Triads . If a business can avoid using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could cut their overall transmission costs . The trick is trying to predict when the Triads will occur and react accordingly . <h> Utilitywise expectations <p> During the last Triad season , Utilitywise provided daily reports for customers on the potential for a Triad to occur . Over those four months , we indicated there was a possibility for a Triad on 17 days . For ten of these occurrences we warned it was very likely ( our strongest warning ) that a Triad would occur . <p> The amount of alerts called by Utilitywise is almost 30% less than last year . This means that businesses would have had to reduce or change production on fewer occasions if they reacted to the alerts to cut their transmissions costs . Overall , those issuing alerts seem to have been more successful in predicting the Triads this year . While the ideal scenario is to call just three alerts through the season , predicting all three Triads accurately at the same time is extremely difficult . <h> Forecasting trouble <p> National Grid is the main source of data and information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The information , provided through balancing service administrator Elexon , gives forecasts of demand across the year . The accuracy of these forecasts understandably drops the further in the future the event is . However , even at the day ahead level there are difficulties . <p> In the graph below , initial demand for the weekdays in the last Triad period is compared to both the National Grid forecast in the morning , and that in the afternoon , closer to the point of peak demand . Even with the later forecast , there are notable differences between forecast and actual demand . <p> In most cases , actual demand ended up below expectations , which would impact upon any Triad alerts based on National Grid forecasts . <p> There are many factors which affect the accuracy of demand forecasts . A key element is weather conditions , such as temperature , which may vary from expectations and dramatically alter demand . The weather could also change the level of wind generation , affecting peak electricity system demand , as more businesses use their onsite generation for energy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . Businesses reacting to a potential Triad will cut overall system demand . This reduction in peak system demand may mean that the day turns out not to be a Triad after all . These factors are all changeable , volatile and affect demand in a relatively short time . <h> Flat lines <p> The scale of error in National Grid demand forecasts is having an increasing impact on Triad alerts , particularly as UK demand is generally falling , helped by the push for energy efficiency . <p> Demand levels from day-to-day are also varying less over the Triad period . At points when demand has reached levels where a Triad is likely , the daily variation in demand has sometimes been as little as 300MW . With potential levels of error of 450MW , it becomes difficult to easily identify which of the days will be a Triad . <p> This is particularly a concern when you are seeking the third Triad . In recent years , it has been quite clear what the highest or even second highest demand levels will be due to the scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third Triad , becomes more problematic if there is very little to distinguish demand levels from day-to-day . <h> What you see is not what you get <p> Matters are complicated as demand used to define a Triad is provided over the winter . The calculation of system demand goes through different stages of settlement ' before it is considered final . This is due to more accurate data becoming available over time . With demand variations being smaller , the changes caused by settlement become more important . This was highlighted in 2015/16 when a day which many thought was a Triad " and one National Grid itself was forecasting as one of the three peaks " did not turn out to be a Triad . This meant that some actually missed one of the three Triads " though Utilitywise did not . In the end , there was less than 1MW difference between the two potential Triad points under debate , so we 're proud to have identified this correctly in such close circumstances . <p> This year saw something similar occurring . The National Grid operational demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different Triad points to the data from current settlement data . The data ultimately ended up being more accurate . As Triads need to be ten clear days apart , it does not take much of a change in demand to affect when the Triads could ultimately be called . <h> The next evolution <p> The final results of this year 's Triad period will not only confirm the scale of Transmission costs consumers will face , but will help inform and improve the forecasting of these potentially very costly demand points . 142874 @qwx342874

Some stores have also seen the connection of AHUs allowing for remote control of internal environmental temperatures and remote fault-finding for maintenance purposes . The implemented BeMS has achieved a 15% savings in Icelands lighting bill across 850 stores in the first year alone . Additional opportunities are also being investigated to identify further savings . Our team are working closely with Iceland to implement load shedding and load shifting activities to reduce electricity charges at peak DUoS and TNUoS times .

@@30195387 @3895387/ <p> The Government has issued new guidance on planned exemptions for Energy Intensive Industries ( EIIs ) . It has also started the process of changing the law to allow the exemptions to be provided . While some businesses will see a reduction in charges , the discount will result in higher charges for the rest of the UK . <h> What are EIIs and how do they benefit ? <p> EIIs are businesses with high levels of electricity usage . They predominantly cover areas such as mining and heavy manufacturing , of which high energy usage is integral to their day-to-day operation . <p> Plans were set out to reduce the cost of renewable policies on EIIs as part of the Autumn Statement in 2015 . Qualifying firms were initially offered compensation from the cost of the schemes as part of a rebate . <h> What 's changing ? <p> The new scheme for EIIs will see these businesses exempt from paying the bulk of CfD costs . CfD exemption will be for a maximum of 85% of an EII 's volume . It has received State Aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new UK legislation . Similar plans for the costs of the Renewables Obligation ( RO ) and Feed-in Tariff ( FiT ) are still under discussion with the EU . <p> Current expectations are that the CfD exemption will be fully rolled-out by the end of the year . However , the timescale is uncertain , with UK legislation needing to be approved before it can come into force . <h> What does this mean for non-exempt businesses ? <p> The costs for CfD are passed to bill payers via electricity suppliers . The proposed modifications will not change the overall costs of the CfD scheme , just how it is recovered from bill payers . <p> The exemption for eligible EII volume will mean that the costs of the CfD scheme are spread over a smaller consumption base than is currently the case . As such , the unit rate for those who will still have to pay for the CfD will increase . Based on Government estimates of EII exempt demand , the CfD unit rate will rise by around 4% . <p> While EII 's will still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume , their effective unit rate will be lower . They are still using the same volume of electricity , just not being charged for CfD on all of it . It is expected , as with other similar exemption schemes such as the CCL , the unit rate will be reduced on EII bills to reflect the scale of eligible volume that is exempt . The potential impact is illustrated in the table below . <p> The latest Government forecasts have suggested a lower impact on final bills than initially expected . This is partly a result of a lower volume of EIIs seeking exemption than previously forecast . However , the actual price impact of the EII exemption is uncertain , as it is not yet clear how many businesses will be taking part and to what degree their electricity consumption will be exempt . The exemption is on the eligible electricity used by the EII . Based on a site 's usage , not all of their metered volume could be considered to be eligible .

@@30195413 @3895413/ <p> Coal capacity in the UK is set to decrease again . Supply concerns- were enhanced this month with news of two further coal plant closures . This has brought into sharp focus the impending loss of over 7GW of coal capacity from the grid , equivalent to around 15% of average winter UK electricity demand . Despite predictions of blackouts , the UK has successfully negotiated the current winter period relatively stress-free . However , focus has already switched to next winter . <p> A sharp reduction in coal plant availability has led to National Grid forecasting negative margins for several weeks through November 2016 to January 2017 . <p> The newly announced closures of coal plant at Fiddlers Ferry and Rugeley brings the total loss of coal plant in 2016 to more than 7GW . Both plant cited the challenging market conditions for coal at present as reasons for closing earlier than scheduled . Three of the four units at Fiddlers Ferry are set to close in April 2016 , taking 1.5GW of power off the grid . This is despite those three units being awarded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capacity Market ( CM ) , designed to secure future power supplies . Though the plant will incur a -33m fine for breaking the CM contract , closing in April will avoid further annual losses estimated at between -30m and -50m . This highlights just how financially challenging operating a coal plant currently is . <p> Coal plant are struggling to break even on each MWh of electricity produced <p> Persistent declines in coal prices , falling demand from a mild winter along with a concerted global effort to curb carbon emissions and push towards renewables have placed significant pressure on the coal industry . As a result , profitability " measured by Clean Dark spreads shown in the graph below " has tumbled since the end of last summer . <p> Coal availability currently sits at close to 17GW ( roughly 37% of average winter UK electricity demand ) generated from 10 coal power stations across Britain . By the summer , this coal capacity will have fallen below 10GW following the closure of five coal plant : <p> Longannet ( 2260MW ) " closing 1 March 2016 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferrybridge ( 980MW ) " closing 1 April 2016 <p> Fiddlers Ferry ( 1961MW ) " closing 1 April 2016 <p> Rugeley ( 1000MW ) " closing summer 2016 <p> Of the five remaining coal plant , two ( Cottam and West Burton ) have no Government subsidy beyond 2019 . Both are operated by EDF Energy and are running up substantial losses . The French-owned group recently booked over G800m in lost value against the two coal plant as revenues failed to meet original expectations . <p> One unit at both Eggborough and Fiddlers Ferry are taking part in the National Grid 's Supplemental Balancing Reserve ( SBR ) . The SBR is part of National Grid 's toolkit of options available to boost supply margins during times of high demand . The units at Eggborough and Fiddlers Ferry will be paid to remain open , ready to be called on when required at times of system stress . However , the SBR is an annual service and there is no guarantee that the units will take part in subsequent SBR schemes . <p> Why are coal plant closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directives aimed at curbing carbon emissions across the EU . This has impacted most heavily on the inefficient and carbon-intensive coal plant . The Industrial Emissions Directive ( IED ) required coal plant to meet certain criteria for carbon emissions by 2023 . Only one of the current coal plant ( Ratcliffe ) has signalled its intent to comply with the regulation . The Aberthaw plant has opted out of the IED which has left the plant with a limited operational life of 17,500 hours from 1 January 2016 . The three remaining plant are considering their options having opted into the Transitional National Plan , delaying compliance requirements until 2020 . However , under current economic conditions- there seems little incentive for loss-making plant to stay open . Plans announced by UK Energy Secretary Amber Rudd will close all coal plant by 2025 , though by then it 's likely this will only affect one plant , as the others will have closed several years earlier . <p> Are there alternatives in place ? <p> The Government 's intention is to replace coal plant with renewable generation and new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidy schemes have only led to the construction of one Combined Cycle Gas Turbine ( CCGT ) plant " Carrington 's 800MW site due online in early 2016 . Meanwhile the Trafford plant , which secured a subsidy via the Capacity Market , has so far failed to secure appropriate investment to start construction . The issues surrounding the management of the new Hinkley C nuclear plant have seen costs multiply and the project delayed as much as eight years . <p> The overall situation has left the UK with a dearth of guaranteed capacity for Winter 2016/17 , particularly if weather conditions induce a sharp increase in demand . National Grid has a range of balancing reserves on hand to boost margins by both reducing demand and bringing online additional supply when required . However , with negative margins forecast throughout next Winter , the threat of blackouts has increased substantially . <p> The market remains hopeful that National Grid will conjure up a short-term fix before a long-term strategy can be implemented to address this issue . 142875 @qwx342875

Year-ahead contracts have fluctuated around three month lows , following a steady downward trend seen through February . Healthy supply and demand fundamentals continue to provide the main source of downward pressure to the energy market . Rising temperatures heading into the summer season have contributed to falling demand across gas and power . The UK clock change at the end of March will further cut peak power consumption as evenings stay lighter for longer . Brighter conditions this week have already supported solar generation , which peaked at over 5.5GW on Tuesday . The renewable source will provide a further supply boost over the summer season , cutting the need for gas and coal-fired generation . Strong wind generation this week added further downside to the prompt . Day-ahead power prices are down over -10/MWh month-on-month , hovering around three-month lows at -43/MWh . <p> The UK gas system has been oversupplied this week , pressuring the Day-ahead market .

While the short-term supply outlook remains healthy , there are still concerns over the availability of the Rough storage site for next winter . Injections are at present unavailable until at least July with stocks down around 50% year-on-year . Entering another winter season with low stored gas levels would increase the pressure on imports and LNG to meet the shortfall , potentially pushing up prices . 142875 @qwx342875

Find out how were helping VIRTUS take advantage of the CCA extension . <h> The Brief <p> In July 2014 the Climate Change Agreement ( CCA ) was extended to the Data Centre industry , providing data centre providers with the ability to make huge cost savings , by aligning the amount of carbon tax that operators have to pay with the energy efficiencies the company puts in place . <p> VIRTUS prides itself on providing customers with flexible cost effective services and were keen to obtain a CCA for their LONDON1 data centre as soon as possible , to bolster their already excellent environmental credentials . This would not only help minimise the impact of the Carbon Reduction Commitment ( CRC ) on their clients , creating a more efficient operation , but also allow them to pass these additional cost savings onto customers . Utilitywise Corporate Division was already working with VIRTUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into practice and was requested to assist in VIRTUS ' CCA application . <p> Committed to Efficiency <p> VIRTUS is committed to the continual improvement of its environmental and operating efficiency and so was already on an existing Green energy contract ; using an environmental management system , based on BS EN ISO 14001:2004 and an energy management system based on BS EN ISO 50001:2011 . <p> VIRTUS was exempt for the first phase of the CRC which finished in March 2014 , however due to their continued growth it was required to comply in Phase-II . This would have increased its fuel costs by an additional 7% , the cost of which would have been passed through to clients or absorbed internally . However , by signing up to the CCA , VIRTUS would be relieved of these carbon costs from the date of CCA activation , minimising the impacts on its customers . <p> As a result , VIRTUS is required to make efficiency improvements towards the sectors overall efficiency target ( based on PUE ) of 15% by 2020 . For VIRTUS this target fits well into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement . <h> Our Approach <p> A successful collaboration <p> The CCA application process at the LONDON1 site was completed in an especially short timeframe and this was largely achieved through the close working relationship fostered between Utilitywise and VIRTUS . <p> VIRTUS had already installed complete sub-metering across its LONDON1 site , and coupled with the expertise at Utilitywise , this meant that the process from site visit to CCA activation was completed in just four weeks . Furthermore , the Underlying Agreement approval was given just five working days after the application had originally been made . <p> VIRTUS supplied the IT data load , whilst Utilitywise sourced the invoice data , completed the application pack and associated documentation . This included an annotated site plan , exemption calculations , process flowchart and process description , all of which lead to high praise from the scheme administrators relating to the high quality of the application . <p> As an ongoing service , Utilitywise will manage the agreement on behalf of VIRTUS checking eligibility , as well as reporting on performance and managing their evidence pack . <h> Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagship data center , LONDON2 , which has been designed from the outset as a model of efficiency aimed to meet the growing demand for scalable , reliable , on-demand colocation services .

The gains are being fed by a combination of supply-demand concerns in gas and escalating crude oil prices . <p> UK temperatures have dipped sharply in the last week , falling to five degrees below seasonal normal levels bringing conditions back to those seen in late January . The cold weather has pushed up domestic heating demand . Overall gas consumption had already been supported by the use of the fuel in electricity generation , exports to the Continent and injections into storage . The increased UK demand has left the market undersupplied at points , especially as Norwegian imports have been cut by maintenance . Both the cold and the maintenance is expected to continue into May , adding to the support for prices . <p> Storage reserves have been used to help offset the drop in Norwegian supplies , pulling down already weak Rough long-range storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stock made in medium-range storage over Easter . Conversely , with storage being used , it has meant that there has been less injection demand , taking some of the pressure off the system . Meanwhile , the recent ramp up in UK prices has also led to a switch from UK export to imports from the Continent as UK supplies become too expensive to sell into Europe . UK gas supplies have also been helped by the use of LNG , with eight cargoes delivered in April and two already booked for May . The suspected Qatari maintenance has not slowed the pace of deliveries and recent trends in Asian prices have made the UK and the Europe more attractive for LNG cargoes . <p> Meanwhile , oil prices continue to push higher , supporting forward gas prices . Data indicating weakening production provided support . While the market remains oversupplied , there are expectations that this will be rebalanced . At the same time , the dollar has weakened , making crude oil cheaper in other currencies and so more attractive to purchase . 142874 @qwx342874

We gave an alert on 24 of these days , through our traffic light ' warning system . <p> The number of times we advised action to avoid Triads was lower than last year , increasing the value of the offering . Furthermore , on the day we provided an Amber ' alert , 25 November 2015 , most of the other tracked suppliers with Triad alerts failed to provide any such warning . The alert on 25 November may have caught many by surprise given the forecast demand around the day . On initial demand data from National Grid , it looked like the previous Monday had higher demand of nearly 300MW . Ultimately , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This highlights just how flat demand had become this winter . Furthermore , it is worth noting that demand surpassed the lower Triad levels in March , outside of the Triad period . Given the Triad process is designed to capture the peak demand for the year , this does create questions over if the current methodology is fit for purpose . <p> Analysis done in previous years found that those that reacted to possible Triads saved over 10% in their transmission charges . However , the value of acting falls if demand is cut too often . Every time electricity demand is cut , this could also result in lost production for the business . This is partly mitigated by the Utilitywise alert methodology . A Red Alert ' signals a very high likelihood of a Triad , and a full demand response is advised . However , if the risk is less significant , but still possible , the Utilitywise Amber Alert ' suggests a more moderated response . Even a small reduction in demand may provide savings against the baseline transmission costs . <p> In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this must always be balanced against the costs of doing so . This is one of the constant challenges in Triad forecasting , and one that is also changing from year-to-year . 142874 @qwx342874

What is ESOS ? <p> The Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme ( ESOS ) is UK legislation ( based on article 8 of the EU Energy Directive ) that makes energy audits mandatory for large organisations . The aim is to reduce EU energy consumption by 20 per cent by 2020 . Estimates indicate approximately -1.7bn of net benefits to the UK . <p> Public bodies subject to the public contracts regulations 2006 are not affected . <p> 4 . How do I comply ? <p> First an organisation , energy managers and facilities managers needs to measure its complete energy usage , then understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ISO 50001 certification , - Green Deal Assessments or- Display Energy Certificates can all play a part in compliance . One of our first- steps would be to identify which is the right option for you . <p> 5 . Why should I comply ? <p> The ESOS assessment is a mandatory requirement for all affected businesses ; if you do n't comply the Environment Agency ( EA ) can enforce financial penalties of up to -90,000 . Many organisations are seeing ESOS as a catalyst to kick start energy efficiency across their operations as it will identify opportunities for real saving . Alternatively by at least implementing some opportunities the cost of compliance can be covered . It is likely that many organisations will not have budgeted for ESOS . <p> 6 . How soon do I need to act ? <p> Straight away ! Entrants must undertake audits and provide your notification of compliance ( or equivalent ) covering 90% or more of their organisational energy by 5 December 2015 and then ongoing for each four yearly phase . <p> 7 . What 's the rush ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limited number of qualified professionals to carry out audits and assist with compliance . Acting now means you avoid the risk of overpaying for audits later in the year if other companies hike their prices closer to the compliance deadline . If you set your reference period sooner you will have more time to complete compliance . <p> 8 . What happens if I do n't comply ? <p> The EA have the authority to apply civil penalties against those mandated companies not participating in ESOS , or found to be non-compliant with its requirements . Failure to comply with ESOS will result in fines of up to -50,000 and possible charges of an additional -500 per day for up to 80 days , totalling -90,000 . Non-complying companies will also be named and shamed . As a result it 's far cheaper to comply . <p> 9 . What types of energy are covered by ESOS audits ? <p> Energy used in buildings , transport and industrial processes . <p> 10 . How long is the audit valid ? <p> There is no validity to an audit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 11 . Can I conduct the audits myself , or do I need certain qualifications ? <p> ESOS audits must be signed-off by a Lead Assessor , who must be listed on an Environment Agency approved register of energy professionals . An in-house member of your team could carry out the audit provided they have the right qualifications . Alternatively , using an external consultant can really add value to your compliance as they will be well aware of the requirements of the scheme . A team member will have to invest time , potentially months , to understand ESOS fully , which is time that can be better spent on their usual day-to-day responsibilities . <p> 12 . Do I have to act on recommendations that come from the audit ? <p> Only if you want to reap the real benefits of compliance . If you take advantage of the opportunities ESOS identifies it 's likely you can cover the cost of compliance and make further savings in the future . However , implementing the recommendations is not mandatory . 
@@30195474 @3895474/ <h> Winter energy issues every buyer needs to know <h> Winter energy buyers need to be aware of the challenges of the season <h> Colder weather drives up heating demand <p> Demand changes are perhaps the most evident price driver for the winter . The winter season is the period of highest demand for both the UK 's gas and electricity systems . Running from October to March inclusive , the season encompasses the most extreme of the country 's weather . The darker , colder weather conditions provide a platform for increased winter energy consumption as households stay inside more , switch on central heating and turn lights on earlier . <p> The UK 's domestic heating system is mostly gas-fired . As such , - cold temperatures have a far stronger impact on gas demand levels than they do on power . Daily average domestic ( Local Distribution Zone ) demand for the summer season this year ( April to September 2016 ) was 84 million cubic meters ( mcm ) . However , the average demand for the previous winter season was 175mcm per day " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas demand has already doubled this October , compared to September. - The gas system has experienced tightness which has supported a steady rise in gas prices . However , the UK is yet to experience a prolonged cold snap . When a spell of below seasonal normal temperatures hits the UK , how well the system copes with the spike in demand will tell the market a lot about the UK 's supply situation for the rest of the season . <p> Winter weather conditions also affect peak power demand . However , it is daylight hours that have the bigger impact when it comes to electricity rather than temperatures , given the relatively low use of electrical heating in the UK . The end of the British Summer Time put clocks back one hour at the end of October . This traditionally provides an increase in peak demand of 6-7% ( around 3GW ) as the number of evening daylight hours shorten . <h> UK reliant on outside help for supply <p> The increased demand levels inherently place additional strain on the gas and power systems as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The UK has developed its own gas reserves in the North Sea and UK Continental Shelf . However , as domestic production has matured and gas extraction becomes more complex and expensive , the UK is increasingly looking to imports via pipelines and Liquefied Natural Gas ( LNG ) tankers to provide sufficient supply . In fact , the UK has been a net importer of gas since 2004 . <p> Norwegian production levels operate on seasonal profiles , switching between winter energy and summer energy- levels in line with demand . From 1 October , the switch to the winter profile led to an increase in overall production and subsequently stronger exports to the UK . Norway 's oil and gas company , Statoil , also agreed to increase annual production limits at its largest gas field , Troll , from 1 October , increasing available supply further . The UK can also utilise gas imports from Europe via the BBL pipeline with the Netherlands and the Interconnector with Belgium . However , as with any imports , price differentials come into force . <h> The cost of winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Euro since the UK 's vote to leave the European Union on 23 June . This has increased the cost of imports for the UK when buying supply from Europe . Day-ahead gas prices have risen 50% so far this winter as the UK tries to maintain a premium over Continental prices to attract supply to Britain ahead of Europe . <p> The UK can also import LNG , predominantly shipped from Qatar , into its terminals at South Hook , Isle of Grain and Dragon . There are annual contracts for deliveries , but the UK still competes in the global market for spot cargoes , meaning frequency of delivery is dependent on global demand levels and market prices . During the winter , demand can be high across Europe , particularly if there is a widespread cold snap , which can increase competition for available LNG supply , and subsequently push up prices . So far this winter , the UK has struggled with low LNG deliveries . Just two tankers arrived in October and the first November arrival is not due until the seventh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressure on other supply sources to make up the shortfall . <h> Gas saved for a cold day <p> Gas storage sites play a significant role in the fundamental make up of supply during the winter season . Producers build up storage stocks during the summer season , when demand is relatively low , in preparation for withdrawing that supply during the higher demand winter period . The level of storage supply available at the start of the winter is often an indication as to how well the UK will be able to cope with the higher demand levels . <p> This year , the UK is facing significant problems with its sole long-range storage site at Rough . Representing more than 70% of the UK 's storage capacity and able to meet 10% of peak day winter energy demand , the Rough storage site is critical to the UK 's ability to navigate the winter . However , routine safety checks back in March 2015 revealed problems with the integrity of the wells at the site . Injection capability was limited and a storage cap was put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in operation today . In June 2016 an additional issue was discovered which prompted Centrica to cease all injections and withdrawal operations at the site . Injections at the site will not be available until at least April 2017 . <h> Shortfall of reserves <p> With suppliers unable to inject gas into the site , stock levels at Rough have been stuck at 40% of capacity , with around 1.5 billion cubic meters of gas less than 2015 . Some withdrawals will be possible from November but the significant shortfall of reserves has limited the UK 's supply flexibility for the winter and increased the pressure on pipeline imports , LNG and withdrawals from medium-range storage sites to meet demand . <p> European gas storage levels , conversely , are significantly higher than last year . While this offers an avenue for potential imports to the UK during the winter , the availability of imports is dependent on winter energy- demand levels in Europe as well as pricing , with the current weak value of the pound raising costs for UK buyers . <h> Keeping the lights on <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant concerns over the availability of power supply during times of system stress . National Grid- manages and balances the electricity network between supply and demand. - It has a toolkit of measures it can put in place to help balance the system . However , the grid operator has still forecast tight and negative margins several times already this winter . Tight surplus margins should remain very narrow through much of November , December and January . <p> While the margins do not include possible Interconnector flows , transferring supply from overseas , the upcoming winter is expected to be the most challenging in decades . <p> A sharp reduction in the number of coal-fired plant has reduced the UK 's baseload capacity . Baseload plant are able to generate electricity consistently . They ensure a minimum level of supply is provided to the grid at all times . However , a challenging economic environment and increased taxes for carbon consumption have triggered the closure of several plant . Nearly 6GW of coal plant capacity has closed since the beginning of the year with a further 4GW only available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves just 9GW of coal left which can operate freely . The reduction in baseload plant has made the country more susceptible to fluctuations in renewable generation " with wind and solar supply entirely weather dependent . <h> Renewable generation <p> Solar generation is minimal during the darker winter seasons and while wind levels are generally stronger during the winter , there are still strong fluctuations in available supply . Most of the main sources of renewable generation " wind and solar are unable to provide baseload electricity as their output is intermittent . As a result , it can not be relied on to meet demand during times of stress . This already led to significant price spikes during September as the UK power system struggled to guarantee sufficient supply to meet demand . Day-ahead power prices spiked to record highs at over -150/MWh and there remains a strong potential for further price spikes through the coming winter . <h> Interconnectors <p> The UK is able to import power supply via Interconnectors from France , Netherlands and Ireland . However , the availability of interconnection has seen major problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed a fault in late September and will be shut down until the end of February 2017 , reducing the available imports from Ireland by 50% for the bulk of the winter . In France , safety concerns over its nuclear power plant have resulted in the shutdown of 12 reactors , with maintenance work expected to run until the new year . This has halted the expected flow of supply from France to the UK as the country struggles with tight supplies and becomes dependent on neighbouring countries " including the UK " for imports itself . <h> Balancing the system <p> National Grid has a range of balancing tools and reserve power that it can call upon if faced with the prospect of tight supplies or worse . The operator has secured more than 3.5GW of back-up gas and coal-fired capacity as part of the Supplemental Balancing Reserve ( SBR ) to help support- winter energy demand . Schemes such as the SBR can avoid the risk of blackouts. - However , the cost of paying plant to come online when required places an additional strain on customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-commodity charges . <p> Stay up to date with the latest market developments concerning winter energy issues with help from our Energy Markets team . <p> Veronica joined Utilitywise in 2002 and currently manages the Market Intelligence and Analytics Team .

While the issue was a short-term factor , and the gains were focused on contracts for delivery close to the present , it has raised concerns for the coming winter . However , there has not been a corresponding jump in the value of gas , and contracts for both commodities beyond the coming winter have remained largely stable . <p> Going into this week , National Grid had been forecasting tight electricity supply margins , due in part to expected plant outages of over 8GW . However , the scale of the difference between supply and demand tightened further this week , with a drop in wind generation the main factor .

The gas system has been generally oversupplied , despite continued strong exports to the Continent . The use of medium-range storage and LNG has contributed to the oversupply .

Meanwhile , while storage is being used , medium-range stocks are still at comfortable levels going into the winter . While this might be putting downward pressure on gas prices , there remain concerns over the winter supply-demand balance .

@@30195486 @3895486/ <h> Rough storage is far from smooth this winter <p> The UK 's largest storage site has been offline since June , greatly limiting UK supply flexibility this winter and impacting gas prices across the board . With the Rough storage site returning next month , how will this impact on the UK energy market and what plans do we have for future storage ? <p> Rough is the UK 's only long-range storage facility and its operation in 2016 has been markedly different to previous years . With withdrawals expected to return by 9 December , we 're looking at how Rough storage may operate " and affect the market " for the rest of this season . <p> Rough 's operator , Centrica , began testing works on the site 's wells back in March 2015 . After identifying a problem with one of the wells tested , all injection and withdrawal operations ceased in June 2016 . Then in July , Centrica extended the shutdown of injections until at least March 2017 . This left the Rough storage site at around 40% of capacity heading into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season was 1.5bcm " the equivalent to 12 additional LNG tanker deliveries . <p> In August , Centrica confirmed withdrawal operations could return subject to completing relevant testing . This testing is expected to be completed shortly with withdrawals from the site scheduled to return by 9 December 2016 . <h> Finding a pattern from previous winters <p> The total amount of gas which the Rough storage site can hold- has changed for each of the last three years due to maximum operating levels . Problems began after Centrica increased the maximum operating pressure at the site in 2014/15 . Subsequently pressure levels at the site and the maximum available operating limit has been reduced each year . <p> In previous years , storage withdrawals have been minimal for the early stages of the winter season . For each of the last four years , inventories have been more than 30 TWh at the turn of the year . This was then followed by a three-month period of heavy withdrawals . Sendout then began to slow around April time , stabilising close to 10-15% of capacity . <p> Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below this level . Freezing conditions raised demand to such an extent that Rough was effectively empty during April . This forced it to dip into emergency supply . During this post-Christmas spell there is a base rate of consistent steady withdrawals from the site , with supplies able to increase in line with demand levels , should colder temperatures increase consumption . <p> However , with Rough entering the winter season with significantly less stored gas than previous years , how the site reacts is unlikely to follow a similar pattern . <h> An exceptional year <p> The UK gas system has so far coped with cold snaps pushing up demand levels . The market has utilised interconnection with Europe to import supplies from the Continent , where stored gas inventories are significantly higher than in previous years . <p> With storage withdrawals due to return in early December 2016 , the site , at 40% of capacity , will still be around two and a half months behind previous years in terms of stock availability . In the last few years , stocks at Rough have not fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly reduced available supply , steady withdrawals throughout the remainder of the winter are highly unlikely . Rough is more likely to act commercially , as it would a medium range storage site . The turnaround time of withdrawing from the Rough storage site- is longer than the medium range sites already operating . <p> However , it is still possible for Rough to act in line with demand levels . Gas would be withdrawn only at peak prices during periods of high demand , such as a cold snap . This boost in storage flexibility during periods of high demand would likely be depressive to prices . Balance of Winter gas prices have already fallen around 2% following the news of a restart of withdrawals . Expectations of improved flexibility for the first quarter of 2017 have boosted the supply outlook , providing the UK with another source of gas to meet spells of high demand . <h> Long-term plans for Rough storage <p> The maintenance issue that has beset the Rough storage site this year raised concerns over the future of its- viability . Having been in operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a priority . Centrica has already permanently closed its smaller 47/8A platform which connected to six offshore wells , following concerns over age and deterioration . <p> It is within the interest of the UK government to maintain a strategic long-term storage facility . This is the case , even if the financial appetite for investment is not clear at this time . The storage capability on the Continent and the UK 's links with Belgium , Netherlands and Norway has , this winter at least , negated much of the requirement for a seasonal stored gas facility . Additional global LNG supply is expected from the United States and Australia in the coming years .

A tight power supply network has caused electricity prices to rise sharply . While the issue was a short-term factor , and the gains were focused on contracts for delivery close to the present , it has raised concerns for the coming winter . However , there has not been a corresponding jump in the value of gas , and contracts for both commodities beyond the coming winter have remained largely stable . <p> Going into this week , National Grid had been forecasting tight electricity supply margins , due in part to expected plant outages of over 8GW . However , the scale of the difference between supply and demand tightened further this week , with a drop in wind generation the main factor . Margins for Tuesday were only 1-2% while those for Thursday had been negative . This caused prices to rally at the start of the week before the contract for delivery on Thursday surged further to hit ten-year highs of -158/MWh . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Day-ahead contract up on concerns of what the tight margins may mean for the winter .

The gas system has been generally oversupplied , despite continued strong exports to the Continent . The use of medium-range storage and LNG has contributed to the oversupply . LNG use is being aided by a recovery in the delivery schedule , with eight cargoes already booked for September compared to five for all of August . Meanwhile , while storage is being used , medium-range stocks are still at comfortable levels going into the winter . While this might be putting downward pressure on gas prices , there remain concerns over the winter supply-demand balance . The problems at Rough long-range storage means the UK has reduced supply flexibility for the winter , which could mean it relies more on imports , which will come at a cost . 142874 @qwx342874

National Grid had secured supply from the Supplemental Balancing Reserve ( SBR ) for this winter and is expected to rely heavily on SBR for the coming winter with negative margins forecast . However , the Government has stated that the SBR and the Demand Side Balancing Reserve ( DSBR ) come at a high cost to consumers .

This is despite the SBR auctions clearing around the level that should encourage new build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism for failing to encourage sufficient investment in new build gas generation . The 800MW Carrington plant is due online in the next few months , though no additional new build gas plant were awarded contracts under the CM last year . <p> The requirement for new generation has intensified this year with the impending closure of over 7GW of coal-fired generation , as a result of five plant being set to close by summer 2016 . The scale of any new auction for delivery in 2017/18 is yet to be decided . However , it is expected to be large given the scale of capacity being lost in the medium-term . <p> The Government has already suggested that the next regular T-4 auction at the end of 2016 will be for around 3GW more than previously anticipated . This is partly as a result of plans to bring forward capacity into the T-4 auction which would have otherwise have been held back for the T-1 auction for 2020/21 delivery . <p> The T-1 auctions were originally designed to have a focus on securing capacity through Demand Side Response ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for existing generation to continue operating .

In particular , planned changes in the Transitional Arrangements ( TA ) scheme are designed to allow more options for aid for those who can cut or shift demand without any recourse to onsite generation . The Government has highlighted that DSR support auctions to date have generally been dominated by onsite generation reducing the need to use system power . This is now considered to be as competitive as regular generation , so part of the Capacity Market consultation focuses on taking generation-based DSR out of the TA .

The Capacity Market is technology-neutral but DECC expressed its hope that gas-fired power stations would be at the forefront of delivering the new capacity needed . However , the nine-month window between auction and delivery provides no time for additional new build generation .

Should the first-of-a kind project be small scale or large scale ? <p> The tidal lagoon is based on established technologies and construction methods . The review recognises that the potential for cost reductions from learning on construction techniques and technology development is limited , unlike the experience with solar and onshore wind . <p> The report describes a potential cost reduction of 8-10% , yet the strike price calculations show a 20% reduction based on learning from Swansea Tidal Lagoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little learning from doing , then the lower unit cost of a larger project may be more cost effective than a pathfinder project which , at -1.3bn , does not come cheap . <h> 3 . What is the impact of intermittency , not just on National Grid , but on other investments in generation ? <p> The report asserts that National Grid can manage the intermittency of the predictable tidal lagoon , but this will come at a cost . The value of predictability over flexibility is over-emphasised . Solar is nearly as predictable . So is wind is in the short term . The output of the tidal lagoon will be inflexible . The UK already has more inflexible nuclear , PV and wind capacity than is required on a sunny and windy day . <p> Any additional output at this time will have little value .

Who should pay , how much and what for ? <p> These questions are not answered by the report . <p> In order to decide whether to support the Swansea Tidal Lagoon , just one simple question needs to be asked : <p> With an investment pot of -1.3bn to spend , if the government was looking to support : <p> electricity generation <p> decarbonisation <p> regeneration <p> infrastructure <p> would it commit to funding Swansea Tidal Lagoon ? <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a CfD paid by electricity consumers is an appropriate way to secure financing . 
@@30195528 @3895528/ <h> Triad Challenges <p> National Grid is set to publish the three confirmed Triads for winter 2015/16 .

For those who have been seeking to reduce their exposure to transmission costs via triad response , the publication of the dates will also confirm how successful they have been . However , the task of avoidance is getting increasingly complex . <p> The Triads are the three half hours with the highest system demand between November and February each year . Crucially , though they have to be a clear 10 days apart . The scale of demand recorded during these periods is used in National Grid 's calculation of its transmission charges . For consumers , with all-inclusive contracts Triads have little impact . However , for business on energy-only contracts , the Triad dates have a direct effect on their transmission charges . <p> In an ideal situation , a business would be able to predict the Triads and cut demand accordingly . However , there are many factors which make this difficult and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards a perfect ' warning system is demand itself . <p> Trusting the forecast <p> National Grid demand forecasts have been above the actual final demand figure for most of the last winter .

The level of error is important , not just for estimating the validity of demand on the day , or on the next , but also for the coming weeks . Triads need to be at least 10 days apart , so peak demand on any day must be compared to that in the following and preceding weeks . If future demand is expected to exceed demand on the day , this reduces the likelihood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's forecasting error is the result of many uncertain factors in its forecasts , such as weather and seasonal demand changes . This has been complicated in recent years by the growth in small-scale renewable generation . These sites offset the use of electricity from the main supply system . National Grid does not have full details of their actual output , making it very difficult for the system operator to estimate the scale of demand reduction they might cause . Embedded wind is just one contributor to reducing the accuracy of system demand from National Grid . <p> Triad avoidance " a victim of its own success ? <p> Further issues surround the act of trying to avoid the Triad itself . As people become more aware of the Triad , they have also taken more steps to deal with it .

During the 2014/15 winter , the level of response struggled to reach 1.5GW . <p> Such a swing in demand would easily lower peak demand to a point at which it would no longer be deemed a Triad . In such a situation , businesses would have reacted , cut demand , potentially incurring a cost for doing so , but with no benefit from avoiding a Triad . <p> Duos and Tuos " an unhappy overlap <p> Businesses may be making it harder to predict Triads by seeking to cut their distribution charges .

In the last winter , the mild weather conditions for much of the season enhanced this effect , keeping demand both subdued and virtually flat from day to day . <p> For identifying potential Triads , this provides a significant challenge .

Both the falling demand and its flatness are also a reaction to businesses using energy more effectively .

Lower power demand should also cut the use of fossil fuels , which have already been mitigated by the mild weather conditions and strong wind generation . 142874 @qwx342874

LNG sendout remains steady , helped by a third cargo being booked for April delivery in the last week . <p> The losses in the gas market had been helped by the continued weakness in crude oil .

@@30195574 @3895574/ <h> DECC outline further plans to curb rising energy subsidy costs <p> The Department of Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) has announced a series of significant changes to renewable energy subsidies . This is in order to limit the rising costs of the schemes which are borne by consumers . <h> Levy Control Framework <p> The total amount of non-tax based subsidies available for renewable development is capped via a mechanism called the Levy Control Framework ( LCF ) . However , recent projections have shown the UK 's renewable subsidy costs under the LCF will exceed -9 billion in 2020-21 " an over-spend of more than -1.5 billion on the original budget set out in 2011 . <p> The Government has also pledged to publish an LCF budget beyond 2020 , to provide a clearer picture for long-term electricity investment .

The CFD scheme is designed to fully replace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 April 2017 , under plans outlined within the Electricity Market Reform ( EMR ) . <h> RO support for Solar PV <p> DECC has announced a consultation on proposals to close the RO scheme to new Solar PV projects of 5MW and below , from 1 April 2016 . The RO scheme had already been closed to large-scale solar projects ( above 5MW ) in April this year . This had triggered a dash for solar , as developments rushed to connect in time to receive the subsidy payments . In June this year , it was also announced the RO would close to onshore wind projects from April 2016 , reflecting a pre-election pledge to curb development of the technology . <p> Estimates indicate around 250 solar projects of the relevant size are awaiting construction or planning permission . However , the plans propose grace periods for developers who have made sufficient planning or financial investments , with projects allowed to enter the RO scheme up to 31 March 2017 . <p> DECC are also consulting on plans to remove grandfathering of RO rates for small scale solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RO support for the lifetime of the project , designed to boost investor confidence in the renewable sector . However , DECC has raised concerns of the potential for overcompensation as a result of the process . <p> The consultation is due to close on 1 September 2015 . The early closure of RO to small scale solar farms would be applicable across the UK , although proposals regarding grandfathering would only apply to England and Wales . <h> Biomass <p> In response to an earlier consultation from December 2014 , DECC has confirmed plans to remove grandfathering for biomass conversions and co-firing projects . It 's hoped this will remove the potential for increased allocations under the LCF , estimated to cost around -500 per year by 2020/21 . <p> These changes have been backdated to take effect from 12 December 2014 . Though any station that is currently subject to a contract awarded via the Final Investment Decision Enabling for Renewables ( FIDeR ) process and is awaiting State Aid clearance will be exempt from the changes . <h> Feed-in-Tariff accreditation <p> DECC are also to undertake a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to enact further future savings . It has launched a consultation " running until 19 August " on plans to remove pre-accreditation and pre-registration from the FiT scheme . Pre-accreditation provides generators with a guaranteed tariff level in advance of installation , provided the project is commissioned within a specific timeframe . By removing this element , installations will only receive the tariff rate as set on the date of application for full accreditation . As a result , developers will not be aware of the level of support available to them before applying for accreditation when the installation is complete . This will also stop sites locking in to high support rates but coming online when cheaper rates are in operation . <p> Taken as a whole , all these changes may help control the costs of the LCF by slowing the pace of the increasing costs to consumers . Still , with most of the LCF budget based on already contracted generation , the scale of costs to consumers will remain significant .

The first compensation payments to cover electricity costs are expected to be issued from April 2016 . <p> Interested businesses need to apply before the end of March 2016 in order to get this first payment , but can apply after this period for subsequent aid later this year . The support follows State Aid clearance for the moves being granted by the European Commission at the end of 2015 , a little earlier than expected . This is a result of the Government reducing the scope of its application of the scheme . <p> The UK still intends to apply all the proposals promised last year for EII support , but further State Aid notices are required and new legislation will have to be passed .

French nuclear availability has now returned to levels from 2015 , reducing system tightness on the Continent and freeing up supply for imports to the UK . However , supply to Britain is currently limited by a 50% capacity reduction on the IFA interconnector after cables linking the regions were severed . Maintenance work is to continue until the end of February 2017 . <p> A lingering cold snap pushed peak demand to record highs for the winter on Monday at over 51GW . However , demand has since fallen 10% on the back of mild weather conditions and strong wind generation . Wind supply briefly hit record highs at 10GW on Wednesday and output is expected to remain above 5GW for the rest of the week . 142875 @qwx342875

Contracts rallied going into the end of the year as weather forecasts were revised to indicate a cold start to the new year .

For the UK , there are also concerns over supply flexibility .
