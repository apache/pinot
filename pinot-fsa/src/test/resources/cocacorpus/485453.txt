Click an order type to view an extended order type description and a list of supported products . From the description table , click a link to drill down to more detailed information for a specific order , including exchanges on which the order type is supported , a link to the TWS Users ' Guide , and sample order applications and examples . <p> A Discretionary order is a limit order for which you define a discretionary amount ( which is added to or subtracted from the limit price ) that increases the price range over which the order is eligible to execute . The original limit price is displayed to the market . <p> An LIT ( Limit-if-Touched ) is an order to buy ( or sell ) an asset below ( or above ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This order is held in the system until the trigger price is touched , and is then submitted as a limit order . <p> An LOC ( Limit-on-Close ) order that executes at the closing price if the closing price is at or better than the submitted limit price , according to the rules of the specific exchange . Otherwise the order will be cancelled . <p> An MIT ( Market-if-Touched ) is an order to buy ( or sell ) an asset below ( or above ) the market . This order is held in the system until the trigger price is touched , and is then submitted as a market order . <p> A Market-to-Limit order is sent in as a market order to execute at the current best price . If the entire order does not immediately execute at the market price , the remainder of the order is re-submitted as a limit order with the limit price set to the price at which the original order executed . <p> A Market-with-Protection order is a market order that is cancelled and resubmitted as a limit order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market price . The order 's limit price is set by the exchange to be close to the current market price , slightly higher for a sell order and lower for a buy order . <p> A Relative order derives its price from a combination of the market quote and a user-defined offset amount . The order is submitted as a limit order and modified according to the pricing logic until it is executed or you cancel the order . <p> A trailing stop for a sell order sets the stop price at a fixed amount below the market price . If the market price rises , the stop loss price rises by the increased amount , but if the stock price falls , the stop loss price remains the same . The reverse is true for a buy trailing stop order . <p> A trailing stop limit for a sell order sets the stop price at a fixed amount below the market price and defines a limit price for the sell order . If the market price rises , the stop loss price rises by the increased amount , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price remains the same . When the order triggers , a limit order is submitted at the price you defined . The reverse is true for a buy trailing stop limit order . <p> A Sweep-to-Fill order identifies the best price and the exact quantity offered/available at the price , and transmits the corresponding portion of your order for immediate execution . Simultaneously it is identifying the next best price and quantity offered/available , and submits the matching quantity of your order for immediate execution . <p> The VWAP for a stock is calculated by adding the dollars traded for every transaction in that stock ( " price " x " number of shares traded " ) and dividing the total shares traded . By default , a VWAP order is computed from the open of the market to the market close , and is calculated by volume weighting all transactions during this time period .

@@27489853 @1189853/ <p> Under SEC approved Portfolio Margin rules and using our real-time margin system , Interactive Brokers customers are able in certain cases to increase their leverage beyond Reg T margin requirements . For decades margin requirements for securities ( stocks , options , and single stock futures ) accounts have been calculated under a Reg T rules-based policy . This calculation methodology applies fixed percents to pre-defined combination strategies . With Portfolio Margin , margin is based on the largest potential loss found by valuing the portfolio over a range of underlying prices , and volatilities . It is available for all US stocks , OCC stock and index options , and US single stock futures positions . At this time , it is not available for US commodities futures and futures options , US bonds , or forex positions , but US regulatory bodies may consider inclusion of these products at a future date . <p> Portfolio or risk based margin has been employed for many years in both commodities and many non-US securities markets , with great success . Depending on the composition of your trading account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T rules , which translates to greater leverage . Trading with greater leverage involves greater risk of loss . Of course for some accounts with risky positions , Portfolio Margin can require more margin than under Reg T. That 's the point of Portfolio Margin , for margin requirements to more accurately reflect the actual risk of the positions in an account . It should be noted that for customers with highly concentrated accounts , Portfolio Margin may calculate higher margin requirements under Reg T. One of the main goals of Portfolio Margin is to reflect the lower risk inherent in a balanced portfolio of hedged positions . Conversely , Portfolio Margin must assess proportionately larger margin for accounts whose positions are concentrated in a relatively small number of stocks . <p> IB Canada customers are not eligible for Portfolio Margin accounts due to IDA restrictions . In addition , all Canadian stock , stock options , index options , European stock , and Asian stock positions will be calculated under standard rules-based margin rules so Portfolio Margin will not be available for these products . <p> Portfolio Margin Mechanics <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component groups ; Class groups , which are all positions with the same underlying ; Product groups , which are closely related classes ; and Portfolio groups , which are closely related products . Examples of classes would include IBM , SPX , and OEX . A product example would be a Broad Based Index composed of SPX , OEX , etc . A portfolio could include such products as Broad Based Indices , Growth Indices , Small Cap Indices , and NASD Indices . <p> The portfolio margin calculation begins at the lowest level , the class . All positions with the same class are grouped and stressed ( underlying price and implied volatility are changed ) together with the following parameters : <p> A standardized stress of the underlying . <p> For stock , equity options , narrow based indices , and single stock futures the stress parameter is plus 15% , minus 15% as well as eight other points in-between . <p> For US market small caps and NASD market indices the stress parameter is plus 10% , minus 10% as well as eight other points in-between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress parameter is plus 6% , minus 8% as well as eight other points in-between . <p> A market-based stress of the underlying . A five standard deviation historical move is computed for each class . This five standard deviation move is based on 30 days of high , low , open , and close data from Bloomberg excluding holidays and weekends . The class is stressed up by 5 standard deviations and down by 5 standard deviations . <p> An implied volatility stress for options . Each options classs implied volatility is increased by 15% and decreased by 15% . <p> In addition to the stress parameters above the following minimums will also be applied : <p> Classes with large single concentrations will have a margin requirement of 30% applied to the concentrated position . <p> A $0.375 multiplied by the index per contract minimum is computed . <p> The same special margin requirements for OTCBB , Pink Sheet , and low cap stocks that apply under Reg T , will still apply under Portfolio Margin . <p> All of the above stresses are applied and the worst case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard correlations between classes within a product are applied as offsets . As an example , within the Broad Based Index product 90% offset is allowed between SPX and OEX . Lastly standard correlations between products are applied as offsets . An example would be a 50% offset between Broad Based Indices and Small Cap Indices . For stocks and Single Stock Futures offsets are only allowed within a class and not between products and portfolios . After all the offsets are taken into account all the worst case losses are combined and this number is the margin requirement for the account . For a complete list of products and offsets , see the Appendix-Product Groups and Stress Parameters section at the end of this document . <p> Interactive Brokers real-time margining system enables us to qualify for an exemption to the Day Trading Rules and so no Day Trading Rules will apply for Portfolio Margin accounts ( these rules will still apply for Reg T margin accounts ) . <p> Because of the complexity of Portfolio Margin calculations it would be extremely difficult to calculate margin requirements manually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TWS Portfolio Margin Demo to understand the impact of Portfolio Margin requirement under different scenarios . <p> Portfolio Margin Eligibility <p> An account must have at least USD 100,000 ( or USD equivalent ) in Net Liquidation Value to be eligible for a Portfolio Margin account . Existing customers may apply for a Portfolio Margin account through Account Management/Trading Permissions at any time and your account will be upgraded upon approval . New Interactive Brokers customers can apply for a Portfolio Margin account during the registration system process . It should be noted that if your account drops below USD 100,000 you will be restricted from doing any margin-increasing trades . Therefore if you do not intend to maintain at least USD 100,000 in your account , you should not apply for a Portfolio Margin account . <p> New IB customer accounts requesting Portfolio Margin will have Reg T rules in effect until their accounts are approved for Portfolio Margin .

@@27490056 @1190056/ <h> Understanding the Transaction Cost Analysis <p> Transaction Cost Analysis let 's you analyze the cost of the decision to trade over a specified time period with respect to various benchmarks . <p> Each executed trade in the period of the analysis is marked to a series of performance benchmarks with the results displayed in multiple interactive tables . You can drill down in a variety of categories , including trade date , order side , exchange , trade price and underlying , to see how each trade performed when compared to the benchmark . The performance of a trade is calculated by marking the trade price to each benchmark . A positive number indicates that the trade worked in your favor ; a negative number indicates that the trade did not work in your favor . <p> Marketability <p> Indicates whether an order was marketable or not . A marketable order is either a market order or is an order that is bought at a price that is greater than or equal to the prevailing ask price ( or sold at a price that is less than or equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted . <p> Transaction Cost <p> Every trade has costs associated with the transaction . There are explicit costs like commissions and exchange fees etc , and there are implicit costs that depend primarily on the characteristics of the trade relative to prevailing market conditions and trading strategy . <p> The Transaction Cost Analysis report compares trades to various industry standard benchmarks and some unique measures , allowing you to evaluate the quality of the executions . <p> Basis Points <p> Unit of measure that describes the percentage change in the value or rate of a financial instrument . One basis point = 0.01% , or 0.0001 in decimal form . Performance metrics are expressed as basis points ( bps ) of value traded . <p> Currency <p> All commissions are in your account 's base currency . When we add notional value and total premium , those will also be in account 's base currency . The trade price will stay in traded currency . <p> Methodology <p> We mark each trade to a series of benchmarks such as price improvement , arrival price and more . We aggregate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as various tables that show performance broken down by various criteria such as trade date , trade price , underlying , exchange and more . <p> Negative numbers are indicated by parentheses . <p> You can drill down into reports by clicking categories , essentially filtering the results as required ; the current active filters are always displayed at the top of the page and you can remove any individual filter by clicking the X icon next the filter .
