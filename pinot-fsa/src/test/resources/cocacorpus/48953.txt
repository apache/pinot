Answer : You can redeem for as many reward products as you have points . <p> Question : Can I request an alternate reward firearm model ? Answer : No . You must select from one of our standard reward products which can be found on the " Get Rewarded " page . <p> Question : What are the acceptable forms for Proof of Sale ? Answer : Proof of sale is required for each firearm sold in one of the three acceptable forms . Completed copies of pages 2 and 3 of the Firearms Transaction Record ( Form 4473 ) OR a copy of the cash register receipt showing serial number , date sold and approval number ( NICS or State/Local Approval ) OR a copy of your electronic ATF disposition record showing serial number , date sold and approval number ( NICS or State/Local Approval ) . Note : If your cash register receipt or electronic ATF disposition record does not contain ALL requirements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 4473 . Proof of sale that is not complete or missing the specified information will be rejected . <p> Question : Can I submit hand-written receipts as Proof of Sale ? Answer : No , they will not be accepted . Proof of sale will only be accepted in one of the three forms as listed above and in the Program Rules . <p> Question : My state / locale does not require a NICS background check . What form for Proof of Sale can I use ? Answer : An approval number is a required element of a proof of sale document . If your state does not require a NICS background check , the state / locale approval number is allowed . This number is a required element for all of the defined proof of sales . If the cash register receipt and eATF record proof of sale does not contain the NICS or state / locals approval number , then completed copies of pages 2 and 3 of the Firearms Transaction Record ( Form 4473 ) will need to be submitted . <p> Question : When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does PENDING mean ? Answer : As your redemption moves through our verification process , your status will change after each step . " Received " means we have received your proof of sales and we are starting to verify your sales . We are also making sure your FFL is up to date and that you have enough points for the reward you have chosen . " Pending " means there is an issue with your redemption that needs to be addressed by you . You should receive an email detailing what is missing or incorrect on your redemption . Often times it is an expired FFL copy or the proof of sale you submitted was incomplete or not valid . " Processing " means everything is correct with your redemption and there is nothing more you need to do . " Approved " means we have made the request to our shipping group to ship out your reward(s) . You should receive an email once your reward firearm has shipped . <p> Question : Will all of my reward items ship at the same time ? Answer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Question : How do I submit a redemption for reward items ? Answer : All redemptions MUST be generated online . However , final submissions of your redemption can be either online or you can mail it in . If you are submitting your redemption online , you will need to select tracked sales that are marked with the " Digital Ready " icon . Redemptions that use tracked sales labeled " Paperwork Required " will require you to mail in the Redemption Form and all tracked sales marked " Paperwork Required " per the instructions on the generated Redemption Form . <p> Question : Is the date range for eligible purchases defined as the SOLD or RELEASED dates . If in fact it is the sold date , page 3 of the 4473 will not be signed or dated ? Answer : For your sale to be counted in this promotion , the SALE DATE needs to be by August 31 , 2017 and all redemption requests must be completed and received by September 30 , 2017 - therefore your firearm would need to be RELEASED in a time-frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 30 , 2017 . <p> Question : I work at a major outdoors retailer , am I allowed participating in this program ? Answer : Any legally employed salesperson of FEDERALLY LICENSED RETAIL FIREARMS DEALER HAVING A REGULAR PLACE OF BUSINESS with scheduled business hours on premises where such business use is permitted by law , and where products are displayed to the shooting public , and who have a state resale tax number ( where applicable ) may participate PROVIDING THEIR MANAGEMENT ALLOWS FOR PARTICIPATION . <p> Question : Sometimes a sale is " pending " and the salesperson who sold the gun could n't finish the 4473 and another person signs the form , who gets the credit ? I think it should be the person who sold the gun but his name will not be on the 4473 . Answer : To get credit for the sale , have your store manager sign and date the COPY of the Proof of Sale stating who is approved to get the credit for the sale . They should write the SELLERS name in the footer of the copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print and date . <p> Question : Can I combine my store points across sales reps or across multiple retail locations ? Answer : No , this program is intended to support retailer sales people as individuals and the Points are awarded to individuals , at one retail location . THE PROGRAM IS NOT INTENDED FOR RETAILER LOCATIONS AS A COMBINED SALES ENTITY . That is neither an objective of the program or within the program rules and regulations . <p> Question : I often sell firearms over the Internet / indirect to consumers ( either through transfers or outside our local area ) . Because of this , our business does not record the 4473 or get an approval number and we are unable to provide a copy of the document for you . Can we utilize another form of verification to receive the Points for this program ? Answer : No , our goal for this program is to reward storefront retailer sales reps and have set our rules and regulations accordingly - both in how points are rewarded and the regulations on who can participate . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4473 ( pages 2 and 3 ) , a print out of your electronic ATF disposition record showing model , serial number , date sold , approval number , and salesperson as the verification of sale or a photocopy of cash register receipt showing model , serial number , date sold and approval number , and we need to have a copy of that document for all Points submitted . Without that documentation , we are unable to process those Points and reward any firearms . Further , because of the way this program is structured , everyone benefits from the increased Ruger pull-through . Even if this specific promotion is not directly beneficial to a mid-rep , an internet seller or a broker of a sale , the increased activity of this program will increase sales and help your business . <p> Question : I use the e-4473 offered by the BATF . Am I able to still participate in this program ? Answer : Yes , you will just need to send a copy of your printed version of the form . There is no difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pre-printed version . The output for both is a document that can be copied and submitted for this program . <p> Question : Why is there a New York address on my 4R materials ?

If you can not find the answer to your question below , please click here for contact information . <p> Why are Ruger pistols that used to be available in California no longer on the Roster ? Pistols that appeared on the California Roster of Handguns Certified for Sale ( " Roster " ) were tested and approved pursuant to the regulations in effect at that time . However , the California Department of Justice ( CADOJ ) requires us to submit firearms for re-testing if we make any change to the design , however small . If we change the weight , dimensions , or materials of a part , then that is a change that CADOJ says requires re-testing . As part of Ruger 's program of continuous improvement , we routinely make changes and enhancements to our products . Any firearm that is re-tested must now incorporate microstamping technology ( described in another FAQ ) . As this is not feasible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a change , and the pistol is dropped from the Roster by operation of law . <p> Why are there so few Ruger pistols offered on the roster in California ? We at Ruger are committed to our customers in California . The problem is the microstamping requirement ( described in another FAQ ) in California . Because the California microstamping law is impossible to comply with , no new Ruger pistols ( or any other manufacturer 's , for that matter ) have been added to the California Roster of Handguns Certified for Sale since the law became effective in 2013 . <p> What is microstamping ? Microstamping is a patented process that micro-laser engraves the firearm 's make , model and serial number on the tip of the gun 's firing pin so that , in theory , it imprints the information on discharged cartridge cases . California 's law requires that any pistol added to the roster includes microstamping technology that imprints this information in two locations on discharged cartridge cases . The technology does not work . An independent , peer-reviewed study published in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of microstamping is unreliable and does not function as the patent holder claims . It can be easily defeated in mere seconds using common household tools . Criminals could also simply switch the engraved firing pin to a readily available unmarked spare part , thereby circumventing the process . To date , no firearms have been made by any manufacturer that utilizes this unproven technology . Please note that we continue to work with the National Shooting Sports Foundation ( NSSF ) to support their efforts to overturn the California microstamping law . <p> May I send in a handgun for repair that is not on the California Roster of Handguns Certified for Sale ? Yes - Ruger can and will continue to repair and return any handgun which is legal to possess in California ( i.e. , not an " assault weapon " ) .

Therefore , replacement handguns must be presently listed on the Roster . <p> Can I buy parts from Ruger for my handgun , whether or not my handgun appears on the California Roster of Handguns Certified for Sale ? Yes , provided you are not looking to purchase a magazine with a capacity in excess of 10 rounds or parts which must be factory fitted . We can not ship so-called " high-capacity " magazines to California . Parts which require factory fitting must be installed at the factory , which would require that you contact our Customer Service department at 336-949-5200 for a RMA . <p> Are Ruger revolvers available in California ? Yes - California law generally exempts single-action revolvers from the California Roster of Handguns Certified for Sale ( " Roster " ) . As such , although Ruger single-action revolvers do not appear on the Roster , they are indeed available for purchase in California . <p> Double-action revolvers also are available in California and we regularly submit our double-action revolvers for testing and inclusion on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sale in California can be found on our here . Over three dozen of our double-action revolvers are available in California . <p> Are Ruger rifles available in California ? Ruger bolt-action and rimfire rifles are generally available in California , unless the rifle has a magazine capacity greater than 10 rounds . California law prohibits all ammunition magazines with a capacity greater than 10 rounds . <p> Auto-loading centerfire rifles are restricted due to California 's feature-based , so-called " Assault Weapon " ban . Ruger makes all of its centerfire rifles that are not prohibited by California 's " Assault Weapon " ban available for sale in California . Primarily , the California ban prohibits modern sporting rifles , such as the AR-556 , SR-556 , and SR-762 . However , variations of many Ruger rifles that include features such as a threaded barrel or flash suppressor are also prohibited by California law . <p> How can I get an instruction manual for my gun ?
