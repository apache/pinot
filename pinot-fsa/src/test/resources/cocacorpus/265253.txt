@@4404422 <h> Featured Article : Looking for a quick way to test parasitic draw ? <p> by Ed Picard Nov 15 , 2016 <p> Looking for a quick way to test parasitic draw ? <p> With todays vehicles having electronic modules that stay awake for extended periods of time , it can be time consuming waiting for them to go back to sleep after connecting an ammeter when you measure the parasitic draw . Here is a very different way of testing for excessive draw that does n't  require you to disconnect one of the battery terminals , or measure the mV drop across multitudes of fuses . It is very quick to do , and will allow you to immediately determine if an excessive draw is present . It is a bit controversial , but I think you will find it can save a lot of time and requires no special tools other than a DVOM . <p> It is named the Chesney parasitic draw test after its creator , Sean Chesney . Instead of using an ammeter to measure the draw , an ohmmeter is used . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( resistance above zero ) . Set the ohmmeter to ohms ( the lowest scale ) , touch the meter leads together , and read the screen . The reading is the resistance of the meter leads and is the meters true zero when used with those leads . Typically an ohmmeter will read about 0.1 ohms when the leads are touched together . Some meters have a delta feature that recalibrates the ohmmeter to zero when the leads are placed together and the delta button is pushed . If your meter has this delta feature , you can use it so that you will not have to remember the delta reading . But for now , let 's say your meter reads 0.2 ohms delta . <p> Next , with the battery terminals still connected to the battery , place the DVOMs black lead on the negative post of the battery and the red lead on an unpainted surface of the alternator housing . Read the ohmmeter and subtract the delta value from the reading . This reading corresponds to the relative parasitic draw on the system . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtract the original 0.2 ohms reading of the leads . This leaves a reading of 0.7 ohms delta . <p> Through testing , Chesney found that a draw of about 35 milliamps equaled an ohm reading of about 0.3 ohms delta ( above the delta value ) on a DVOM with 10 megohms of impedance , and about 0.6 ohms delta on a DVOM with 20 megohms of impedance . Anything above those readings indicates an excessive parasitic draw . So in our example of 0.7 ohms delta , and a 10 megohm meter , the parasitic load is approximately 90 milliamps , which is well above the standard 35 milliamp limit , indicating an excessive parasitic draw . <p> If you are skeptical of this method like I was , go out and try it on several vehicles . Simulate a parasitic draw by opening the drivers door ( make sure the dome light illuminates ) , and watch the ohmmeter reading . It went up substantially , right ? Next , close the door . As soon as the light goes off , the ohmmeter reading goes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find an excessive draw , pull fuses one at a time , watching for the ohmmeter reading to decrease . If it does not decrease after removing all of the fuses , suspect an unfused circuit such as the alternator diodes or the ignition circuit on some vehicles . <p> Now you have a quick , handy test for identifying excessive parasitic draws that require no wasted time waiting for modules to time out !

@@4404453 <h> CDX News Featured Article : Time for an Engine Oil Perception Change <p> by Ed Picard Nov 15 , 2016 <p> Many technicians do n't  think much about engine oil , except that it needs to be changed regularly . Much like engine oil itself , however , the lack of attention given to oil and new lubrication standards also needs to be changed . Technology has affected the realm of engine oil just as much as it has virtually all other aspects of a vehicle . Engine oil is now engineered to meet specific manufacturer requirements , or even individual engine requirements within a particular manufacturers lineup . Long gone are the days when we can use generic 10W-30 engine oil out of a drum for every vehicle that rolls through the shop . Let 's look at just two of the less familiar standards . <p> ACEA Standard The ACEA classifications formulated for engine oils used in European vehicles are much more stringent than the API and ILSAC standards . Some of the characteristics the ACEA-rated oil must score high on are soot thickening , water , sludge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after-treatment compatibility . While some of these may be tested by the API and ILSAC , the standards are set high to achieve ACEA certification ratings . If you are servicing a European vehicle , it is advised that you make sure the oil meets the recommended ACEA rating specified by the manufacturer , or the manufacturers own specification rating . <p> OEM-Specific Standards - Many vehicle manufacturers have developed their own oil rating standards . These standards may even be specific to individual engines within a manufacturers line-up . Here are a couple of examples : Oils meeting Volkswagens VW 506.00 standard are suitable for use on diesel engines ( not with single injector pump ) with an extended service interval of up to 31,000 miles or 2 years . Oil meeting General Motors dexos1 is specified for use in all GM vehicles except those equipped with Duramax diesel engines and is backward compatible in all older GM vehicles . It has a service interval of up to 18,600 miles . <p> While we have only scratched the surface , you can see it is important to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and only use the specified oil . Also , remember that you need to take into account whether the vehicle is operating in normal vs severe conditions when recommending an oil change interval .
