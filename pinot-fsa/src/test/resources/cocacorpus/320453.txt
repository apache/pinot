@@25138810 @5138810/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> Riffling hitch , a silly question <p> Hi folks , I assume when fishing riffling hitch in fast flowing water , the hole is placed towards the front of the tube , and when fishing slower flows the hole should be positioned towards the middle of the tube . It seems a silly question , but what would be the correct hole side on tube when the river left ? and when the river right ? <p> The hole is placed in the throat of a plastic tube as near the front as possible whether the current is fast or slow . When it 's in the throat it does n't matter which side of the river you are fishing . Put a flying C wire down the tube centre and burn the hole through at an angle of about 45 degrees with a dubbing needle . If you tie a rifling hitch use the one described in the book tying and fishing the hitch by Art Lee . An interesting book . <p> Last edited by minitube ; 12-05-2009 at 05:43 PM . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of this world , where each person is clinging to his piece of debris ?

I think some assimetryc riffling tube flies which have an upper wing and a little throat , need a hole in each side .

Could you explain a little more ? Thank you for the Art Lee book reference , and sorry for my english . <p> Flying C wire is the wire used to make flying C spinners , the wire fits inside most plastic tubes - any fine diameter wire will do , this is to prevent the hot needle going out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire after making a hole in one side only . <p> Though you are talking of looking at the head of the fly you did not say if the end of it was towards you or away from you - or up or down so it is impossible to answer . <p> The hole should be on the side of the fly that you are on , towards your own bank . River flowing left to right as you said , you are on the right bank then , with the fly pointing upstream the hole should be on your side of the tube - or underneath in the throat . If a riffling hitch knot is used then it also should be tied on your side or underneath . I use this method for grilse at times with both mini tubes / small plastic tubes and single hook flies , but also mostly riffle mini tubes without using the hitch knot or the hole in the side . Two small plastic tubes will riffle well without the hitch or side / throat hole . When the hitch knot or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is out of the water , when it is not used the tube is sub surface with the water humping over it . <p> Last edited by minitube ; 12-05-2009 at 09:41 PM . <p> What is the appropriate behavior for a man or a woman in the midst of this world , where each person is clinging to his piece of debris ?

@@25138812 @5138812/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> Attaching loops to poly leaders <p> Its been a while since I posted anything useful , so thought I would do a wee step by step of how I attach loops ( and make them ) for extending the useful life of poly leaders . From the off I 'll say that they should be viewed as items which do degrade over time , and at the 1st sign of wear should be pointed towards the bin ! There are many ways of doing this , but as I had a few to do ..... Here 's a step by step of the method I use , and find to be completely bomb proof . <p> Here 's the manky end of the poly leader which needs to be cut at an angle to form a point . <p> Point cut . Put this to one side . <p> Take the 25lb braid and cut a nice fray-free end with the scissors . <p> 3 to 4 " from the end of the braid , feed in the bobbin threader and push it up the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point , push the end of the threader through the wall and out of the braid . Feed the cut end into the eye of the threader , <p> Carefully pull the threader back through the braid . When the loop reaches the desired size , nip it tightly between your fingers and pull the threader completely out . <p> Loop formed <p> Cut it to the desired length . About 3 " here <p> Take the pointed end of the poly leader and feed it into the rear of the braided loop . " Inch-worm " it forward . <p> Keep pulsing and feeling it forward . Its fiddly at first but feed the tip of the poly centrally inside the core of the doubled over loop , and right to the end of the loop ( this is where the grip is and unobtainable with bought loops ) <p> Take the Kevlar and bobbin holder and create a 10 - 15 turn tight whip towards the rear of the braid . Carefully trim the loose ends with the scalpel . <p> I make a further whip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over section at the tip . Overkill perhaps but these will not slip or wear . At this point you can add a drop or two of superglue to the braided section , but keep it away from either end as it will cause cracking at these point in time . <p> Here 's a pic of the finished loop after aquasure has been applied and allowed to dry .... Ready to fish ! Its worth mentioning that when applying aquasure or any PU resin , I use a cocktail stick to really push it and work it into the fibers . This " wets " the whole assembly and greatly increases strength . Simply coating with the resin is not enough . If you want to thin the viscosity of it for better penetration and wetting , mix it with 50% toluene and it 'll dry in a few hours rather than overnight . <p> Perfection loop or figure of eight ( depending on the diameter ) is secure enough I think ! , but thanks for taking the time sure a few will use this method as everyones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " tippet " direct to the exposed core of the poly with a 3-turn water knot . You lose very little core when you have to replace the tippet . When you run out of the exposed core you can also attach direct to the outer coating of the poly in the same way - the fluorocarbon bites through nicely and beds down . <p> Cheers guys . You can do this with and shop bought loops but being pre-glued , they are n't just as tight and up to the tip of the poly as I 'd like . Absolutely nothing wrong with the other methods of attaching tippet . I suppose my only reason for doing it is confidence in not having to check or guess at the integrity of a mono knot or loop after several outings . Having said that , I use the tippet rings for trout and think I 've had one on for months without issue .

My thoughts on this are still undecided as I do not see springers being caught in any decent numbers yet to convince me of a big shift .. Is this shift actually happening ? I fish the Teith and my close friends fish the Forth and without charts or graphs being posted I feel the back end runs have fell off a cliff since 2010 however I do not see the big numbers of returning springers to make up for this supposed reversal .. Surely if the fish start returning more as springers over a 5 year period from say starting 2010 then spring numbers should start to show big improvements .. I know it is still well too early to start judging a rivers spring catches but looking at the Teith and Tay threads and not too many being caught at present .. <p> If the Rivers have an average spring and another poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year then what will the predictions from the graph and chart men be ? I enjoy reading all the theries and predictions but I am more into judging the amount of fish in a river by what I catch and what I see when I am fishing .. for me the last few back ends have been a disaster and ended up with me packing in early due to hardly seeing fish .. <p> I will be fishing the Teith and Tay for 10-12 days in March and hopefully connect with a few but for me I am still unsure if this shift is taking place . <p> It 's all speculation . My belief is that IF there is a change it will be preceded by a period of flux for a few years . On the Tweed the Autumn run basically fell off a cliff from 2014 . I would not expect it to be any different this year , but it could come back very strongly . The spring run will never have the numbers of fish you see in a grilse cycle , but so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid February ! Also there are good years and bad whatever cycle we are in and rivers vary tremendously due to local impacts . It will take about 10 years to settle down , if there is any change , so I would n't get too carried away yet . My own gut feeling is that rivers with much less anthropogenic interference , North Coast rivers , North Esk etc will continue to improve each year , over a long term average , with huge weather related fluctuations and a gradual shift to earlier runs . Rivers that are fecked will continue to be fecked . My advice is book May to August on the good rivers and you 'll be fine . <p> unless the norwegian sea feeding has improved I do n't see the backend runs returning anytime soon . Last couple of seasons on the Tyne its been fair to good early season but the backend has been " kipper city " -old river fish being recycled . <p> i 'm not sure about the shift being this early , but there 's no doubt that across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , as was some English rivers such as the Avon and Test . <p> Also , there was no doubt that despite plenty of water , the september run just did n't happen . maybe they ran in October or November , who knows ? <h> Spring run <p> As said , 5 or 10 yr average is only way to know .

If I was trout or grayling fishing I would know for each month of the season but the whole salmon game is still all new and fresh to me , cheers Paul <p> I would concur with that . The best time of the day is when there are ' active ' salmon in the pool in front of you . On hard fished , the fish will be less disturbed first thing in the morning and there may be a few fresh ones that have slipped in at last light . However , if there are fish running off the tides and the tide is later in the day then either side of the tide may be the best time for that particular day . If I am covering resident fish from summer onwards , just as the light starts to fade into night time is often the most productive . For some reason , even in low water , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held lies for short periods . This activity and jostling around the pool can often bring them on the take after they have been sulking all day . <p> Not being flippant but as has been said above , this can be any time of day ( or night ) dependent on season , water height , stocks , etc . <p> If you had to choose a single time , either last light or midday would be my choice . Last light for the reasons given above and midday because it 's the warmest and animals are often most active at this time . ( granted in mid summer this may not apply ! ) <p> Whatever you take to the bank with you , one thing you can be sure of is the fish will not agree and the take will come as a surprise ! <h> Thanks <p> Thanks for the replies .

They all play their part , and even when you think you have the ideal combination , then there , s the small matter of lure size &amp; type , colour etc .

If the ghillie has worked his socks off to get you a fish or two you might feel compelled to dig deep , but you should never feel that you need to tip more than you can afford as it will put you off booking decent fishing . <p> It also depends on the ratio of gillies to rods , if its one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in with those who need it &amp; the updated advice given to those more familiar with the beat &amp; physically able , a tenner day per rod is pretty good going .

Any tips or advice would be very welcome . <p> Tight Lines Steve <p> Steve , I last fished there back in the 90 's so it 's been a while Fished the Rising Sun water about four or five times and got lucky twice : Once in mid August with the river running at a trickle . I 'd taken a spey casting lesson with Simon Gawesworth the previous day and just wanted to wet a line . I fished bears pit pool and conjured up a 6 pounder . Next time was around June time when the river was in perfect shape and fished a couple of days . I was lucky enough to draw the Crocker 's beat when the Sun still owned it and came up with a fresh run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heavy rain and came up empty but the landlord back then , Peter Huntingdon got a really nice fish of about 15 pounds at the Railroad bridge .

@@25138824 @5138824/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> How to Fish a Sunray Shadow <p> Right folk 's , I 'm looking for some info on how to fish a sunray shadow or collie dog pattern ! I 've never fish this method before and have a pool in mind to try it on on my local river ! First off is it a straight floating line i use ? or would i fish it sub surface on a poly leader ? Also looking for some patterns to use for this method as-well . Regards Robert <p> Although not a maestro by any means , I caught 3 ( and lost 1 ) on a SS on my last day last year . <p> I fished it about 3-4 inches sub surface , on a sink-tip . <p> Basically I was told to cast square , move the rod fairly quickly across and downstream , not retrieving , then whilst rod stationary at the end of your sweep , retrieve one long pull , then stop retrieving and move rod again . <p> The idea being that the fly never stops and has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe but I hope you get the gist . <p> As an aside , one of the fish I got was when reeling in , so a perfectly smooth , and quite quick , retrieve , which I tried to replicate at all other times . <p> It is a very versatile fly so I guess there is no real wrong way to fish it but I think fished just under or even on the surface and quickly is best . <p> Agreed . In cold water it can fish well on a sinker without a retrieve . In faster water , I use less of a retrieve than I do in slow currents . I donlt fish it often but I know a man who does . There is definitely no right or wrong way . <p> I once fished through a pool on the Tay , stripping the Collie all the way through until my phone started ringing . I cast the line out and answered the phone while the fly swung without a retrieve and ' bang - fish on ' . It never stayed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While I 'm sure a **26;0;TOOLONG long winged fly will catch fish without a retrieve , I think that rather misses the point of them . Where they really score , IMO , is in offering a change of presentation style to the norm . <p> As a general rule , one thing we should always bear in mind when fishing is keeping the speed of the fly in proportion to its size . If we believe that a salmon takes a fly out of a residual feeding instinct , it 's probably a good idea to make our fly behave more or less like a natural creature . In general terms , small fish or invertebrates tend to be less powerful and swim less fast than larger ones . Therefore a small fly fished fast is likely to look unnatural to a salmon , whereas a big fly fished at the same speed will not . So I see long winged flies as providing an opportunity to present a fly to a fish at a faster pace than one would usually fish a conventional fly , without it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you strip the fly is to some extent dependent on the speed on the current . If you want your fly to appear to be swimming at a natural speed , the rate of retrieve in water flowing at 4mph needs to be less than in water flowing at 2mph . It is also dependent on water temperature . It 's not only salmon that are less active in cold water ; their prey items are too . So if the water is at 40 degrees F , you probably want to fish the fly slower than you would with the water at 60 degrees . <p> Although I know others fish them on full floating lines ( and sometimes even skate them on the surface ) , I generally aim to fish them a bit deeper . I 've been told that , although a fly fished on or just under the surface can generate a lot of reaction from fish , you tend to get more solid takes from one fished a bit deeper . I typically use some sort of sinking shooting head , probably something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmer conditions . I also reckon there is less chance of the line causing a wake on the surface when fishing flat water with this setup , although I know other people who use a floating head with a short section of T14 or some other fast sinking tip , which probably achieves a similar depth . <p> Having said all that , there 's no great subtlety to the way I fish them . Basically just wang it out square and haul it back . If a fish takes , resist the urge to strike if you can . <p> As to flies , as I said at the beginning I reckon it 's all about the presentation rather than the specific pattern . But one fly that I use a lot with this method , ( because I have confidence in it , not because I can honestly say it 's better than any other ) , is a sort of monkeyish thing with an orange hackle , yellow underwing and black overwing . <p> Can you clarify why the tube has to be quite long rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would increase the probability of the dreaded tail wrap , or is it more a question of getting the hook further down the body length to improve the chances of a hook up . <p> I think tube length is a matter of personal preference . My one pictured is probably on a 1 1/4 " Slipstream , so not all that big in fact . On the whole I tend to go for a tube that is about 1/3 to 1/4 the length of the overall dressing . On the other hand , I got a Collie Dog in a fly swap a couple of years ago tied by a well known ghillie on , I think , a 2 " tube with an overall length of about 4 - 4 1/2 " . I probably would n't use those proportions , but if it works for a professional who am I to say it 's wrong ? <p> To reduce tail wrap I use a double hook and set it upside down , with the points upwards and the wing lying between the two legs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way too . This does seem to help reduce the problem a bit and you often to get a good solid hookhold in the top jaw , too . <p> In fact , it 's just occurred to me that mounting the hook upside-down might possibly help to reduce the likelihood of getting a fish in the gill rakers - particularly with long-winged flies which they often seem to hit quite hard . Anyone have any thoughts on this ? <p> Hi Charlie - thanks for that . I think you might have a point with the upside down gill rakers issue . That aside , not being an SS ' user ' to date ( although I have for many years stripped / skated flies for sea trout ) can I ask if the flies you are using are , regardless of length , generaly light in weight or can / should the weight of fly vary with the conditions ie. speed of current ? <p> Hi Charlie - thanks for that . I think you might have a point with the upside down gill rakers issue . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date ( although I have for many years stripped / skated flies for sea trout ) can I ask if the flies you are using are , regardless of length , generaly light in weight or can / should the weight of fly vary with the conditions ie. speed of current ? <p> I use fairly light tubes . Generally slipstream type aluminium , but I have some on plastic tubes too . I have tied some with coneheads , but have n't so far felt very inclined to use them . However , I mainly fish them on rivers like the Spey which is fairly shallow and where dredging the bottom is n't generally thought necessary . <p> I do n't know whether stripping a fly works particularly well when the water is very cold . I have n't tried it when the water temp . has been much below 40 degrees , but that 's because I have n't fished very early or late in the season for some time ( i.e. since I 've been using these flies ) . Because you 're fishing the fly quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move a bit , so if they 're glued to the bottom and very torpid it probably wo n't be all that effective . On the whole i would reckon that if the fish are at all willing to come to a fly fished fast , they will probably come up to one fished a bit above them . <p> Also , I 'm someone who usually likes to get depth with the line , rather than the fly . I do sometimes use brass tubes in high water , but generally take to the view that a light fly on a sunk line moves more attractively in the water than a heavy one on a lighter line . And particularly since this technique more or less requires you to use a shooting head , there should be no problem about using a fairly fast sinking line . I think I may have had a fish on an S2/3 head a couple of years ago on the Spey when the water was quite high and around 40F , but as I have said , even in these conditions the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish to eyeball the fly , and I think an S1/2 , perhaps with a brown poly , is probably enough . <p> I would n't claim to be an expert in this technique , and there may be others who do it differently . But I do n't recall ever seeing a sunray or collie on a brass tube . <p> Generally the aim is to fish the fly in or just below the surface , but it does work deeper as well , especially when the water is cold . A brass or tungsten fly tied in this style , or a lighter one presented on a fast sinking line adds to the catch records each season . I do n't have much personal experiences with this but have hooked fish in early spring with long winged flies in this style and I know others who fair well with them fished deep and slow . Sometimes it is not just the material of the tube , but the style that gets it down a bit . As an example , I sometimes find that a dense plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skating on the surface than a light metal tube with a small diameter hole . I can only imagine that this is due to some air being held in the metal tube and that the flow of water only passes aroung the outside creating more lift . The plastic tubes with the larger diameter hole must allow some water to pass through the inside of the tube allowing the fly to sink more readily . Anyway , that is a side note , but one worth bearing in mind when you are trying to get a large fly to swim just under the surface . 
@@25138825 @5138825/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> Mounting and Fishing Shrimps <p> Thought I might share with you all my way of mounting and fishing shrimps . Nothing totally new here , just a few changes which may make a difference . Now I realise its a bit early in the season and that shrimps are not everyones preferred method . However , they can sometimes save the day if a beat does n't offer many opportunities for the fly . <p> First the accessories : I 'm not a big fan of commercial shrimp pins and prefer to make my own from , you 've guessed ithairpins . They are generally thicker , you can cut them to different lengths and are a little more weighty for getting the shrimp down if you 're not using a weight . You can get them in black or brown and twist a narrow eye onto them . Cheap to buy but if you ca n't find any then I 'm sure the mother-in-law will oblige ! <p> Next the way of securing the shrimp to the hook and line . Well shrimps are pretty expensive now so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . I fish a shrimp sink and draw with a weight above the swivel . I like to get it well down before my first lift and it can be difficult judging the correct depth . Get a shrimp stuck on the bottom , even for a few seconds and it comes back in a right mess . They can also sometimes take a bit of a battering by repeated casting with bits falling off , which is why the favoured method of securing them is red elasticated cotton . <p> Now I 've seen a few monstrosities in my time , you need enough elastic to make it stay on , but not so much as to make it look like the bad guy tied up in a cowboy film . They can suddenly start to look very unnatural if you 're not careful and you frequently end up binding the legs flat against the underbody . It could be argued , that this takes away the shrimps most natural and attractive feature ( to the salmon that is ) its dangly legs . Not forgetting the egg clusters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare , you might try threading the cotton between the legs ... no thanks . <p> My prefered method is using bait bands as used in coarse fishing . These little things are nearly invisible , cheap to buy and only about 8-10mm across . Most importantly , they fit neatly around the shell-head of the shrimp and hold the head of the treble tightly underneath the body . The bands are very elastic to allow easy passage over the legs and whiskers and easily shrink back to the original size which is just tight enough on the shrimp without cutting into the body . Now this does n't  make the shrimp indestructible and you will still have problems if you get it stuck . However , it keeps the legs dangling free , improves the presentation and increases the life expectancy with repeated casting . If it 's a large shrimp or prawn you might use two or three bands . I 'll let you decide which gives the better presentation . <p> Everyone has their own method of fishing the shrimp and like I 've said , I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees across , let the weight take it down , flip the bale arm back as it nears the bottom and lift the rod tip slightly . That first sudden lift is what really bugs the salmon and is the best chance of a take in my opinion , almost like the induced take method when nymphing for trout . However , providing the pool is big and wide enough you can increase your chances a little . Once you start to lift the shrimp , it is on an ever upward journey due to the pull of the current and you 've possibly lost your best chance of a take . Therefore , when it swings to the 45 degree angle , flip the bale arm off again and give it as much slack as possible for about five seconds . The weight will take it down again and you get a second chance to lift and induce the take . I 've had a few takes on the second lift that I believe I would n't have had otherwise . <p> Never had a salmon on anything other than a ruby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish a shrimp with a float , if salmon will take it like a leaf in the current it would seem to blow away my theory about inducing a take . Truth is , they both work well at times and its what you feel confident with . <p> when float fishing on fast water i use a fixed float , braid line , 12ft rod , shrimp on single viking hook wrapped with clear fine bait elastic , almost invisable . cast straight out , mend line let it swing round with finger on braid , most times the take will be felt with your finger , just lift the rod when a take is detected.make sure braid is floating.shrimps are better freshly caught they are more pliable.bought ones can be crispy and come off easily , make sure they are this years stock and not sitting from 2008. purple i find the best.any fish can be easily released as they are 99% lip hooked . <h> float fished shrimp <p> when using a float the standard setup would usually be with stren line connected to a slim foat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lenght of mono about 4ft then shrimp pin/ treble or single hook . use a few spilt shot spread along the mono . A sliding knot above the float will give you the depth cast upstream and keep rod held up and in contact with float , once you know there is no snags and the float moves or dips under strike quickly , i always try to have as much of the float submerged so that just the tip is showing , this is so that the fish feels least resistence when taking the shrimp <h> Fishing the shrimp without a float <p> Has no one tried fishing the shrimp without a float ? I have done so for years with great success , although you can not relax when fishing this method and must strike if you feel any we bang at all . <p> I use a single number 2 aberdeen hook and i just thread the shrimp up through the shank of the hook . This takes a bit of practice and requires top quality shrimp ! <p> I usually cast across the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike and let the shrimp come across the current like a fly . <p> If you feel any bang at all , strike ! If you see a balliff ( depending on what river you are fishing ) stirike hard and the shrimp will come of . Then take a box of worms out of your pocket and act natural lol ! <p> The shrimp is a brillant method to use when other methods are failing , but i believe shrimp/prawn caught salmon should not be killed . 99% of the time they are hooked in the roof of the mouth or scissors , so it is a perfect method for realeasing them . <p> This method can be deadly and its a shame the prawn/shrimp has killed so many salmon over the years , fishmongers across the country have ruined it for the rest of us and tarnished such an enjoyable method of fishing . <p> float set up with sliding top stop knott to alter the depth of the shrimp , very good set up as you can fish water deeper than the length of the rod as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound onto the rod , , , a good tip when fishing this method down a run is to stop the line coming of the reel for a few seconds with your finger which causes the shrimp to lift enticingly in the water .. <h> float shrimping <p> bothy cat yes the shrimp swims down the river without any drag suspended by the float setup the size and thickness of the float and drilled bullet would be used depending on the flow of the river , the idea is to get the float to drift slow , probably slightly slower than the rivers flowing , parts of the moy are great for this method there are few snags and long slow wide canal like stretches below is a few of the floats i use and weights od <h> prawns &amp; shrimp <p> I never use shrimp pins only a single hook and only tie them on when they are softish or in very fast water .

When I was a boy shop eggs were always white and then white eggs became associated with battery hens , brown with free range . All shop eggs then became brown . The reality is that different breeds produce different coloured eggs ; shell colour is no indicator of quality . My Cornish game hens lay small white eggs , my welsumers lay a dark brown large egg . Both are delicious . The ease of peeling is to do with freshness . Fresh eggs are much harder to peel than older ones .

However the versileader only has a loop at the butt end . Can anyone suggest the best way to attach a nylon tippet. if I use a knot it means I would always be cutting part of the leader , which would work out expensive in the end . I thought of a braided loop at the end of the versileader . Do'es this make sense , or has anyone a more suitable method . Thanks in advance Jim . <p> Tie on a Roman Moser silver ring or Mustard carp ring or equivalent , use a uni knot then uni knot your tippet to the ring . This will give you 90% + knot strength as against 70% if your ' lucky with most loop knots Bimini hitch excepted . As a bonus you will not cut the leader loop with your tippet meaning the life of the poly-leader will be extended when contrasted with the looped method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What paddymc says is the easiest option but I do n't like to have the core exposed on lines or leaders . I have not used the versileaders for a while now but if I was to start using them again I would whip a loop in the end or use a braided loop as i have much more confidence in these 2 methods . I stopped using the versileaders when 3 times in 1 day my 15lb leader cut through the 24lb core when joined by a loop to loop connection . Salmon fishing is all about confidence and if you do n't  have it or have very little you might as well be sat at home . The gear does n't have to be the best / most expensive or to others liking as long as you feel that it is doing the job right and will not fail . <p> Thanks everyone for your good advice .

@@25138840 @5138840/ 48620 @qwx248620 <p> from what i 'm told by ghillies , a very popular method of fishing the Frances is to cast straight across and strip it back fast , a bit like the sunray shadow method . I think ( ? ) this is the method they use with the bigger tube-fly version - like this LONG ... I have had quite a bit of success with the Frances .. never used the tube version .. always fished mine on a floating line , conventional down &amp; across , from size 10 treble to size 6 double , depending on conditions . Have often seen the salmon rise to the fly ... <p> When I guided in Iceland ( River Hafralonsa ) , the technique we found most success on was to cast a weighted bottle tube Red Francis up stream of the fish and then let it sink as it flowed back towards you ..... but it was crucial that as the Francis passed your target fish ( the water was clear enough to watch the process ) it was facing upstream , and not in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you needed to do some clever mending to get this process right ) so in effect it was dead drifting , but with immaculate presentation .

I watched grown men cry as they watched double figure fish take the Francis and then spit it out before they had a chance to raise into a strike ! ! !

( they were , at the time working well in the much larger ' sister ' river which was river over 50 miles away ) <p> I suggested they just fish either the single red , or single black as I felt it would spook the pools but they would n't have a bar of it . <p> They then wondered why , when on the first cast into the prime pool , we all watched over 30 fish scatter in mayhem from the central lie ( and master taking position ) I told them in my pigeon French something along the lines of " I told you so ....

@@25138856 @5138856/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> Atlantic Salmon Farms Shift to Open Seas , Trying to Shake Off Lice <p> Source : Associated Press via VOANews.com OSLO *Atlantic salmon farming companies are designing huge pens to raise fish in the open seas in a radical shift from calm coastal waters where marine lice have slowed growth of the billion-dollar industry . The drive for new designs by Norway , producer of 54 percent of all farmed Atlantic salmon in 2016 , will have to cope with ocean storms that can rip cages and free thousands of fish . Escapees disrupt natural stocks by breeding with wild cousins . " The industry has to develop and to solve the environmental challenges it has , especially linked to salmon lice , " Norwegian Fisheries Minister Per Sandberg told Reuters , referring to parasites that often spread infections resistant to antibiotics . One in five salmon farmed in Norway dies before reaching maturity , partly due to tiny blood-sucking lice that latch onto the outside of the pink fish . Lice , also a problem in other countries , tend to concentrate in the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now based . A shift offshore would expose farms to ocean currents that should help to sweep away the lice larvae . The Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries is seeking innovative fish farm designs , both for offshore and coastal waters , in a two-year drive open until November 2017 . So far it has approved a handful and is reviewing about 40 others . Many borrow ideas from the offshore oil and gas industry . The lure of offshore pens is that they would open almost unlimited areas for fish farms beyond bays and fjords , attracting investors and transforming the global aquaculture industry . Norway produced 1.1 million tons of salmon in 2016 , more than double the output of number two producer Chile , and earned $7.6 billion in exports . Smaller producers include Britain , the Faroe Islands and Canada . But Norways production , by companies including Marine Harvest , SalMar and Leroy Seafood , has been little changed since 2012 due to lack of space and disease , even as rising demand has pushed prices to record highs.Storm risks <p> " Well take the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest cost , no escapes and is industrial , " Marine Harvests chief executive officer Alf-Helge Aarskog told Reuters of a range of designs the company has proposed . Nets in coastal farms sometimes tear in storms , harming wild stocks from Scotlands Spey River to Norways Alta River , and offshore farms will be exposed to far stronger winds and waves . Last year , 126,000 salmon broke out of Norwegian farms . " Escaped fish mix with the wild salmon that creates problems with genetics , " said Ingrid Lomelde , of the WWF Norway Farmed fish are bred to grow fast and fatter than their sleek wild cousins . Interbreeding could produce fish too weak , for example , to leap up waterfalls to reach spawning grounds . Among approved designs , SalMar is building what it calls the " worlds first offshore fish farm " to start in late 2017 a floating circular construction 110 metres ( 360 ft ) across that looks like a drilling rig , apart from huge nets dangling below . The 700 million Norwegian crown ( $82 million ) yellow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will be big enough to raise more than a million salmon . " Were starting to install the anchoring systems , " off the coast of mid-Norway , chief financial officer Trond Tuvstein said . " No one wants escapes , " he said . In Chile , Felipe Sandoval , head of industry group SalmonChile , said the government wanted more research into farming in more exposed and offshore areas . " We will have to wait a bit to see how this takes off , " he said . Most approved designs in Norway are still on the drawing board , such as a sealed 44-metre ( 144.36 ft ) tall egg-shaped tank by Marine Harvest where the fish swim inside in seawater filtered to keep out lice , or a 400-metre long farm by Nordlaks shaped like a supertanker.Egg <p> Marine Harvest hopes to start building an " Egg " prototype in mid-2017 , CEO Aarskog said . The sealed design would be suited for calm waters in fjords and is favored by environmentalists and river owners as a way of isolating any disease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more exposed areas globally " including for other types of farmed fish such as sea bass or bream , said Tore Toenseth , an analyst at SpareBank 1 Markets in Oslo . Huge new cages able to withstand storms could be used anywhere , from Japan to the United States , he said . But river owners say not enough is done to protect wild stocks by the expansion of farming . " Its a very vulnerable system , " said Erik Sterud , of the river owners association Norske Lakseelver , who estimates there are now just 500,000 wild salmon off Norway against half a billion farmed fish . Companies are willing to invest hundreds of millions of crowns in the new technologies partly because Norway will award licenses to operate the new fish farms , almost for free . <p> Why not anchor the cages to the sea bed below the surface were there are strong tidal currents .

Its even better than a factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals a weak inner core that can decay . <p> All I ever do is nail knot a braided loop on and coat it all ( loop included ) with aquasure .

Two large weirs were preventing fish movement upstream , but both weirs have been changed to make it easier for sea trout and salmon to make their way to their spawning grounds . It follows work to make it easier for fish to pass through Environment Agency tidal gates at the coast , where the sea meets the stream .

The real skill comes in determining just how to do this by varying the amount of weight according to the flow and depth of the water being fished . All comes with practice . Usually years of it . <p> " A wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its usually the allan i fish , and some parts above kinbuck area are very slow fishing would i just be trying to get the worm moving as slow as the flow ? also would you recommend a single lob or 2 ? <p> Thanks mate , its usually the allan i fish , and some parts above kinbuck area are very slow fishing would i just be trying to get the worm moving as slow as the flow ? also would you recommend a single lob or 2 ? <p> the allan is a small spate river <p> AA <p> If you find it hard to keep the worms moving in slow water simply use a shrimping float.Tie a stop knot on the line , slide on the float put a weight above the swivel.Two foot of line to the hook a couple of split shot about half way between hook and swivel.Set the depth so that the worms bounce along the bottom and away you go . Also you can use a large bubble float to move the worms along a popular method on the Moy . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once saw used by an old chap on a very slow moving deep pool on the Bladnoch to ensure the worms kept moving was that he tied a pva bag with a pebble in it onto his swivel ( the only weight on his set up ) . Cast the lot upstream into the pool . Pebble took the worm to the bottom and then once the PVA bag melted , the worms slowly trundled along the bottom . I walked that river all week and he was the only person I saw catch a fish despite the pool being heavily fished . I would agree , keeping the worm trundling along is most important . As for one worm or two , the old fella had a huge bunch of lobs on his hook . Might be down to personal preference and confidence that one ! <p> thanks ! , ive always conisdered using a float but never really seen anyone else using one so i guessed it was the wrong idea , i always see bubbles float as something frowned upon and used on bait fisheries for trout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger ) but i like the idea of the shrimping float , ive tried using no wieght and just a swivel but feel they do n't  get down that much and kinda hang mid water , unless in shallower , which is usually faster so they move too fast i feel

@@25138895 @5138895/ 48620 @qwx248620 <p> Simms hard bite tungsten . Expensive but worth it in my book , superb grip and will likely outlast your boots . I have previously used the wee hex head ones but I find they wear through far too quickly and also their large size impares grip . <p> I would put some in the heel but definitely none in the sole , I know some people like a few at the very edge of the toe to help climbing out of a steep bank . <p> I put about five studs in an arc around the back edge of the heel , and four around the front of the toe . Felt generally gives a pretty good grip provided you have contact across a good proportion of the sole , but the studs in the heel should catch if your foot does slip , while I find that the ones in the toe are good if you are moving on an uneven bottom where sometimes you do only have a toehold . <p> I used the Snowbee studs in my current pair of boots because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grip has been fine , but as Strathglass says they have n't lasted all that well , and some are now quite badly worn down - will probably replace with the Simms ones . <p> The cheaper the stud you buy the less longevity they will have , cheap D.I.Y . store options may well only last a few days and as they wear down to expose a broader surface will become a positive danger , especially as you will be expecting " grip " from them.Allthough it hurts the wallet to buy the Simm 's Hardbite beleive me its more than worth it.Just be aware that there are two types of Hardite stud , one for Felt soles and one for Rubber type.Make the effort to obtain the right ones for your boots and you wont have to worry again as they will outlast your boots.Happy wading , Pedro . <p> I would have to agree with previous comments regarding both the Simms Hardbite studs and the positioning of the studs . I currently have a pair of Simms boots with built in tungsten studs all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as being very uncomfortable when walking on a hard surface . Having experienced this I would never again have wading boots with studs in the fore foot , especially around the ball of the foot . This boot was poorly designed by Simms , but I have to say that I am a positive advocate of their Hardbite tungsten studs . They will definitely outlast your boots . ONLY PLACE THEM IN THE HEEL THOUGH ! ! ! ... or as has been suggested maybe just a couple at the very front of the boot . In my experience the only reason that you need studs with felt soled wading boots is to get a grip when you are walking on soft ground like clay , mud or wet grass . With just a few studs in the heel you can get a decent grip on soft surfaces just by keeping your weight on your heels rather than the fore foot . My issue with studs in the fore foot is that it is generally the fore foot that you use when you are trying to negotiate your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can turn your wading boots into ice skates . Also , studs under the ball of your foot will become very uncomfortabel if hard ground pushes them up into your foot . <p> Cheaper studs will do a good job but will need replaced after a short time when they flatten out . <p> So in summary - three , four or five Simms Harbite studs at the back of each heel is the optimal solution . 
@@25138896 @5138896/ 48620 @qwx248620 <p> If your looking to re-use old spey lines due to the running line being cracked or damaged then there should n't be a problem . Simply cut off the old running line a foot or so from the beginning of the rear taper ( reel end ) and ad a loop in the form of a braided loop or a welded loop . The line should perform in the same way that it did when it was used as a spey line only it should shoot further . If its a double taper then it presents a bit of a problem as the cut head would have to be weighed in order to match to the AFTM of the rod . A wee word of warning when cutting lines ... always cut off less than you intend as you can always cut off more if it 's too heavy . <p> Changing the running line as SA suggests is a way of restoring a worn out or broken line and will in effect give you a shooting head albeit a long one that offers very few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spey line will never cut down to make a shooting head for a 10# rod in the true sense of the word as when cut in length it wont be heavy enough . You need a spey line a couple of line weights above the shooting head you want , this means getting 10# or 11# heads out of spey lines is almost impossible . <p> For example a 10# Hardy Mach2 55 ' weighs 44g , if you cut it down to 42 ' it weighs 32g which works out around 8/9 in shooting head terms . Lots has been written about cutting lines into shooting heads and my own opinion more often than not its a waste of time unless you are looking for 8/9 weight heads . This Mach2 is an example of one which works really well . <p> If it 's a spey line then yep , simply replace the running line . The weight of the head is distributed throughout the head length so if you shorten the head then you will ultimately reduce the weight of the head . If it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the head then you 'll reduce the weight of the head therefor it will be lighter and may not suit your 10-11# rod . <p> Spey lines which have long rear taper are good material for two different S/H . Vision Spey ACE , SA Mastery Spey and Orvis Wonderline Spey I have found cheap ( less than 25 ) in wt 11 ... 13 and their front taper and some belly has been good for 8 to 11wt TH and Rear taper with some belly for 8 to 12 SH and 6 to 8wt TH . <p> If you get yourself a set of scales the whole process gets easier . I usually deal more with approximations for my shooting heads than exact figures , but I made a lot of shooting heads for an old rod of mine , some successful -some not I knew the line weight that I liked on the rod and it ranged from 39g to 44g for lines in the , oddly enough , similar length in feet for the grammes in weight ( ie. 39 to 44 feet ) . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of head that I prefer on a rod , is coil the lines up to the length that I want and pop that length on the scale . If it also weighs the right amount for that length of head , I know that it 's worth cutting up for a shooting head . Different line tapers will vary in their loading of the rod and their performance at that weight and length , but it is usually within tolerance of your preferred loading . It also helps ( speeds up the process ) if you cut yourself a board of wood that is a foot long , or any measuremnt that you wish to work in . Measuring the line is simple , you simply wrap the line around the board until you have the number of loops that equate to the desired length .

Anyway , one of the presenters was doing a piece about sheep farming in New Zealand . He commented on how green the hills were and on the great quality of grass that was being grown . The farmer said it was a ' secret ' but seeing it was the BBC he would let them in on it . He took the presenter to a huge pile of white powder that a JCB was loading onto a crop dusting aircraft and explained that the ' fertilizer ' was the crushed down remains of oyster and mussel shells that were collected from fish factories by the lorry load on a daily basis . The crop duster then flew up and down the mountain sides spraying them with the crushed shell powder which made the soil less acid and improved the quality of the grazing . We all know how famous the trout fishing is down there and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible . Since the demise of our steel industry , basic slag is no longer cheap and easily obtainable and buying crushed limestone also appear to be too expensive for farmers to apply to their upland pastures . As a result since government lime subsidies were removed in the 1960s or 70s the hills in the upper catchments of our salmon rivers have steadily become more acidic . Surely there must be some way that an enterprising person could organise the collection of similar shells that are probably dumped at the moment and create a business out of it which would also benefit our salmon . Even Fishery Boards could contribute by perhaps subsidising hill farmers in particular areas to mechanically apply the stuff . Any thoughts ? <p> It would certainly work , historically they would burn shells to produce lime for building purposes in coastal fishing communities . <p> The only problem now is that crushed shells are popular for garden paths etc. so I suspect that with this demand from garden centres &amp; the like the once surplus shells are no longer freely available as there is now a market for them .

A stretch of water I fish has some very fast water about 4ft deep , maybe 20ft wide and on the far side of it a deep pool with little or no current . How best to fish the deep pool ? I can not fish it from the far bank as the far bank is an island and impossible to wade to when there is suitable water to fish . Any ideas ? Liam <p> Two tactics spring to mind . 1stly start well above the deep pool and try a long line fished down and across into it , hold the rod as high as you can , keep your fly line/running line off the fast water as much and for as long as you can.Try a few different sinking polys/tips to get some depth . 2ndly , a fast sinking tip cast across and square right into the pot with a real long winged big flee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your rod tip downstream and pull the flee back as quick as you can while allowing the line to be pulled and bellied downstream at the same time .

Good luck , Pedro . <p> Girt big monkey on a heavy bottle tube whipped through using the current to belly the line , plus a bit of stripping if appropriate . Or a whacking great toby ! A sunray would be worth a swim too , I would think , but first choice for me would be a bit of monkey magic . <p> Presumably the fish is at best lying on the far edge of the fast current or if it 's resident then it 's well down in the depths of the deep water .

James was awarded an OBE in the New Years Honours List for services to conservation , education and the community , and he was presented with the award in March by S&amp;TCs Patron , The Prince of Wales. * Below is our tribute to James when his OBE was announced .

A Service of Thanksgiving*to celebrate his life will be held in June , at which S&amp;TC will be represented. **James will be very sorely missed by all of us who had the pleasure of working with him over many years . <p> James ran his Moorhouse Estate here in northern Cumbria according to his conservationist principles , and was very " hands-on , " and totally committed to his local causes here .

He absolutely loved his fishing . I recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grayling , with gentles , only 18 months ago . He also loved shooting , and I last met him on the final shoot of the season at Warwick Hall in late January this year .

Do you need to fish a heavier line when tube fly fishing or is there another secret to it <p> Your fly line provides mass to transfer energy to the fly and turn over the cast . You 're seeing that the tube is too heavy for the mass of your fly line combined with the length of leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed by hauling . This will move the mass quicker and may improve turnover . Shorten the leader to help the transfer of energy . Choose a higher line weight and overload your rod slightly . Most rods will cope with one size higher . Choose a lighter fly . <p> " Out of every hundred men , ten should n't the others back . " Heraclitus <p> As Stu says , you need to use a lighter line for your single handed rod which is probably trout rated , instead of your salmon rated line .

Casting a heavy tube with this set up , especially a 9ft leader and overhead casting will be very hard especially if you are a beginner . <p> To get deeper you might want to think about using a sinking line in conjuction with dressed hooks , or using a set-up better suited for fishing with heavy tubes . <p> From what i can gather you are using a 9ft 7wt single handed set-up with a single handed rated 7wt line .

All setups are different and depending on yours you may have found something it ca n't do , esp if you 've had no problems with dressed doubles/trebles . <p> A setups ability to deal with heavy end gear will depend on the design of the rod and design/power of line , some are better , some worse . <p> FWIW , eventually every combination of SH or DH will get to a point where it ca n't deal with heavy/un-aerodynamic tube flies . Sometimes using a slower more deliberate cast and aiming higher can help , but sometimes you 're just stuffed A shorter leader and lighter/less bulky fly is your best bet if you want to continue with tubes in the meantime , personally I 'd go for a sinking line though to get depth . 
@@25138923 @5138923/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> Salmon V Sea Trout Identification <p> Hello Flyn , <p> I am aware of a number of ways of differentiating salmon from sea trout : <p> Heads : The jaw line ( maxillary ) of a salmon or grilse usually does not extend further back than an imaginery vertical line from the fishes eye down ( i.e. it does not extend beyond the eye socket ) . On the contrary , the maxillary jaw line in a sea trout usually extends slightly beyond the eye socket <p> Tails : The extreme edge of a sea trout 's tail is usually square when the tail is held splayed . - This contrasts with a grilse/salmon tail which has a concave ( inwardly curved ) tail . N.B Both tails can look similar ( i.e. forked ) if not held splayed , this may be one cause of deception in poor light or to the uniniated. - Just to confuse matters , in larger sea trout the extreme edge of the tail may even have a pronounced outward curvature ( i.e. convex ) . - Salmon also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the tail , which sea trout completely lack . there is also a ' wrist ' narrowing just above the tail of a salmon ( sometimes inperceptable in small grilse ) by which the salmon may be held and gripped , supported by the rigidity of the tail rays . Again , the sea trout completely lack these features . <p> Scales : Another way of differentiating salmon from sea trout if still in doubt is to perform a scale count . This involves counting the number of scales from the hind edge of the adipose fin forwards and downwards obliquely to the lateral line . In a salmon , this count usually amounts to between 9 - 13 scales ( usually 11 ) . In a sea trout this scale count will usually be between thirteen and 16 ( usually 14 ) . That is , sea trout usually have a few more scales than salmon based on this count . <p> Patternation : Sea trout usually have more spots both above and below the lateral line . the majority spots on a salmon are usually confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , utterly confused ? Refer to one of the good books that cover this subject such as " Sea Trout Fishing " - Hugh Falkus or " Successful Sea Trout Angling " by Graeme Harris and Moc Morgan . - Even experienced anglers get confused or need a second look on occasion , so you are not alone . Like most things , with experience and ' feel ' you will get better at easily discerning the difference . <p> Still confused ? - On very rare occasions scientific testing may be necessary to discern the difference .

@@25138929 @5138929/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> 2 suggestions <p> I 'm sure every river is different but here are two general observations I have on spate river fishing . Fish the lower/tidal sections if there has n't  been a spate ( especially around big/spring tides ) and fish further up after a spate as the water is dropping and clearing . After a few spates fish should be spread along the river but the fresher ones will tend to be nearer the estuary if the water has been low for some time . Just from my own limited experiences which have been mostly for sea trout rather than salmon on spate rivers . <p> Assuming there are some holding pools ( deeper water which allows some cover/protection for the fish ) there will nearly always be some fish in the river after the first spate of the year , the stock building up as the season progresses , and these will most likely be in these holding pools . These can become very hard to catch the longer they are in the river . <p> When the river is in spate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rising ) , you could contact fish pretty much anywhere as the fish strive to reach the holding pools or the spawning beds . The fishing will continue to be good until the river is back to normal levels . <p> It 's also worth remembering that there are spate rivers that are 2m wide and those that are 20m+ wide , and these may differ in their amount of holding water and fish running speeds . Some rivers will drop to normal levels in a number of hours , some in a number of days . <p> If you get the water , spate river fishing can be awesome , if not it can be very frustrating ! ! <p> If the river is local , and it 's been raining , cancel all appintments and get to the river ! <p> Falkus reckoned the first 6in of a spate was a prime taking time and then , to fish after it had peaked and was dropping off . On my local river ( near the tide ) the fish tend to become active during the first foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it wo n't fish until it starts dropping off again . To confuse matters further , my club has two beats which only fish in a big filthy flood . However , these pools are about 30 miles upstream of the tide In short , and to generalise , Falkus was probably spot on.Again ! ! ! ! Get hold of his book , it says on the cover " a practical guide " ... and it does what it says on the cover.Recommended . Tone <p> In short , and to generalise , Falkus was probably spot on.Again ! ! ! ! Get hold of his book , it says on the cover " a practical guide " ... and it does what it says on the cover.Recommended . Tone <p> Agree with Tone on this one . I have both his Salmon and Sea Trout books and they contain a huge amount of information . Best not try and absorb it all in one go though . Take what you need at the time and go back to them when you need too . <p> But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books out there . <p> No doubt that the classic time for a spate river is on a falling river . Especially if you are using normal salmon fishing tactics with normal salmon flies . However , first thing in the morning and last thing in the evening can be productive even in a summer low . If you speak to sea trout fisher they will tell you that the first run down will not infrequently result in a salmon . <p> You can even get them during the day if you know where they lie . Tiny flies ( I 've known of people catching on s16 trebles and also grayling bugs can get you a fish ) . <p> The only time when I would say it is hopeless is in a hot , bright sun with very low water . I ca n't recall ever having caught a salmon on a spate river in those conditions . <p> I spend a lot of time fishing spate rivers . The fish do still run even if there has not been a spate and I do occasioally see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to holding pools . <p> Before a spate , fish tend to move to the head of pools and the fish tend to become a lot more active . This can be a good time to catch the fish . When the water is high and coloured , the fishing can be tough but fish often lie closer to the bank and in the tails of pools where they seem to rest . <p> As the water drops and clears , many fish can be caught as the fish run through the system . I like to fish the faster moving water which can be quite good sport . <p> When the river is low , I tend to find the evenings and early mornings the best time to fish . The fish tend to lie deep in holding pools but they can still be caught , but it can be hard work . <p> I was always told that the smaller is better , particularly when the grilse are in the system . I would use no larger than size 12 . Size 14 is what I will use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a size 16 trebble on the findhorn last year . <p> When the water rises , I would use a weighted fly / tube to get down a bit .

The north Tyne benefits from Kielder releases , but these are not set in stone , I think the last scheduled release is the 18th of September ( you can find these on the web ) . I like the fishing at Warden , reasonable cost 65 a day , Andrew is a great guy he will keep you right and the pub is a short distance away ( Boatside Inn ) rooms from around 80 .

I like the Angel at Corbridge , very busy and lively . We have stayed at the Riverdale but apart from the nice lady who organises the fishing , we found them quite unfriendly . However , if you want an hotel with fishing this could be your answer especially at the back end . We have also stayed at the George Hotel at Chollerford , a lovely looking hotel but it was tired , belongs to Shearings and caters for the older person 's bus trips .

On my recent trips I have caught very little and the other rods have n't had a lot either . About 3 or 4 years ago the catch numbers were excellent , so good in fact the Ghillies earned themselves a trip to ( I think ) Russia .

@@25138940 @5138940/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> KNOTS- Tying fly to leader <p> Hi <p> Can we discuss what is the best knot to use to tie a Salmon fly to a leader , this includes dropper and point flies . I mainly talking here about using treble and double hooks Any suggestions should include a reason for your choice of knot . <p> For droppers I prefer a double blood knot over the water knot as the tag end stands at 90 degree 's to the leader thus reducing the risk of the dropper tangling round the leader . With the water knot it lies alongside the leader and they can twist around each other . <p> For tying on straight eyes it would have to be the tucked blood knot for pure ease . <p> For tying on upturned eyes then it should be the double turle . However , this is my bogey knot and I 'm still not happy with tying it . <p> I am experimenting with having doubles ( up eye or not ) tied with a little loop so they have free movement . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " One Stop Shop Knot " Does n't matter what strength leader you use 8lb-30lb the fly swims freely ! !

@@25138942 @5138942/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> New improved hitch technique .... well , new to most anglers ? <p> Hi Folks ; <p> It seems appropriate that this " NEW " ( LOL ) riffling hitch technique be exported from the same little island that the portland creek hitch ( aka the riffling hitch ) was exported ( Newfoundland ) .... So here goes ... BTW very few anglers globally know about this technique ... like .... a handful ! But its DEADLY ! Solid hook-ups ... lots of bone in the gap of the hook ... just try it . <p> Here is a little something that was passed along to me by a 3rd generation monster hunter who has helped educate some of our better anglers here in Newfoundland and Labrador .... he catches 30 pounders for fun ( almost at will ... grrr ! ) and can cast a full single handed fly line ( wf or dt ) with either hand in a gale with a big #2 4X shank bomber on the end ( like casting a small styrofoam cup .... also grrrr ! ) ... and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to fish wrong handed as a child so he 'd have to learn to use both hands ! Anyway ... here 's the trick . <p> First use nylon ... not that other stuff ... The knot tests at near 100% of the line strength when using nylon ..... oh and watch out for burred edges on the end of the wire in the eye on mustad hooks ( cover any with thread and lacquer while tying your flies ) . <p> Take a short shaft sproat bend hook ( ie deep gap ) with a perfect or round DOWN TURNED EYE ( eg the old mustad 3906 3999 , 3399 , etc .... if you can find them ! ) . Then use this knot after putting the leader UP through the down turned eye ( if using a floating fly and fishing near the surface .... ALWAYS tie your down turned eyed hooks on by putting the leader UP through the eye ) . <p> The effect ( if done right ) is simple ... the hook rides on the end on the line in a wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on a 45 degree angle and offset on a 45 degree angle ... the results of this are : <p> 1 ) more profile of the fly facing the fish . 2 ) better and deeper hooking in the jaws .... but ya need that deep gap short shanked hood mentioned above to take full advantage of it . 3 ) with the right water speed and hook size you can also make it riffle ! Experiment with it ... you can also have it " tilt " /riffle from one side or the opposite way .... experiment . You can also tie the whole knot then slip the figure eight knot over the eye of the hook like a giant messed up turle knot ... same riffling effect and double tilting effect .... the knot often makes the riffle while the hook eye helps very little if any with the rippling effect . <p> JUST TRY IT ! <p> ( mods .... a sticky ? ) ... I have others ... <p> Last edited by silverleapers ; 26-09-2008 at 01:05 PM . <p> Get educated and involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too late ! <p> This looks interesting and I will give it a go as riffling does work here .

Make sure you do it in a well ventilated area . <p> If not though and it is poly or epoxy , when I refinish a blank I use a very sharp scraper blade made from a old plane blade to take the finish off . Having first removed the rings and old whipping thread and varnish holding the rings on , I then hold the blade hard against the blank with the blade vertical at 90 degrees to the blank and scrape off the finish - whilst rotating the blank frequently . That may sound brutal , but the reality is the blade slides over the carbon surface and does n't cut into the fibres . The sharper the blade , the better it does the job . I then finish the surface off with a wet sanding to smooth it down before re varnishing it . <p> I agree with D-FLEX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Walker with a craft knife blade . To reiterate , take the whippings off first and then run a blade at a very slight angle , you will almost see an air bubble move in front of the blade as the varnish comes off the blank , and that will mean you can keep the blade away from the blank and not damage it . The hard bit is as you get closer to the tip and the blank becomes very thin , but you will just have to get more careful . <p> I spoke to Brian Potter and he suggested using fine wet and dry , and of course he has a lot more experience than me , but I did n't want the matt sanded finish , so I removed the final residue traces with some cotton wool dowsed in my wife 's nail varnish remover ( the good stuff without added nail renovator ) .

@@25138956 @5138956/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> Overlining , is it contributing to power application tailing loops . <p> Been doing a lot of practice over the last few weeks , mainly SH overhead , tracking , drift , haul timing and smoothing out my entire game . Trying a lot of different rods , pokers through to noodles with various line combinations.Lenfant terible has been a little sage vps 9ft 4weight , untill that is I put a little Bario wf3 through it and its suddenly been transformed , Next up put a 4weight rio on Lukes Airflo delta 5/6 , the thing was a rocket . For years every second person I 've spoken to about casting , rods , lines etc. has told me that said rod feels better with a line a weight or so higher , now I find that my haul timing and power application are much less exacting while underlining . Your thoughts lads ? <p> My thought is that weight distribution within a line 's head is just as important with a single hander as with a double . Perhaps more so . <p> Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weights per se of Rio lines in particular are often a half rating heavy as standard , I guess over here the practice might have come from lads shortlining on Loughs in a good wave , in order to have an effective backcast into the tailwind the extra mass cut down on much false casting , lift .. haul .. shoot into the back cast , drift and away she goes , big open loop with three flies up , nice economical fishing . Anyways going to have to do a rethink on much of my single handed setups . <p> Taper makes much less difference to rod loading in an overhead cast as all of the line plays its part in loading the rod as its all in the air , for example 18g is 18g regardless of where ( within reason ) the weight is . Lines for casting heavy saltwater or pike flies have far more weight towards the front compared to more regular trout profiles yet they still weigh the same weight ( within reason ) over a given length for a given line rating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and things change dramatically with the weight in the top half to the apex playing the major part . That 's why spey casting lines are far more profile critical than overhead casting lines . <p> I would expect a lighter line would make haul timing and the correct/increased application of speed more critical to achieve good rod loading . <p> What you might have is rods that were over-rated to begin with and an extra line weight above this was too much , that might explain your findings as you are now putting somewhere near the correct line weight ( for you ) onto the rods . <p> No expert but I do mess around a lot with single handed rods and lines . Just because a manufacturer says the rod is a this or a that is only an opinion .... To complicate things it should be based on casting only approximately 30ft of line . What if I want to carry 60ft ? Should I underline ? I do n't think so . There 's a lot going on , and we expect a lot of our tackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicately at 20ft , while having the versatility to bang a lure out 80ft on a stillwater . As with rods its the perfect scenario to try before we buy ... And pick the line which feels best when mated to our rod , personal style and fishing distance / fly weight . The bario slx is an amazing line .... But very heavy , as is the Rio grand and gold . Its too late in the night to ramble deeply , but my experimenting has raised both of my eyebrows ..... Aftm #6 is about 11grams . Actual slx #6 weight at 30ft was 13 grams ( including the level taper at the front ) When i distance cast a bario gt125 i can carry 70ft which weighs 20grams . So to sum up I want my trusty 6wt , designed to cast 11 grams of line to cast anything from half that to almost double ! ! ! ! .... And feel great ! A lot to ask . <p> Yeah these days so many different tappers are available , also the weights per se of Rio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard , I guess over here the practice might have come from lads shortlining on Loughs in a good wave , in order to have an effective backcast into the tailwind the extra mass cut down on much false casting , lift .. haul .. shoot into the back cast , drift and away she goes , big open loop with three flies up , nice economical fishing . Anyways going to have to do a rethink on much of my single handed setups . <p> A good wave usually requires a good wind to produce it . I only ever use a two fly set up in this situation . Its much easier to get the leader straightened out into the back cast ( into the wind - which is always behind you when you are drifting ) resulting in a better forward cast . This results in better presentation , less time sorting out fanks and more productive fishing- for me anyway . <p> Of course Pete , that is the standard tactic on most big waters , I am just wondering where all this advice to overline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast actioned rods is responsible for much of the overlining , am postulating whether it is contributing to the tailing loops so many including myself suffer from . <p> If a line is too heavy for a rod ( based on that casters forward cast effort ) then it is entirely possible you will bend the rod in a way that is conducive to creating a tailing loop if you do n't control your application of speed in the forward cast properly . <p> Heavier lines do n't cause tailing loops on their own , its really a technique issue but could be amplified by the heavier line , you can also get them with lighter lines if the application of speed during the forward cast is wrong . <p> Heavier than normal lines can be cast perfectly well providing the caster can make the necessary adjustments to his technique . I would rather have to deal with a line that was too heavy than too light most of the time . <p> The old chestnut but I 'll say it ... would n't it help if manufacturers all gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sage Circa for example ...

This will tighten a joint , but can be imprecise and could overtighten it which requires removal and try again . <p> 2 ) Not to be attempted after alcohol ! Spread a THIN coat of superglue on the male spigot as smoothly as you can .

@@25138971 @5138971/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> Leader connection to Carron line <p> Hi all , <p> It 's been said a lot about various ways to create the connection at the end of the flyline to connect the leader . However , I 'm struggling with coating the Carron line is built from . Tried many ways ... braided loops , nail knots over doubled end , whinding with the thread and in all variants used some aquaseal for security and smootheness of the connection , but all leading to the crack of the flyline just behind the connection . Any solution for the Carron lines ? Myself going to conclusion of stripping the end and to tie non slip loop of clear line core . What can you offer else ? <p> I use the same method with Carrons as with all my lines that have braided cores - I strip off the coating , fold the core back on itself , sew the two parts together , whip it all with Kevlar thread and then give it a couple of coats of Aquasure thinned with Cotol . This not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neat one . <p> I find it helps if you take the Aquasure back a little way up the line . Cracking happens when you have hingeing between the stiff , whipped loop and the more flexible line tip ; I do n't think it 's possible to avoid this , but making sure that the Aquasure extends back onto the line seems to help to smooth the transfer from one to another . If you do find that it cracks , it 's fairly easy to apply another light coat of Aquasure over the top to prolong its life . <p> Thanks for the tip ! Done this too ! After a day or two of fishing the line cracks again just behind where aquaseal is . When out for a week fishing this causes almost everyday tuning of the line with growing of aquaseal coat further up the line , which sounds not a good idea . Any other suggestions ? <p> bushi , you must be doing something that 's leading to an inflexible spot on the line which will cause hinging-leading to cracking.If its only taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! , even a superglued sleeve connection lasts longer than that ! . I 'd try a braided loop with a double length of braid about 2 " long , feed the tip of line up inside the doubled length until it touches the very base of the loop itself , then apply the mearest drop of waterproof superglue-such as Zap a Gap through the doubled section of braid onto the tip itself ( purely a security measure ! ) , them where the braid stops on the line whip over 1/4 " each side so the whipping length is no more than 1/2 in total , apply Aquasure with a wet finger and rub gently into the whippings and allow to dry overnight , use the mearest drop at 1st , then apply a second coat next day . There 's a thread on here about the non hinging double braid loop , you can easy follow n do it all yourself . If you continually get cracking , there 's something that 's causing the tip of the line to hinge badly that needs looking at , or just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very old ( it does happen now n again , which I suspect could be that case due to the regularity of the line cracking ) . Now this bit I hate saying and it sounds awful and its not meant to , but what are you using on the end of the flyline-tips , flees , leaders etc and how is your casting technique ( sorry do n't know you and do n't want to cause offence ) , that could also be a contributory factor if your a relative begginer , huge apologies if I 'm miles off there . One more thought in that if its an unusually long fine tip , it may well behave like this and simply need cutting back to a more suitable diameter-poly tips , and heavy flees such as tubes will need a slightly larger tip diameter to cast and turn them over any way , I had several lines I trimmed by a foot or so right out of the box for the very same issues ! Keep us posted , Pedro . <p> Thanks a lot for the inputs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can say about myself ) . The problem have happened last season on two Carron Jetstream lines - 85 ft and 65 ft . Now I 'm going to use 55 ft Carron line . As I reckon Carron lines have quite a long thin tip and thus I 'm afraid I have to cut a lot until I get to thicker part . Also I 'm not fishing heavy flies with Carrons as well as not often using polyleaders , mainly ordinary nylon , so thicker tip is not good idea to cast shrimps tied on #6-8 doubles . Another solution I 'm working on now is to strip an inch of the tip and tie the nail knot with the leader butt right on the core closing it with overhang knot of the core of the flyline as a stopper . After that to seal the connection with the aquaseal . We 'll see .

They are finished off with brass reel foot and handle . A simple " click and pawl " ratchet makes a very loud click ! The spool is lightly " dimpled " to allow for gentle palming and although there is no modern drag system , the benefit of a small arbour and shallow spindle means that a when a fish runs there is a smooth noticeable resistance as the line leaves the reel . The Classic II weighs 362gms/12.7oz and is capable of holding 75 yards of backing with a 65 ' head 10/11 spey line or 100 yards of backing with a 9/10wt 55 ' head spey line .

@@25138986 @5138986/ 48620 @qwx248620 <p> Here you go PWH2016 . Written by Donny Donovan who taught me how to nymph for salmon at Nursling . Wonderful . Good luck . <p> Salmon on the JW weighted nymph . <p> There is a chapter in the classic Frank Sawyer book " Nymphs and the trout " where the author describes his attempts at catching salmon using his weighted nymphs both on the Avon at Somerley and on the Test at Broadlands . If I were to teach a complete novice how to fish for salmon using a weighted nymph at Nursling in this year 2004 , I would show them that particular chapter and say that is exactly how to do it . It is both perfectly written and perfectly descriptive of how we fish for salmon today using weighted nymphs . The incredible thing is that Frank Sawyer wrote it very nearly fifty years ago . So much for progress . Frank Sawyer was a river keeper way ahead of his time in both fishing techniques and in his ideas on fisheries management and a lot of what is now regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . <p> Having said that Sawyers nymph technique for salmon can not be bettered , I would still like to give one or two examples of my own observations at Nursling and hope that the great man would n't think that I was in any way questioning his thoughts . Incidentally , Vic Foot ( Nursling keeper for 56 years ) remembers well Frank Sawyer coming to Nursling and failing to catch a salmon using the more conventional flies . Perhaps that is when he decided on trying his weighted trout nymphs ? <p> The fishermen in the early 90s who developed a nymph fishing method on the Lower Test through trying various colours and hook sizes etc say they were completely unaware of Sawyers efforts fifty years previously . Mmmm ! <p> At Nursling I fish for salmon using a 96 sage rod rated for a six weight , although I use a seven , floating line with a 15 lb leader about seven feet long . Not your normal salmon set up but perfect for the Test at Nursling . I have caught a salmon of 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be about the limit . All salmon caught on the Test are now returned so they need to be played hard , brought to the net as quickly as possible and returned to the river . A salmon of 10 lb can be hooked and landed within five minutes if played properly and netted smartly . The 20 lb fish took nearly forty minutes to land and pushed the rod to its limit and throughout the fight I can remember thinking that I would n't want to catch anything bigger on such a set up . Without snapping the rod , there is very little you can do with such a big fish using a trout rod . I have fished the weighted nymph on the Tweed in Scotland using the exact same method only fishing with a double handed 15 foot rod which would give much more control on such a big river with the possibility of much bigger fish . With practice the weighted nymph can be Spey cast and fished in the same delicate manner on the Tweed with a 15 foot rod as we fish it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole idea of the weighted nymph and without doubt the most important part is to get down to the fish . You must lift that nymph through the salmons eye line . The great advantage of fishing at Nursling is that you can normally see the salmon and so you are basically stalking it and can see everything happening in front of you . I have watched with fascination a salmon completely ignore a nymph not more than six inches above its head but cast a little further upstream , a little more time to get the depth , bounce that nymph on the gravel in front of the fish and slowly lift through its eye line and it can not help but follow it to the surface as if magnetised . I should add that this is of course not a 100% guarantee and as with all fishing , there is always thankfully the exception to the rule . <p> Most of the fun fishing this method is in the actual stalking of the fish , having a target to aim for and in seeing the take which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly to a rising trout . That said , there are occasions when you cant see anything in particularly deep or coloured water but there is still that same feeling of excitement as the nymph slowly makes its way to the top likely to be ambushed at any moment . Since fishing the weighted nymph I have not once foul hooked a fish as with at least 75% of all takes you can watch the salmon have the nymph , strike instantaneously then hang on for dear life whilst he makes that amazing first dash for freedom . <p> I usually prefer to fish downstream to a salmon as much more control can be felt whilst trying to get the nymph in the right place and loops of slack can be roll cast upstream to buy the extra depth . I have caught fish using the more traditional upstream method but because we only use a short leader and have to cast quite a way in front of the salmon to allow for the drift , it is very easy to spook the fish . With salmon I have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and although they tend to stay in their lay they seem to switch off and ignore your attempts . Sea trout on the other hand , are gone as soon as they see you so a stealthy approach is a necessity although on many occasions your first sighting of a sea trout is as it disappears into the depths . It does surprise me how little consideration fishermen give to concealment and if I see a fisherman crawl on all fours towards his target then the more confidence I have in him having a successful day . Keeping out of sight is one of the most important things when nymph fishing in any gin clear chalk stream especially when you are after salmon or sea trout . <p> Over the last five or six years we have experimented with all kinds of different nymphs of all colours and of every size and we now have what I believe to be the perfect salmon catching Nursling nymph although it must be remembered that it might not necessarily suit other waters ! When you read of Sawyer and the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural food and so size and pattern was absolutely critical . As we all know there is really no natural food in the rivers for salmon as they have more important things on their minds once they have entered fresh water and whilst some salmon flies might represent shrimps etc in the hope of triggering the memory of what might have been its last meal at sea , our nymphs are not an imitation of anything in particular . I think that the salmon takes a nymph through a mixture of annoyance and aggression and that the colour is not of particular importance ( apart from the last couple of weeks in September ) although the weight is because unless it is fished through the eye line , then it is very rarely successful . It is always an exciting time when John White ( Inventor of the JW Nursling nymph ) turns up with something new to try whether a different colour , size or weight . Most of our nymphs are black with a silver bead and I would use nothing else in clear water . In coloured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much for the convenience of me being able to see it . I also sometimes fish a red nymph later in the year when the cock fish seem to become more aggressive and do seem attracted to the colour . The point I am trying to make is that our way of fishing the weighted nymph for salmon at Nursling in the year 2004 is nothing as precise or as exact as what Frank Sawyer was doing for trout over fifty years ago at Netheravon . As I have previously said , he found that he could catch salmon using the same method although with the trout his deception involved replication where as ours , whilst being just as exciting , is more to do with annoyance and perhaps aggression and the more cynical fluff chuckers amongst us might say that that is one of the many differences between trout fishing and salmon fishing . You trick the trout where as we just eventually **** the salmon off ! <p> To see a salmon rise from the depths in pursuit of your nymph is fantastically exciting and half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I do as soon as the fishs mouth closes on the nymph . I find it very difficult to fish in Scotland and to let the salmon run with the fly before lifting into it because at Nursling the nymph will very often be spat out within seconds unless set very quickly . The unfortunate thing about this method of salmon fishing is in having confidence in it to begin with and in persisting until successful . As soon as you catch the first fish or at least raise one to the surface , you 'll know what I 'm talking about but it is easy to lose faith . Un-successful fishermen often complain that they do n't  feel as if they are fishing properly and that they would feel more comfortable casting thirty yards of pointless line taking a step forward each time and working methodically through a pool on a big river until something grabs the end . I also like casting but what works on one river may not necessarily work on another and once you have seen the nymph fishing technique work , you are of course well and truly hooked . Thanks Frank . 
@@25138987 @5138987/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> Spiral single spey with a switch rod <p> I was playing around with this cast yesterday and it seemed to have a couple of advantages over a single spey . The only downside I see is that it may look a little superflous to an observer if that would bother you . <p> I found I could manage considerably more overhang which is a big plus with a shortish switch line . This made more distance possible for my ability anyway . I also found it mush easier to time as the anchor touchdown was slower making fine tip anchors easy . Possibly also less room required . <p> A single Spey is a great cast but once you start to master circles it transforms the cast , you can pick the line up and place it wherever you want in order to put your fly in any part of the pool . There are many names for these casts but essentially it 's just circles , really great fun with a switch rod but also very useful with the longer rods . The key is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temptation to rush it . Teach yourself to do it off both shoulders , it will allow you to fish in places you never thought possible before . It also reduces your need to do those horrible sustained anchor casts like snap T etc where the line gets ripped off the water and scares the fish away ( I 'm going to get pelters for that last sentence ) . <p> Thanks bankwheel , That confirms my own thoughts . It seems to add an extra element of stealth by making it easier to minimise the anchor as there is already some tension on the line before the anchor tips the water . I found by keeping the rod tip high through the circular motion , I could easily start the forward cast with a vertical rod position which gives good elevation despite the rod length limitation . I could get a little extra distance anyway .

Chris GreenGage Plum Wine Homemade Wine You 'll need demijohns and obviously proper yeast . Sanitation is key so make sure everything is properly sterilised and have proper air locks . Christmas might be a bit early . My wines I bottle after 12 months following numerous racks . However as said I use different fruits . I have a few books and I 'll look later to see if they mention this plum variety . It 's normally victoria that I have previously seen talked about . <p> Hurricane I just checked one of my books and there is a recipe . It however is n't the most straight forward but I 'll write it up here anyway . Ingredients : Greengages 1.75kilos Barley 0.25kg Sugar 1.75kg Water 4.5litres Yeast and nutrient Pectic enzyme <p> Grind barley in the mincer , stone and cut up the fruit , putting both into fermenting bin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 4 days , adding the Pectic enzyme when cool . The enzyme is most important if you are to be sure of a haze free wine . Stir daily . Then strain onto the sugar , add the yeast nutrient and stir till all is dissolved . Then add the yeast ( preferably a burgundy wine yeast ) . Keep closely covered in a warm place for a week , then pour into fermenting jar ( Demi John ) , filling to bottle of neck , and fit an airlock . Siphon off for the first time when it clears but do not bottle until assured that fermentation has completely finished . Otherwise bottle bombs . <p> Anyway that 's all I can find . As for mincing barley I have no idea ha . Good luck . <p> Hurricane I 'd personally remove the stones but do n't worry about being neat . For wine it does n't matter what they look like . I would weigh the plums before so that you know what weight of plums to add for whatever recipe you will use . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm guessing that the wine recipes are stating the weight of plums before stones are removed . Maybe I 'm wrong . But it 'll be much easier and quicker when you have time to make wine to remove stones now . Also fruit is easier mashed up to release juice from frozen . The addition of boiling water breaks them up well . Good luck removing the stones wo n't be fun I 'm sure but will be worth it in the end .

@@25139018 @5139018/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> How to fish frances flies ? ? ? <p> Hi all ! I have noticed an increase in the number of reports of fish caught this year on Frances flies and variants - red , black or whatever . I would be interested to hear how those succesful anglers actually fish the Frances - is it a sink'draw method , short pulls , upstream casts to fish the fly deep through known lies , etc ! ! Its not a fly I have yet used , but I would like to add it to my " armoury " for next season , and would like to learn from those who use it successfully in the UK . Thanks in advance and tight lines to all Nick <p> I recently saw a remarkable demonstration of fishing the Francis . The pool is about 12 ' deep straight off the bank , with quite a strong current , below a weir . The angler short-cast a heavy Francis ( 4gm ) on a fast sinking line slightly upstream , and ' nymphed ' it along the bottom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit like czech nymphing or ' high sticking ' . When it had passed him on its way downstream , the tension on the line caused the fly to draw up towards the surface . Result : as it lifted off the bottom , he hooked a silver fish in the high teens that I had been trying to tempt for two days . That was the only fish hooked by three very good anglers and me on the beat that day . The fish got off after a vertical leap and a brief tussle , but wow - was I impressed ? ! The angler concerned told me that the take usually comes as the fly rises off the bottom . Another angler later told me that he uses the same technique but with a very long leader ( he said 15-20 ' ! ! ) , to allow the fly to get down deep . I also learned that they fish it sometimes as a standard salmon fly - i.e. more or less down and across . Getting it down deep seems to be desirable - but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a few ... it 's a must-have for next season 's fly box . Hope this helps . <p> They look good . I believe Helmie , one of the Forum 's trade sponsors , supplied the flies mentioned in my first post - they 're on tungsten bottle tubes , and very smart they looked too . Think I 'll use a bit of lead wire when I tie mine though - it 's cheaper . <h> www.frances.is <p> It varies from river to river up and accross or down and accross . I quite often twich it back in a figure of eight or bounce the rod tip as it swings round . We have fished it like check Nymphsand induced the takes takes . I like one tied with a gold angel hair body . <p> When ever i hear of people recommending a very long leader and heavy weighted fly cast a bit upstream or straight accross it reminds me of a very effective technique i used to watch on a certain pool on a well known urban central Scotland water . Right enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being spent in an attempt to fill said pool in.

Riverge or Vision tippet rings have never let me down , but they are certainly not the cheapest .

This will enable S&amp;TCS to bring all MSPs attention to what they can do to protect Scotlands iconic wild salmon and sea trout , and the wider Scottish environment , from the damage it is currently suffering as a result of salmon farming in marine open cages . <p> " This is a vindication of what S&amp;TCS has been saying for some years . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the message has now got through and MSPs have taken the first steps towards a solution " . <p> S&amp;TCS Aquaculture Campaigns 2016 Petition recommends that the Scottish Parliament should seek to amend the Aquaculture and Fisheries ( Scotland ) Act 2007 to give Scottish Ministers a statutory duty to inspect farms and enforce sea lice control on salmon farms . This is for the express purpose of protecting wild salmonid fish from juvenile sea lice infestation from marine cage fish farms , and statutory powers to order immediate culls of any marine cage fish farm where average adult female sea lice numbers of farmed fish remain persistently above Code of Good Practice thresholds . <p> Over the medium term , S&amp;TCS argues that those farms consistently failing to control sea lice should be closed or relocated to move the worst performing farms away from salmonid rivers and migration routes . <p> Finally , S&amp;TCS supports a renewed focus on moving to full closed containment of farmed salmon production in Scotland , with complete biological separation of wild and farmed fish. *Fisheries scientists including the Scottish Governments own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fish-farms harm wild salmon and sea trout , both at an individual and at a population level . <p> However , S&amp;TCS believes that these threats are not being addressed by effective regulation and control of sea lice numbers on fish-farms in Scotland , which are essential to protect wild fish populations , many already significantly reduced . <p> In 2016 , the S&amp;TCS raised a formal Petition to the Scottish Parliament , which seeks to change the law , firstly to require immediate culls or harvesting of farmed where sea lice numbers have effectively gone out of control and secondly to give fish farm inspectors the legal duty to control sea lice on fish farms , expressly to protect wild fish populations from juvenile sea lice infestation from marine cage fish farms . <p> The Petition has been considered by the Scottish Parliaments Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee . <p> Step in the right direction but it will not happen tomorrow .

Im pleased we did forego the Dee , as the river was totally blank below Banchory , where we fish . <p> Kiritimati , or Christmas Island , lies about 120 miles North of the equator , and is accessed by a once a week ( ! ) flight from Fiji to Kiritimati and on to Hawaii , doing a complete return trip the same day . It is apparently the largest atoll in the world , and was the site for early atomic weapons testing in the late 50s/early 60s . The SE Tradewinds blow at about 10mph each day , and the daylight hours are basically 6am to 6pm . <p> Our journey started at Heathrow , to Los Angeles , then Hawaii about 18 hours flying time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight down to Kiritimati . We left home at around 5am on Monday , night stopped Monday night and flew out of Hawaii at noon on Tuesday , arriving Kiritimati at 3pm Wednesday you cross the international date line on this flight ! ! Watches / cameras / brains all needed to be reset . <p> We booked our trip through FlyOdyssey ( I have no connections with them ) and all the arrangements worked flawlessly , so hats off to Mat Mchugh . <p> About 50 anglers , mostly from the USA , boarded the flight at Honolulu , all heading to the small number of " lodges " that serve the visiting fishermen . We stayed in Tabwakea Village at " The Villages " , a fishing lodge run by the Church . <p> It was pretty basic accommodation , but the food was good we lived on fresh fish each day . The 12 anglers at The Villages are looked after by 12 guides , and we changed guide each day . There were 4 boats with a boatman , each taking 3 anglers and 3 guides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anglers were also mixed up each day , so you always had new company for the day . <p> Our team of 12 comprised 4 Brits , 1 Dane , 1 German , 1 Canadian and 5 from the USA a super bunch of guys and good fun to be with . <p> This trip was what I call " immersive " , in that 6 days were spent with no phone connectivity , no WiFi , no TV etc . Our daily routine started with breakfast at 5:45 , you made your own sandwich lunch , and headed out on the boat at 6:30 , just before sunrise . <p> A normal day saw us back at the lodge around 5:30 to 6pm , with dinner served at 7 . A very long , tiring day but well worth every moment . This was all wade fishing , with the guide beside you , dropped off and moved around by your allocated boat . <p> We each normally fished 2 locations in the morning and 2 in the afternoon . Mostly , you could see no other fisherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes 2 miles apart ! <p> The guides used their extensive knowledge to put us onto different flats according to the tide , wind and sun conditions . This is all sightfishing , and you need the right sun angles to best see the fish . <p> The fish mostly Bonefish , with a sprinkling of Giant , Bluefin and Yellow Trevally , Trigger fish and the usual aquarium suspects . The odd Black Tipped shark cruised around , also hunting small bonefish . <p> Most of us were kitted out with an 8wt rod for the bones , with a 12wt ready for GTs , carried by the guide to be quickly available should a GT pitch up . When they did , they were cruising erratically and at warp speed , and you were very lucky if you could get a cast in . There is a lot of footage on UTube of large ( 60-100lb ) GTs being caught , and these are almost exclusively fish that have been lured into the edge of the flats by chumming , a practice which in now somewhat frowned upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Over the week , I lost many more fish than I would normally expect to lose in the Keys or Cuba , simply because of fish running through coral heads and cutting off the leader . I lost 3 Trevally and about 8 bonefish in this way , including my best bone of 8-9lb which cut me off just before the guide was about to land it . All these fish are returned , the guides unhook all the fish and we used barbless hooks only , making unhooking by such skilled guides a quick and simple task . <p> The bones I encountered probably averaged about 2 3 lbs , but a lot were around 4lbs , some 5lbs . During the week , bones of 10lbs and 9 lbs were taken by members of our team . My Keys and Cuba flies were mostly ignored by these fish , which live on worms , rather than shrimps and crabs . For those of you who fancy a trip , you need " Christmas Island Specials " in sizes 6 and 4 , with various weights of dumbbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 6 days of fishing , one of which was pretty much a write-off for all of us due to rain and wind affecting the water temperature , I took around 90 bones . My best day was the last , when I took 30 by lunch and another 10-12 in the afternoon . And remember , all these fish are sight cast to its a very visual and totally absorbing and rewarding experience . <p> There are also opportunities for " blue-water " fishing , and Pegleg and 2 neighbours of ours took the plunge . A 3-hour motor to the right area on the exposed lee shore , led to 5 or 6 hours fishing a mix of trolling and fishing into the back of the surf with giant poppers for GTs . Our 3 intrepid heroes , fishing with only 2 spinning rods between them , managed to land 2 Wahoo ( Peglegs was around 75lb ) , a 40lb GT , 2 Yellowfin Tuna and lost another 6/7 fish in play . <p> Plus a rod " exploded " ( ! ) under the strain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for much of their day , they took turns on just one rod .

Once sleeve fitted over polyleader and tail of braided loop , hold polyleader below braid so loop is vertical add one spot of low viscosity fishing glue to top side of sleeve . The little glue will work all round inside of sleeve coating braid and polyleader , no mess . I 've had fish over twenty pounds using this method . You can add additional tying thread whipped over braided tail and a spot of aquasure in teardrop form to finish . <p> Yep , agree with rush on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the polyleader and they last a long time .

@@25139034 @5139034/ 48620 @qwx248620 <p> Can anyone compare Airflo and Rio poly leaders ? Are they any different in their ability to turn flies over ? <p> Yes mate there is a difference , the rio versi leader is almost 2x the weight of the equivalent airflo polyleaders and as such has the ability to turnover larger flies easier with a line that has suitable front taper , Let me explain <p> I have rio AFS Heads that have a fine front taper for better presentation the down side is the leaders that was included in the kit were in my view to heavy for the front taper , the slower sink ones were ok i.e. intermediate and slow sink but the heavier fast sink and super fast in combination with a heavy fly too much for the front taper of the line to turn over easily , the airflo polys were much more suited to the front taper of these lines and even the super fast polyleaders were a joy to cast . <p> Now i also use the Airflo rage lines , these have a more aggressive front taper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versi leaders being heavier in their make up are far nicer to cast and the heaviest leaders in combination with a heavy fly were much nicer to use so both have their uses but in my veiw are very different , happy casting <p> I 'd rather have something I do n't need than need something I have n't got ! ! <p> I have been a long time user of Polyleaders.My particular go to ones are the Airflo.I 've never had a problem with them in any way at all.I so far have turned over any weight of fly I 've ever put on them ( up to 3 " copper ) , I find them robust , accurate in breaking strain and cheaper than the Versi Leaders by some way . I do own and have tried Versi Leaders , however I and a few friends found them of far lower breaking strain than they were supposed to be in fact we all experienced them at times breaking for almost no reason at all.As a consequence I do n't trust them and no longer use them . The weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier LSR 16 and 24 were much more difficult to cast and turn over compared to the Airflo ones . These issues may well have been resolved , that I do n't know.But so far I 've not had any problems with any of the Airflo Poly Leaders in any length . Pedro . <p> I was one of the ones that Rennie referred to with breakages on the Rio versi-leaders , quite a few broke at a very low strain on the rear loop . <p> I since believe that this was a bad batch &amp; suspect that they were over-cooked when the loops were formed ; I have used others since without a problem . <p> My thoughts are that if you are using a light weight line ( say a #7 or possibly an 8 ) , especially if it has a fine tip , then stick to the Airflo ones as they are lighter &amp; easier to turn over with this . <p> If you are using a mid weight line then maybe use the Rio ones up to fast sinking &amp; the Airflo ones in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a bit heavier in grams than the slower ones . <p> If you are using heavier lines , say 10-11s or upwards ( especially sinking lines ) or 570 grain Rage heads or heavier , or lighter Skagit heads , then the Rio ones may be a better match precisely because of their extra weight . <p> One point though , Airflo make the extra strong ones on a 40 lb core , this is a bit stiffer &amp; turns weighted flies over better than the standard one ; also it means that if you are using a strong tipper with heavy tubes , say 25 lb Seaguar , then there is a better chance that the tippet knot will break before the leader loops or knot ( if you use a tippet ring as I do ) if you have to pull for a break when snagged . Far easier to replace the tippet than the leader . <p> A personal thing of mine , when using heavy tubes I do n't believe the tapered leader does much for turnover , rather the momentum of the tube keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader does however mean that the tip sinks more slowly than the rear ( washing lines ) . For sinking lines &amp; faster rated poly tips I still like the Michael Evans ones which are parallel &amp; sink faster at the tip than the tapered ones do . Also they have a 30lb core as opposed to the standard 24 lb one on the others . You can cut a 10 footer ( they have coated loops at each end ) &amp; add tippet rings to the cut end &amp; have say a 6 foot one &amp; a 3 foot 8 inch one -allowing a couple of inches loss in each for the tippet ring knots , but with practice you can half this . <p> Just remember though , all poly or versi leaders are just that - leaders , they are not sink tips . They will let you fish a fly a bit deeper in a flow off a floating line or to fine tune the depth with a sinking line ; but they wo n't get you down in a good flow in February or November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people expect too much of them in this regard &amp; they are definitely something to use in conjunction with , not in lieu of , a full sinking line .

That is why I decided to buy a 12Ft Rod I am looking at the Rio Skagit Max VersiTip Fly Line but I do n't know if this type of line will be to heavy for the rod ? <p> Thanks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact lines , ssvt#7 or airflo rage compact both superb lines , I use these on my 12fters , there both 5/6 ft shorter than the afs so will suite the shorter streatches of the river but both are well capable of good distance when called for , you can of course use your rio polys ( versileaders ) on both these heads , I like to use shooting heads 2.5x the rod length when things are tight behind me ( trees , banks , vegetation etc ) or short distance work , and 3x the rod length for when im afforded a little more room for the back cast , I have heads that are 30ft long and with a 10ft polyleader on the end I can fish in really tight spots happily with a 12ft rod <p> I 'd rather have something I do n't need than need something I have n't got ! ! <p> I ca n't help with choosing an exact line for your rod , but having fished the south Tyne a bit I 'd recommend finding a suitable skagit . When waters on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . Not in the least bit stealthy but ideal for big flees and short distances . <p> Yes , i must admit that for the most Rio have looked at the rod rating and gone one lower for the " A " rating and whatever the rod rating actually is for the " B " rating which for the most will work out . Bruce and Walker notoriously under rate their rods and I think on rods such as your powerlite , Scandinavian brands and older rods you would be better off trying out lines rather than assuming these charts have used every rod and line combo . <p> But I think the demon will be right going off the charts .

Any advice would be gratefully received . <p> Just happened to drop in !

The first batch of the Mach Spey lines were way over weight but I gather the problem has been solved ( but even at the actual weight as designed the 9/10 is still too heavy ) . The Rio AFS 9/10 at 38 grams should be ideal and the Airflo Delta Spey 9/10 was also good on the rod . ( Not the long version ! ) . The Rio Windcutter 9/10/11 should be good if you come across one . I tried a 9/10 Rio Unispey which should have been ideal but I did n't find it so . However , it was a short trial and I did n't cast it often enough to figure out why the line did n't suit so well .

A new Airflo Sniper reel and a nice starter outfit for 105 is not too bad ! Cheers S <p> Regarding the different models , it 's true that any of the models can cast any of the lines , but it 's not optimal , it 's like saying why you do n't play golf with one type of club . Skagit rods are regressed ( parabolic ) whereas the Scandi is a stiff tip actioned rod with the classic being somewhat in between . The cast is different also to cast a different fly , though it is being blurred with the types of lines being produced these days . The Skagit cast as shown by Ed Ward is a sustained anchor cast for casting heavy tips and large flies , but the Scandi is for casting relatively small a light flies on floating and intermediate tips .

The week started with mild weather and overcast skies , during which our group of anglers averaged 5 fish per rod per day , with more than 20% the catch being bright , summer fish . From the third day of fishing on , however , the sun shone brightly and the temperatures rose , posing some challenges for anglers and guides alike . We ended on Friday with temperatures above 30C , and , the catch rate responded in kind . <p> In a constant search for the most productive fishing tactics , our team of guides and anglers explored many different techniques . In some specific spots - usually big , deep , slow pools - full sinking lines and big flies were quite effective . Others opted to target fish in the more oxygenated broken waters of the innumerable points with small , bright flies . Another group cast heavily weighted rubber-leg tubes fished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more traditional approaches , worked with a certain level of success , but as would be expected the conditions determined most of the results , and fishing slowed as the temperatures rose . <p> Several fine old friends joined us this week in Ryabaga . Gianni from Italy was our top rod with 37 fish . At age 85 , Pat made his usual 2-week excursion to the Kola Peninsula with his family friend Peter , and entertained us with stories of the adventures that took him around the world . It was also nice to welcome Cyril and Alexander back in camp once again . <p> A special note should be made about our dear friend Bill Young who came to camp this week with his son Willie . " Youngie " ( as his friends call him ) has been fighting a hell of a battle with cancer for some years now , and we were thrilled to see his resolve in returning to Ryabaga . Youngie is not only a passionate angler , and one who has fished the worlds famed salmon rivers , he is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is a man who takes life into his embrace fully , and having him here back was an inspiration to us all . Until next time , Youngie . <p> From here , we are fully in the throws of Kola summer , and we are looking forward to more fine fishing and more friends before our summer break . Week 6 looks like a promising one , with a full camp and 20 skilled rods on the water . As with all things in the far north , the weather dictates much , but we are confident that good conditions and fine anglers will collide with a wealth of Ponoi silver . As we enter another week on this remarkable river , we are confident that 2016 will continue to be a record-breaking season .

Using Braid allows the rapalas to swim better as not as much drag on the line , and of course casting is far far easier ( others will disagree watch this space ! ! ) .

I know I will be using light lures and do n't mind spending a bit of cash on something decent that will have a tip that will work with a size two mepps but have a bit of backbone to handle decent fish . 
@@25139079 @5139079/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> Rod line weight and shooting head match <p> Hi All , <p> From what I read my understanding is shooting head lines are easier to cast than standard spey lines and i 'm thinking of getting one . Currently only have short head spey floating line . <p> I have a vision catapult 14 ' double hander and on the rod it states line weight of 34 grams 9# . Can anyone tell me does this mean I need to get a line precisely 34 grams or does it matter if line weight is 2/3/4 grams heavier than stated on the rod . I know this is quite a generalization but if brand states 34g then would n't they all do the same thing and only difference would be price point ? <p> Can anyone recommend a shooting head line for vision Catapult GT4 14 ' rod . <p> The 14ft Catapult that you have is really designed for a 34g head as is stated on the bottom end of the rod blank . In truth however the rod will comfortably cast both a 34g and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , less experienced casters tend to like as heavy a head as they can get away with as this enables them to feel the rod load deeper into the blank . With extended periods of casting practice and more experience some anglers are able to cast the line just from the rod tip which is really what the Catapult was designed to do as it was Vision 's flagship shooting head rod .

@@25139088 @5139088/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> Ian gordon Partridge spey 13ft rod-line to match <p> Hi I 've taken this discussion from the sales section . <p> I have the Partridge PDF regarding these rods and for the 13ft it states the " Head weight " is 42g . It makes no mention of it being a Spey line . Is a 42g shooting head too heavy ? I have a 40g snowbee shooting head and it seems to cast fine . <p> the 42 gram is definitely for spey lines . For shooting heads I use the mwf shooting head system @33gram or the airflo rage compact @ 510 grains which equates to the same 33grams . Beanieboy on the forum is your man for info on the 13 ' partridge . lovely rod to cast very sweet once your tuned in with the correct line , but saying that if the 42g is working for you and not overloading the rod why worry . I have a 42 gram guideline ready to go shooting head I will have a throw with it and see how the rod handles it <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " If women are so bloody perfect at multitasking , how come they can not have a headache and sex at the same time " Billy Connolly <p> I agree with smokie , the Rage 510gr is , imo , spot on for the rod . Weights are important , but so too is the actual head profile and length , for example the 540gr 35g Rage head feels much heavier on the rod than some of the Rio and Guideline heads weighing in at 38g . Personal preference also comes into play , some folk prefer a light loading , whilst others including myself prefer to let the rod do more of the work and prefer a slightly heavier load . I , for example , find the AFS 34g too light for this rod , whilst others find it spot on . I also know that some folk use Hardy Mach #9 speylines 55 ' head with this rod - again I find the #9 too light and would highly recommend the #10 if you want to use full lines . Should also say that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' unless you are a good caster - no point torturing yourself with a short rod and medium/long headed line unless you know how to throw it . The longer line in same rating may also not load your rod as well as the shorter headed line , so be careful with speyline selection . The Rage 510g , as stated earlier is the best line I have thrown with this rod and copes well with tips right down to fast sinking , no problem . Remember though they are designed to lie somewhere between a skagit and a scandi and are relatively ' short and thick ' - they therefore load well , hence my agreement with smokie when he recommends the 510g - the 540 Rage is just a step too far for this rod . <p> Thanks for all the advice . The original line I bought was a Mach 65 #9 but found it murder polis to cast , just would n't load the rod . Also tried an orvis wonderline #9 and worked a bit better but still not convinced . The snowbee shooting head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast . Only intend to use as a summer rod so will stick to what works and possibly think of a heavier AFS down the line . Cheers J <p> 65 ' lines on a 13 ' rod are a challenge , certainly not fun if wading . Try a Mach 2 55 in #9 , much nicer than the 65 ' taper <p> Never understood trying to cast a 65 ft line on a small rod too much effort the Mach 55 is probably the best short headed line I have used I use it on 12 and 13 ft rods and you could use it all day long without getting knackered <h> Ian Gordon Partridge 16ft 11/12 <p> I have the Ian Gordon Partridge 16ft 11/12 its a rod I only use very occasionally .

Eddie <p> Same as above It will not keep indefinitely in the freezer but does keep well enough to last for as long as you 'll probably need it .

Swilly can be good for general fishing , but you need to be out towards Fanad for variety .

I contacted fishing.porsanger , who are renting out 2 cabins with 8 private beats that are fished on a rotation principle . They are almost fully booked , but have availability for week 33 ( prime-time ) . Unfortunately I did n't yet get an answer as of how much they charge , but will find out . Here 's two links : <p> I 've also contacted the river keeper , who 's on holiday break and a few german guys who 've been there , for some other options . No feedback yet , but I 'll keep at it . Would anybody be interested in joining ? Two friends of mine will probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six , to use the cottage 's capacity . Hopefully some other accomodation options will pop up , giving more flexibility regarding size of the party ( 4-8 ) , in case my buddies ca n't make it or they do and a few more of you wan na join .

I have pain every day but to varying degrees and my mobility is better some days than others . <p> Its difficult with the teaching because the river bank is n't a great place for me to be at the minute , I 'm not able to move as quickly as I have been so the risk of a slip or fall that could cause me further problems is there . I also found that in the last couple of years there would be days when a lesson had to be cancelled because I was n't in as good a shape as I felt I needed to be . Add to that a shoulder surgery last April that went badly wrong and left me with maybe 50% movement in my right shoulder for most of last year and it lead me to the decision it was best to no offer and lessons until I 'm better . My shoulder is now up to 90% so that problem has all but gone now . <p> I have also been focusing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A workshop environment is far easier for me to remain productive with relatively less movement and if I get pain I can always sit down and rest or take time off as needed . <p> Because I was n't physically comfortable on the river it was always going to be hard for me to keep up-to-date with everything that 's was going on .

Bead at hook side of swivel eye , a stop knot or split shot or leger stop or second swivel to keep hook out of swivel , tie hook onto end . Then take a weaker breaking strain of mono from other swivel eye and tie betty on this . The weak link allows you to snag a betty but not lose a fish as fish is on main line . <p> Adjust the length of weak link depending on flow and bottom structure .

" Heraclitus <p> Not really more effective but I find upstream legering always requires less weight to hold bottom than downstream . This means you need less weight to bounce along and the bait is coming down to the fish which is a more natural direction .

When this happens , do nothing ! ! Wait for the fish to move upstream before tightening into it .

Too heavy and it 'll get snagged a lot , too light and the speed will be too fast . When the line does stop just lift slightly to get it trundling along again and keep in touch with it all the time . <p> Worming can be done at any time but on a flood or in low water are the best times and it really depends a lot on the type of water . <p> Deep holes are especially good for worming and in low water fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygenated . Slow water where a fly wo n't work too well are other likely spots . <p> During a flood fish it right close to the bank especially in places where the flow ' sets ' against the bank and causes a flat even flow behind it .

Best of luck , Pedro . p.s when I say lead obviously its lead substitute below 1 oz in weight ! , or maybe not <p> Good advice from Rennie . I would add , purchase some Tulip beads , still available from McHardys of Carlisle . Do away with the twisted wire mounts and go straight to the hook being held by the tulip bead , they spin and work much better . Another tip select your hook size approx the same size as the minnows fins , i.e. the ends of the fins are in line with the bend of the hook . Hope this helps .

I am looking for any info on how to fish the float on a river and what depths etc to set the worms at . Cheers guys <p> Right salar2007 here you go ; first you need a long rod suitable for float fishing 12ft or above prefereably not a spinning rod , a good quality fixed spool reel filled to the brim with line of 12/15lbs a good quality floating brand or braid if you prefer.Floats , the clear Drennen Chubber type fit the bill , deeper the water , further you need to cast bigger float you use , for water deeper than the rod you will need a clear slider float , the smallest of the Drennen clear Pike floats is ok.Some previous knowledge of depth is helpfull but for depth within the rods length ; fix the float on the line using two float rubbers one top one bottom ( silicon tubing from cycle shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the line.Cast out to your spot and see how the float reacts if it sinks too shallow if it floats along before sinking too deep.Set the depth somewhere near then bite off the bomb and tie on your hook , then again bite off 18ins up and tie a small swivel to the hook line then slide a bullet weight of the appropriate size on the line below the float followed by 1/2 " of silicone and re-tye to the swivel.Now have a few trial chucks , check the float cocks correctly to the coloured tip and swimms through without catching bottom.Bait up and slide the float up a couple of inches , cast out and allow the float to swim through slightly slower than the current by feeding line by hand , in likely spots hold the float dead still then let it run through again . To fish a sliding float , slide a small bead on your main line followed by the sliding float , tackle up as before then take a guess at the depth then above the float and bead take a sepereate bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a domhoff knot ( lots of spit and tighten carefully ) leave the knot ends long that 's ok.You will be able to move this knot on the line to suit the depth where you are fishing.Heres a tip really spay your main line with Mr. Sheen or some such , its silicone based will make your line float and let you lift the line off the surface to mend and keep tight to your float.Now the important bit in float fishing is , keep the line tight to your float , the float should travel downstream very slightly slower than the currents speed.The wind will dictate if its worth fishing in that if the wind is upstream or off your back it will help you to keep your bait in the flow , if its downstream or into your face it will blow your float off track.To buy any of this kit try one of the coarse fishing mags or give me a pm I can probably help.For really shallow water a little ( smallest one you can find ) Grayling Bob with the stem cut off and fixed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine style.Tight lines happy float fishing Pedro . <h> memories <p> Originally Posted by ibm59 <p> Used to be a favourite method at the top end of Loch Eck using the good old Jiffy lemon as a float . <p> mind ma da telin me about guys catching salmon up there , throw the ( jiffy ) float out with bunch of worms get a fish , i tried it once or twice trolling but nothing landed , i thought he was at wind up trying to keep me queit but maybe not ? <p> I used to fish any method on the Reservoirs at Hammersmith back in the seventies , before taking up fly fishing . Bear in mind , as the water warms , the fish will be higher in the water.Bright sun can push them down though.Float fishing with worm used to be productive.Just alter depth if nothing forthcoming.As stated above , try the margins rather than hurling anything out as far as you can from the off .

MikeA licensed angler who killed a salmon and hid it in a hole in a wall near the River Bann instead of catching and releasing it has admitted contravening a fishing regulation . Coleraine Magistrates Court was told on May 5 a bailiff spotted James McNeill ( 65 ) , of Carnlough Road , Broughshane , commit the offence near Kilrea at 7.45am on June 20 last year . McNeill pleaded guilty to one charge of contravening a fisheries regulation . A prosecutor said the defendant was using a rod and line and after a co-accused netted the salmon the fish died and an attempt made to conceal it in a wall . The prosecutor said McNeill told a bailiff : " I have killed a salmon , I was wrong . It wo n't happen again " . Defence solicitor David McIlrath said his client is a well-respected businessman in the Ballymena area with a completely clear record . Mr McIlrath said the defendant was licensed to fish on the River Bann but after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do in a " grey area " he " panicked " . The solicitor believed the fishing licence , which had been suspended due to the case , would now be withdrawn . Fining McNeill 200 and ordering him to pay costs of 232 associated with the case , District Judge Peter King said it was quite clear the defendant came to court with a character which was " beyond reproach " but said in the circumstances it was " hugely regrettable " he was dealing with him for a fishing regulation breach . At the same court , John Crawford , whose age was not listed on court papers , of Bann Road , Kilrea , denied and successfully contested a charge of aiding and abetting McNeill to contravene the fishing regulation . Mr Crawford accepted he took the salmon from the water in a net and passed it to McNeill . In court he said he was doing it as a favour to McNeill and said he was unaware of what the other mans intentions were . Mr Crawfords defence barrister Alan Stewart said for someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have knowledge that McNeill was going to kill the fish and he said it was McNeills case that the death came when he " panicked " . A prosecutor argued Mr Crawfords vast experience as an angler meant he would have been aware removing the fish from the water for any length of time meant it was " going to die " . In the witness box , Mr Crawford said he had arrived separately at the river from McNeill who was already there and he was asked to assist in landing the fish . Mr Crawford said he had " absolutely no idea " what McNeill was going to do and said a fish could probably live out of the water for " quite a long time " . Regarding the presence of the bailiff , Mr Crawford told the court : " I was angry that somebody was lying up in the bushes watching us to see if we were going to do something wrong " . Mr Stewart said if his client was convicted no fisherman " will feel safe " netting a fish for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisted bailiffs in the area regarding poaching and was involved in vetting individuals for fishing licences .

Just not right . <p> All very true but the bailiff is only doing his job too under the legislation set out for him . As an angler What do you do .. let it float off or tag it and hand it in ?

If you feel them pulling tight at the back side as you sit down it is probably too late , the seam will probably have opened .

The strength comes from a 5mm welded ( glued ) tape and this is not a lot of overlap when a 15 stone man sits down and strains them . However , if you do n't  strain them they will last well . I have a lot in , all makes and 90% have an open seam at the back side . They wont fix with a splodge of glue , as when you lift the tape the seam will actually be open , and what works with a stitched seam wont work with these , the glue will just run through and wont seal them .

It was only then I realised the real significance of the collection and its importance to the history and heritage of salmon fishing and of course Farlows . <p> This all happened whilst Farlows were celebrating their 175th anniversary and Martin wrote an article on the books for their 175th anniversary book and from that came the vision for this publication . <p> I have nothing to add to the marvellous review by Dr. Andrew Herd ( reproduced here below with the kind permission of Keith Elliott of Classic Angling magazine ) but do want to add my personal extremely grateful thanks to Peter for first bringing the existence of the books to my attention and to Martin who has painstakingly ensured the collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations and also for his monumental effort in producing this book .

The fact it has been published in ours is something for which we should be thankful . In years to come , it is likely to become a collectors item , to be spoken of in hushed tones . <p> This is not a salmon fly encyclopaedia as we know it . Do not purchase this book expecting to find dressings for each pattern entered alongside it . Had that been done , the publisher would have had to double the books size , not to mention tripling the already considerable amount of research needed to write it . What you get is a detailed view into the " pattern books " that Farlow maintained over the best part of 100 years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You might ask why such pattern books existed , when so many flies can be found in late 19th-century encyclopaedias of salmon fishing . But when you realise over 700 flies are listed here , you appreciate that at times , even the most retentive memories failed . Sure , much of the time it was possible to check out a dressing in Kelsons The Salmon Fly and Tips , Franciss A Book on Angling or the Badminton Librarys Fishing : Salmon and Trout , but these were not the kind of items to be found abandoned on the shop floor . <p> Even if a pattern could be found , the chances of an illustration was low . To make matters worse , the exponential growth in numbers of salmon flies between 1867 and the early 1890s meant there had been a 25-year gap when virtually nothing was recorded in print . Even The Fishing Gazette , The Field and Land and Water were wanting in this respect . <p> Throw the occasional influential customers home-grown personal favourites into the mix , and recall that until the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time beyond , many clients preferred their flies tied to a quite different aesthetic to the one we preserve today , and you have some idea of the challenge facing tying shops . Problems could even occur when someone asked for a fly listed in a firms catalogue , because only the most popular ones were kept in stock , while a few languished untied from one season to the next . <p> The Farlows Pattern Books <p> John Farlow founded his tackle shop in London around 1840 and was soon joined by his brother , but it was n't long before the pair parted ways and Charles continued alone . The business flourished , thanks to regular advertising in papers like Bells Life . By the 1860s , Farlow was a fully paid-up member of the angling establishment , consulted by writers like Francis Francis and well placed to supply customers fishing around and beyond Britain . <p> As his business expanded , a fly-dressing department was created , and as with every enterprise , an initial period of patchy record-keeping was succeeded by a need for better organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt with what was almost certainly an archaeological digs worth of scribbled papers with flies hooked into them , by compiling an index and creating two volumes containing the flies . <p> These works bound together large vellum pages , each one of which hosted several rows of loops used to secure the patterns , with the index number of each fly written above its loop . This wasnt infallible . Sometimes , a fly was noted in the index but no example was tied , in which case the index usually directed the reader to one of sources listed above a slightly risky process in retrospect , given Kelsons awful record on accuracy . <p> Despite the challenges involved , maintaining these pattern books had its rewards , because Farlows persisted with the system until the early 1960s . Similar books were maintained at Hardys and at just about every other retailer that tied its own flies , but in the vast majority of cases , these books have either been lost or have found their way into the hands of private collectors , thus disappearing from our ken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides a fascinating window into what Farlows customers liked to fish in the years leading up to the First World War . <p> Farlows Salmon Flies begins by setting the historical perspective , and moves on to describe the challenges faced by the author in writing a coherent account for a set of books that , for all that they contained specimen flies , had been maintained on an ad hoc basis as a working reference . <p> Despite labels having been attached to the flies sometime after 1910 , the books contain duplicates as well as incorrectly named flies ; there are flies in the books but not in the index ; patterns where the only hint that the original existed is an entry in the index and an empty space ; and flies that are identical , bar minor differences in the material used to dress the body or wing . Making sense of it all must have been a nightmare . We have to give grateful thanks to Martin Lanigan OKeeffe for having the sublime patience to take on this daunting challenge . <p> One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extends to 313 pages and it shows each fly , with a life-size or near life-size picture where possible , together with details of its history where known and a note on where the dressing can be found , assuming that it is listed somewhere . Very fortunately , most dressings can be found in the standard works . <p> The book finishes with a couple of appendices , the first containing colour reproductions of the pages of salmon flies found in Farlows catalogues , while the second checks flies found in the pattern books against their appearance in some*of the catalogues . Finally , there is an index of flies , together with a general index . The book is huge , by the way , at 290mm by 225mm and weighs more than two kilos , so don your steel toecaps before you mess with it . <p> An interesting problem occurs with the earliest flies , because some date back to before the 1870s , when it was relatively rare for salmon flies to have names . This probably accounts for the appearance more than one version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Grey , and the Lee Blue , none of which were ever an exact science , coming from before the days when salmon fishermen became wedded to a precise order of things . The author indulges in much speculation about these , all of it entertaining . <p> One of the challenges was that many flies occur nowhere in the literature , which is more or less what one would expect , given the improbability that every single dressing ever invented found its way into print . <p> Since the fly dressers at Farlows did n't  write any dressings in the book , the only way of recreating these patterns is to settle down and work them out for yourself . But the author gives some helpful clues . A good example is the " LAW fly " listed on page 160 , a wonderful low-water item with a pale green floss body and a lot of tippet . <p> Another agreeable conundrum that Farlows Salmon Flies poses is the way it lists " mystery " patterns . In the index , the Lascelles is accompanied by a reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming any were ever present , so there is no picture in the book . If you want the dressing , though , the reference to Francis is enough , and details can be found on page 348 of the early editions of A Book on Angling , and page 364 or so in later editions . <p> Much the same applies to the Laxford , for which there is no photograph either , but the pattern can also be found in Franciss book , just under the Lascelles . Better yet are patterns where Farlows Salmon Flies lists several different possibilities . My favourite is Kelsons Inky Boy , for which three different dressings can be found between The Salmon Fly , Tips , and The Fishing Gazette . Farlows customers clearly werent satisfied with that , because the pattern books contained a fourth . <p> Martin Lannigan OKeeffe ( l ) and Charles Farlow ( r ) study a notebook along with one of the new ' museum ' books . <p> The flies in the pattern books have now been cleaned , but very fortunately they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good that most surrender their secrets without too much effort . However , if you have grown up with the late 19th-century salmon fly tying aesthetic as most of todays classic tyers have done , thanks to the many excellent publications on the subject you are in for a shock . <p> Many flies are tied to mid-19th-century standards , with relatively thick , tapering bodies and , horror of horrors , cover yer eyes , lads , dare I say it mixed wings . Some are exceptionally fine , my absolute favourite being the Erle King , a stunning item from its Indian crow and topping tail , to in-your-face macaw , guinea fowl , peacock herl , black partridge and just about anything else that takes your fancy wing . They do not make em like that any more . <p> A feature that will doubtless cause much discussion is that the flies are tied to nowhere near the standards one would expect to see at a fly fair these days . And for good reason . The men ( virtually never women ) who dressed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , depending on the patterns complexity . I know little about the early Farlows tying practices , but the vast majority shown here were almost certainly tied in the hand , because it was faster . <p> And there would have been a strong emphasis on making sure that they were tied to last . After all , the firms reputation was riding upon their products performance and staying power . This built-in toughness is one of the many reasons why the condition of flies shown is so good . <p> Farlows Salmon Flies therefore raises a question about what we are trying to do when we " recreate " classic salmon flies today . Many flies shown would be laughed at , were they presented at a show today . Yet it is unarguable that these pattern books contain precisely the standard of fly that anglers were happy to fish with in the times that our classic salmon fly tyers are trying to revisit . I do not , by the way , have an answer to this , but it poses is an interesting question . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast amount of information and downright fun lurking in the pages of Farlows Salmon Flies . Do you need a copy ? Not really . Do you want a copy ? Yes , absolutely . This is n't a work you are going to read from front to back . It is n't the " last reference " on classic salmon fly patterns either . But boy , does it paint the horizon wide . A whole , rich world awaits anyone who wishes to explore what is portrayed in these pages , and the author has given us the keys to the door . My advice is to open it . <p> Dr Andrew Herd <p> How To Purchase <p> Farlows Salmon Flies special leather-bound collectors edition <p> Farlows Salmon Flies by Martin Lanigan OKeeffe , Regular edition 50 Limited edition of 25 in leather with two Farlows flies from the period 795 Published by Coch-y-Bonddu Books <h> Great Book <p> I finally got a copy of the book last week . It is a great book and really worth getting if you are interested in old flies with the added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am looking forward to putting names to a number of flies sitting in my Grandfathers old pipe tobacco box ( pre WW2 ) he married late in life so some date back to the early 1900 and most will be pre 1950 .

In general I prefer dark nymphs ( pheasent tail , black , olive etc ) and from my point of view the presentation of the fly and the right size is about 80% of success . Even when dry fly fishing I recognize the same + the wings and body proportions are crucial ( right floating ) . Great nymphs by the way , I would use them without a question Cheers , Pawel.

@@25139140 @5139140/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> Sea Trout or Brown <p> How do you tell the difference between a sea trout and a non migratory brownie ? I ' ' ve heard people saying they have caught sea trout 1lb in weight and the colouring was the exactly of a brownie so how could they tell it was a sea trout ? <p> I 've only ever caught 1 sea trout as confirmed by others but I was n't 100% convinced it was a sea trout as it again was coloured exactly like a brownie . <p> As I 'm sure you know , sea trout and brown trout are classed as the same species , and the line of division between the two is pretty blurred - to the extent that it 's debatable whether there is a line at all ! <p> For example , a few years ago I caught a fish that appeared to be a brown trout , but which was unusually large for the river ( the Towy ) although it did n't look like a cannibal . Analysis of the levels of some element or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scales by the Pitlochry boffins revealed that it had , at one time , been to sea , but , judging by its colouration , it appeared to have reverted to a fresh water existence . There are also so-called slob trout which feed in brackish water at the mouths of rivers , which show a big variation in colouring ; some are quite brownie-like , while others are almost entirely silver , though often retain the red spot on the tip of the adipose fin . <p> Although the majority of fish will clearly be one or the other , there are those that occupy the middle ground , and I think there is no simple and foolproof test for whether a fish has gone to sea other than as mentioned above . <p> Depends on time of year also.When the sea trout are returning to sea after spawning they develop a brown , stale looking colour and some spots look like they are turning brown.The big difference though is they have n't a golden belly , like the brown trout <p> Analysis of the levels of some element or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scales by the Pitlochry boffins revealed that it had , at one time , been to sea , but , judging by its colouration , it appeared to have reverted to a fresh water existence . <p> The element would have probably been strontium . By dissolving the scales in nitric acid , you can deduce the levels of strontium in scales . There is around 100x the amount of strontium in salt water than in fresh , so a trout that has spent part of its ' life history in salt or brakish water will exhibit greater levels of strontium than a freshwater resident trout . <p> On loughs Eck and Lomand , even resident trout tend to be quite silver . Here scientists have had to resort to stable isotope analysis to identify sea-run and resident brown trout . This demonstrates just how difficult differentiating the two can be , with slob trout providing another complication ! <p> I 've dug out a picture of the fish - it looks a bit more silver than it actually was , on account of the flash . But you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some red spots along the lateral line - although it also had pink flesh , whereas I was told that Towy brownies are white fleshed . Make of it what you will . <p> Sometime around the middle of July . Still a long way away from spawning , so I do n't think that explains the colour . And as you said earlier , I do n't think a sea trout that had been fully silver would get that amount of yellow on its belly , even when stale . <p> Your right , it does have that golden buttery belly that makes brown trout so beautiful looking ! The colour of its flesh may have something to do with its diet.Perhaps it was feeding on shrimps which may have given it the pink flesh or if you caught it near the estuary it may have eaten a few sandeels . I was caught a sea trout baggot in July ... it ran itself aground after being chased around by fresh grilse ! ! After being this long in freshwater though it still looked like a sea trout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish sometimes follow the sea trout up the system , but do n't  usually get past 10 mile upstream from saltwater .

@@25139141 @5139141/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> SFF Review - Rio AFS Shooting Head Kit . <p> I first saw this line shortly after it was launched in the UK . AFS or Advanced Fight Spey to give you its full name . It has been out for 2 or 3 years now but I felt a review was appropriate considering the interest in shooting heads here . <p> AFS from Rio Products in the USA is a ready to go shooting head system that appears to be targeted at those wanting to use a shooting head but without the need for the custom cutting to length and splicing of loops etc . <p> You can buy an AFS in a floating kit form with the running/shooting line and 3 different density tips or as a single shooting head in various densities . The common line sizes available in the UK are 7/8 - 10/11 in the following lengths and weights . <p> On closer inspection inside the wallet you find the AFS shooting head and three different 10 ' tips in floating , intermediate and fast sink densities . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would guess they will be around 1.5 " /sec on the inter and 6 " /sec on the fast sink which is common with Rio 's other sinking versi-leaders . <p> The shooting head is a yellow/green with the front 24 ' in an olive green , the rest is yellow except for the final 12 ' where it joins the running line which is again olive green . This colour change at the rear makes positioning your head before the next cast ( overhang ) very easy . There is a clearly marked sticker near the rear loop , again to denote which end of the head connects to the running line . The rear loop now has the line weight clearly printed on it as well which is real improvement over the old bar code affair used previously , 10/11 in this case . <p> There is also a loop on the front of the head to attach either your leader material or one of the tips included . <p> On the plastic spool is 100 ' of 0.35 " Powerflex running/shooting line in a sky blue colour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line to be 0.35 " and uniform along its length . There is a 6 " long welded loop on one end and a clearly visible instruction sticker on the other indicating which end is to be attached to your backing . <p> The three 10 ' tips are easily distinguishable , green/floating , clear/inter , black/fast sink and they are looped at one end with the nylon core exposed at the other . <p> To make these tips ready for use you need to create a loop on the exposed nylon end , this can be done with a simple surgeons loop or any other type such as Perfection Loop etc . Some people will choose to tie on those small seamless leader rings , whatever you prefer . <p> Once you have tied your backing to the running line you then connect your shooting head in a loop to loop fashion . This can be done quickly by passing the blue running line loop through the rear of the shooting head then putting the whole coiled shooting head back through the 6 ' loop in the running line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull them together with white knuckles , snug is enough ! <p> In the same way you can attach a tip or just nylon leader if required using the loop to loop connection but be sure to do it the right way . <p> This tip is connected the wrong way and will wear prematurely . <p> On inspection and measurement of the 10/11 kit I found the overall length of the head to be only 38 ' 7 " and not 40 ' 6 " as quoted by Rio but the weight was 42g as quoted . <p> You can also get AFS in bright orange from the USA and this 8/9 was again bang on the weight at 34g but again shorter than specified at 36 ' 3 " as opposed to the 38 ' 6 " quoted on Rio 's website . <p> All 3 tips were 10 ' long and weighed 4g . <p> The profile of the AFS could be described as a triangle style taper with a lot of the weight bias towards the rear then tapering down to a tip diameter of 1.35mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front to back was 27g/15g or 64%/36% . <p> Field Test <p> I have taught pupils and used these lines many times while fishing so I know them well . It is easy to see why the AFS has proven to be popular , it is an easy casting line for beginners while being a very useful fishing line . Because of the triangle shape taper there is a lot of weight in the back part of the line nearest the rod tip and top half of the d-loop . This helps with rod loading while the lighter front taper and tip which makes your anchor does n't require much effort to release from the water . Overall an easy casting line and very user friendly . <p> There is however a trade off in the shape of the taper , that is its ability to cast heavier tips than now supplied and heavy flies such as brass tubes etc . In the beginning Rio used to supply this line with 15 ' tips and in my opinion it used to struggle a bit with the fast sinker , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 ' has certainly helped . Casting into a strong headwind can at times be a little challenging but that is more a problem with shooting heads in general as opposed to this line specifically . <p> The running line at 0.35 " strikes a good balance between feel during use and shootability . It can be figure or eight retrieved without causing any lasting memory and it shoots well with only the occasional tangle , this was as much down to the operator as the running line itself . Thinner running line than this in conjunction with very cold fingers can become a problem with the running line slipping during the forward cast , this diameter is fine . Casts of 25-30yds are easy enough with a fair/average technique and a good caster will see 35-40yds if needed . <p> Conclusion . <p> Overall I think this is a good product and I would recommend it . <p> It has limitations in the respect of a beginner casting tips longer than 10 ' but so long as its used for what it was designed for and with the tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use Airflo 10 ' salmon poly leaders if you have them . The fact that the line was slightly shorter than specified may prove a little troublesome for use on 15 ' rods unless you use the tips supplied even in floating . I have used them before as full floaters with only a 15 ' tapered leader without problem but you need to watch your anchors for slipping , especially if the line is 2 ' under length . The floating kit will cover a fairly good range of salmon fishing scenarios once the water warms a little . Because of the 10 ' versi-leaders I would class this as a floating shooting head with the option to use a sinking leader rather than a dedicated multi-tip shooting head . For that you would need to look to the AFS Tracker with dedicated 15 ' tips included in the overall length of the head . <p> This line was supplied for review and can be purchased from Angling Active

Can we work out the Exploitation Rate ? Do the EA ? <p> I was speaking to an ex-EA person last night who told me that years ago they had to net a pool below a weir because the fishpass was being repaired due to damage . They ended up moving 3,500 over the weir before it was mended . The rod catch is below 100 fish per year , mainly downstream of the weir ...

Can we work out the Exploitation Rate ? Do the EA ? .... PS - did you win nowt for your belting Spring fish in 2015 <p> Hi Seeking , <p> Andy is right about the number of salmon caught on the Tanat . I can only recall one fish reported to the EA for the last ten years . <p> No the EA do n't work out the exploitation rate nor do they have a Egg deposition target for Tanat either . <p> There is also an ' observer effect ' recorded in EA technical reports which is that in high water the flow is too much and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lead Tanat bound fish to look elsewhere to spawn - or to spawn below the counter . <p> It is very difficult to get even a rough estimate of the contribution the Tanat makes to the Severn salmon population . The data from the redd counts ( 1975-2004 ) indicates that the Tanat made up about 20% of the total count , but this has to be recognised as a massive over-estimate of the stream 's contribution to the total Severn salmon population . <p> Why ? <p> 1 ) Because the Tanat is a much clearer stream than most of the Severn spawning habitat - so it is easier to spot redds . <p> 2 ) Because of the fish pass it was monitored more intensely - including redd counts . <p> The two points were made to me by the guys who actually did the redd counting . <p> BTW It is n't possible to over-estimate how hard it is to count redds on much of the severn due to water clarity issues . <p> I know two fords within 25 miles of Birmingham city centre on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish a small fly , but I 've only ever been able to count redds there one year in fifteen . <p> In reality the Tanat is less than 10% of the spawning area . <p> Given concerns over diffuse pollution from agriculture there is certainly no reason to consider it to be above average productivity for the system as a whole . <p> So the best way of getting some kind of handle is to go by river length and width . <p> For reference look at the map below : the Tanat is the river in the top left running in a east/south east direction . The Vrynwy which it flows into is 3 or 4 times wider than the Tanat upstream of the confluence all the way to the Banwy confluence . As is the Teme for most of it 's length , and the upper Severn . The Banwy is twice the width for much of its length too . The map is a little out of date as there has been more water opened up on the top end of the Teme and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites on some of the main river fords below Montford Bridge down to Bewdley - or the fact that in low water years some salmon even spawn in the weir pool gravels on the lower river .. <p> So there is good reason to believe it is well under 10% . But assuming 10% of the run then .... <p> Assume a Severn rod catch of 350 for this year . <p> Add the late runners to the counter figures = 740 <p> 740 x 10 <p> gives us 7,400 for population estimate <p> 4.7% exploitation rate . <p> A more realistic estimate of the Tanat contribution to the population would be 7% . <p> This would give us a run of 10,000 plus which incidentally is the lower figure in the estimated range given by Charles Crundwell of the EA . <p> It all makes a mockery of the official EA stock assessment model which implies that some years there are barely 1,500 fish running the entire system . <p> Teme Counter <p> There is another fish counter in the Severn system on the Teme at Ashford below Ludlow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as during the best running conditions fish can take the weir and do n't use the fish pass . <p> Nevertheless , it regularly recorded hundreds of fish going through . <p> No full set of data from it has ever been published . However , I 've got data from the EA that show 1079 in 2005 and 411 in 2006 . The biggest number of fish reported caught on rod and line from the Teme in a season in the last 16 years is 11 . <p> If we add to that rod catch a proportion of the Severn catch from below the Teme mouth ( based on a very rough estimate of 18% - derived from the long term proportion of Teme redds in the Severn redd count total ) then the annual catch of Teme salmon is somewhere around 15 . <p> The highest figures ever reported by the EA through the Teme counter were in 2010 at 2112 from the start of the close season October 8th to Jan 15th 2011 , but this was revised down to 651 in the data supplied as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The historical redd count data ( 1975-2004 ) shows that just under half of Teme redds were recorded below the counter . Given the greater water turbidity further down , and the resulting difficulty of spotting redds , the real spawning proportion is undoubtedly higher downstream of the counter than it is above . <p> We do n't have enough data to work out an exploitation rate but we do have enough to know that it would be well below the 14% for MSW and 9.9% for grilse applied by the EA ( MSW making up 70% of the catch ) . <p> p.s . I did indeed win nowt but bragging rights for the big fish - it was from the posh river next door . However I lost a much bigger fish from the Severn system earlier in the spring .

" You take the skin off and soak it in the water , and then you scrape it with a sea shell . Some fish you have to scale ; some fish you do n't . Like pike and white fish , you 've got to scale it , you soak it in urine . The urine has to come from a young boy baby before weaning . It does n't contain any chemicals , just momma 's milk . For thicker skins , you have to use the urine from an older boy , around the time his voice changes . " The skin soaks in the urine sometimes half a day , sometimes overnight . The longer you soak it , the softer it gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she sudsed it in the water and then cooled off the water and then put the skin in it . Then she puts aspen shavings in the water and cools it off , then you rinse it in clear water and wring it out . My mother used a towel to absorb the water . I asked her one time in camp , ' What did you use when you did n't have cloth ? ' She said they used dried moss . And then you put it on a smooth board , stick it there , the inside facing in . Then when it dries , it will just peel off itself . You store it away , and when you are ready to use it , you wet the shavings that you saved , and you pad them onto the fishskin on the outer side . Then you roll it and leave it until it dries . Then you shake it off .

@@25139164 @5139164/ 48620 @qwx248620 <p> As requested by " Chester " here is my voice with support FOR the area to be turned into a conservation area and not be fished by either the free anglers or a club . <p> The free stretch in Durham City Centre , for those who are unfamiliar with this part of the river , is situated just below Framwellgate weir , a formidable obstruction to any migratory fish , especially in low water . For about 150 yards downstream salmon and sea trout congregate , waiting to run the river . For years it has been a magnet for poachers , the Environment Agency have battled the snatchers and have achieved many convictions . <p> This stretch is also plagued by many dubious anglers , who although fishing legitimately , using spinners , worm , shrimp , and fly , hound the poor salmon and sea trout day and night . I have witnessed this happen over many years , and it makes me ashamed . <p> I for one welcome this conservation area giving some respite to dwindling numbers of migratory fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable area to be left free , just not the pool(s) where the fish lie in their hundreds waiting for fresh water . Instead of complaining we should be applauding , and I am sure this goes for all conservation minded and caring anglers . <p> I am not a member of the Wear Anglers Association but I do fish the Wear below the free stretch , so can not be accused of wanting the fish to clear the hurdle of the Weir so I can have a crack at them myself . But in all reality do we not all want the fish to be able to get through the Weir and do their business in the top parts of the river ? <p> The very same can be said about Chester le street water below the dam there . When the river is low for long periods the pools there are hammered every day , especially the Buckles pool.This past season being a very good example . And you could also say this about a lot of beats below dams and weirs . Is it not the Weirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others below Hexam on the Tyne that makes them such good venues ? ? . As for battling the snatchers , the bailiffs are a very rare sight most of the time.This past season I had my license checked twice . The worst part about all this is how Underhand it was brought about . There was no mention of any meetings about any of this to the anglers that fished the stretch to give them the chance to put any argument against it . <p> This is my fishing rod ! . There are many like it but this one is mine . Without me , my rod is useless ! . Without my rod , i am useless ! . <p> I do n't understand the terminology on some of these posts . the terms " honest angler " and " legitimate angler " as opposed to " dubious angler " or even " poacher " . if it 's free water how can you be a poacher ? how do you become a dubious angler , by using worm , prawn or spinning perhaps ? free water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there a list of rules displayed showing what can and can not be done . if I netted it would I be a poacher or carrying out an unlawful act . I am not actually stealing . I think the underlying thread is anglers are not as honourable as posts on this forum try to imply and this spot reflects this . it 's a free for all and all the bad parts of angling are on show . I have seen this on a number of rivers where there are no rules in place and if you took the compulsory catch and release away you would soon see these " dubious " methods appear . <p> The Weir they refer to is N of the A690 road bridge . The fish pass you can see on Google has been extended and improved to encourage more fish to move up in lower flows . The water around the footbridge ( to the N of the Weir ) fishes in higher flows too , iI do n't think it 's all about low water . <p> From the outside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMO does indeed look very much like sour grapes . <p> To try to justify this on the basis of conservation is ridiculous . As usual there is absolutely no evidence that catching fish on the free stretch has any effect on stocks of fish in the river . Had the EA suggested either closure or method restrictions on the rest of the river for ' conservation purposes ? ' I suspect there would have been a very different response . <p> Surely there were a range of other options which could have been considered before folk turned their fire on fellow fishermen ? <p> ' No fishing ' heights or days , restrict the season , conduct Joint club and EA baliffing , increase the ' No fishing ' area below the weir , 100% C&amp;R even etc . <p> Some people are far too quick to call for a ban on anything they do n't like . <p> Sad to see this happen , Bushy . I 'm another one who has not only enjoyed but admired your fishing prowess and dogged determination in all conditions . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sport and not people like myself , what Compy used to call " cheque-book " fishermen , and to see your bit of water that you have learned your craft on restricted to you is very sad . I hope as one door closes another opens for you .

@@25139173 @5139173/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> Sunray Shadow - The History and the making . <p> There are many great flies invented thru out times . The one that always seems to find its way in to my fly box , is the Sunray Shadow . <p> The Sunray Shadow , is in my opinion one of the most famous tube flies ever made . It was designed by late UK angler Mr. Raymond Brooks in the 1960s . And if you ask me , The Sunray Shadow is a must-have for anglers pursuing fresh Silver Salmon in any river . <p> Brooks Sunray Shadow is a mythical fly and has a special room in my salmon fly box . In the early 1960s Ray traveled through Norway to find the perfect salmon river . He did so with his wife Margit , and eventually they found the rivers in the districts of Mre ( Moere ) and Romsdal , where they fished for many years . <p> Every summer the Brooks would fish the fantastic River +ry ( Aaroy ) , the river that held the highest average weight of salmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majestic River Lrdal ( Laerdal ) that runs to the Sognefjord . A river that had a historic run of big Atlantic Salmon and Sea-Trout . <p> It was exactly on the bank of the River Lrdal in Norway , that the Sunray Shadow originally was created . Like most fly tiers Ray was always looking around to develop his fishing and fly tying . One evening in a friends cabin , Rays eye caught a rug in the living room , a rug with long black hair . Ray took a piece from a ball pen and tied the long smooth hair on it bingo ! The simple tube with the long hair was made . The rug was made from Monkey hair and it turned out to be exactly right for the long wing . Soft enough to make the fly come alive and stiff enough , not to collapse in the stream . Even more so , the monkey hair would sometimes become a little curly when it got wet . <p> Very fast Ray found the fly to be extremely efficient and quickly developed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white-tipped squirrel , monkey hair and peacock herl . The stiff squirrel would lift the long wing free of the hook , the monkey would create the very long mobile wing and the herl would accent the fly . <p> Ray found a supplier of the monkey hair needed for production and finally also made a registered pattern on the fly that he named : The Sunray Shadow . <p> The Sunray Shadow fly was tied commercially for the Brooks family by Danish company Lawcock and later with fly tiers in Singapore . <p> The picture here below shows the original packing . <p> Sunray Shadow very quickly became extremely popular and widespread , since the little tube with the monkey hair proved so efficient . Today the fly is made in numerous variations all over the world . <p> The inspiration for the Sunray Shadow came essentially from The Collie Dog Fly - perhaps the ultimate smaller salmon fly . The Collie Dog is just a bunch of black hair from a Collie 's tail on a tube , invented somewhere in the UK in the eighteenth century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , the stiff under wing , the herl and the most essential - the long Colobus monkey hair for the long wing . The Sunray Shadow was born ! <p> The Sunray Shadow is an extremely simple and efficient fly . It does the job with a minimum of extras . The fly is a long , black monkey hair wing on a tube with a stiff underwing like polar bear ( my choice ) , to keep it from hooking itself and then a little flash . <p> Upside ! The Sunray Shadow is not a big challenge to tie , and if you are a beginner to tube flies , this is a very good place to start . <p> Tie the fly on a 1 1 + inch plastic tube . Tie in a small bunch of squirrel , bucktail or polar bear wich is slightly longer than the tube . Top that with the colobus monkey hair . For the finish , tie in a couple of peacock herl on the wing and you are all set . You can add a cone head if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brass or bottle tube . Many will prefer to fish the light version in the top of the water , which will give the fly more speed . As with any other salmon fly , you will like to have a selection of the Sunray Shadow in various sizes from around 3 " to 6 " inches long hair wings . <p> Some claim , that the Salmons reaction to a Sunray Shadow is similar to a cats instinctive behavior to flash out a paw on a string that is flicked in front of it , it simply ca n't help it . It just instinctive reaction . The Sunray Shadow with Colobus monkey hair is a legendary Salmon fly ! <p> I will also be chasing the silver dream this season and the Sunray Shadow will once again be a trusted friend in the river . <p> If you like information about where to find monkey hair , i will be happy to provide - just ask <p> What do you mean by the ultimate smaller fly when describing the collies dog and it wasn , t tied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is from the long feather hair from the hind legs up to 8 or 9 inches in length , thought to have been invented on the Brora but fished on the Thurso and the Helmsdale as far back as the 1800 , s . <p> What do you mean by the ultimate smaller fly when describing the collies dog and it wasn , t tied with the hair from the tail of the collie , it is from the long feather hair from the hind legs up to 8 or 9 inches in length , thought to have been invented on the Brora but fished on the Thurso and the Helmsdale as far back as the 1800 , s . <p> Dear Mr. reelit1 <p> I apretiate any kind of knowlege you might have on the matter . <p> The post is mainly regarding the Sunray Shadow . <p> I do n't  know much about the Collie dog and the lenght of hair on the tail or the rear legs - i have no exact knowledge .

I have many times seen monkey hair in this lenght . My personal opinion is , that 3 - 7 inches is long enough . <p> I will try and dig up more but the collie dog was used on the Highland Rivers where they used it when backing up the pools , the long hair used to be kept for the ghillies when the sheep were clipped at the same time the dogs were given their annual clip you seldom see the collies with long hair now as they are bred smaller and a lot have been crossed with the smooth haired collie the last long hair I got sent to me from Dumfries from my granduncle who was a shepherd and still bred the large long haired collies for the hill.He moved back up here when he retired at 79 and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only got one crop from the dog before he sold him , my grand uncle died just a few years ago at 90 with cancer.but he never said who he sold the dog to , you never know his offspring might be out there some where . <p> i 'm with reelit , ...... i only ever seen it as a slight variant of the collie dog which had been fished in the Highlands of Scotland long before a sunray appeared on scene . <p> As i write - " Ray Brooks just enhanced the Collie Dog Fly with some materials , the stiff under wing , the herl and the most essential - the long Colobus monkey hair for the long wing .

These switch rods are trout rated so you can spey cast &amp; overhead cast as and when you please .

Others prefer heavier lines loading the rod up with their slower casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that the old AFTM ratings advised recommended overhead casting weight and spey casting weight .

Glasgow angling , half price 50 ... do it <p> I would also stick to the guideline rating . The 5wt switch multi tip is a 17g head . <p> My lxi 6/7 is rated for 17-19g and I use a 17g head with it and that 's for me the perfect setup . As Eminem said , with a quick application of the bottom hand , you can Spey cast very long distance if necessary with light lines . And I also agree the lpxe or lxi in this weight range should be rather looked as single hander that can be double handed Spey cast rather than small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet spot for your casting stroke is to buy a spool of amnesia as a running line ( some few ) , a #8 caimore voodoo shooting head ( 23g 30ft , less than 10 ) . If the setup is too heavy , trim the back of the head 1g after 1g until you find it . <p> Also remember that the light switch rods are very sensitive to the diameter of the running line . If too thick , the running line drags the head .

Wading is tricky as someone has suggested above but def worth a go . Silver salmos chucked across the tail of the pool immediately above the hut works really well too if no success on the fly . Bob and Ernie ( Stobhall ghillies ) will put you right . Good luck .

I believe myself that the rivers have changed drastically and we must change too to get better results . <p> I still like to tie patterns a lot of the time , just because I enjoy doing it .

My ' fishing ' flies are quite a bit different to the patterns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep it going .. on the subject of floss bodies , I noticed GaryW and KGM to name a few posting a while ago about tying floss bodies over flat silver and even tippex to make the colours stand out more . Usually I use underbodies of white thread ( a tip I took from one of Lamson 's posts ) and a fine double coat of floss , but interested if anyone uses the tipper/silver or any other approach and how well they work ? <p> I find that thread or floss underbody will darken when wet so use and opaque covering for the hook , like Tinsel or Tippex , when tying light coloured floss or dubbed bodies as it does n't go dark and also there is minimal extra bulk . Tying like this makes a huge difference with floro butts or bodies . I think it was gt05254 who posted about this some time ago with pictures . <p> Regards Gary Fishing for 60 years and am still trying to understand why I do it , but I love misunderstandings <p> This is n't something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest . Then again I ca n't think of many floss bodied flies that I use myself . Like FP , most of my own shrimps have seals fur bodirs . <p> If I 'm tying a fly to show on the forum or that , I will use white thread under some colours of seals fur . If I 'm tying for myself I will just use whatever colour of thread I am using for the head . <p> I will almost always use white thread under tinsel bodies , especially silver , just in case I miss a turn and leave a gap . A red or black underbody showing through silver tinsel is very unsightly . This is n't as big a problem for me now since I started tying the tinsel in at the middle leaving two layers of tinsel. 48621 @qwx248621 <p> Mainly the same as the rest have mentioned , i 'll try and match the tone of the fly with the main thread and change for the head if necessary ... white is a great universal thread colour so a good stock always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where i use it on a body but find most other flosses do n't respond well to it ... rookie mistake that one <p> That 's just when I 've time .... come July I 'll hope to be rattling around in old cigar boxes for what 's left of the winter top up trying to replace what ever size it is I 've been sticking up trees and finding uni 6/0 black a very attractive option

When i spoke with the guy in the shop he said " according to the specs from Shakespear the 8/9 was rated for 390gr Scandi " ( although he did n't  seem to convincing ) but he could n't find what spec was given for the Skagit head , , well i bought a 450gr Skagit and took it out today for a throw and something is not quite right hmmmm .. I 'd say i 'm a fairly decent single handed caster having been fishing more than 25 years although i 'm a novice in the Switch Rod/ double handed department , , having said that , you just know when something is not quite right , , i had 10ft of T11 on along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something is not quite right , , it feels as if the head is too light , , when i looked on the plastic packet earlier ( its an Airflow ) it says 6#7 so i assume that the head is meant for a 6#7 rod ? ? <p> Doest anyone out there know what size of Skagit Head is recommended for an 113 Oracle 8/9 switch Rod and while i 'm on the subject What weight Scandi would you recommend as well .. <p> Assuming the rot is rated for 8/9 salmon lines as opposed to 8/9 trout ones then 450 grains is too light . An 8/9 skagit line would be more in the 550grain region , this weight can vary +/- 50grns depending on the rod and the caster . <p> For a scandi style shooting head I would start in the region of 30 grams , again +/- 2g , it is also important to use a head of the correct length , that would be in the region of 2.5-3x the rod length . <p> These suggestions are only a rough guide , it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to you watching your casting . <p> On another note , I do find the US use of grains unhelpful mind you , always have to check the conversion to grams ! One of the Mars probes crashed into Mars due to a km - miles mix up ! Wish they 'd move into the 21st century . <p> I think that the Shakespeare Switch rods are rated as single handed rods and therefore a 7/8 rod would use a #6 double handed line . I use a #6/7 AFS shooting head and it works well for spey casting , but is too heavy for overhead where I use a #8 single handed line . <p> The switch rod is designed for fishing floating and intermediate lines in low water and is not designed for heavy flies and fast sinking tips with a skagit in cold fast water . Therefore in high water you should use say a 13ft rod with the skagit line , but the Oracle switch will cast a 450-475 grain skagit if absolutely necessary . <p> Looks like im going to have to keep an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i kinda guessed it was your typical " can of worms " sort of subject with a lot of " buts , ifs and maybes " regarding line ratings/rods/AFTM Skagit v Scandi etc etc .. <p> I will put it down to my inexperience at spey casting and just keep practising to find my feet , , i suppose things were a little awkward anyway with me casting from the bank as i was trying to make all sorts of un natural adjustments.Most time ive watched spey casting it was always with someone standing in the river and not by the bank . <p> If I were you I would definitely look at the Rio SSVT and look at the video on Youtube ( search Simon Gawesorth SSVT ) . The line is suited to both spey and overhead casting and will handle Mow/iMow tips in T10 and fairly heavy flies in the #9 rated line . <p> As Alan says you need to ascertain what the rod 's rating is , Single or Double handed .

Spoiled for choice trout fishing in that part of the world ! <p> T <p> Yes .. The Wharfe and Upper Aire ( do n't tell anyone about the Upper Aire though ) are great fly fishing rivers . In fact I was up at Bell Busk rabbit shooting in late August and I saw two guys fishing above the bridge looking up to the weir . I 'm sure you 'll know here I mean Tommy and I went to have a word with them . They were both Italian and they 'd had two days at Bolton Abbey and a day on Coniston Cold . They rated it very highly and for the size of the river the trout go to a fair size . Should you hit a shoal of Grayling then a 1.5lbr is standard as you 'll know.It 's finding them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next year they 've just disappeared ! ! Good luck for the future Tommy . <p> Well , apparently we 're having the coldest winter in BC for many years . With day time temperatures consistently in the -8 to -16 range , the Skeena and most of its tributaries are frozen over . Any day when the temperature is -5 or warmer has been an opportunity to grab a rod and get out there ! <p> The Kalum has stayed surprisingly ice free and given the lack of other options has been seeing a fair amount of angling pressure . I 've been lucky enough to meet a couple of great local guys who 've been kind enough to take me out and show me the ropes . <p> Surpisingly enough , when we have managed to get out , the fishing 's been excellent . One pool in particular , has yielded six fish in six trips to our group . The best of which was a cracking fish of well over 20lbs . My best so far is an eighteen pounder that stopped the fly dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A few days ago , having tied my first steelhead fly at a local class , I was persuaded to venture out in -11 ! Even applying Vaseline to the rod rings only allowed about 15 casts before ice clearance was needed ! Concentrating as much on survival as fishing , I crawled my creation through THE LIE in the pool and a fish absolutely smashed it . When it took me 50 yards into the backing on the first run I was convinced I was attached to a beast ! How wrong I was . 5 minutes a later a fresh hen fish of around 7lbs came to the beach . I just could not believe that a fish that size could fight like that . My smallest fish since the move but definitely my favourite ! <p> Other pools have yielded two lost fish both taking on the dangle . The second of which I was convinced was a bull trout when it took meekly and came straight towards me when gentle pressure was applied . It quickly disabused me of that notion when , spying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river and smashed the leader against some rocks . <p> In these temperatures , two or three pools is plenty of fishing so I 've not had the opportunity to prospect other places too much as yet . Temperatures are on their way into positive figures next week so I 'm hoping to make the most of it ! Will let you know how I get on . <p> With the weather warming to around 2 or 3 degrees , I 've managed two half day trips , and a full today , since my last post . <p> The two half days were sobering affairs . The first due to leaking waders and the second due to a failed wader repair ! Cold , fishless and with a strong upstream wind making casting challenging . In each case , a boot full of icy water made an early finish a necessity . <p> Today on the otherhand was an absolute joy . The kind of day to squirrel away in your memory to keep you going on days like those described above . <p> The air was crisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cloud . <p> Armed with a new pair of waders , I waded across the river and hiked around two miles upstream . <p> On the way , I bumped into another angler and we chatted for twenty minutes or so before going our separate ways . He was kind enough to give me a couple of flies ( thanks Mat ! ) and when I lost my black and blue tube half way down a promising looking tail out , I thought I 'd give one of them a swim . Around four or five casts later , the fly was skirting the riffle when I felt a series of decidedly fishy plucks at the fly . Everything went solid and then all hell broke loose . Ten minutes later , I was staring down at a beautiful , coloured buck of around 15lbs . <p> The rest of the day passed without any further offers but a chance never felt far away . The missing piece in my casting fell into place , and I had a nice rhythm going all day . <p> Days like today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this warm ( ! ) weather holds both the Copper and Lakelse rivers should open up for fishing . I 'm looking forward to the Lakelse in particular and will let you know how I get on . <p> On on a different note , I 've recently read two books by one of the doyens of steelhead fishing , Lani Waller . As technical works , I would rate them only below Falkus ' salmon and sea trout books ; that is to say , outstanding . Where Waller is truly sensational , however , is writing about why we fish and the experience of fishing . The best I 've read since Norman McClean in A River Runs Through It . He has that great writers gift of being able to articulate things that at some level you 've always known to be true but have never been able to express . <p> Anyway , as this post seems to have taken a turn for the philosophical , this is me signing out ! <p> Wow - keep those reports coming , it sounds idyllic . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but fell in love with the place ! Most of us could n't imagine living in Terrace .. I am lucky enough to tag a day on a business trip to the Olympic Peninsula in a month and I ca n't wait . But the Skeena will break the bank this year so a return is not on the cards til 2018 but my word what a place to fish . Steelhead on a Spey rod is one of life 's ' must do 's but I have not yet paid my dues yet despite 5 days of praying . Keep those reports coming , thanks for sharing and tight lines JJ <p> Managed another trip out on Wednesday to the Kalum . An overcast day with temperatures around 2 degrees but with a strong upstream wind making things feel much colder . <p> No fish to report despite being on the water from sun up to just before dusk . I did , however , see my first beaver in the river which brightened things up . I had the river pretty much to myself which did make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Too small a sample size yet to draw any conclusions , but I 'm beginning to wonder whether there is a correlation between fishless days and upstream winds . Most of my fishless days so far have featured upstream winds but I 'm drawing no conclusions for the time being . Would be interested in other people 's views on this . <p> A couple of general observations : <p> 1 . In cold conditions , no matter how well wrapped up I am , I find taking a flask of coffee makes a huge difference . Particularly when you 've just waded down a long run and your feet and legs are beginning to feel numb , a coffee gets your core temperature up and keeps you out on the river . Appreciate this is probably stating the obvious ! <p> 2 . Fishing regularly with heavy tips and cone head flies has made a real difference to my casting . When fishing lighter set ups some of your flaws are not as heavily punished . In my case , often setting the d loop slightly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line on the water in the D. I 've had to make real adjustments and am casting far better as a result ( although not anywhere near the standard of the many real experts who frequent this forum ! ) . <p> The Copper and Lakelse are still out of commission due to huge build ups of ice caused by the recent big freeze . I 'm told by the local experts that the bulk of the winter steelhead run is unlikely to materialise until the ice build ups lower down the Skeena have cleared . <p> Working UK hours does n't always feel like such a great idea when I 'm hauling myself out of bed at 2am in the morning . It does mean though that when work is quiet I can be on the river by 10am so it 's not all bad ! <p> We had torrential rain on Friday night that bought the Copper and the Kalum up by two or three feet on Saturday and meant no fishing was possible the whole weekend . I thought today might be worth a look though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The river was still up over a foot and my normal wade across to the other bank was not worth the risk . It was probably doable with a wading staff but I had n't bought one with me . It was a little disheartening to see my favourite pool looking in perfect order and totally out of reach ! <p> Black and blue seems to be working very well for our group at the moment , so I tied on a four inch long black and blue tube that I 'd tied myself the previous day . My fly tying is still pretty rudimentary but tying two or three flies a day means I 'm making decent progress with it . <p> When I arrived here I had a misconception that most of the steelhead would be held up in the bellies of the pools at this time of the year . I 'm told this is n't right at all and while you 'll hook the odd one in the deep stuff the most productive areas are the shallower tail outs . My own limited experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around two thirds of the fish I 've hooked have been in the tails . <p> Generally the fish seem to want the fly fished pretty slowly and with the heavy flows today it was often necessary to make at least one big upstream mend and then keep the rod tip seven or eight feet up to hold the running line out of the current to maintain a nice slow swing . I was doing just that through the tail of a pool when a series of small pulls suddenly developed into solid contact . In the heavy current the fish made a series of heavy runs before I was finally able to bring a fish of around 9lbs to the bank . Very pleased !

Here there is legitimate kelt fishery . The fishermen during this kelt fishery have no expectations of nailing a springer because we do n't see fresh fish until the end of May . Typically after the kelts have emptied the river , there is a lull in the action before the springers start arriving . I understand you can catch a dozen or more kelts per day . Some anglers would retain a fish or two but the vast majority are now released . Kelts are typically fished from boats in a harling fashion using large ( 2/0 ) streamers that imitate the smelts they are feeding on . Sink tip or full sinking lines are required . <p> While I sound like an expert , I am not as I have never fished for kelts but I know a ton of chaps who do . <h> Beautiful Tour ! <p> What a wonderful string of images you 've provided to those of us who may not get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the salmon are there other species in that river in numbers making them a target for the fly ? <p> What a wonderful string of images you 've provided to those of us who may not get to ride that river ourselves . I have a question , beside the salmon are there other species in that river in numbers making them a target for the fly ? <p> Ard <p> Hardy Reels - Hello ! The Miramichi to date , luckily is still a river that has only its native species . There are four sport fish . In the tidal portion with occasional upriver visits we have striped bass . The Northwest Miramichi has a spawning population , and is one of only three verified spawning locations in Canada . There are shad , a sort of large herring that come in early June along with the run of the river herring or gasperaux . These are great jumpers , but getting one on a fly is not easy in the Miramichi . <p> Other than salmon the most important species are brook trout . Brook trout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in many ways are similar to either Arctic char or Dolly Varden . The Miramichi is actually a very good brook trout destination . We have some sea-run fish that on occasion get as large as 6 or 7 pounds , but these are rare . Every stream that feeds into the Miramichi , Cains , or other tributaries has a population of brook trout that normally grow up to about 14 inches in size . Larger fish are there , but they are relatively rare . The main stem of the Miramichi gets too warm to support these fish in mid summer , but in late May , early June , or again after mid-September the brookies can be really numerous and in some places - like the Cains - become a nuisance as they jump all over your salmon flies . <p> There 's a fine line between fishing and just standing on the shore like an idiot .

It 's quite hard to explain but here goes . The general feel for it is this , you ca n't die Black to white , because black is a darker tone than white .

@@25139210 @5139210/ 48620 @qwx248620 <p> First get some dapping floss . You can attach to backing on a spare spool or just attach it to an existing fly line on a spool . You only need 30 ' max. knotted every couple of feet , with 5 ' nylon attached to the fly . Best on a long rod say 15+ ' <p> Basically only the floss extends out the top ring , the wind does the rest . Well not really .... the skill is to have your fly skipping / dancing through the waves , without drowning either floss or fly . Constant attention is required to adjust rod position to prevailing conditions . Can be very exciting ..... the sight of a 5lb sea trout coming up and turning on a dapped fly will live with you forever . <h> Dapping <p> Ahhh dapping , simply the easiset way to major heart failure ever invented for anglers <p> I would n't entirely disagree with the previous replies to this topic except to say the following : <p> Keep your blowline ( Bob Church or Spinnaker dapping floss is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do use a rod meant for the purpose , whilst you can use other rods the extra length and softer action of a dapping rod is part of the key to success . <p> The stronger the wind - the bigger the fly The lighter the wind - switch back to the fly rod <p> Keep leader length to no more than 2ft , you 'll have far more control over the fly and , in truth , the fish do n't mind one jot . At the other end tie on 15-20yds of nylon this will allow you to fish at distance and trust me takes are generally more confident the further you are from the boat . <p> Do fish at range .... if the wind allows . The further away from the boat a fish takes the quicker the ' strike ' to set the hook , the closer the fly is the boat the longer the ' strike ' . Forget the old maxim " God save the Queen " and substitute with " Bloody Hell " - I find that works well for me <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the very very best quality materials to tie them - shop bought dapping flies generally belong in the bin . <p> Use the best floatant you can find and treat your dapping flies like royalty - the better you look after them the better they will reward you . <p> If the wind is really strong I used to put a dropper in the leader and fish the dap fly on that and a " chaser " . The chaser kept the dap sitting on the water or just hovering above . The chaser I used and success on was a teal blue and silver tied on a half inch waddington . <p> 15 ft rod with fairly through action is on the button . It gets the job done and is far more enjoyable to hold than a 17ft stick all day long with your arms raised .

@@25139223 @5139223/ 48620 @qwx248620 <p> I 've tried both . The Zephrus most definitely has more feel . The tip is softer , its still fast , but has move flex so I found I could ' feel ' the line more when casting less than the ' full Wang ' . Being fast it recovers very well so the loops were still stable . It is a cracking rod . But , at 720 ( applying the 20 percent off you should get if you ask ) its a lot of money . There are new 14 6 zeniths on eBay for 440 at the moment . <p> Had the zenith and replaced it with the zephrus . The zephrus is a more enjoyable rod to fish with IMO and is much more comfortable with spey lines . Like the zenith , it is outstanding with shooting heads . No real difference in terms of distance but I 'd say a day fishing with the zephrus is a more pleasant experience . 
@@25139224 @5139224/ 48620 @qwx248620 <p> I have used a 10ft #8 for salmon and it is well suited . You might want to do some research for the right line to help you turn over larger salmon flies . There is plenty of advise in this forum on lines . Perhaps look at the Barrio lines which are highly praised and affordable . <p> The only problem you may have would be if you hook into a large and energetic fish as the 10 footer can be a little underpowered if that were to happen .

You should be fine with a 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tungsten , brass or conehead will be quite a different story .

Great fun with the roll casts with minimal effort . I actually find the casting great fun and forget about the actual task at hand sometimes ! <p> A single hander of 7 or 8 weight will cover most of the Welsh Dee comfortably .

Assuming there is a little bit of nylon showing , grab it with pointed nose pliers . Get hold of the collar on the poly leader between your thumb nail and forefinger . Pull the collar back about 10mm so it causes a concertina effect ( which means the coating has separated from the nylon ) . Grip the top of the concertina bit between thumb nail and forefinger and pull , it will separate and pull off the end of the nylon . Repeat in 10mm strips until you have enough nylon exposed . Or you could just loop the coated nylon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and ninety percent how you respond to it Hidden Content <p> Acetone ( nail varnish remover will work ) I usually just use my finger nails . However an alternative is to use nylon leader . Tie a loop , say a perfection loop , in your nylon , feed the other end of your nylon throught that loop .

@@25139252 @5139252/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> When would i use waddington style flies <p> hairy - I 'm a little baffled that no one has taken a crack at this . Maybe its a bit basic for those who have grown up with Waddingtons . I fish salmon mostly in Canada - though I have been coming to Scotland in the spring , and will be again in 2009 . It was in Scotland that I learned about the fly . Waddington himself theorized that by the design of the salmon 's mouth it fed on relatively long , slim baitfish like squid and sandlance . The extend length of the Waddington shank allowed him to tie a long fly and locate a hook at the end of it to stop short strikers . Also , the hook to shank joint is fairly flexible - I actually use Partridge big mouth doubles connected to the shank with spectra line - and so you do not have the likelihood of your hook being pryed out of the fish as you would with a long shanked hook . There are certain flies that really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allys Shrimp , and long , hairy flies like that are the ones . I think the long slim profiles are attractive to fish in high and/or cold water and produces more strikes than shorter flies . One might ask what the benefit of the Waddington is compared to a tube , and my view would be first in the top and bottom orientation maintained by the front up eye design of the shank , and the fact that the material is tied to the shank like a regular fly . A tube can spin around and lose this orientation . Also , long tubes , especially ones of heavy material become a little unwieldly . You can extend a tube with the plastic junction tubing , but it does n't tend to stay as straight and that can cause twists when in the current . <p> I would suggest the lack of replies is because no-one can think of a good answer , myself included . <p> A fly tied on a Waddington shank can vary in length from under 1 " to over 3 " and would fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weight . As such if you wished you could use them at any time of the year and at any water height . <p> At no time in a season do I feel compelled to use Waddys , infact I never use them prefering tubes instead . Some people do n't  like spinning with Tobies because they think the fish can lever the hook out due to the articulation between the lure and the hook , I feel the same about Waddingtons shanks , hence my preference for tubes over Waddington shanks . <p> I use them , leaverage is not a problem as i use a bit of shrink tube over the hook connection retaining flexibilty , this means i can change a hook if required though it is too fiddly for the bank . Metal framed waddingtons replace light snake flies when sea trouting in faster / deeper runs . yet retain a slimmer appearance than tubes , though i also use tubes . <h> " leverage " can be an issue , but easily over come . <p> Waddies have become fairly popular here in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major difference is few folks actually use a hook connected in the lower ring . <p> ' The Norm ' is to rig them ( hook wise ) the same way you 'd do a tube fly : leader through the upper eye , down the side of the Waddie , through a bit of tubing , tie on hook and slide hook eye/tube over the bottom ring . <p> As the leader DOES NOT go through the lower ring , the fly will pop off and slide up the leader with ' the take ' ala a tube fly . <p> I do n't think that there is any situation where I have ever felt compelled to use a Waddington . There are times though when I have felt that perhaps a Waddington might swim better or simply behave better in the flow I am fishing than a tube alternative .

This once shrunk gives a firm inflexable connection and keeps the hook straight in line with the shank at all times , even when playing a fish . Sometimes though fish will chew on the fly while being played and as a result waste it . Another alternative is to attach a treble in the same fashion as you would a treble to a tube . I pass the nylon through the front eye of the shank , then through a piece of tubing and then tie on the treble .

@@25139254 @5139254/ 48620 @qwx248620 <p> Ca n't see any reason why a salmon would n't take a legered worm . The problem , for me , with ledgered worms is that they tend to be great favourites of Eels . I confess I 've never caught a salmon on a static worm . I have often had the slimey ones pick up the bait when it comes to a halt . However , it is normal on the Tay when fishing the boat to have several casts from one spot so the bait is presented several times over the fish in a way that is less common than with fly or spinner . So in one sense the bait is kept in one area , by repeated casting , similar to ledgering . <p> In all my days of fishing the worm i have only ever caught 1 fish whilst ledgering and this was by sheer accident , put the rod down to answer the call of nature , came back and hey presto fish on . unfortuneately the worms were over the throat which i know happens quite regularly whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fish worm would be as follows . 1 . Low water . light rod , usually a single handed fly rod with fixed spool reel attatched loaded with either a good braid or 8lb maxima and at the business end a small pennal tackle ( size 10 , s ) and a single brandlin . This method has brought me 2 salmon of 11lb and over 50 seatrout ( avg 3lb ) this season . The bait is fished trotting style and any takes are struck almost immediatly ala fly fishing style by just lfting the rod and tightening into the fish ( no need to whack the rod into the air as if you were trying to pull the fishes head off ) great sport . When using this method 99% of all fish hooked are hooked in the mouth or scissors thus can be easyilly unhooked and returned . 2a . Medium to high water . 11 or 12ft spin/bait rod , fixed spool loaded with either 12 , 15 or 18lb maxima , size 2 , 4 or 6 kamisan B980 single hook and 2 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the hook exposed ( my preference ) . Again the bait is trotted along the bottom and on feeling the initial take i ( depending on the flow of the river ) will either drop the rod tip and wait for another bump then lift ( slow water ) , or take a step forward feel the bump and lift ( fast or streamy water ) . the only drawback when using this method is that you will on occassions get fish that are deep hooked so not the best method for early spring when kelts are about or late autumn when lots of coloured fish are present . 2b.The big rod . bait/spin rod of 12ft , or double handed fly rod to 16ft , fixed spool as in 2a and the pennal tackle with size 8 ( B980 , s ) and single blackhead. this method is particulary handy in boulder strewn rivers where short accurate placement of cast is needed , ( double hander takes a bit of getting used to but worth the effort ) . again the bait is fished trotting style close or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift into it tightening the line and result , hopefully a nice sea liced 20lber hooked in the scissors . Tight lines SN <p> I have caught only 3 fish on a worm and only one was what i would call ledgered . <p> The other 2 where both weighted but " bounced " along the bottom into the lie that i was trying to fish . <p> The one that was ledgered was cast and weighted and posistioned into a salmon lie and i basically waited for the fish to take the bait . I knew the fish was there and i knew my worm was there or there abouts on its nose . <p> So if you know where the lies are and can posistion your worm in it you can just leave it there and see ! ! ! <p> I 'm not skilled with the worm at all so this could all have been pot luck but then again is n't that what salmon fishing is about <p> Aye loon but I reckon ye will be giein ' it large next season and haulin ' then oot eh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' what a fuishie looks like Hope you use the forum during the close season to keep up yourself up to speed with what 's going on . <p> great bit of info SN . I have caught slamon when the river is low but all have been on a small bunch of brandlings say ( 3 or 4 worms ) . but was always told that brandlings where too small for salmon fishing to use singly will definetly be trying it next season as your catch rate is impressive . Just out of interest what is your local river SN ? I fish the river leven in dunbartonshire .

The pictures are incredible with most of the ground being thickly covered with snow . They say this is the first time in 26 years that they have canceled the 2nd week .

We had cold dry northerly and easterly air for weeks on end , and only now has the block weakened to allow some rain in from the Atlantic . <p> The flip side has been the deflection of ' our ' normal moisture north towards the Arctic , leaving Norway and the Kola deep in snow and with lower than average temperatures for longer than normal .

@@25139280 @5139280/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> SFF Review - DTX Floating Shooting Head <p> Shooting heads for salmon fishing are more popular now than ever . The G2 range of DTX shooting heads is a fairly new addition to the Mackenzie DTX stable , this review will look at the 9/10 42g floater . <p> The spec on the Mackenzie website lists the 9/10 floater to be 42g over 12.5 the line sample measured exactly as specified . The welded loops on both ends are neat , small and appear very strong . Each line has a clear indication of both the line weight and density printed onto the loop sleeve . <p> DTX heads appear at first glance to have some unusual weighs for their given line ratings , the Mackenzie website explains this is due to the weight distribution within the head . Considering the length of the rear taper and the way the weight is distributed along the head I can see why they have arrived at these figures . The intention was to create a shooting head which was more stable during flight and more able to cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Casting <p> I have tried the DTX heads a couple of times on different rods but for the test I used my own AMC 133 - 8/9/10 rod as it is my everyday fishing and casting rod which I use with lots of different heads in this length/weight range . <p> I found the line was easy enough to cast and it loaded my rod well . At 42g I would say it loaded my rod just a bit more than a 38g 9/10 AFS would but not as much as the equivalent 42g 10/11 AFS . These findings would confirm that the weight is spread out differently to the AFS . I cast the head in two very different ways . Firstly , purely as a floater with an 18 tapered fluorocarbon leader and size 10 salar double . Secondly with a 10 Airflo ex super fast sink polyleader with a 6 18lb nylon leader and a cone head tube fly . <p> As a floater I felt the tip dominated the leader a bit too much , this was due to the 1.3mm tip diameter being bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line ( 1mm ) which of course this is n't ! I added a 7 intermediate tip and 10 of nylon and thing soon became as stealthy as I felt I needed . The head coped well with the ex fast poly and heavy fly , marginally better than an AFS would . The red colour of the line was a bit of a problem for me , this meant it disappeared a bit too quickly for me on overcast days or as the light faded , I found that on both the Tyne and Dee I could not see it as clearly on the water as I could with the more conventional coloured floaters we see . I have not used the head for casting against a head wind but have no doubt based on what I have already seen that if will cope well enough , the problem with wind lies more with casters than lines most of the time . <p> In conclusion <p> The DTX shooting head is a good product , it has no obvious vices and is priced sensibly to compete with its competition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was designed for and needs to do . If you plan to use it for top of the water fishing it will benefit from a short floating or slow intermediate poly leader to smooth the powerful turnover . On the other hand its the same powerful turnover which makes casting the sinking polyleaders easy . There is n't one line that will do everything perfectly but the DTX comes close enough if you do n't  mind the colour issues . <p> This line was supplied for review and can be purchased from Angling Active 
@@25139281 @5139281/ 48620 @qwx248620 <p> Yes . Send the bits back and get a credit . All you need are some tulip beads and treble hooks . Mount the Devon direct onto the leader material , they spin better . Sorry if that was not what you wanted to hear . <p> Just bought some stuff for making my own devon mounts ( from McHardys of Carlisle ) including some of their soft stainless mount wire <p> Any tips / tricks ? <p> or any SBS 's out there ? <p> Hi Piker , <p> I used to use plastic covered stainless steel wire and crimps . Carefully measure the length of wire you need from the treble connection to the point to the inner eye of the swivel ( hidden in the body of the devon - allowing for the tulip bead as well ) - with the outer eye just protruding outside of the devon mouth . Do take care getting this measurement right or you will waste a lot of material - this measurement will vary of course depending on the size of devon and tulip bead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double the wire over so the loose ends almost touched and secure them with 2/3 crimps ( coarse or sea which ever is cheapest ) . Nothing will shift that mount and it worked out quite cheap and was slim enough in diameter to allow the devon to spin freely . <p> PS - remember to slide down the tulip bead into place before crimping ! ! <p> If you are using thick single strand wire you can use a flyinc C wire forming tool to form loops connecetd to the treble and the swivel - again measure twice , cut once ! ! Ball bearing swivels are always better - try Yorkshire Game Angling ( also for anti kink vanes/or Mc Hardy 's ) . <p> Whilst the devon seems to have become a forgotten art and is a nice method of combing the water , I have found the Tadpole ( half devon/half flying C ) a more versatile and killing lure . Spintec sell the best quality imho . They can be cast upstream like a flying C and downstream like a devon - or use paternoster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers . And , when I returned to the ' dark side a bit last year putting my fly rod aside in higher water , they brought me a few fish when everything else was failing . <p> There is a step by step guide on on the internet which someone put on several years ago and is how I 've been making mine for the past 50 years . It shows exactly what bits and pieces you need and the tools required . <p> One piece of critical advice when selecting swivels . Always check the I 'd of the hole through the devon minnow . Nowadays the I 'd standard is 4mm , but it varies a lot with older devon minnows . The traditional swivel to use has always been a diamond eye rolling swivel and a size 8 with 65lbs test is what I 've always used . <p> If you want to make a lot , I have details of a specialist in London who sells spools of stainless steel wire in a variety of diameters at a very competative price ........ much cheaper than tackle shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Originally Posted by piker <p> A variety of feedback there <p> Mick - i actually have some of those tadpoles from years ago ( which i bought on a whim ) . Do they actually work " ! ? ! ? ? ! <p> iJames <p> By God they do - but cast around the clock and at varying depths ( use the floaters for paternostering ) to get the best out of them . They are also good hookers BUT I 'm going to use single circle hooks ( de-barbed ) when I spin in future ) . <p> As Mick says , cutting the wire to the correct length is critical and we 've devised a chart which tells us what length of wire is required for each length of devon minnow . Our formula is twice the length of the minnow plus 2.5 " and it 's essential to check the precise length of the minnow as many older ones come up a bit short , ie 3 " minnows measuring 2 7/8 " . <p> The only tools we use are some wire cutters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 6 " metal ruler . <p> I used to turn all my own Devon minnows and a Fife friend gave me the contraption below to make up the wire mounts . It uses the front end of a ( broken ) electric drill and the measurements were marked out for 1 " , 2 " etc . Handy bit of kit and easily made . Nowadays I prefer to use WD40 red tubes as per my photo below . No wire to worry about Mike

Dave Gordon may have further ( and certainly more expert ) info here , but I can say from own experience that I find that the cheaper Stormsure does exactly the same job as Aquasure yet is less viscous and therefore spreads on and soaks-in more easily . <p> The best sealant is aquasure , but without properly thinning it is is almost a waste of time , it has to be mixed with cotal 240 , and then it soaks in really well and takes a hell of a hold .

For all other jobs i use 25% aquasure and 75% cotal , this is an excellent sealant , it really soaks in <p> Stormsure is also good and also needs thinned .

I see loads of waders with aquasure repairs that do not work , the sealant is floating on the material , and water can weep slowly under the floating patch . In time it will leak properly or even lift . You will know if this is the case because the material under it does not look wet when the repair is dry ( i hope that makes sense ) Done properly the repair looks wet , and this is because the sealant has soaked right into the material , and it looks like the wader is wet . Like most things the preparation takes the time , sealing is easy ! <p> All the sealants have jobs they work well on and some they do less well . All the ones i have used need to be thinned down for use with waders as the material is very thin , a membrane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealing valves , repairing a zip or plugging a hole in neoprene either will be fine un thinned .

The tiny blue ones were the best I thought .

The reason i ask is im trying to get the timing right on when to be on the river at the right time instead of wasting my time . To be honest ive never had a salmon in dirty water but maybe that because i do n't  fish with any confidence . I appreciate any advice . Paul . <p> I 'm an absolute beginner but the first salmon I caught last year was in a semi tidal part of the ribble . The river was at 0.8m rising and it was almost dark . The fish was about 6lb and did n't  fight hard so I assume it was running . <p> Yes they will , depending on the height and power of water , some fish will stay back in pockets of slack water and rest . <p> I agree with this , they will run in " coloured " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debris floating downstream or if the river is so high that the water is very turbulent and fast flowing I really have my doubts that they will run . In a rising flood the worm can be deadly because fish are moving upstream but in a real banker there will come a time where it is just a waste o time . <p> Yes they will certainly run when the river is high and dirty , but they may or may not be in a taking mode . On the Dee during big spates I have watched fish moving slowly up stream - heading and tailing - just a yard or two from the bank . So in these conditions that is where you you should fish . I find something big and orange works . <p> IMHO. . . the stock answer is NO ! ! ! In a big dirty water full of sediment and flotsam I doubt many travel . However as soon as sediment starts to clear up they will push . It has been said to me that the sediment cloggs the salmons gills and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100% sure of that . On lower Tay estuary the visibility is practically zilch due to the shifting sand / mud . Salmon seem to run by there ok . Although the reason nets were so good on tay was the poor visibility meant salmon were even more oblivious to the threat of a net than in " normalish " visibility . I do recall one massive dirty spate right enough on Cargill in October when every one went home barring a weel kent mon frae Dumfries who nailed 6 or 7 in the lee of a bend ! ! ! ! ! when most were either home or bevvying with the ghillie. perhaps the water had just started to change . . . du n no ! !

My first experience of this was around 25 years ago fishing the Kintore beat of the River Don around late September when the water was high and dirty .

If at all possible , go to a shop , look carefully and try for fit wearing exactly what you are most likely to have underneath the jacket when fishing , including testing for freedom of movement . <p> The saga of how I wound up with a new 380 Patagonia jacket for 200 does n't bear retelling.

@@25139307 @5139307/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> SFF Review - Airflo Ridge running line . <p> For those interested in the shooting head style of salmon fishing the question of which running/shooting line is best crops up almost as often as questions about the shooting heads themselves . In this review I have chosen one of many available , Airflo Ridge running line . <p> This is the code number and description for the 30lb grey floating running line <p> The term ' Ridge ' is an interesting concept and as far as I know it is unique to Airflo . During the manufacturing process the line is no longer made in a way which results in an even circular profile , instead it appears under a microscope to look like this <p> A series of ridges around the lines circumference are intended to reduce the overall surface area in contact with the rod rings , in theory this should allow the line to shoot further than a line without ridges but of the same diameter . Airflo also claim the ridges help to reduce tangles when shooting . <p> The Airflo Ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense that it is based on a braided core with a polyurethane coating . At one end there is a large 9 " loop for connection to the shooting head , the other end is cut and needs to be joined to the backing with a suitable knot or braided loop . <p> The first thing I noticed about this running line when I put it onto a reel was just how slick it felt but that it was also quite thick as compared to other shooting lines . A quick check with a digital vernier revealed an average diameter of 1.02mm or 0.040 " . This is at the thickest end of shooting line diameters I have seen/used and typical of the running line diameter of an average spey line , that is n't always a bad thing and more of that later . The weld on the loop was very smooth and slim . <p> Field Test <p> In use this running line is very user friendly , it lies on the water with minimal memory and in most circumstances it floats very well . There will always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can drown a running line and from time to time this happened with the ridge line but no more than any other similar product . I liked the fact that I could figure of eight retrieve this line into my hand and when released onto the water it showed no signs of lasting memory . The 1.02mm diameter made it very easy to grip against the cork during a cast and it never slipped once during the testing with only a single finger applying minimal pressure . <p> Another impressive point I noticed was just how few tangles I got while casting . My longest casts were around 14-15 pulls which is around 42 ' -45 ' of running line . and with a 42 ' head and 15 ' leader gave casts to around the high 30yds , more than enough for my typical salmon fishing home and abroad . At a real push I could squeeze out some 40yd casts but I felt I was working harder than I wanted to . I noticed that the ridges hold onto water as you retrieve the line , this could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zips through the rings but equally it will make the line heavier so may hinder its progress , in truth I think one cancels the other out . The lubrication may however explain the lack of tangles ? <p> I used this line with heads of between 34g and 44g and it performed acceptable with all of them , I would say it shot better with the heavier heads , probably due to the diameter . <p> Conclusion <p> Airflo Ridge is certainly not the longest casting running line I have ever used but it is one of the very best behaved . I would consider this a good ' fishing ' running line as opposed to an ultimate distance casters line . The suppleness and lack of memory make fishing and managing the line very easy which is a real pleasure compared to fighting with some of those wiry mono type lines . The compromise is ultimate distance but if your salmon fishing is done to around 35yds and occasionally longer then its user friendliness would win me over every time . <p> Unless I was consistently fishing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this line for shooting heads of less than 30g . The larger than average diameter and subsequent resistance makes casting further a bit too much effort with these lighter heads . <p> Overall a very nice line which I would recommend to anyone who is new to shooting heads or to those who appreciate there is more to fishing these line systems than ultimate distance . Ease of use and good presentation have significant value to many , myself included . <p> This line was supplied for review and can be bought from Angling Active

@@25139309 @5139309/ 48620 @qwx248620 <h> Skagit - putting it all together by Blue Zulu <p> Although popular in the US , Skagit style fishing is slowly becoming more popular here in the UK . Basically it is a short heavy floating head that is used to carry fast sinking tips and large flies . Due to the weight of this set-up it is necessary to alter your casting style so that you do not overload your rod . Sustained anchor/waterborne anchor casts such as double spey , snap T , etc are used as a single spey or overhead cast may have disastrous results . A more through actioned rod and/or a more heavily constructed rod is ideal for Skagit . <p> This is what all the fuss is all about ! <p> Due to the thickness of a Skagit head it if difficult to find material to make your own head , so you will have to buy one . At the moment only a few manufacturers such as Rio and Airflo market them . You can see how thick they are by comparing a #12 Double Taper ( Top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a 650 grain Skagit ( Bottom ) <p> Skagit Tips <p> The main principle of Skagit is to cast large flies on heavy tips . You can use standard 15ft tips , use lengths of level sinking line such as T8 , T11 , T14 , T17 or the latest product from Rio which is a set of MOW Tips . <p> The Heavy MOW tips use T-14 in all sinking sections . The Medium MOW tips use T-11 and the Light MOW tips use T-8 for all sinking sections . As a guideline , Heavy MOW Tips are best on Skagit line of 575 grains and heavier , with the Medium MOW Tips most suitable for Skagit lines between 475 and 575 grains and the Light MOW Tips being most ideal on Skagit lines lighter than 475 grains . <p> These MOW tips retail in the US for about $150 and are not available in the UK . However here is how to make a set of you own . <p> Here is some items that you may or may not need to make your tips . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my 650 grain Skagit Head I am going to use T14 for the sinking part and a mill end double taper #12 for the floating sections . T14 weighs 14 grains per foot so 30 foot of T14 weighs 420gr . Using the AFTMA scale at 30 feet as a rough guide then 420gr falls in between a #12 at 380gr and a #13 at 450gr . <p> Normally when looping thick bodied lines such as shooting heads a length of running line is attached to form a small loop . However it is best to join PVC coated lines to PVC running line and PU lines to PU running Line . The problem comes with mill ends etc whereby you may not know the construction so if you are unsure then it is easy to cut of few small sections from the end tapers to form the loops . This way you are sure of joining like with like . <p> Cut approx. 10foot of parallel line leaving a bevel at one end . <p> Prepare your loop <p> Slide over the clear heat shrink tubing . Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short side is to the inside . This would appear to be wrong but actually it seals in the core . <p> I use a portable gas soldering iron with a hot air tip and diffuser .

Re-heat any sections as necessary . <p> One fused together it should look something like this . <p> Cut and peel back the heat shrink tubing which not only squeezed the plasticised line together but formed a heat shield and prevented over heating of the line . <p> Here is one welded loop . <p> Place a small piece of heat shrink tubing over the other end , heat and roll to form a blunt taper . <p> Cut and peel back the heat shrink tubing . <p> Insert a felting or darning needle through the blunt taper and out through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work the needle in and out to form enough space to either pull through some mono or in this case a tapered leader .

Would a different density of line help or hinder you ? That is even before considering if the water is clean or dirty , high or low , warm or cold , time of year , good light/poor light , time of day , etc. etc . <p> Those that have done the years of trying all those different things are usually the ones who catch the most for the amount of effort they put in on the river . Yes , people can be lucky and hook a salmon on their first day out but over the course of the season , it is those who have the experience that usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of effort . The changes they make are just automatic . Almost second nature . <p> The best thing I ever done for my fly fishing was to hang up the spinning rod 14 years ago . By only fishing fly in all conditions , I have a decent understanding of what might work and when . Of course there are many days that I blank but when I hang the rod up at the end of the season , more often than not I will have had more salmon to the bank than many that spend all the hours they can get at the river . I 'm still learning and trying different things but that is all part of my passion for fly fishing . <p> In short , there are no easy answers unfortunately . The experience gained from being at the river and trying different things is much more beneficial than anything that you can read in a book or online . <p> Aye you 're probably right with your summary there overall .... For me the depth you fish at is the most important thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water i 'd be happy enough fishing say a flamethrower or a Cascade in any flow and conditions and would n't feel i was limiting my chances any . <p> Wow ... Some seriously quality replies to this thread . I want to thank everyone for adding and I hope others continue to add . The last 3 posts really are filled with thought provoking insights . There really are so many variables . When I fish the Sunray it feels odd because I usually have a shooting head on and it just does not feel right . Should I have a single hander with a full floater specifically for this ? I most certainly will be giving these more time this season and the dry trout fly has me excited . How exactly is it done Loxie ? ? I am very interested . I agree completely that small specifics and people saying this wo n't work etc are probably over the top . However , I also have to say that staying true to the original design of a fly is extremely important ( Jockiescott ) that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are just not " feeling the vibe " when they look at specific flies and say " that wo n't work " it 's not got a green butt. ? Hemmy All of that said , the advice is superb and invaluable . Thanks for all the input to everyone and keep it coming ! ! ! <p> I concur with SpeyClaveDave about this fixation with Jungle Cock ' eyes ' . Having designed the MCX Shrimp - which is n't novel , you could liken it to a variety of patterns - and as I do n't tie myself I asked someone else to tie me some examples of the Version 2 . They all came back with JC ' eyes ' added - aaagh ! - if I 'd wanted them , I would have asked for them , but I did n't . So I then spent 10-15 minutes cutting off the ' eyes ' that the over-enthusiastic tyer had added . One of this eye-deprived batch caught my largest ever salmon ( The Beast of Wensleydale ) and the others took fish whenever they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that whereas trout flies as imitations were designed to catch trout , salmon flies were designed to catch fishermen . As I 'm not a tyer , I feel no allegiance to specific patterns or loyalty to their originators - perhaps more agnostic than atheist in such matters . As someone with an engineering and scientific inclination I like to deal in the basics : detection - how the salmon knows the fly is there ; acquisition - how it perceives the object as a target ; and deception - how do you avoid alerting the salmon to the fact that it is dangerous ? This allows you to exploit contrast - black is the key here ; silhouette - realistic in an impressionist sort of way and avoidance of excessive detail ( Topher Browne 's " a look , but not too good a look " ) ; and movement - does it move sensibly for an object of that size and shape ( nymph things move at inches per second , fishy things at feet per second proportional to their length , and lives things do n't tumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rides roughshod all over such reasoning , which all goes to show that we have n't got a clue ! I use a Sunray in 2 very different ways : first , somewhat below the surface with the leader threaded straight down the body , stripped at varying speeds ; and on the surface in hitched mode with a lightweight single hook and positively floating leader , using the current and varying retrieve to create a big Vee wake effect . The latter mode produces heart-stopping moments : I used it for the first time in Norway last year , and when in the half light a fish came up out of the water for it ........... and missed ....... <p> There 's no getting away from the fact that a surface take is a serious adrenalin moment . There used to be a chap called Plastic Tube on the Forum who was a sworn devotee of such methods , just as Silver Leapers from Newfoundland was the evangelist of the dry fly . However , they seem to work better at higher water temperatures , and the Ure 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch a salmon that way . <p> Jockie you seem to have a wealth of knowledge on fly fishing an in different conditions ... Maybe you could share it with a fly fishing novice like myself lol known salmon lies , flies for different water alomg the faughan .. When to fish an when not to etc to name a few lol Like reading your comments as you know the craic . <p> Again , it 's all a learning curve from year to year especially on a river like the Faughan . The river has changed so much , even in the past 5 or 6 years , that lies that once held fish no longer do so , for whatever reason . Parts have shallowed , parts have deepened , the course of the main flow has altered and made once , almost guaranteed lies , now just another empty part of the river . It is about trying to find those lies again , if they are there at all of course . <p> I ca n't give the names of many patterns because I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variants that I use at different times . If I was pushed to give two patterns that should bring success on the Faughan then a Bann Special and a Foxford will take fish right throughout the season . Or if you want to use something slightly more modern then a Cascade , Park Shrimp or Calvins will definately work . <p> Again , I do n't believe the pattern to be that important but you must still remember that , despite a few fish being caught , it is still early for the Faughan with our main runs of grilse and summer salmon traditionally not arriving until July . Do n't let it get to you that you are not hooking fish now , keep at it and you will . <p> One thing I can guarantee , you wo n't get a fish on a fly if you are not at the river or if you are spinning . 48621 @qwx248621 <p> I get the Jungle Cock argument and have caught salmon on flies with it and without it . <p> I have said before on the forum about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that time I was tying in a shed with extremely poor natural light . I went into the shed as it was getting dark one evening and something caught my eye . It was the shrimp flies sitting on a piece of foam to the side of the desk . There were all colours and combinations of shrimp fly sitting and the only discernible feature I could pick out on any of the flies was the Jungle Cock . I posted a thread on the forum about it and wondered if the colour of the fly was important at all if all that could be picked out in dark conditions was the JC . <p> I know a salmon 's eye is a lot different and light enters water a lot differently so perhaps it is n't important . <p> Will you catch fish on flies without Jungle Cock ? Of course you will . Will it do any harm to have Jungle Cock on a fly ? Absolutely not . 48621 @qwx248621 <p> I fish with very successful people who exam flies and pick out little errors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fish that one ... I am more flippant tbh ....... <p> Also , I do watch water levels and I am informed regarding fish runs etc . What is the missing magic touch ? ? <p> I 'm with you on the ' flippancy ' stakes . I too fish with anglers who angst over their choice of fly . Constantly changing with every change taking them higher and higher up the angst ladder . From the second their latest choice hits the water you can almost sense them wondering if there is something ' better ' in their box -or one of many boxes no doubt . <p> There 's absolutely no rocket science ( unlike fishing for the wily brown trout ) needed when choosing a salmon fly for any given condition . You will know ( or you should know ) instinctively what the ballpark figure would be in terms of size . Then you consider at what depth fish might be travelling or resting in any given pool -weight of fly , density of line and length and angle of cast . <p> Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Black and Yellow tubes for early spring . GBWG 's for late spring . Silver Stoats Tail and Silver Bodied Ally 's for summer ( Ally 's in peaty water ) . As long as it 's garish and / aggressive in colour , anything you fancy for the back end .
