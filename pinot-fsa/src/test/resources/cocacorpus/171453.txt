@@22791666 @2791666/ <h> Level 315 Cheat #1 : Work in the middle . <p> The hardest part about Candy Crush level 315 is the positioning of the ingredients . There are only three slots with green arrows and they are in the center of the board but at least two of your ingredients will not be in green-arrow columns . <p> Moving ingredients is hard to do in-game . Work on keeping moves as central to the board as possible . <p> Keep a close eye out for when you can switch a candy and an ingredient . Remember : Do n't  accidentally swap an ingredient and candy in the wrong direction ! With only 50 moves , you need to focus on the ingredients and not fixing mistakes . <p> Do n't  try and plan out moves too far ahead . This level features rainbow meringues , which means that after every move , the colors inside of the meringues will change . Until you clear the meringues , those candies will keep transforming . <h> Level 315 Cheat #2 : Make coconut wheel combinations . <p> When you combine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 striped candies . And if you 're on level 315 , you 'll know the value of a striped candy which is gold for an ingredient level ! <p> If you can combine a coconut candy with an existing striped candy , wrapped candy or color bomb , the power of the coconut candy is exponentially better . However , its not needed in a level like this ; the coconut wheel is enough . <p> But its so near the bottom on this level by the time you get to use it it rolls off the side to oblivion without helping at all . This is a very frustrating level cause if you do n't  get the other 2 cherries in the middle , before you know it , the game is over . Not hard to get 1 cherry down but it will take many tries to win . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

@@22791669 @2791669/ <h> Level 414 Cheat #1 : Make Striped Candies . <p> Striped candies are very helpful in this level because of the isolated jelly squares and the popcorn in the center . At the beginning of level 414 , you are given a horizontal striped candy on the bottom that can take out 1 hit on the 2-hit jellies in the corner . <p> You can use vertical or horizontal striped candies to hit the middle , popcorn covered jelly . <p> The newer popcorn version of Candy Crush level 414 makes it both easier and more difficult . Since the popcorn must be hit three times with a special candy to reveal a color bomb and the jellies beneath , it is more difficult . The color bomb that the popcorn eventually gives you , though , does make the level a bit easier . <h> Level 414 Cheat #2 : Do n't  Make the Isolated Jellies your Priority . <p> While the bottom jellies are the most difficult task in this level , you shouldnt be overly preoccupied with them . Jelly fish boosters are great if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , the popcorn and the color bomb hidden beneath will do the trick . <p> As you continue Candy Crush level 414 , make special candies and hopefully theyll hit the isolated jellies . <h> Level 414 Cheat #3 : Combine Special Candies , and try for Combos . <p> Combining special candies is always a good way to clear jellies and the popcorn . The best combo is a striped candy and color bomb , but color bombs are hard to come by because there are 6 colors of candy and the shape of the board . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

This will easily help you to clear the sugar keys that inhibit your progress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , that 's not true that you cant pass it w/out buying boosters . You might be referring to the old version of it , where apparently you did have to have jelly fish boosters to beat it but they " nerfed it " ( I learned what that meant reading about this level lol ) so that now you do n't  need them . This level is really tricky.at first I was playing on my phone and was n't even coming close to beating it . I honestly thought I 'd be on it for ages . Then I played it on my PC and literally passed on my first try . Only one star but I could care less , I was just so happy to have passed it . I 'd suggest to anyone having trouble w/ this level to play it on your PC vs phone . I passed w/ no boosters . I actually found 585 to be more difficult for some reason ! But I think I 'm in the minority w/ that one . 181 remains the hardest for me , its the one I was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. ridiculous ! I guess Im done with Candy Crushplayed this level well over 200 times and I rarely even get close ! ! Yes I 'm in for some competition and enjoy a certain level of difficulty BUT what feels like impossible is Boring ! Goodbye Candy Crush . was fun while it lasted but guess this game is just too tough for me ! <p> Wait till you reach 789 , most insane level I have come across , you can have stretgy for defusing 8 bombs which appears on opening of board , beyond that you just keep your finger crossed so that more green candies fall from top to complete order of collecting 77 green candies . <p> Well you are in luck , they have nerfed level 789 , reduced collection order from 77 to 45 , so it should cake walk for you . Checked level 350 , record shows that I have aced it with 3 stars , besides never remembered the same , so I must be few lucky one to pass 350 with ease . <p> Simonmortensen , I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardest levels I played till today were 677 , 829 &amp; 1180 . Levels 677 &amp; 829 both are being nerfed now , but 1180 takes the cake , it was so hard , King people changed the level completely , incidently 677 &amp; 1180 were released on 3rd September 2014 &amp; 2015 respectively , and I cleared both on the same day of September and that is 8th . Cleared pre nerfed levels 677 &amp; 829 with out using the boosters , but to clear level pre nerfed level 1180 , I had to use nothing less than 4 switch boosters . Input from your side will be highly appreciated . <p> manI read these comments here and have been stuck on level 40 for a while . are you people in the mensa branch of a prison so you have all day to figure this out . Starting at 35 , I started feeling the need of a 12 step program . Plus I have been doing Lumosity for a couple of years and I have been laying off it <p> Nope we are normal people leaving normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept 14 , started playing CC around on the 10th Sept , as off today completed 860 levels , without spending single farthing . Looking back I find 147 , 181 , 453 , 461 , 677 , 789 &amp; 829 most difficult levels , it will be wrong on my part to say that I cleared those levels , but real fact is , CC allowed me to clear mentioned levels . <p> Hahahaha I started feeling like I needed a 12 step program at level 34 . Then i passed it and went on a role and am currently at 67 . I felt like I was losing every bit of respect for myself having serious conversations with my bf about " candies " and " bringing the fruit down . " Then when you play so much that you start to see combos in your head its actually kinda terrifying . <p> I got to 500 totally expecting to b stuck for some time as I remember some of these comments . Got lucky and completed on first try while watching some football . Buddy thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level lol <p> Interesting , I went back to 84 in the dreamworld to see what you guys were talking about . I passed it w/ 2 stars and was #2 in the top 3 of my fb friends but honestly do n't  remember it . Sometimes I find the dreamworld more difficult in general though than the " real world " . <p> Level 84 of the dreamworld was pretty easy for me , got three stars on my first pass through.I had a much harder time with 128still passed it though . Am on level 156 dreamworld now and 387 normal . Not been playing too much lately so my progress has slowed = <p> Why do you have a game that is impossible . Is it just for me because I refuse to spend any money ? Level 165 hardly ever allows me more than 7 moves because of the bombs . If I am ever able to use all my moves the most blues I can get is 40-50 because there are not any on the board . I am taking a vacation from you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't  seen 33 mentioned in any other " hardest of " lists of Candy Crush but I was actually about to look for tips for 33 b/c I 've finished up to 590 which is as high as the phone will go and am waiting for tickets to get to 591 since it goes up to 605 on FB . In the meantime I figured I 'd go back &amp; try to get 3 stars on earlier ones &amp; I 'd remembered trying to do that before &amp; getting stuck on 33 . I 'd passed it a LONG time ago w/ 2 stars but then when I went back to play it again , I could n't for the life of me even remember how I 'd passed it at all ! Going to read your tips &amp; see if I can make it to 3 stars <p> Level 350 is not tough at all . Just with some attempts I pulled through . And candy crush is the most fucked up game in the world . The levels will never finish because they 're making money put of it . Regretted playing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized I had eight hammers left and used 7 of them on the jellies to finally pass this level . If you do n't  mind buying them , playing another game may earn 5 hammers or just save a bunch of them and use them when you know you have enough . Good luck . I warned my SIL about this level and she is about 3 weeks into it so far . <p> Ive been on Dreamworld level 84 for 2 months . Im stuck on level 215 . But in my opinion , the most difficult level for me was 167 . I think level 167 and level 211 should switch places . I had no trouble with levels 165 , 181 , 191 , 197 , and 199 . The episode with levels 201-215 has really been difficult . Hopefully I 'll get 215 crushed soon , but as for level 84 in dreamworld , The owl has defeated me , so he can jump off all he wants to . Good riddens Odus . <p> The most difficult level for me was level 677. way too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this with the added pleasure of constant bombs to tend to . I finally passed this devil level .. waiting at level 680 now for the next crazy episode to begin <p> For both H Zammit and Maria the only way that I was able to pass it was save up my free hand switches and hammers and I bought extra moves BUT I only bought the extra moves when I got close enough ; like 7 or 8 pairs of a possible good board and only needed 2 or 3 more pairs . You have to WAIT until you reach a board that feels right near the end I never really buy extra moves but in this case , I was not letting the game go when I had gotten so close to the end , THEN I used my hand switches to make the extra pairs I needed to finish . Good Luck the next episode is normal again <p> I got through it in 2 days . I just concentrated on getting the combos in the middle first instead of trying to free up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free that way anyway and make it easier to get more combos . Goodluck ! <p> I am now @ Level 741 , but i can only play on PC , not in my mobile phone &amp; tablet . This starts when i completed level 725 , everytime i ask the next level it only appears " To be continued Soon there will be new places to explore , you may replay previous levels to gain higher scores and more stars " Why ? How many episodes/levels here in candy crush ? <p> I have completed 770 stage in candy crush saga &amp; finished the game till next updation. i m so exited. i was stuck on level 305 for 8 days . this is the hard stage for m but finally i have completed this stage after 8 days .. <p> I thought level 350 was pretty much the hardest I 've played , I was stuck on it for months .

Besides , I am certain the game is good the this old man brain ! <p> Am on 171 , but is an " unlock more levels " level . Does not give me option of waiting 24 hours to continue , only to " ask friends , " or buy my way with 9 gold bars . Is there any way to do this without using any of those options <p> I cant believe level 463 is n't here . Its the first level Ive ever been stuck on for , literally , months . Even the walk-throughs only succeed due to an absurd , blitzkrieg of blind luck on the final move . <p> I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Everyone thinks the hardest Levels are the ones they show but this one is unbelievable ! I had to use everything I had To beat this level ! ! But I have never spent a dollar on this game . I think the will adjust This level because its just to hard ! <p> 829 is by far and away the hardest level so far , 50 matches in 40 moves all the while there are bombs on 2 separate candy movers above and below that are replaced as soon as they are destroyed . I consider myself a very good player and this level took me 3 weeks and over 500 tries to get . Made 147 look like childs play <p> Level 377 is keeping me stuck for weeks now . Getting 100 of three different candies in only 50 moves , unless you are lucky , is near impossible . CC has suckered me into buying additional moves but it has never helped me finish . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

Hope this helps ! <p> I just got through this level after days of patient slogging . As always its a little bit of judicial planning but mostly just perseverance . Some amazing things can happen seemingly spontaneously . In my case I got two colour bombs but they were separated by one candy . Then suddenly two more appeared adjacent to the first one forming three in a row and a separate fourth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed this level on the TOP half of the board ! ! I had 25 moves left before the merangue ( sp ! ) at the top was open and gone . I was sure it was a terrible board ! These tips really did n't  help me at all . Resetting the board is not necessary . I do n't  play this on my PC . I cant reset the board anyway , and obviously do n't  have to if you 're diligent and just keep trying . <p> I got tired of failing so went for a special candy ( the one with the check mark in it ) it made a color bomb easily .

Do not use a combination in the upper board to clear the licorice , it just brings down licorice . Once you get into the lower board , stay there and a ) feed the frog and b ) make normal matches to move the ingredients . The first time I tried this it took too many moves to feed the frog in the upper board but the second time I had a bit of luck and was able to drop everything with moves left . <p> I also get just licorice to replace licorice. and then the frog ended up under an ingredients just ready to drop but it would not do this because the frog was in the way .

For example , if the ingredient is in column 6 , move the frog to column 5 or 7 , and one row underneath . If you move him to column 6 , he will just get in the ingredients way . <p> That " tip " #3 is a " no shit , Sherlock " for sure . Post hoc 4/13 : I got it . Folks , do n't  get all wrapped up in using only the frog to clear all your candies . He cant do it all by himself ; he simply does n't  have enough moves to bring down six ingredients . Continue to focus on combos like color bomb + stripe , like you always do . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

It occurs *after* the level 's objective has been cleared . If we could *get* the sugar crush for passing the level , we would n't need help passing the level . <p> I used the lollipop thing to smash the candy underneath the hazel nut and hand to take the hazelnut off the conveyer belt for the first one . It was easy to direct it out by making rows of three all the way down . The second one I just switch hazelnut for a candy off the conveyer belt . Both were freebies from the prize wheel . <p> If you 're not willing to buy that switcheroo booster for this level , there is NOTHING you can do but idly crush candies and wait for that magic lucky arrangement that allows you to move the hazel off the conveyor belt . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763 
@@22791691 @2791691/ <p> After 5 days I FINALLY defeated this absurd level . I agree with most posters , the rules all seems to change on 266 . When bringing 4 of the same colored candies together , I would sometimes get a color bomb , not a stripe . Dozens of times when I combined two stripes , they would just cancel each other out and explode . Sometimes two stripes would suddenly appear together for a match up , for no apparent reason . Since the game is " free " , I guess the producers of this game can change the rules whenever it suits them . <p> I visit candycrush once a day in case my friends need tickets . Candycrush was good at the lower levels , but at these levels I get very little enjoyment . There are far more rewardiing ways to spend my time . <p> I FINALLY beat this level after about six weeks of trying . My suggestions : Keep resetting the board until , on your first move , you can make a stripe above the horizontal line of chocolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can , since working the lower half might uncork the bomb dispenser . Do n't  worry about where the stripes are . Just keep making them . Eventually two will fall together . ( However , try not to make two of the same color too close to one another , since a move might accidentally make a line with both of them in it , detonating them both . ) Finally , do n't  try to make color bombs . If one comes up , great , but color bombs are of limited use to you . The best use of a color bomb on this level is to get rid of bombs coming out of the dispensers . And you know what , if you do n't  succeed , do n't  sweat it . Its only a game . Keep playing . Its not like your life depends on it . By the way , I cant say I had all the same technical problems some other players had , like getting a color bomb when you put four together . Maybe that 's a device issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm still playing after a few days . I enjoy reading the comments of everyone who is frustrated like myself . Now I 'm paying more attn and find how many " opportunities " show up when I 'm on my last move . Ones that did not seem possible the move before . I 'm sure its programmed to encourage you to pay for one last move , which I only did on level 70 , never again . So it helps not to take it too seriously because we just move on to a couple of levels we blow through and then another one like this . I was stuck on one for days a few weeks ago , then some angel or whatever it was cld appeared and passed me through the level . <p> This level is beyond impossible and you need major luck to pass it . You have 50 moves , so that means you have 10 moves to create and position the special candies . There is no way possible you can strategically do it . I have played over 250 games and have n't come close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just stop playing for a week or so and the game makes it easier to pass the level <p> Not one of my favoritesa lot of stuff going on here and stripes going off all over the place but when 2 cascade together and go off , it does n't  count as one of your orders . Then there 's the bloody bombs and all kinds of color bombs and wrapped candies screwing everything up by exploding at random , usually when you 're on your last order side by side with one move left . Whoever put this one together is evil <p> Thanks for the great tip " Try to make special candies next to one another so you do n't have to move them together . " HA ! They explode but the order counter does n't  decreasethis level is soooo annoying on every leveland I too have now experienced the F.colored.bomb exploding with only 4 candies and wiping out everything I had but making all those stupid wrapped candies which also blow all your efforts to bits . Someone needs to take another look at this and revamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that block the bombs from coming out ( at most left and right rows ) . sometimes striped candies combos at the bottom part of the board eliminate them . then pay attention so it wont be too late to match/cancel the explosions . once there are only 15 moves or less left it wont be a problem any more . good luck . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

When this Licorice Swirls spread on the playing field , this translates into easier time spreading the jellies thus finishing the Candy Crush Jelly Level 42 successfully with fewest moves possible . 12757 @qwx212757 12763 @qwx212763

Once the frog is active , put him in the middle of the 9 and clear the jelly . Start feeding the new frog the same way and clear the second square . Make sure you have enough points though before you use the second frog , the first couple of times I did n't  make a single star . <p> to feed to frog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frog . Once he s full , click ( not drag ) on the frog and move it to the middle of either the 9 squares at the top .

The goal is not tough to meet , but you must be ready to think critical considering the number of pies or blockers on the board . Pies cover almost the whole of Candy Crush Jelly level 26 , and this makes it practically impossible to spread . These blockers are double-layered , making the game more complicated .

Now that you have an enlarged space to make stronger moves , and you can now start making special candies for spreading the jelly . With four colors on Candy Crush Jelly level 26 , it will be very easy to form any special candy that you believe can make a great impact in the game .

You 'll never get thru the level if you do n't  have at least 2 ( preferably 3 ) matches to gain immediate access into the pyramid . I got very lucky and had 4 immediate matches ..

Most of the swirls will be dealt with while spreading the jelly but you have to deal with those that are on the left side . What makes the swirls in this level a bit complex to clear is their position and design of the playing field . The holes make it difficult to match candies around these blockers . The best way of dealing with these swirls is by matching candies adjacent to them but most of them will require the use of special candies .

One thing that is clear at the end of this level is that some areas such as corners might be a challenge to reach . These are areas where the spreading of the jelly can not be achieved by the normal candy matching or even the use of other special candies . This is where the use of the jellyfish becomes necessary since it can swim across the playing field to spread the jelly in such areas . You can activate the fish candies that have already been released by the dispenser or make yours by matching candies of the same color in a 2+2 format . Combining the fish candy with a striped candy or a color bomb will make a powerful move to complete Candy Crush Jelly level 50. 12757 @qwx212757 12763 @qwx212763

So you need to save at least 5 jelly fish to eat those hidden jellies . Do n't  even think to clear those jellies by removing the meringue layers first . <p> * Since one fish eats 3 jellies , always count if you have enough fish to clear the hidden jellies . e.g. If you have 3 fish and you have 10 hidden jellies , you do n't  have enough fish . This is a loss loss situation , no point of continuing , better hit the finish button and start a fresh game . <p> * Since jelly fish play a major role in this level why not using the jelly fish booster at the start up . Using a color bomb will also be much much helpful . Hey I am not telling you to spend $$s , but just collect jelly fish and color bombs from daily booster wheel for free . <p> * When you have color bomb and jelly fish boosters selected , again strictly follow the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jelly fish booster the more fish will be fallen while you are progressing . <p> * Combine the color bomb with a jelly fish . That will multiply the jellies . ( If you are lucky enough you 'll get at most 12 jellies cleared from this match ) <p> * This is how I won the level . I selected all the boosters I have at that time ( a +3 moves booster received from a friend , color bomb , jelly fish and striped+wrapped booster ) . Then I combined the color bomb with a fish after clearing some possible jellies . <p> * I tried more than 100 games of this level , but I won the first game that I started with the boosters as I described above . <p> * Need not to say , the Striped+Wrapped booster that I selected at the start up was useless . <p> the problem with this level is n't that you cant see the jelly you totally can see it .

Make many special candies and color bombs . <p> After this , combine the color combos with special candies if possible . Another good reason why you should target the lower side of the playing field , is that it is very easy to start a chain reaction .

Go for the color bomb rather than another special candy . <p> Lastly , do n't  forget to look at your goals . Although there may be an easy opportunity for a striped candy , you may really need a wrapped candy . Do n't  let wrapped candies pass you by . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

On both occasions I have played three games and then run out of lives .

First try after more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least two weeks , and it worked ! I got through it at last ! Yay , now on to some even more frustrating levels . <p> I tended to get close by starting at the top sides rather than bottom . You do need to shift as many licorises : that makes the bigger later plays have more effect . Do n't  get hypnotised and waste moves you have to free dozens of squares so make every move count ( especially keeping an eye open for freeing the odd corners at top/bottom ) . <p> You 'll only do it after all that by getting a Five , then combining that with a stripe . So save any Fives and manoeuvre to get stripes next to it . And if you have a ( say ) red stripe next to a Five ready to go , see if you can drop in some more reds before blowing everything up <p> I have wasted 144 lives on this level and I still cant beat it .

Keep in mind , this is supposedly one of the ten hardest levels in the entire game . Those " corner " squares make it a bear to win . Once you get through it , its back to smooth(er) sailing ! <p> After watching my wife play the game I learned to resist making obvious moves on the board .

What if you keep getting a rubbish board and have no other moves to make so are forced to use your special candies because the board does not reshuffle unless there are absolutely no moves to be made . Somehow , the board always manages to force me to waste my special candies because there are no other moves to make . And then I have none left when it counts .

And within the next two moves , there was no other move to make on the board so I either had to waste my sprinkle candy or end the game . I ended the game . I 'm not giving King the satisfaction of screwing up yet another one of my games and causing me more frustration . Oh and do n't  you love it when you have a sprinkle and a striped and there is one candy separating them and no matter how many ways you try and shift things , you cant get them next to each other . So surprise surprise , they go to waste along with all your moves , obviously because King wants you to buy the power up to switch two candies . Such a money making scheme .

I have been trying for weeks and was about to quit ! I let it rest for about a day , and then did the daily spin . Received the color bomb , candy with colored dots and used it immediately ! I waited to combine it with a stripped color candy . Once a color candy was next to it I tried to match all other combos to maximize the effect with more of the same color dropping down . Once there were no other options I hit the color bomb with the stripped candies to take off as many . It worked hope this helps others ! <p> I just completed level 125 after complaining yesterday that I could n't get through it after almost three weeks . Go figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does n't  have anything to do with the licorice . <p> Got sugar crush on level 125 , everything cleared . Thought i had won this one after 5 wks . Would not move to 126 . Level 125 blinks and a train and an ugly green bird appeared . Did n't  get to see my score , assumed i had win . Said i must purchase or ask friends . Do n't  want to . Did n't  offer me any quest to play as other levels . Thought if i replayed it may help but the score to win is now 145,000 . Before it was 80,000 , also the free prize wheel is gone .

The Tooth Fairy will then take you passed all the Quest Levels , and forward to the new land/area , where you will play new levels ! <p> You will receive a push notification that tells you the Tooth Fairy has a gift for you . Open it and find this picture ( look below ) . The Tooth Fairy will bring you to your new level instantly ! <h> Comments <p> This tooth fairy cheat did n't  work for me ! I followed the instructions of this webpage on how to get the tooth fairy cheat . I logged out of my facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried playing the first of the three mystery quests but I did n't  win . I set the clock of my phone one week ahead then I went back to the Candy Crush app in my phone . The tooth fairy did n't  come ! : ( <p> P.S. When I finished the Bubblegum Bridge episode on Dec 27th- I waited a week and the tooth fairy came on Jan 3rd . I was finally allowed into the Salty Canyon episode . I finished the Salty Canyon episode on Jan 12th , and today I was expecting the tooth fairy to come again because its been a week , but she did n't  . So I found this webpage about the tooth fairy cheat . I tried setting my clock ahead a week like this webpage suggests . But it did n't  work . How do I fix this ? I really want to use the tooth fairy cheat but it did n't  work for me . <p> Here 's an idea that would make the Quests more bearable , and have those Stars you earn on the levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you complete a fifteen-level land/area episode , instead of always having to complete three Quests , why not have it so that the number of Quests you have to complete depends on the Stars you earned in that Land/Area ? <p> Proposed formula : NumQuests = 4 - INT ( AVG ( Starsprevious 15 levels ) ) <p> So , if you earned an average of three Stars in the previous levels ( when rounded to an integer ) , you 'd only have to play 4 - 3 = 1 = one Quest ! No 24-hour delay ! <p> If you earned an average of two Stars , you 'd only need to play two Quests . Only one 24-hour delay after the first Quest . <p> Only if your rounded average was one Star would you need to play all three Quests . <p> If King wants to make it tougher , they could change the formula to:NumQuests = 4 - MIN ( Starsprevious 15 levels ) <p> So instead of a rounded average , it 'd be looking at your lowest scored stars for the 15 levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stars , you only play one Quest . If you scored two on any one level , even if you scored three on all others , but never scored only one on any level , then you play two Quests . If you ever scored only one Star on a level , you play all three Quests as usual . <p> This would be calculated afresh each time you attempt to play the Quests , so that once reaching the Quests , you can choose to go back and replay your one-Star and maybe two-Star levels again to avoid having to do a Quest , or even to abort the 24-hour timer after your first or second Quest . <p> Thank God ! ! I was ready to uninstall Candy Crush stuck on that rotten Level 110 and those F-ing bombs ! I hate those things . 5 seconds to get rid of 2 of them right off the bat makes the game more like some sort of college exam . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

Double wrapped candies work especially well considering the blast radius and power is so high , so if you manage to get one of those utilize it ! You do n't  actually NEED the jellyfish to beat this board , but they can help if you 're out of options .

Wrapped candies are far more valuable for clearing meringues than color bombs in this particular board . They do help , but the difficulty in creating color bombs can often eat away at your move numbers . <p> Beat it on the 3rd try . Had one jelly left with 4 moves left .

The goal of level 152 is to clear all the ingredients ( 2 nuts , 2 cherries ) and score 40,000 points in 50 moves . <h> Level 152 Cheat #1 : Reset your board . <p> Its ideal to start this board with ingredients that are in the middle columns . Of course , this is n't a given . Play on mobile and keep resetting your board until you get the ingredients in the middle or are more clustered . <p> This will make less work later as you wont be working to break all the multi-layered meringues . <p> Once your ingredients are clustered , you need to form striped candies . Focus on making matches adjacent to meringues to clear them but remember , as for any ingredient level : vertical striped candies all the way . This is the fastest and most efficient way of bringing your ingredients down . <h> Level 152 Cheat #3 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere on the board , try keeping your clearing moves to the center of the screen .

Since lives are n't  an issue for you ( just set your clock forward ) , try to keep resetting your board ( and yes , losing a life ) until you get a good beginning cascade . You want to aim to start the game with at least 4,000 points without having made a single move . <h> Level 100 Cheat #2 : Use vertical striped candies for the bomb . <p> Meringues are n't  cleared by striped candies but bomb and licorice xs are ! If you 're worried about the bomb , a well placed vertically striped candy can help free the bomb . <p> With 15 moves to clear the bomb , you do have time to clear it but you do n't  want to wait . Take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Aim for big combinations and adjacent matches . <p> The best way to take out these meringues is big combinations and adjacent matches . Remember : any jelly covered by the meringues will need to be cleared three times ( once for the meringue and then there are two layers of jellies ) . Make moves that will knock out multiple pieces of meringue or set you up for a nice special candy combination . <p> I think all of these levels are somehow set in order to frustrate the players so theyll buy time . Interesting how often a grt to a winning move juuuust as I run out of time or moves . I 've seen this over and over and over . All controlled by the many times we only have one choice for a move . Very clever . <p> This was a tough o+e . I lost starting out with over 6000 points and again starting with over 1300 points . But I hung in there and passed this level starting with over 5000 points , just like magic , it all fell into place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few to cascade . Maximum of 400+ points to start which apparently is not enough . I agree they want you to buy stuff and control what screens you get until you do . It is a bunch of crap that you have to hit the bomb twice . It is darn near impossible to even get it once . I am scared to think how the levels in the next 100 and even higher will get stupidly difficult . <p> Yes , very tough . Have several times cleared the bomb within two or three moves , but still did n't  come close to clearing the jellies . Back to it ! While I would love to clear and move on , I am still getting a certain level of satisfaction by improving my overall position ( most of the time ) before the moves run out . <p> Finally beat 100 . Took 3-4 days . Good advice here , but most important is to be patient . At first , I am content to just eliminate the bomb with no less than 8 moves left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get rid of it in just 2-3 moves . While practicing at zeroing in on that bomb , I also work at getting as many jellies as I can with as few remaining as possible when I run out of moves . Its hard to make special candy combinations in this game . Failing sucks , but failing a bit less each time makes it easier to keep at it when it seems impossible Anyway , that 's my 2 cents worth ( not that we have pennies here anymore ! ) <p> Ridiculous level does n't  matter how skillful you are at the game its pure luck whether you get the bomb quick enough and , even then , there are so few moves left that without bombs or combinations , you 're screwed . More boring than any of the previous levels because you just have to wait for the board to swing in your favour . I just wish there was a " Per-lease " button . <p> Been on this level for 8 weeks . Not able to start with 6000 points . Not able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the programming is preventing me finishing hence the constant request for me to spend money . Pretty hopeless game without any skill requirement on the part of the player . <p> Been on this level for 2 months . At no point have I been able to start with over 6000 free points . Nor have I been able to clear down to less than 3 jellies . However I have been inundated with requests to buy extra lives . The programming on this level negates the need for skill or luck . That is obvious . Essentially this level is a money maker and in no way meets the definition of a game . <p> Ive been stuck lots of times on lots.of levels but I hate to admit that I got this level on the third try , &amp; I do n't  reset if its going to cost me lives . And Ive never ever paid a cent to buy plays or lives or anything . Its patently against my principles . I just used the tips ( except reset ) . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

You need to drop your ingredients to the columns with a teleport area . Then you need to teleport them to the left or right columns , which are the only places that can clear ingredients . It will really help to first position your ingredients in the 3rd and 5th column ( where the teleports are ) before you start dropping them . If you get them stuck in the column with no teleport , you will need to waste precious moves to get them to the right column . <p> After your ingredients are positioned in the right columns , you just need to drop them into the teleport areas .

Then go back to game , use another life , go back into Messages , accept another life etc . Its the only way you can take advantage of the extra lives sent to you . The game wont allow you to have more than 5 lives available at any one time , but nowhere does it tell you how to use the extra lives that friends send you ! this is how ! <p> Youve probably figured this question out already , but just in case there is someone in the future with the same question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Facebook friends gift you , DO NOT accept them if you have a complete set of lives . Only accept them when you are completely out of lives . For instance , you open up your Candy Crush app and have your full set of lives ( 5 ) , if you accept the lives right away , you will lose them it wo n't give you 6+ lives . For some reason , the app wont let you have more than 5 lives at a time . Wait until you are completely out of lives , and THEN go accept them . Once you accept them at that time , they should show up then and you can continue to play . ( If 3 Facebook friends have sent you 3 lives , the lives ( the 3 ) should show up then after you accept them . ) I really hope my answer makes sense , LOL . I tend to ramble when explaining things . <p> Please , oh please , tell me how you did it .. And could you explain it s-l-o-w-l-y and in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your question you 'll either need to have FB friends give you 3-tickets , or you can pay to move to the next level . <p> You have to get the fruits to the bottom . Then get them to go through the portal . Once the fruits are over on the side that 's when you want to make special candies because its to small of a space . You have to really plan your moves . It took me like 10 tries or more befor I got it . I hope this helps . <p> I have finished level 95 but cant seem to go any further . There is still a keyhole that appears and I can not click on anything to move to the next level . So I can not do any mistery quests or ask friends for tickets . Any idea why ? <p> Do n't  spend your money ! Pending on what phone you have , just change the time in your settings . Then go into the game , and more lives should follow after that . Then go back to your settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact steps or you 'll screw up your time ; But I only know how to do this on a Samsung galaxy phone , cause that 's the phone I play on . GDo these steps in order I give u &amp; u should b good . .. 1 . Make sure ur on the MAIN SCREEN ( says PLAY &amp; has that little guy dancing &amp; laughing next to the KING logo , gives u all ur options ; sound , 2 play as guest or log into ur Fb , etc. ) 2 . ( So if u have galaxy phone ) u should b able 2 pull your screen down 2 get into ur Settings WITHOUT EXITING that MAIN SCREEN because u need 2 KEEP that screen up while doin all this ! 3 . Once your into ur Settings , press Date and time . 4 . UNCHECK Automatic Date and time . 5 . Press Set time &amp; move time ahead 2 hrs or more . 6 . Escape outa Settings . 7 . Press Play ( which should be on the main screen ) 8 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fb pic next 2 whatever level ur on , press that level # that is the level ur on at the time . 9 .

KEEPING UR PLAY SCREEN UP ; Go back into ur Settings , re click Date and time , &amp; Recheck Automatic Date &amp; time so the CORRECT time is reset by ur phone . 11 . Now u can press Play&amp;Should b good 2 go ! ! Hope this helped u ! It took me a few times &amp; , I kept screwing up my time but Finally got itnow I do n't  have 2 spend 1 cent or lives or bother ne of my friends every time I play , It can b a neusince ! ; good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first open the game a banner , or large sign , displays the messages ; including who has sent you lives . After closing this and starting the game any lives you have n't accepted will be in an envelope on the page that has an aerial view of the road winding through the land you are currently playing in . When you run out of lives leave the game and you should be on that page . Look for a toolbar with the clock and the Yeti shop ; the envelope should be there . I do n't  think they are saved after you leave the game completely . <p> Me too then ! I came here looking for help and the posters are talking about getting the ingredients to teleporters and I 'm thinking , so , what , were in Star Trek now ? ! Wish somebody ( i.e KING ! ) wld explain how to play each level when it opens up AND explain what teleporters are as well as the other things that ppl talk about . <p> How do you get the cherries and nut into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not get the ingredients to move , only with cascade !

I also won many special challenges . What does it take ? Very disappointing and why I am fed up <p> I quit playing candy crush for over a year because I could n't get past this level ! Ridiculous ! I just started back a few days ago . My daughter finally beat it on my iPad but I was n't connected to Internet and it did n't  save it ! Grrr ! 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

The key to overcoming the level has everything to do with how one deals with the Licorice . <p> Once the pies are cleared , it will be a bit easier to make more special candies and also clearing the Licorice allows more horizontal striped candies to be released ; they help in clearing the stumbling blocks and in meeting the ultimate objective of the level of spreading jelly . <p> Doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an upper hand in easily maneuvering the obstacles and fulfilling the objectives and pegging on a superb chance of killing the game . <h> Jelly Level 107 Cheat #2 : Keep the amount of Licorice turns and twists to a minimum as more of them in the playing field makes it harder to make special candies . <p> Candy crush jelly level 107 is quite an easy task to accomplish after overcoming the Licorice locks . However , one has to keep the amount of Licorice turns and twists to a minimum since they being in large amounts in the playing field hinders making of special candies . <p> Also , they being more , turning and twisting lowers the effects of special candies .

Trick here is to match candies near the bottom of the playing field as many times as possible . <p> If there are no candies near the bottom of the playing field , we go for those that are as low as possible and furthest from the top of the playing field and match them often as possible .

The goal of level 425 is to collect 200 blue candies and make 5 striped candy and wrapped candy combos in 50 moves You must also get 65,000 points , too . <h> Comments <p> This level is total crap . The tip is correct that without a ton of luck you have no chance . There is no strategy involved as the 3 random tornados constantly wipe out your wrapped candies and stripes before you have a chance to combine them . If the tornadoes do n't  get you then the bombs will before you even get started . Many times I have gotten the 200 blue colors only to fall short on the wrapped striped candy combos . <p> Yes , I noticed that . Ive been stuck on this board for over a week and if I play from my iPhone or my Mac Laptop , I only get 10 chances on the timebombs and need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Kindle , its still the original version . What kind junk is that ? ? ? <p> The bombs do NOT take care of themselves , EVER ! Unless you are very lucky and King gives you a board that will do this . Out of five lives you get 250 moves , well I give up 195 moves because the bombs do not take care of themselves . That is why king offers to buy more moves after the fist 11 because the bomb(s) are going to go off . Why not change bombs from 10 to 20 , so one is able to at least try and use their skill to at least come close to collecting the orders . Please the game is programmed to have one spend money you do n't  have and king is hoping for that . Their interest is the money only . These really are not cheats to beat a level , it common sense . You do n't  cheat to candy crush . Candy crush cheats to steal your money . <p> I could pass this level with their boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel king has set you up to fail . It just is not fun , your dead in the water before they even open the gate . It is just wrong on all counts . I did n't  get this far on luck alone or paying to play . Karma is a bear king , do n't  forget that . <p> I agree .. King has rigged this game to suck your bank account dry . Every time you set up any candy/striped combo the tornados wipe it out .. This game has become too aggravating to enjoy ! Time to delete this game and find a more enjoyable form of entertainment ! ( Preferably NOT another MONEY PIT designed by King ! ) <p> A possible solution : Sign onto Candy Crush Via Facebook and take a daily spin to accumulate boosters- that way you do n't  have to empty your bank account . I have NEVER paid for booster or extra lives , and I have over 900 saved extra lives via facebook . <p> This level proves skill has little to do with this game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King realizes your not going to pay for a booster . In turn , they let you pass the level . I have n't spent a dollar up to this point , nor will I ever choose to do so . I do n't  have to wait on lives anyway . I just set my internal clock on my iphone 2.5 hours ahead and POOF ! 5 more lives . When I need my clock back , I just delete and re-install game . Old news , but for those of you that do n't  knowit is a way around waiting 2.5 hours for lives that will be gone in 5 minuteson this level anyway . <p> FYI you do n't  need to delete and re-install . After you set the clock fwd , go to game , make sure the 5 lives are there and then before you play , go back to the clock and set to automatic again . If you forget to reset the clock back and play , you can always set the clock ahead again another few hours , then check the game for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to current time again . Never fails . Unfortunately endless lives does n't  help beat this level ! ! <p> What irritates me is the fact that while the tornadoes are doing their thing you are n't  able to do anything . Its like your moves are frozen until the games plays come to a complete stop . This can make a difference when trying to get the bombs exploded . I think this level is very unfair and just a way for King to make money . I will keep playing this level at leisure , but I 'm not going to pay for advancement . <p> why ? when the strategy is for you to make money that u think we are stupid to keep playing this game ? King you might want to rethink this , Its not fair when the only way to win this level is to put money into it <p> anyone that made it passed this level understands its no longer skill but pure luck.You have to play until the game decides to give you the win.It took me a month of causal playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for king just wanting money I will tell you I do n't  work for free ether . There programers and code writers are not doing it live in a life of poverty . <p> I do n't  know how anyone passed this level . The owners of this software are nothing but scumbag cheaters and want nothing more than our money . I wont give them any and hope these cheaters go to hell and skip purgatory . <p> Well I am with most of you on being completely frustrated with this level and not paying a penny to King . Unfortunately there are likely far more people sucked in and willing to pay than those of us who realize this set-up of Kings . It stinks because this is ( was ) a fun game , and anyone who has reached this level obviously agrees otherwise we would n't be posting on this site . I cant say that Im done with King but they wo n't see another penny of mine . <p> Of course king wants to get payed for there work so do you and I.What I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free on others work . I am at level 439 without paying anything and though its frustrating at times i am just happy they let me get this far for free <p> I totally agree with your comments and I do n't  understand all the negative criticism of this game . If you are so bored or frustrated , do n't  play , and if you do n't  want to spend anything , you do n't  have to . I have spent a few dollars , but it was to get to the next set of games as my friends were too slow in giving me a ticket . Mr King runs a business folks . <p> The strategy that worked for me was : start in the middle by the merangue remove as much merangue as possible Do not worry about bombs till they get closer to the end but do try to make wrapped and stripped candies do not worry about the blue candies these are cleared , as you set your bombs off . You can use the combos that you make to detonate your first set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped- stripped combos tho . Try to make a few coloured balls these can be used to take out any colors or bombs . By taking out a color you free up the board for the possiblity of making the wrapped , stripped or colored bombs . Admittedly this level also requires some luck , but as soon as I perfected this technique- I got it first try I did n't  buy any special candies but did use a free lollipop I won on the wheel , to move a stripped next to a wrapped . Good luck ! ! ! <p> Took me a week to pass it and without any boosters . For me , the key is to get the blocks cleared away quickly in order to manage the bombs . The blue candies and matching the striped with wrapped basically took care of itself . Making color bombs was the most helpful combination for me . Its hard but not impossible . <p> I have reached this level without spending any money . I tried using the " bonus " items and restarting if I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lollipops were useful for getting rid of bombs about ready to explode . Since there was a walk through , I had to believe it could be done . Several times I go all 230 blue and up to 4 of the stripe/wrapped combos . Today , after about a month of trying , I got all 5 striped/wrapped combos and had only 4 blues to get so I broke down and spent .99 for 4 moves which also gave me 3 lollipops and 2 hours of unlimited lives which I used on a stupid bird level to no avail . So if you 're careful and lucky , it can be done . <p> I was stuck on this one too first time ever I used Google for help and it got me here , not much help after all . However , I do have a solution that might help with the luck = make sure to collect the lollipop boosters , i would say 5 will do . Start the level and focus on the combinations . If within a few moves you have a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your side . Clear the blocks as fast as you can , do not focus on the bombs . Hge tornados every now and then do also destroy bombs . If a bomb becomes a threat , use a lollipop . It worked for me , game started smooth ..

The blue ones never seem to be a problem and also had 6 moves left and also i only needed 2 lollipop boosters Is it luck ? Yes it is , but with the right game setting you can help your luck = cheers from Holland <p> I 've tried a few other strategies .. including spending a free colour bomb to mix with a striped candy to try to wipe out tornadoes .. but the lollipop hammer solution sounds worth a try .

Did n't  think I 'd say it , but I think its the end of the candy road for me as I do n't  think I will ever pass and I buy things .

Its not impossible You have to really plan ahead and make those wrapped candies . If you let them drop to the bottom the tornadoes tend to leave them alone . Then you just have to make a striped candy to drop on it . Its not easy but if you rely only on luck you wo n't get far . I did n't  use any bonuses either . <p> The money pig has dried up ? on the edge too delete candy crush 425 is a joke fuck buying moves when you move and it gets blown up ? ? ?

The game eventually " gives " you the harder levels by *conveniently* dropping exactly what you need . There was a previous level with STREAMS of bombs dropping down . Played it for weeks , impossible to pass it , then one day I get a run where NO bombs drop and every move I make causes a huge cascade , allowing me to beat the level . Another of these tornado levels always had 4 running and then , as if by magic , the level only generates 2 tornadoes on one of my attempts .

Same day as my initial post . I kept at it and eventually managed to get some good combos on the initial drops . Lots of choco-balls forming , wrapped and striped from the cascades . The center meringue opened up pretty quickly with all that , and once the center is open its much easier to make combos . I fell short a few times , but eventually got it . Choco-balls combined with blue to knock out a large chunk of that order , and making striped/wrapped combos would keep the tornadoes at bay . I even got to give the level one final " boring " vote on the way out , too . See you in hell , Soda Swamp . <p> By far the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually no skill required . Candies will detonate for no good reason , particularly when you 've just lined up 2 for a combo . The PC version does seem fractionally easier than the phone version ? ? <p> Tip for lvl 425play it on FB only , cleared it .. tip is to make as many special candies as u can stripes wraps color bombs etcdont worry abt collectin D blues .. match the wrap/stripe whn there do n't  get caught up .. just keep makin special candies .. do n't  match the color bomb with a special candyjust any regular candy ( blue if there but do n't  force it ) .. concentrate only on makin wrap candies if stripe is there take it do n't  use itunless u have to . FB has 15 move bombs which is huge . rememer color bomb to eliminate a color do n't  match with it with special candy . DO NT WORRY ABT THE BLUE CANDY . <p> Getting to this level has been the most frustrating and the most enjoyable . This I have to say is the hardest yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can go further , patience is all that is requiredwell that and a few drinks . Good luck fellow players . <p> This level is terrible ! The tornados set you up for failure ! I 've tried it on laptop and tablet . Neither is successful ! I refuse to buy anything from King ! Only thing I know to do is stockpile lollipops for those bombs . This level hastaken all the fun out of t is game . Its pure luck , even after checking the board and resetting . UGH ! ! ! ! <p> Come on guys if I can pass this level anyone can . First you need to get your wrap combos done . Start with making a wrap and then make a stripe close to the wrap . Once you match this combo , your board resets and then repeat this step . Do n't  worry about collecting blues while doing this because you will collect blues during your match . When finished , make color bomb and match preferably with a solid blue . Do NOT match color bomb with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boosters . Do n't  let the above instructions stating this level is based on luck get to you ! As all other levels , its based on strategy . Hope this suggestion helps . Have fun candy crushing . <p> Today I beat this level . What happened was I used a striped candy with a color bomb combinatiob . It got rid of all the tornados and they did n't  come back for the remainder of my game so I was able to concentrate on what needed to be done . Yes , I HATE this level but somthing for everyone to try . If you get rid of one tornado at a time , I think they eventually come back but getting rid of them all at once and they do n't  . Good luck . Oh , and up to this poinf I have not paid a penny to play this game . Refuse to do so . <p> I have played and loved this game since January of this year . I have almost quit a couple times but kept on and unfortunately have spent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time on how they ( king ) expects loyal players to win this level , there 's just no way . I consider myself to be a pretty good player but ready to go spend my small fortune somewhere else ! <p> I agree King has made this a money making venture . A friend told me there are support groups popping up for people that are spending well above what they can afford to pass the levels and are addicted to it . They need to pull way back on the intensity of the game and make it for pleasure not for them to get rich . Otherwise I think FB users should pick a day or length of time to boycott the game . Has anyone ever won the jackpot on the wheel of prizes ? Get my point ? Just one opinion . Good day all . <p> I agree dis level is pure luckrigged probably ! ! I got close to finishing it few times , saw it through finally . So , I have every reason to believe u can do it as well ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and none of us paid for it ! ! The real trick is to be persistent enuff , it took me about 100 lives in 4 days to go through ! ! Gud luck <p> this level is absolutely crap .. tornadoes , bombs , obstacles , 230 blue candy , 5 combinations .. 90% of the time bombs go off Just do n't  understand why they want to put everything here no other level took so much time I 've planned to quit this game forever : / <p> This is a ridiculous level and the first one in the whole game I did n't  enjoy and considered deleting the game . Finally passed it after having been stuck on it for 3 days , as many already said you just have to wait for your lucky deal . Skill makes no or little influence on beating this level totally no fun level ! <p> I love the comments that get upset with King . Of course they 're in it to make money ! ! ! This is America . If King made it easy and everyone was playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games would n't be able to support themselves or their families . Quit complaining . I wont spend a dime but I wo n't complain if I never get past this level . I 've had a lot of fun playing this the last 5 months but life goes on and I 'll find something else to do once I get bored with this . <p> When you get rid of the bombs the candy machine will dispense solid candy . This gives you time to focus on the rest of the board . Try to eliminate the bombs . However , make sure not to get distracted so you do n't  miss your opportunity to make a bomb and stripe combination . I passed the level . The blue requirement will pretty much take care of itself . However , a chocolate ball helps knock it down pretty quickly . <p> When you get rid of the bombs the candy machine will dispense a solid candy .

Eliminating the blue candy pretty much takes care of itself . However , a chocolate ball helps knock them down pretty quickly . <p> Here is how to beat this level . ( I was stuck &amp; read these comments &amp; they were no help , just people griping ) . I started with a free color bomb from my daily spin . I reset the board until I could see a setup for a stripe by the color bomb . When I combined the color bomb with the striped , it got rid of the stupid tornadoes , and the level was do-able , just had to concentrate on making striped/wrapped combos . I had a couple more color bombs &amp; combined them with blues and could complete the level . <p> What the ? ? ? ? I just cant pass this level and I 'm not paying ! So many people had told me about this game but now people do n't  even bring it up in conversation it was fun going through the competition with others but now its even played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep trying but I wo n't recommend it to others SORRY game people you 've drained us ! ! ! You could come back and make it better LOL ! <p> This level takes a lot of luck but I found once you clear the meringue try and move the candies into the bomb slots rather than just taking out the bombs . That way no more bombs can come down . Then work on getting your wrapped and striped further up the board . It took me a week to get it but it finally worked . Good luck ! <p> Just try to make wrapped candies . Once you make a wrapped candy , try to make a striped one near it to make combo . Do n't  worry about bombs , do n't  worry about getting all your blues . Just make wrapped/stripe combos . <p> I finally got passed everything except I need 21 more blues and have even purchased more moves BUT there are no more blue candies for me to get . If I hit two stripes or whatever and the boRd goes crazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get . has anyone else had this happen ? This sucks and I am DONE with this stupid game <p> CC 425 makes me seriously think about hooking off . I will never pay any money for a game and this level is no fun anymore . No matter what you do you loose . Bombs , hurricanes , impossible numbers of blue and then the striped and wrapped candies are set of just when you have them next to each other . Nah , II can find better ways if I want to waste time . <p> So I JUST got through this level after hell long , one of the longest that Ive gotten stuck at . My strategy was .. to throw all strategies out of the window . What I did ? Focus purely on making as many power candies as I could anything and everything and here 's why . I figured WHATEVER you get , it will either a ) increase your likelihood of a stripe-packet combo or b ) clear the hell out of the screen which will c ) clear as much blues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e ) give you more accidental combos . How ? I did this by slowing down the pace a notch and I noticed combos I might have missed otherwise because I was trying to make the stripe-packet combo . All things considered , it IS largely based on luck but this will help your odds slightly . ( Not much I might add , I finished on the last move , phew ) Good luck crushers and let me know if it helped you , cheers . <p> I agree , the fun is gone . The tornados are strategically placed , not by random as King claims . By the time you make the striped combo you are wiped out . To ALL gamers , quit now before your lose you entertainment and pick up any game except KING . They only want your money . There is no winning this level , the odds are too high so you have better odds playing at a casino . King sucks ! ! ! ! ! ! Not worth the aggravation , lack of fun , and tornados taking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world championship chess match for God , s sake , its a flipping game . King needs to wisen up or they are going to lose more than this player . Ridiculous to say the Ieast. 3 weeks into it.I quit and realized that I really do n't  miss it as much as I thought I would . KING CANDY CRUSH SUCKS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> After numerous tries and lost lives for over a week , I finally beat this level . I changed my strategy to wiping out the tornados ASAP , which worked like a charm . Then I was free to make my combos that actually took out the bombs with each swipe . With one move left I had a color bomb ( luck ) against a blue candy ( more luck ) which crushed the remaining blues needed to complete this level . Its mostly luck people , but once the tornados are out if the way , your chances of winning are much higher . Just wanted to share this with everyone .. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorly thought out . <p> I have hated the Soda Swamp from beginning to end . There is absolutely nothing fun about it . If I should find the next level to be as much as a drudge as the Soda Swamp I will quit Candy Crush and find a new game to play . 425 is utter nonsense . <p> I am STILL trying to get past this level 425 . Have gotten to get all the blue orders but still needed 1 combo . And also the other way around . This one is hopeless ! No matter what you do those stupid absolutely evil hurricanes keep getting what you set up . And the bombs are just sitting there laughing at you . <p> I got lucky after 11 days . I believe it helps to use the striped and wrapped ones in the beginning even if you cant cross them . That will get rid of the hurricanes and gives you much more chance to work the game . <p> I find that when candy crush wants you to win you will win . You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win . I am convinced that the game is programmed and is not random but strategy can help . <p> People , this game is about money , tats why this level is all about luck , u have to pay your way out of here , but i wont , been stuck for 2 months , tbey want u to buy , look at all vids of people who won , they had alot of help , all my friends bought their way out of here , so GOOD LUCK , NOT , have fun play , or quit the game if u do n't  want to pay.or keep playen for fun . <p> Do Not buy one thing ! Its all board placement . Has nothing to do with skill on any level . Do n't  even waste your your boosters . Eventually after 50 or so games , you will get a decent board placement . No game should cost money . They are doing it for their investors and shareholders . No way is it ever going to be easy nor up to date on bug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 days of trial . these are the steps i took before conquering the level . though this level is absolute madness . <p> steps to note : 1 . make sure u reset ur board to be able to make wrapped combo from the first move . 2. try as much as possible to clear the centre and make the strip and wrap combo within the first five move from the start , this wld give an edge advantage 3. focus on the wrap and strip combo 4. once the wrap and strip is completed , try to make a color bomb and try mix wit any strip combo. this is d trick i used but it also requires luck . <p> It took few hours and I passed it easily . At the begining try to blow out the tornadoes with striped candy and combos . Once they r gonewhile taking care of the bombs make strped and wraped candy combostry to makeas early as possiblethan u r left with blue candies.which is lot easiergood luck who r still struggling.come on its much easier than previous hard levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other levels . When you use your three extra moves , of course you bomb out at 36 moves left . Its all a scam programed to frustrate you into buying extra crap that should be free by trading in a point factor . Money making pit . Lol , now I 'll probably never pass this level for complaining . Techs love our responses ; it makes them think they are doing their job , lol , but of course we catch on , the techies think we cant figure this outbooyah busted ! ! ! <p> I have really lost all interest after finally passing this insanely difficult level . Now , I realize it has nothing to do with skill or strategy but all computer programming to get your $ . I passed this level and am on 432 but it really is not remotely fun anymore . Sad because I loved this game <p> Just passed but used 1 lollipop and 5 extra moves which I cleared on first extra cleared the level with 414K points I was struggling here for 2-3 weeks and I am here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like impossible I suggest : focus on combos no matter what then if you need , use lollipops to remove bombs you can do with a bit luck on top a couple of lollipops + some luck is all you need <p> I made it through this level in a day , playing on a computer with no resets to get a better screen . Sprinkles ( color bombs ) and striped combos worked best for me . They often clear the tornadoes along with lots of blue candies. 425 levels to date and no money spent . <p> Wow . After reading the tip to work the combos , and deal with the bombs secondarily , I cleared this level on the fourth try . I had been trying to clear the meringue to get to the bottom row , but that strategy is a loser . <p> I finial clear it after they change the score from 5 to 3 and 230 to 200 . I have not and will not pay one cent to play their game . I found it best the beat the levels late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is a tough level . I stopped playing for 6 months as too hard but my gf was catching up so I gave it another go . First , expect to need 200 odd goes at cracking it . Its a luck slog . Second , you can quit if 2+ bombs get down to 4 in first phase of bomb madness . Do n't  waste your time ( as if that was not what you were doing anyway ) . If you cant make significant inroads into the meringue/grey in first 7 moves quit good decks clear the meringues almost by themselves bang bang . . Once you have space use specials to kill the bombs and tornados . A good deck will do this by itself as long as you go for a low switch at bomb level . After that , use choco bombs to take out one colour this enables you to get the combos you need . At this stage the card becomes peaceful no near as stressy as at the start . Just keep on with the specials , reduced colours with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Summary : i ) Merengues for space , ii ) kill bombs with specials iii ) reduce colours iv ) get combos , v ) Cruise the blues . Do n't  get frustrated its a luck deck level . <p> Hey everyone . its been a long time ago since i finished this HARD AS HELL level let me tell one thing this level is nothing if you wan na delete it then do it cuz you 'll drown in the mouth of the devil after this level im on level 763 and i 'm telling you . THIS LEVEL IS NOTHING ! <p> Finally finished this level after about a week . It is pure luck ! Keeping up with the bombs was the hardest part for me . Sometimes those darned tornados actually helped clear a bomb with only 1 move left ! Good luck ! <p> WOW . I made it on the second try . Perhaps I would have made it on the first try but did n't  notice the bombs there unless it becomes 4 moves left . <p> I was hoping to spend weeks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this even on previous levels . First I was amazed , but then realized , after seeing the tips here , that King has made it easier now . It would have been a hell if the tornadoes wo n't wipe out from stripes and wrapped . That 's the key to make this level a walk in the park . <p> Next the 5 wrapped+striped order now have become 3 . But I do n't  think this helped a lot . Because I made 4 wrapped+striped and could have made another one easily . Instead I focused on making color bombs to collect the blues . <p> What a bunch of whiney babies . 1 . This game is ALWAYS about luck . Its just more apparent here . 2 . Its a game designed to make money . This is NOT news . Its a business ! ( Watch South Parks " Freemium is n't free " episode . Brilliant. ) 3 . Do not buy boosters . I get a free one every day , so that gripe goesnout the window . 4 . Set your phones clock ahead like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you after 424 lvls delete now ? QUITTERS ! THE GAME BEAT YOU ! 6 . Just settle in , have some patience , and remember , rage complaining ai n't  fun , and hinders progress . 7 . If you do n't  want to get stung little froggie , do n't  offer to carry the scorpian across the pond . Good luck . <p> I just.left a rant 20 minutes ago and it did n't  seem seem to post . I went on about how many babies just whine and complain that this level is too hard , that this game is bs , and its designed to suck your wallet dry . I gave them a ton of crap about maybe if they stopped complaining , focused and had some patience , maybe they would beat the level . Then I went to play the level . And you know what ? I WAS RIGHT ! I beat it immediately by following the tips here . There 's no magic , just keep the tips in the back of your head and focus a little . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOO much on the bombs . And yes , there was a lot of luck , but I still thought just ONE move ahead each time in the end , esp . It can be done . Do n't  complain , just beat the game . Hey , that 's catchy . Gon na remember that one . Good luck all . <p> Its totally ridiculous . 10 bombs is no where near enough and to say they take care of themselves is ridiculous . Its pure luck no strategy ! Its pay to play to continue to next level which I refuse to do so Au Revoir ! ! <p> While I agree that the level is pure luck I got it in a Relitively short time ( under a week of playing 2 or 3 times a day ) and without buying anything or using any special items from spins . Only tip I can give is keep restarting the game u til you get a wrapped candy either before you make a move or can get one on your first move . <p> 4 times I got all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from blowing up only to fall short on the blue candies5th time was the charm . <p> Oh and for the record I HATE the levels that are pure luck and no strategynot fun ! This level was nowhere near as the level I was stuck on for 3 months ! 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763 
@@22791962 @2791962/ <h> Candy Crush Level 30 Video <p> Level 30 is an ingredients level , one of five level types in Candy Crush Saga . Your objective is to bring down all of the ingredients . The level type first appears in level 11 and has now made over 150 appearances . In order to complete an ingredients level , a player must bring down the shown amount of ingredients to the bottom of the board . There two types of ingredients are cherries an hazelnuts . For every one collected , a player will receive 10,000 points . <h> How to Beat Ingredients Levels : <p> Wrapped candies will do fairly well for ingredients as well . These special candies will crush a large cluster of candies . Therefore , the wrapped candy should be used close to or directly below an ingredient . <p> Color bombs can also made a big impact in ingredient levels . For example , you can use one to remove a candy immediately blocking your ingredient or you can combine it with a striped candy to pretty much guarantee your ingredients exit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reason behind this is that when they are activated , they will clear out an entire row(horizontal) or column(vertical) on the board . However , since vertically striped candies clear an entire column , they are far and away the best weapon in this level type . Always try to ensure that vertically striped candies and your ingredients are in the same column . When they are , the vertically striped candy will clear drop the ingredient in one swift and efficient move . For better results , align multiple candies in the same column . <p> As you progress further into the game , you will see your ingredients path to the bottom more and more obstructed by various blockers . To combat this , especially at the bottom , make sure to shift your ingredient to the a clear row or column . <p> When I Googled Candy Crush level 29 , this site came up first so I went to it . I 'm so glad I did ! I was stuck on level 29 for 2 days and after reading your tips for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started playing the game 4 days ago and I 'm glad to have this page to help me out now ! After reading your tips for level 30 , I 'm going to go give it another try ! Thanks ! ! <p> I was stuck on 29 for way too long when I found these tips . After reading it I passed the next time I played . Thank God cause I was ready to quit . LOL . Its not fun when some of the levels are too challenging . It makes me want to quit , you do n't  want it to be too easy but you also do n't  want to get to the point where you 're frustrated . That is not fun , and to me they are going to lose a lot of players as I already know a few people who have quit this game saying its too hard . <p> I like challenging games , but when the its computer generated , random results the player has no control over , it leave me to believe there is a problem with the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't  showing up To go throw th whole level and only 2 cherries show up , something is n't right <p> like several other people have said and it is happening to me on level 30 . The ingredients do n't  come . you try every column and still no cherries or acorns ( what ever they are ) . i was stuck on level 29 for weeks and one day i cleared it with 1 move left . just luck i guess . i am glad i found this site because these tips are being helpful . thanks guys . <p> U do not have to buy your way out . I am stuck on it too but my daughter and friends are way past this one . My daughter is on 200 something and believe me she is way too cheap to pay anything . It is random so itdepends on what moves u make and how it falls . Since i really started taking my time to look for 4 and 5 in a row to get the srriped ones and other candy , i am doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and missing some good moves . Patience is the key i think . it is frustrating my daughter called it the devil when she found out i started playing . Lol 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763 
@@22791963 @2791963/ <h> Level 70 Cheat #1 : Save the licorice for last . <p> Level 70 of Candy Crush is very annoying . The second you break open the licorice Xs , that is when the chocolate begins to multiply . <p> Use your first moves to eliminate all the jelly that is above the licorice Xs ( on the right hand side of the board ) without breaking them open . This will make it so that you have less jelly to get rid of once you break open the licorice Xs and have to worry about the chocolate . <p> Power tip : If you do n't  like your board before you make your first move , you can exit out of the level and get a fresh board without losing any lives . <h> Level 70 Cheat #2 : Make special candies on the left because there 's more space there . <p> After completing available moves on the right section of the board above the licorice Xs , move to the left and make special candies . <p> Focus on creating horizontally striped special candies and sprinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right side of the board and prevent the chocolate from taking over . <p> The wrapped candy is useful only when paired with a striped candy , which can clear a lot of the board and chocolate . Always remember that the chocolate will not multiply if you make a move that touches it , so if you have an opportunity to make a move next to the chocolate , use it ! <h> Level 70 Cheat #3 : Direction , direction , direction . <p> Notice if you make a move on the left hand side of the board , the candies will not move down but only give you new ones from the top . If you make moves on the right hand side of the board , you will notice the candies in the corresponding column on the left hand side will move down , and the bottom candies on the left hand side will move to the top of the candies on the right hand side . <p> Noticing this direction of travel can be useful in numerous ways . First , a special candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think is useless can be brought over to the right hand side where it can be very helpful . For example , if you made a vertical striped candy on the left hand side , its not going to help you unless you make matches on the right hand side , which will shift the left hand side down . Once the vertical striped candy has moved to the right hand side , activating that candy will eliminate jelly and chocolate , when it would have done nothing if activated on the left hand side . Do not be tempted to activate special candies that have no purpose specific to your goal on Candy Crush Level 70 ! <p> You can better position your special candies on the left hand side in order to eliminate specific rows on the right hand side that you want them to . An example of this would be if you were trying to get a striped candy and a wrapped candy positioned next to each other in order to get a wrapped and a striped candy combo let 's say that the striped candy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrapped candy . You can look for any moves on either side of the board , including the right side , that are below the striped candy that will move it down one , while not affecting the other column with the wrapped candy in it . In other words , it is a lot easier to place special candies next to each other to create combos when you are aware of the right hand sides ability to shift the left hand side . <p> Go into your phone settings , and change it a day ahead . Open your game , you 'll see 5 new lives . But do n't  play the game yet , NOW go back to your date and time setting and change the time back to the original time . Make sure you change the time back each time you get 5 new lives . <p> " I been stuck for two months " Just Kidding . Just wanted to mock you broke niggas these days . My advice is to stop being broke and stop asking random ass people for lives . STOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your phone setting Scroll down and look for ( Time and Date ) Change your date 1 day head Then go open Candy Crush , you will have 5 new lives . BUT do not play the game yet . Close Candy Crush , and go back to your setting and reset the date back to the original todays date . The go to Candy Crush and play the game . You can do this as many times per day as you like . BUT ALWAYS remember to reset the date BEFORE you play the game . This can also be done on an iPad , Smart phones , and IPhones . BUT not a P.C. Hope this helps . <p> Manually set the time on your device forward under settings . As you repeatedly run out of lives , you can do this as many times as you please . The time being incorrect will disable other apps temporarily . After you 're done with Candy Crush , you 'll want to set the time back . When you go back to Candy Crush , it will say you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are connected with FB , you can delete the app , and re-download it for original timing , full lives , and correct level placement . Everything will be back to normal . <p> Or just delete the app every time you run out of lives , and re-download . ( Bad option without no WiFi ) <p> You have the right idea , but when you set your time , set it 3 hours ahead . Then go open your game you 'll then see you have 5 new lives . BUT do n't  play the game yet . Now close the game . Then go back and reset your time 3 hours back , make sure you set the time back to the original time . Then go open your game and play . If you do it this way your time will never increase into years . <p> I beat it and only got one star and now it seems like its impossible . I do n't  like to move on to the next level without getting at least 2 stars per level . What non of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board and moves are luck . I was stuck on level 65 for a few days , so I would also recommend patience . Luck , patience and combos . <p> That 's a bitter attitude to have , do n't  you think ? Who cares how much the genius of this game is making . Your obvious jealousy at the creativity and business acumen of others is incredibly petty and sad . <p> Not paying I can understand , because you do n't  HAVE to pay to play and anybody that does is , quite frankly , an idiot . But boycotting this game simply to serve your own self-righteousness is pretty pathetic . But hey , more power to ya I guess . <p> there are no cheats just hints , X out and you lose a life you play or pay to get past this ugly level keeps screwing you up on the right side with no combinations and blocking chocs then its just running down the moves and end game . <p> I found a good way to get free lives . Go to your clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candy crush game . Then exit the game , return to your clock and reset your time 3 hours back . The , reopen your game again . Wala 5 new lives . But remember to always reset your time before you use the lives up . have fun . <p> After what has seemed like an eternity ( I think it was a week all told ) I 've finally got past L70 the only tip of use I would endorse from the ones given is to be patient and wait for the combos to line up properly . This is a frustrating level and I agree that its geared up to make you pay to get past it <p> Its easier said than done trying to get those combos.either you have the moves to get them or you do n't  . I hardly ever get the chance to make combos on this level . If I do they are vertical not horizontal to help get rid of the right side . <p> The tips here are all good , but I did n't  end up beating it until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . It took three of my striped candies and moved them to the right . I destroyed all of the jelly with 28 moves left . So , the tips helped , but so did a little luck . <p> This was my easiest level so far . I managed to clear it first time . I tried it a 2nd time and managed to clear it again . I do n't  know why you guys are struggling on this one ? Use the cheats and its simple ! <p> Ive been on level 70 for three days and there 's no hope in sight . My sis has been on it for a month ! I have bought boosters for most of the other levels when I 'm frustrated and only have one or two moves left . But level 70 is n't letting me get even close ! I 'm getting close to just giving up on this whole game ! 70 is n't a challenge , its impossible ! Although I know one person who is in the 200s so somehow he did it . Waaaaaaaaaa ! <p> The chocolate only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and break them on the rows UNDER the licorice . If you can break both chocolate rows the choclate will be eliminated and will not grow . You are then free to play normally . Lilykn <p> first . WELL YOU CANT if you do n't  have the right moves ! ! sometimes i end up getting swallowed by all the chocolare with like 20 moves left . I just keep playing and let the chocolate overtake the board ! ! ! ! ! <p> HEY Beef , This forum is n't for people like YOU who just make fun of people and put them down . YES , I can complain about not being able to pass a level . Just as many other people do here . Hopefully I can get tips from people that may help me ! So , go somewhere else and " troll " . <p> I got through level 70 in a few hours , it was very frustrating until I figured out that you have to take out the chocolate first by making striped candy on the left side be careful as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate then take them out first . Take out the lower level of chocolate first if not at the same time and if you take out the licorice next using the same method the upper roll of chocolate will blow up too .

I know what has to be done but it is all on pure luck ! ! ! I get through the moves then the bombs go . GAME OVER ! ! ! ! ! Im reall getting frustrated . any suggestions ? ? <p> I just had 40 moves left on this level and the chocolate overcame me ! i had no choice . The moves just werent there . If they are n't  there is nothing you can do to pass this level ! ! ! they say get rid of the jelly on the right side first . Well , I never have moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayeb one or 2 that 's it ! this is bullshit ! ! <p> Have people forgotten about the daily prize wheel , or whatever its called , at the top left hand corner of the screen ? Use a special candy you can get from there . The fish are really helpful because they can clear the jelly at the end . <p> I hear what everybodys saying . Strategy tips are useful , but if you do n't  have the colours then nothingll work . Persevered for 2 days , and finally got the right board without buying boosts . If it was easy , everyone would be doing it <p> I have been trying to get past this level for a long time now . I tried to use all the cheats and tricks that I read . But its no use . Even if you clear the jellies on the right hand side and do n't  break open the licorice , if you clear a lot of the candies so they all go down a certain was , the licorice gets broken anyway . <p> Me too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is so unfair . Chocolate keeps building no matter what you do ! ! ! ! And btw , I will rather stop playing than paying ! I still have Word with Friends after all . <p> I was stuck on this level a day , came in here and read what everyone was saying got on this morning and first time I played I got through it , I played the left side and got 4 across and then zapped the chocolate straight across , once that chocolate is gone you are able to play the game <p> I got through level 70 in a few hours , it was very frustrating until I figured out that you have to take out the chocolate first by making striped candy on the left side be careful as you lower them to the bottom carefully line up with the chocolate then take them out first .

In fact I found that if I had a right-side combo that the chocolate would n't reach for a few moves , by holding that back to clear the chocolate when it reached it , I could clear jelly or make candy on the left without too much concern of getting overwhelmed . <p> In fact , I now think maybe the game is rigged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left practically by themselves . Maybe I just finally got lucky , but I just beat the level using this mixed approach after about 10 tries .

But I did win and moved on after 2weeks being stuck <p> For all you players I have found an alternative are you fed up of paying money ( I never have ) waiting for next level ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they make a level you have to spend money on to complete and do n't  change it till everyone complains that they want money back ( not everyone does ) which makes them money . All the people that have given up this game due to one level asked for money back ( how funny when that happens levels are made all of a sudden not impossible ) here is an alternative I love it think this will , given the chance take over candycrush or provide waiting time til next level is actually completed . Skyward Tale check it out , Candy Crush players will find it weird working backwards but it was a challenge , loved it . <p> i was on level 70 for 7 weeks i tried saving my powerups and using them all at once which did n't  work i tried everything i came close to winning several times but did n't  i can say i won today just by luck and that 's all finally its over <p> i played this game for almost 8 weeks i tried saving my powerups and using them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came close several times but never one i finally one its all pure luck its over now 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763 
@@22791965 @2791965/ <h> Level 191 Cheat #1 : First , go for the bombs . <p> In level 191 , its a lot more about luck than it is about skill . Unfortunately , you only get 25 moves to clear the bombs . Thanks to multi-layered meringues , jellies and licorice xs , you 've got a lot between you and the bombs . You 're going to need to use the candies in the marmalade wisely . Try to maximize the impact of special candies by forming special candy combinations . <p> Aim for the sides of the multi-layered meringue boxletting candies into the empty side area will open up moves for getting those pesky bombs . <h> Level 191 Cheat #2 : Then , go towards the jelly . <p> Once you get a good board and you clear all the bombs , this level is fairly easy . Its just about clear jellies . Since a jelly is n't immune to other blockers or obstacles , even small striped candies will do a lot of damage on this level ! <h> Level 191 Cheat #3 : Create special candy combos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through jellies is to create special candy combos <p> For instance , creating a striped candy plus a wrapped candy combo will clear out a large amount of jellies as its effect will stretch acorss the board <h> Comments <p> Theoretically yes . But practically it needs so many of them , and you can make so few of them in time , that it is hardly ever possible to get three of them , all at the right place , before the bombs explode . I made good experience with the use of fishes , after just three games I passes , while I made so many more games without fishes and always failed . <p> Yes , this level is not designed to be passed without paying . Even when the level starts well I had two color bombs and was able to remove two bombs in the first ten moves , but then the usual " King problems " ocurred : NO usable combinations for the next 15 moves . None , not a single striped candy to be made anywhere <p> The only way to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level starts the candies that fall have to unwrap the striped candy in the middle and the combination has to break the majority of the jellies in the centre AND has to uncover some of the coated meringues the coated meringuesif it does n't  do this go to the arrow in the corner of the screen and click the red circle with the door and arrow and get out and go back ( it does n't  use up a life and you can repeat this until it happens ) I was able to beat the level in 49 moves . It is hard and you will need at least 1 striped candy color bomb combo and the striped and wrapped combo and several striped candies ( I also had to use a hard candy hammer ) This level was SO brutal and I 'm glad Im done . I managed to get 307000 points and 3 stars so that 's good . good luck guys . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

Watch this gameplay video . <h> Candy Crush Level 500 Video <p> Level 500 is an ingredients level , one of five level types in Candy Crush Saga . Your objective is to bring down all the ingredients ( 4 cherries , 4 hazelnuts ) and score 80,000 points . The level type first appears in level 11 and has now made over 150 appearances . In order to complete an ingredients level , a player must bring down the shown amount of ingredients to the bottom of the board . There two types of ingredients are cherries an hazelnuts . For every one collected , a player will receive 10,000 points . <h> How to Beat Ingredients Levels : <p> Wrapped candies will do fairly well for ingredients as well . These special candies will crush a large cluster of candies . Therefore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ingredient . <p> Color bombs can also made a big impact in ingredient levels . For example , you can use one to remove a candy immediately blocking your ingredient or you can combine it with a striped candy to pretty much guarantee your ingredients exit . <p> Striped candies are your best friends in ingredients levels . The reason behind this is that when they are activated , they will clear out an entire row(horizontal) or column(vertical) on the board . However , since vertically striped candies clear an entire column , they are far and away the best weapon in this level type . Always try to ensure that vertically striped candies and your ingredients are in the same column . When they are , the vertically striped candy will clear drop the ingredient in one swift and efficient move . For better results , align multiple candies in the same column . <p> As you progress further into the game , you will see your ingredients path to the bottom more and more obstructed by various blockers . To combat this , especially at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear row or column . <p> When candy crush updated the owl and the next 15 levels I seemed to have arrived in the new part without adding the three friends : S but I did finish all the other levels and then I kept going back to level 500 . I passed it a few days ago on my last move . = it took over three months to pass this level . <p> Been here for about 3 weeks now I had once managed to clear all obstacles as well as cleared 7 of the 8 ingredients with about 24 moves to spare . The last ingredient did not even appear until I had about 3 moves left ! ! Not like I did not keep making way for them to be released either ! ! ! : / <p> I really think CCS should come up with a free pass once a month or each account have 3 for a lifetime or soemthing . One could use it to skip a level or auto clear a level will retain the number of players for sure = <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut left with more than 20 moves left and it never came out until I had a few moves left . I had only played the level a few times but now its been a few days &amp; after reading the reviews think I may be playing this level for months <p> I have been on 500 for months . Its just no fun any more . There is no reason for any level to be so difficult . I have even deleted the game but decided to try once more . I loved Candy Crush until I got on level 500 . <p> I 'm feeling the same way right about now . I 've tried to pass with everything I got . Just cant manage to get passed it . I 'm not using money either . One dayiIll get it . I love the game.I just hope I dnt get bored cause Im stuck on 500 . Good luck <p> ive tried this level several hundred times , and managed to get 7 items , but I have NEVER even SEEN the 8th could this be a glitch ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT fine that its unbeatable because of this problem . Even when I have 20 moves left and 7 items out , it never comes down , even with major combos . <p> I 'm now getting very bored with candy crush iwas stuck on a level for 7 months got pased that and now cant do level 500 I do n't  mind hard levels but this one is taking the p### think its time to stop playing the game <p> Just like the rest of you , have been on this level for months now . Too bad I am done with this game now , I have really enjoyed playing it . I really like a challenge , but this is so calculated , and the special candies do n't  take out the cake all the time , too frustrating I hate a quitter but . <p> I just follow the tips on this site . The important thing is " Try not to waste a move on normal matches that do n't help you make special candies . Wrapped + striped , Color bomb + striped " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that kind of person who wants to beat the level without using any boosters just finished it with two lollipop hammers at the end = so .. **40;57;TOOLONG finally after week of horror and disturbia = <p> Yea this level is insanely difficult . Hardest in the game ( I 'm waiting on tickets to level 516 ) thus far . But how I did it I combined the coconut wheel with a striped candy and it made an extra horizontal stripe in place of the wheel and really helped a lot . I got a few wrapper stripe combos and was on my way . But in closing I was on this torturous mentally punishing level for 3 months . I never quit playing entirely . My will was tested like never before . Maintained , was extremely nervous towards the end because I became increasingly aware I had a really large chance of finally winning . My hands were shaking . I leaped in the air after that victory . Pure euphoria . <p> I eventually beat 500 tonight after 1 week of trying ! Its sooo hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake , not the two ! ! However , keep trying , I found 2 wrapped candies helped ! In the end it was 5 extra moves ( 69p ) and a free hand switch thingy that helped ! I never pay for extra moves unless I can see them visible on the board . This is my first post on here ! Hiya CC fans ! <p> I read all the comments regarding the difficulty of this level and yes it is . Fortunately , I passed L500 on my first attempt with no boosters or extra moves with 1 star . The key to passing this level is to try to have your ingredients to fall on 1 side . Make as many vertical stripes and wraps as you can . Use a vertical stripe in the row above your ingredient . When you run out of moves in this area , then use a stripe and wrap combo near the ingredient . Not only does this bring your ingredient(s) down it will reset your board . Hope this info helps . Good Luck candy crushing ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the right time : while the middle column is full of candies , not licorices , and you have a chance of clearing at least one cake . <p> Its more than luck ; I used this strategy and came verrrry close numerous times within one or two ingredients until I actually did get that board where I was able to form enough combos to clear it . <p> Just passed this level after 2 frustrating nights . I received 3 gift hammers for agreeing to notifications for candy crush soda and I had four saved when the opportunity came I whacked seven times to sugar crush heaven . <p> This level made me delete the game after months of trying.then I started over from level one . When I got to level 42 it recognized me and made me go back to 500 . So I tried it and it actually let me pass . Now on level 542. 500 is ridiculous . <p> I have been on 500 for exactly a week , challenging level , but never to give up . You can ignore the cakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its only when luck is actually on your side . I do n't  buy any boosters or lives . Just be patient <p> Weve been dreading this level after reading all the comments , but my wife just defeated it after two or three tries this morning ! No money ever spent getting here , just doing her best creating stripes and wraps/packages . Last fruit came down in good time , with five moves left . A stripe up the row did it with four moves left . Now on to 501 ! <p> I 'm really angry . Have played this level 500 so many times the same thing happens all the time where the last fruit wont come down .. I had the board cleared and had 52 moves left and the 8 th fruit no where in sight , , , , , , that 's me finished with candy crush .. I 'm wasting no more money or time on this crap .

The ball turned all the orange candy to vertaical stripes . <p> When 102 opens for me , I do n't  even have chocolates . I have one row of meringues , then a row of springs and then another row of meringues . The only way I can get the ingredients down is with a striper that will wipe out the row and it has to be an up and down striped , not sideways , which means I have to get it from under , which is nearly impossible .

That is the game though ; some levels need to be hard to keep it interesting . So here is the strategy . Always go for vertical stripe candy , wrapped candy and the 5 in row ones . Try making combinations of these . Best of all if the opportunity is there is to combine two wrapped candies adjacent at the bottom line of the top box . As always you need to be patient for some good luck . Happy crushing . Well done game developers ! <p> It gets boring when you do n't  even come close to completing the level it truly is n't " interesting " when you 're doing the same thing over and over and it is n't " hard " , which implies that skill will beat it , its just whether you 're lucky or not . <p> I have n't read anything positive about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am trying hard not to accepting a defeatists attitude , but it gets more frustrating and impossible with each game .

You have to buy a coconut wheel- or get it free when you win it in the spin . Make sure you select it before you play . It turns the candy you replace it with into striped candies and opens up three rows so the ingredients can go down . The coconut roll reappeared also so 3 more rows opened up at the very bottom . FINALLY ! ! <p> I was able to get past 102 in a few hours and my version had NO chocolates . I was beginning to think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last row before the meringues and create a BIG BALL that opened up the bottom ! !

Or you pay . <p> It does n't  matter how " skilled " you think you are . Some levels are simply gawd-awful hard to beat . You play and play and play and play and keep losing . Then one day stuff starts blowing up left and right , you do n't  even know what happened , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And then comes the next B*tch Level . Play , fold , or pay . Those are your only choices . <p> Been at this for weeks do n't  get more than 3 candies hardly ever and I 'm now bored out of my skull . Finally stopped playing 3 weeks is long enough when you have no luck but there sure as hell is n't any skill in this level . If the candies do n't  line up , then what 's the point . I 'm off . <p> I finally beat this . Keep you drops in the range of a few bars wide from where the first nut appears . That way if you can create some verticals , they will actually be useful . If you drop all over the board , the nut and cherries are all over the board and it is impossible . <p> I cleared level 102 tonight ! ! I have the game with no chocolate . I took my time and planned every move . I had been on 102 for a couple of days . But with patience and careful planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the special sprinkle jelly tonight I cleared the level . Good luck and be patience . <p> I also have NO chocolate , just meringue . Have updated and yet none of my electronic devices have the chocolate . If there is no way to skip it , then I am done with Candy Crush . I have already deleted the game from pad and phone . Computer is next . Last ditch effort to try and find a way to get past this level by reading here . Otherwise , this game is HISTORY for me , going the way of the Angry Birds ! <p> Level 102 sucks , I bought the strip boot x3 for $4.99 , give you 3 games with one or two bombs at boot up , it is a joke , no way to win even you pay for one boot , I guess you need to buy the color bombs too to win . KING LLC is a public trade company lately , their stock went south first day offered , from $19 , the offering price down to $15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where.very disappointed , they not letting you go thru a level , means that they wo n't let themself go thru either . I quit , screw it . <p> Took me about a week with a few plays per day . I enjoy having to practice patience and learn what needs to be done to crack the merangue as early as possible . ( mainly down to luck of the board ) Did n't  waste any of my extra tools until the end when I bashed a striped candy with a lollypop and cleared the last fruit . GREAT ! ! Just treat this level as the pleasure of the ride and you will enjoy it . It can be beaten . <p> What I hate is when ANY level is just ridiculous as you 're not getting any moves and often no choicesthen the last 5 moves , all of a sudden you 're getting striped candies , bombs , etc. so you 'll want to continueCandy Crush makers have definately gotten greedy leading us to other games . <p> This level is ridiculous . At first it was a fun game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoying and a waste of time and money . I 've tried to beat it for months just cant . I spent money to play this game and did n't  mind but I will not spend anymore just to pass a level . Its a ripoff and they know it . That 's why they 've made so much money on it . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

Your objective is to clear all 24 jelly and score @qwx212766 12768 @qwx212768 12771 @qwx212771 <p> Level 89 and any other level with chocolate sucks . I reset 10-12 times every attempt to even get a screen that might have a chance . I get down to 1 chocolate and the controllers of the game make sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate . Same with gels I get to 1 with 10 moves left and no chance to clear it . The one time I cleared the gels on 89 , I was too low on points . They want people to pay to advance and I wont , so I get crap screens . If you have to score a minimum number of points AND clear gels , then enough points without clearing gels should also work . <p> Hi Brian , clearing the chocolates is pesky . However it is also the top priority here . Unfortunately , there is no real trick here other than simply clearing out the chocolate . A wrapped candy or horizontal candy ( In the bottom row ) would be ideal but do n't  count on it . But you are right not to waste you money . If you have come that close before then you can surely topple this level in time . Do n't  give up ! <p> So tonight , I cleared the chocolate in fewer than 5 moves and worked on the gels . Things going well and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get the sugar crush , and am thinking I finally can move on . But wait the stinking pile of human waste game stopped accumulating points at 98,200 . So guess what the game thought I had it too easy and I did not successfully advance . Just another example of the frustration for not paying to play . <p> Ipad on left you 'll see an arrow pointing up &amp; to the right , tap that and you 'll see a red door with an arrow pointing left , tap that and then hit " play " and you 'll have a new refreshed board .

@@22791973 @2791973/ <h> Level 445 Cheat #1 : Leave candies in the corners locked . <p> Take a look at the diagram above . You should leave the circled candies locked . Then when you remove the cream below the lower locked candy , it will cause the blue candy to slip out between the locked candies into one of the inner columns . This is good since as you clear the meringue , you will drop the bombs down and will be able to remove them . It also means that when ingredients drop down from the left and right side , they will also move into one of the inner columns as you clear rows below . This is important since you can not clear ingredients in the outer columns . They must be moved to an inner column . <h> Level 445 Cheat #2 : Move ingredients in the right columns . <p> Make note of where you can clear the ingredients . You can not clear them on the left or right . So if you did n't  follow the trick from the first tip , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inner columns . Do this when you get the chance . <h> Level 445 Cheat #3 : Clear the move bombs . <p> Make sure you remove the bombs from the board before they explode . You can do this either by clearing it with a match or letting it fall to the bottom of the board . The best way to do this is to follow tip 1 and have the bomb move out of the corner into one of the inner columns . <h> Comments <p> Why this level sucks and KING is going down . Requires more luck than skill . Does n't  provide enough moves . To many turns wasted because the Greedy King only leaves 1 possible minimum option . Clearly designed to get player to spend money . Guess what KING ? There are lots of much more fulfilling ways to spend than making your stock holders a profit . Many less greedy game makers are out their with better imaginations than a Tetris ripoff like KING . If you own this stock , dump it before you are left holding nothing <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get some lucky drops and squeak past . But I 'm going on record saying that this level is complete bullshit without boosts . I 've gone through maybe 30 lives and have only passed the bombs on maybe 10 of them . Even once the bombs are eliminated there just are n't  enough moves to get the ingredients off . <p> I think the trick to pass this level is to save up your daily spins for at least 5 lollypop hammers and 2 swaps to knock out both bombs and then focus on one side , using the swaps to move the ingredients out of the end row . <p> This level has been a challenge for me for 4 weeks . There is too much chance , too few moves to set up strategies , and an exit pattern that 's too complicated . I can get to within 1 move of a win and the games over . I do n't  think its winnable without springing for boosters or buying additional moves . In frustration this a.m. , I 1. ) played an entire level without ever seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every single recommendation the game makes to see if I could finally win . Dream on ; 3. ) tried all the strategies listed at the C.C. websites . No go . Its not fun anymore , so I 'm going to concentrate on Monster Busters , which is a more reasonable game . Fun , too . <p> This level is ridiculous ! ! ! ! Even with boosters it is impossible . Not enough moves . Even if you get one fruit through the second has n't  even showed on the board . King is only making money and does n't  care about those of us who want to play for fun . This may be the end of Candy Crush . I am sure there are suckers who will pay to keep playing . No fun anymore . <p> Here is a strategy that might help you beat this stupid level . You need to collect two candy crushers and also get an extra three moves from a friend . Then as soon as you open the game up , take out the two bombs right away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thirty-three moves to work on getting the two ingredients down and out . Good luck ! ! ! <p> This level clearly shows that King rules against the player . Not enough moves to clear this level IF you are fortunate enough to have taken out the bombs . Once again King , you have taken to fun out of gaming . I have quit for 2 months before . This level will most likely take me out of the game entirely ! Too many other NON KING games that let the player have fun and actually enjoy without the frustration . Been on this level for 2 weeks.time to move on . You guys just plain suck ! What were you thinking when creating this ridiculous level ? ? ? ? <p> You waste so many moves by just trying to eliminate the time bombs alone . I think the best way to beat this level is by working on one side only so that both ingredients come down the same column . Once you get them both to the very bottom , use two sticky hand boosters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . Make sure to move the top ingredient first . <p> I have since beat this level using this method . Once you clear the time bombs , focus on the side of the board with the least meringues . Hopefully they both come down on that side . Luckily I had some of those hand boosters from recently winning the jackpot . Just wait for level 463 . That level makes this level look like a piece of cake . Its easily the most hardest level I 've encountered so far ! <p> Congrats and good luck on 463 . Right now I 'm on 471 , which is quite similar to 445 in that you need to make a ton of moves just to destroy the time bombs and then not having enough moves thereafter to bring the ingredients down . <p> This is the worst level EVER ! ! Its beyond ridiculous ! ! If King wants people to continue playing they need to make this game FUN , not stressful and impossible ! ! I , personally , am DONE playing this crap ! <p> I almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ingredient was in the corner column and I did n't  realize it until the very end that it could n't drop down that way . It was so sad ! ! I had a striped + wrapper combo , expecting to win the level , and I did n't  bc it was in the corner column . So , I think this is a good tip . I may have used a free spin-the-wheel item but I cant remember . <p> This level caused me to put the game away for FIVE MONTHS . I just couldnt bear to look at it for another moment . I must have tried , and failed , to clear it several hundred times . When I finally tried again it was business as usual . Days went byand no luck . I was about to say to hell with it , again ! , but tried one more time . AND I DID IT ! ! I sat there in disbelief for a bit because I could n't quite grasp that after six months it was finally over . <p> Bottom line , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose only purpose is to get the player to spend money to defeat it . I , however , do not spend money on in-game purchases for this or any other game . <p> This game is waste of time and king make a lot of people sick and nervous for nothing but stupid game like candy crush please stop this silly game to save ur life and money the king company wants to destroy ur life <p> Wow ! This was a really hard level , and not fun to play either ! The tip to keep the two upper corners blocked is correct . There are n't  enough moves to get both objects out of the side rows , if they come out there , and the side rows do n't  have exerts . . When I finally beat this round , both objects came from the same side , this does n't  always happen . I was able to get them both to the bottom on the second row , then with one move left I used a lollipop hammer to activate the wrapped candy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this level . I only got past both bombs about 25 times . Very frustrating level ! If you can , try to make stripe/ wrapped combos . <p> Too many levels are now down to luck . This level with giving an unusual number like 17 moves before the bomb explodes tells me only one thing . At 17 moves you are likely not to make it . Why not 20 ? . 17 is to stuff the player over . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

I got down to 1 jelly last night , but in the way-too-many games Ive played since , I have n't come remotely close . I have hated a bunch of levels , but I 've never hated a level the way that I hate this . Good luck ! <p> Thanks Tracey : - ) . Just now at the beginning of a game : mystery candies : 6 meringues ; 2 chocolates and 1 bomb ! I am not even going to go on with this one but just end it and start a new one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promise to come back and let you know . <p> Wow . I just passed it too . I kind of stared at the screen in for a minute . After 3 , 3.5 weeks of mostly awful boards , or the game completely freezing when things started to look good , I was starting to feel like I was never getting off . My husband got off on his third try . grr ! <p> I did it , I did it , I finally got through 463 . Funny enough there were still a few meringues left but hey , I am not going to argue about that . This level was really torture and will not be remembered fondly . <p> I used color bomb + color bomb to clear the entire board by an one layer and I still could n't beat the level . 15 moves is simply not enough . I have not spent a single dime on this game and I still wo n't spend any . <p> I have to quite most games with 8 moves left because most of the question mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strategy game if you play and hope the stars are aligned and you get this magical cascade effect . I have n't even come close . <p> Since more lives are required for this level , here is a cheat/tip to get more lives than it gives . When you receive a life from a friend , you can convert that single life to 5 . Here are the steps . * Before accepting the friends request , you should spend all the lives you currently have , otherwise it will be wasted . i.e. just make sure you have 0 more lives . * Then go to the screen to accept the life request . * Instead of clicking once on the " Accept " button there , just click the mouse button as many times on it before it get disappeared . Yes . Your index finger must be very quick . * If you are lucky enough you will get 5 lives from a single life request.That means if you have received 4 lives from 4 friends you can convert in to 20 lives . * Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though you are quick enough , it will only add 1 life , perhaps 2 or 3 . What ever the number it is worth to try . Because you lose nothing by doing this . * Good luck ! <p> * There are some other ways to have more lives . One is , opening the game in two tabs when you have one more life . So you can play two times in those tabs . <p> Major issues with this level . FINALLY beat it , got sugar crush , next screen came up and froze ! Had several times where the game ended because the bomb went off .. no candy bomb on the screen . Twice Ive combined 2 sprinkle donuts , they remain on the screen with other candies on top of them while they pulsate . This level is strictly about luck and the candy cascade . When you need luck on your side , you REALLY do n't  need a malfunction ! PLEASE-candy crush-fix this level ! Oh , and if you happen to use a 3x move bonus , watch out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lower right or left corner , with no way of getting rid of it .

@@22791978 @2791978/ <h> Level 87 Cheat #1 : Make moves on the right . <p> You should first work toward the right side of the board , which will clear the meringue and open up more room on the board for cascading matches . Even after the meringue has cleared , the ingredients can only be brought to the bottom ( right ) through the right side of the board by the green arrows , so moves to the right are always best in level 87 . <h> Level 87 Cheat #2 : Make striped candies and special candy combos . <p> As all other ingredient levels in Candy Crush , vertical striped candies and striped candy combos are the best moves to make . Make a vertical striped candy by matching four candies , with the last one moving either up or down . You can also match a striped candy with another striped candy , a wrapped candy , or a color bomb for maximum effect . Color bombs on their own are also good because they can eliminate a candy of a particular color if it is standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board . <h> Level 87 Cheat #3 : Bring down the ingredients . <p> Since you need to move the ingredients from the left side of the board , constantly keep your eyes open for an opportunity . Although this level moves quick , make sure that you are keeping track of the ingredients . <p> Once the meringue have been cleared , move any ingredients that were stuck above the meringue to the bottom to collect them . <p> What the cheats above do n't  explain clear enough if that you wo n't get more ingredients , until you exit the ones on the board . They say to clear out the right , but do n't  emphasize to do that exclusively if you want more ingredients . Clearing out the left side will not bring you more . Once I figured that out I finished this level after 2 tries ( whereas I spent 50+ trying it the other way ) .

The goal of level 169 is to fulfill three different orders , 1 striped+striped candy combination , 1 striped+wrapped candy combination , 1 striped+color bomb candy combination in 35 moves . <p> In Level 169 , there are a lot of chocolate fountains and luckily , trying ot make combinations to fulfill the orders will keep chocolate from taking over your board but use those meringues in the beginning to your advantage ! The meringues will keep the chocolate fountains from activating so try to form as many special candy combinations within the more-narrowed board while there are still meringues to clear ! <h> Level 169 Cheat #2 : ( Mostly ) ignore the chocolate ! . <p> Unlike a jelly level , having a chocolate on your board in an order level is n't as big a deal . They wo n't prevent you from fulfilling the minimum objectives . Rather than fixating on clearing the chocolate , instead , focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own and having a few on your board is n't a big deal for level 169 ! <h> Level 169 Cheat #3 : Combos make combos . <p> Remember : the more combinations you form , the easier itll be to form more combinations . <p> Do n't  be afraid to use striped candies ! Sometimes , its an inevitability that you 'll need to use a striped candy . Do n't  worrythese are easy to make and replace . Do n't  spend too much time building moves around striped candies . <p> Mathematical thinking ? Not really . This is a game of luck , starting when you have your first set of matches for you . When you sit there and say , " oh , there was a candy ball " at the end , its set there to make you feel like you need to continue because you were close .

Its a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you ! it was VERY helpfull for me .

Thank you/ thank you , thank you ! <p> I believe this level requires payment , I will stop and not play anymore , I have never been on a more hopeless level , thanks for nothing , this is supposed to be not easy but friendly game , sorry I 'm not some guru , I actually have other things to do , FYI I have actually spent money before to advance , no more over it ! ! <p> ENOUGH , 169 is just TOOOO hard . Getting the wrapped candy only happens too near the end of moves thus impossible to match . AND then ! You still have nowhere near the number of points needed ! ! ! And yes , have read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel seem to be stuck on fishes which are no help . Games should be fun , this is no longer fun ! <p> Samantha , your advise to make combinations without breaking ice is worthless , because you don t have space enough to combine anything , and this level is not so harddefinately not harder then 92 , for instance , just break enough ice to have space , then focus on combinations . <p> I am in Level 215 and I am playing Mystery Quest Level 169 for the past four days . Not able to cross the quest . Even if we make the 3 orders , score of 60,000 is not reaching . Low scores for every moves . I think King company is wanted doing this to make us pay money to purchase lives and instant access . Started hating this game <p> For the first time ever I 'm contemplating quitting this game . Its not even enjoyable . I 've had other tough levels but I always fought thru as I like a challenge but this level is just dumb . Ive come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nowhere near the points required .. and btw I 've never paid a penny to advance nor will I. <p> I agree , I 've managed to get the orders a number of times , but it is impossible to get 60,000 points ! you would need a number of chocolate balls and stripe mixes to do it . I do n't  see any way possible to beat this . <p> there 's no reason to spend money .. UNLESS you want too . i 'm only stuck on this for a few weeks as well , i have friends who have completed the game without buying any . its like getting a bad board in bingo . eventually you 'll get passed it .. no need to cry over it <p> This level is BULLSHIT . I get my candies lined up and the game smashes them so of course I do n't  get credit for them.THEY DO NT COUNT . And forget about ignoring the chocolate bc that is a joke . And what really sucks is since the last level I cant even log onto the game using facebook so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by King so i 'm forced to buy shitTHATS NOT HAPPENING . ILL DELETE CANDY CRUSH FIRST ! <p> Anybody who remains stuck on a level for months has problems that go way beyond this game . Anybody who then pays to get past this level should seek therapy . It took me four tries after I followed these tips . There 's a heavy dose of luck required . You need to be very skillful to beat this level , but if the candies do n't  fall your way , it ai n't  gon na happen . <p> IMO , paying to continue playing is like cheating at Solitaire . I just do n't  see the point . <p> It can be beaten . My strategy was to get rid of the meringues to give me more options then concentrate on getting points . Also to always be on the lookout to create wrapped candies . No money , Facebook help or boosters . <p> i beat 169 after playing my life away hardest board ever levels after so easy its weird all i know is i did it yea i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard board and no you do n't  need to buy anything just the right board and an angel on your side happy dance <p> Lol , I just have to laugh at their sample board . I have done this level over 50 times and it is NEVER that easy . So often youl get 2/3rds there with a ton of moves left and then the board never gives you a chance to nail the last one . <p> This level is boring , tedious and difficult .

God knows my time could be better spent elsewhere . <p> I just started this level . . Insane I do love a challenge but this is ridiculous .

They are free . <p> The level has changed . The chocolate fountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the outside . however , this wont make the level so much better . It still has too few moves , and getting some of the required combinations remains a thing of random only . <p> Hi guys I 'm stuck on this level too . Is so frustrating . BUT I have another problem . When I spin the daily booster wheel it keeps telling me it can contact the server and to restart the app . I have done that . turned off my ipad for 4 hours . reconnected to WIFI and it still doest work . Any suggestions ? <p> Be sure to spin the wheel every day to get a free striped candy or color bomb or hand switch or lollipop . At times I 've used those to get out of a level . At present Im dealing with the torment of Level 169 ! <p> I got through this level within 3 lives . The trick is to clear the meringues as fast as possible so you have a larger board to make more combos . Do n't  save your combos in the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12763 @qwx212763

The goal of level 165 is to collect all the orders , ( 99 Blue , 49 Yellow , 24 Green ) and reach 50,000 points in 60 moves . <h> Level 165 Cheat #1 : Take care of the bombs first . <p> The bombs in Candy Crush level 165 only have seven moves before that burst , so anytime one appears on your screen , take care of it as quickly as possible . Remember , compared to fulfilling orders and chocolate multiplying , a bomb getting to 0 will end your game immediately . Luckily , the game should n't have too many bombs . <h> Level 165 Cheat #2 : Control the chocolate . <p> With four fountains , despite the temptation to focus on the orders , keep the chocolate under controlit takes away how many moves you can make on the board and it will prevent new candies from falling . <p> If the chocolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can block the upper tier of the board and prevent new candies from falling . <h> Level 165 Cheat #3 : Blues , blues blues . <p> It wont be hard to fulfill your other orders , the green and yellows will happen either due to cascading or within moves . But 99 blue is no easy feat with all the chocolate blockers . Focus on making blue combinationsnot yellow or green ones . <p> If you 're low on blues , try making combos that will clear out a lot of candies or a lot of other candy colors ( like a sprinkle + striped combo or a striped + wrapped combo ) . <p> This level seems impossible but a lot of people break through so it can be done . The key is to find the bombs , stripes , and wrapped candy and using them strategically . Since there are more blues than the other colors , they have to be eliminated as soon as possible ! <p> Think you can get no help in this game the extra daily spin all I ever get is fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke . Which are no help . Think the designer needs to try and play for himself . Lol reconsider given some more blue 99 is impossible . Help somebody . I will not let this cgame crush me lol <p> That dude in the video got waaay more blues then I have ever gotten , he is n't even good he missed so many moves to create stripes , color bombs etc. people that beat 165 luck out by getting a ton of blues , and the game works on algorithms , spend money get blues . <p> I must say this level sucks I honestly have been on it 5 days and have nerve ever gotten close . those blues are impossible they do n't  drop enough . I have tried everything I possible that can be done Even if you get enough good moves there are not enough blue to crush it . Help someone . I am not gon na be crushed by this game . I had enough level that took me 2 months I will not waste that much time again . Help Hey kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all days playing this even getting extra live from my husband all the time . Help ! ! ! ! <p> Hey Cameron . Forget about the green and yellow . They will be collected as you play along . Try and only focus on blues and clearing chocolate . You can also try working from the bottom to create the cascade effect . Remember , with more candies cleared from the board come more new blues . <p> Not enough blues drop , looks like twice as many purple than any other color . I 've never got more than 70 blues . And the comment of not very many bombs is a joke . Bombs all over the place and getting a blue bomb is pretty much a game ender . The developers need to play this level and make some changes . <p> The frustration is spending too much time on 1 level and the game becomes boring enough that many have given up or uninstalled . Suggest that , makers should allow an easier way 2get through , after playin a level mayb 15 times . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 50 failures . The way to win for me was to ignore bombs and chocolate and concentrate on getting as many stripes and wrapped candies as possible . When they all start to go off you get rid of everything on the board quickly so you get more blues and the obstacles get blown up in the process . That worked for me . <p> This level has to be bought , I am convinced . Been playing it for a while , even with 2 color bombs + striped candies and did n't  make it ! Time to move on to another game . Not enough blues come down unless there is a key to it and we do n't  know it ! <p> I think there should be an option to skip levels after you 've been stuck on them for more than a few weeks . This is ridiculous ! And the makers of the game need to give out more help options than just saying " keep at it you 'll make it " . Give out more help bonuses . The game is starting to suck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my iphone I am horrified to see that it has n't  registered when I play on my computer . Its asking me to still play level 165 .

I was being to think I would never get pass this level but at last I won tonight on my second try using your tips . To all of you do not give up and use the tips candy crush mod gave us . <p> I was trying since some months now level 165 without any success . Just today when I read this blog I thought to try again . And surprisingly I good nearly to the end ( 5 blues remaining with 3 moves , but I could not disable a red bomb ) .

Thanks on behalf of all ! BTW : writing from Germany so it was not only the cold winter in US ! <p> Yes , this is a horrible level.There are too few blues.After being on this level for almost two months I finally passed it this evening.I also did not have to purchase a thing to do so.Thought about quitting thinking it is impossible to complete this level , but it isnt.It can be done.It takes a lot of patience.Good luck ! <p> Play on a mobile . Wait until the drop gives you 96 blue and easy to remove the first bomb . Do n't  collect any greens or yellows deliberately . Do n't  even go for 3 blues unless you reallY have too . Wait for 4 blues which leaves you with another stripped blue <p> I have removed Candy Crush from Facebook and my Kindle . I expressed my frustration to King Games on their web site and did n't  even get a acknowledgement of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a luck of the draw when every 8 moves a bomb falls and there are not enough blues to make the 99 . Done . Done . Done . Games are supposed to be fun and this level has killed my interest in candy crush . <p> Do n't  give up yet ! This is probably the worst level Ive seen yet , but I finally got a board that kept feeding me blue candies . As usual , " tips " and " tricks " are useless because the board is random every time . Just focus on blue , green and yellow and keep an eye on bombs . Other than that you just have to wait for a favorable ( blue ) board . It took me a couple of weeks , but I finally lucked out . Hang in there ! You got this far so you know what 's up . Do n't  get suckered into buying anything and do n't  throw in the towel . <p> I totally agree with not enough blue ones ! I have been stuck at level 165 for weeks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Candy Crush . I HAD been enjoying it but it has become to frustrating . I am going back to Farmville ! I had been playing several times daily , but not anymore ! <p> Do n't  focus on crushing the blues exclusively . First , take care of all bombs as soon as possible . Next , focus on creating special candies and set off as soon as you can . That way you crush more candies total , including the blues , and thereby , more candies appear on the board . It is still hard to get enough blues , but that is what worked for me . <p> I wantt to thank Candy Crush level 165 . I found the level so frustrating ( not the first ) that its restored to me a pleasure I had set aside in order to play this game . Yes !

I have gotten to 17 blue left and ran out of moves . I have even spent money buying extra time for the bombs . I have been on this level over three weeks . its frustrating as hell . I think they want you to buy buy buy in order to get off this level . this has happened to me with a couple other ones and once I bought extras all of a sudden I was through the level : ( <p> Do n't  give up ! !

Good luck guys <p> Still trying to pass this level weeks now . Others on this level will be surprised to read that ths biggest struggle with the level is wait for it an overwhelming lack of blue candy ( shock ! ) followed closely by an accumulating number of bombs .

After reading the comments , I was about to give up for good . I decided to play one last time and BAM ! Got passed the level . I think big candy crush brother is watching me . Or is living inside my brain . Freeeeeaky ! ! ! <p> You need to make a lot of special candies in order to bring down a lot of candies . Otherwise you wont have enough blues . Do n't  worry so much about making blue combos as making big combos that will bring down a lot of candies . If you do n't  bring a lot of new candies to the board you wont have enough blues and you will lose . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

When the dust settled , I had over 600,000 points , with 16 moves left . After that , I was super cautious and only did matches on the top row , just enough to keep things balanced . Ended with one more moonstruck and a final score of 828,000 .. <p> I kept failing on this level , so opted to purchase an extra 5 moves . Somehow , I completed the 160,000 required number , with 1 move left to go . Before I got to use that last move , I watched the screen for what seemed like forever , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last move and the screen kept going until the final score of 17,999,500 . No , that 's not a typo ! Nearly 18 million points ! ! Needless to say , I was number 1 position with my friends . LOL <p> Its totally true though , no cheating , but definitely a one off . After making a certain move , it went on autopilot for ages . I just sat and watch the screen for several minutes , wondering if it would ever stop . Its a one off though , maybe a glitch in e system at that time , I do n't  know , but the moves were genuine and the score was increasing with every auto move . I 'm currently stuck at level 534 , I think . Just cant get past it and have given up , just claiming the free gifts daily . <p> You ca n't beat level 43 , you are suppose to get 160000 points , I got 210000 and it said I failed.I was excited that Ifinally beat that stupid bird and they tell me I failed the level.what kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those levels that you HAVE to use all of the moves even if your score is above 160,000 . If you get above 160,000 before the last move ( which is always during moonstruck ) , then just do simple combos at the top and keep the bird level . Do n't  try to get more points until you 're down to 2 moves . THEN you can blow off everything you can safely ! <p> I finally figured out how to do this level . All you have to do is to not try to get a lot of points right away but slowly chop away at the locked squares but always making sure the bird stays near level . Do NOT blow off color bombs or any striped/wrapped combos . When you 're on the last turn before the moonstruck ( the moon is nearly full THEN blow off something good . Then you only have ONE turn during moonstruck so blow off the best combo you have which is of course safe . While the bird is back , just safely do simple combos near the top always keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combos or try to get a lot of points . When you 're at 2 moves left you 're one move before moonstruck and can safely blow off the best combo you have . Your last move is during moonstruck blow off the best move near the bottom and you have a very good chance of getting 160,000 points and you 're done ! I only got 188,000 points but that was still good for 3 stars and it only took 3 tries with this new strategy ! Good luck ! <p> Mine says 160,000 but I have friends on this level that have passed with 60k-80,000 which I can get with with no problem but how is this possible that they passed without getting 160k ? The most Ive been able to get is 115k without the bird falling off <p> I have been so frustrated with this stupid owl . this level seems impossible to beat but then I figured the owl out under him its blue if you hit the color to his right and the color to his left simultaneously the color will slowly change to yellow that 's when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most points the more moon things you can get in 30 moves I finally just passed this level ! ! ! <p> It took me two days to beat this level but when I finally did my score was 70,959,320 . One move before the end I only had 75000 points and I set off a chocolate+wrapper and started off a cascade that lasted about five minutes . I thought it was never going to stop . There were only 3 colours on the board so I figure it was during a moonstruck . <p> So this is when I call bs I 've got 150 points and I buy 5 moves and on the first of the 5 moves ombudsman falls off and game over . I 'm through that is like cheating and makes you feel that its rigged that 's 150000 points <p> I do n't  understand this level . I have gotten over 40,000 many time without odus falling and have not beat the level . I have also beat the 160000 a few times on the last moonstruck when the owl is gone and failed . wth this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for months . Finally got lucky . Though I used 3x carry on ( had 50 free gold bars ) since I was at 100k already . And somehow it just would n't stop comboing during moonstruck . I was afraid I had to force end my app cause it would n't stop for a few minutes . Which meant I probably would n't clear the level . But glad it stopped . <p> You just have to get lucky . Its 90% luck and 10% common sense . <p> Tip : Pray to the candy gods that your candies keep doing combos while that owl is away . Since when its moonstruck , a few colours are absent . <p> Guys , I strongly recommend you go do this level on Facebook , I play on Nokia Lumia , and I was stuck for ages . The game behaves differently on Facebook as opposed to the mobile version . On my second try on facebook , I got 320 000 points , did n't  have to even think so hard , just make special candies etc and do n't  activate them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12763 @qwx212763

These blockers are similar to a locked door or cagethey will contain a candy or blocker within them but they are locked away . <p> When a candy or blocker is contained in a licorice X , they can not be moved , so you must make moves to accommodate clearing the locked candies . <p> These candies appear early in the game , - like in level 77 , but they begin to really pose a threat in higher levels like 129 and 161 where moves are more limited . <p> How do I clear Licorice Xs ? <p> Licorice Xs ( or locked candies ) are exceptionally hard to clear because any candy or blocker contained in the X is not automatically cleared when the X is ! Any candy or blocker that is underneath a locked licorice will need to be cleared- a second time after you clear the X. <p> As you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the orange candy , you did not clear the candy as well . 12762 @qwx212762 <p> In order to clear a licorice X , you 'll need to match a like-colored candy or with a special candy combination . In levels where you have rows of licorice Xs , you 're best off trying to make a striped candy to knock them out quickly rather than taking them on one by one . <p> A benefit- to the Licorice Xs is that can prevent other blockers from spreading ! If you have Licorice Xs blocking rows of chocolate , the chocolate will not be able to respawn ( or replicate ) until the licorice is cleared . <p> In this gif , you can see once the licorice X is cleared , the bomb-candy is absorbed by the chocolates . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

This is the easy task . But with every move you make on the bottom you have to look carefully for combinations that will make VERTICAL striped candies or wrapped candies . Use wrapped candies only in combination with a striped one ( of any direction ) Also striped + striped combo can help to clear the board when you get stuck . Once the top board has cleared up a bit , you must start making these combinations there , too . <p> I just got it after being stuck here for a week ! There IS a definite strategy , but its a bit counter-intuitive . The " ideal " way is to get a color bomb next to any striped candy and try to get lots of candies the color of the stried one BEFORE you blow up the color bomb . But that takes lot of luck .

S.davie scotland . <p> Stewart go into yor tools and advance the time by 3 hours then open candy crush to the map page you will see you have 5 lives.dont go any further close the app and put your time back the 3 hours but add 1 minute each time you do this or your phone time will fall behind because it takes approx 1 minute to do this . You may find that changing the time messes around with other things on your phone I.e. your alarm if so just restart your phone and it will be fine . <p> when you do the change the time open candy crush but do n't  play it . once open the candy crush get out of the candy crush and go back to setting and change back to the real time . For the solution for the crazy amount of time you would have uninstall the game and connect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Stop do n't  reinstall . All you have to do is go into time and date set it far enough ahead in days that you get your five live but this is an important but you have to not play yet . You close candy crush go back to date and change it back to today . It will go back to today and you will have five lives . You can . Do this simple trick to get five lives again and again . Keep trying I just passed 530 cant wait for more . <p> I have altered the time on my android phone as instructed above several times now and even though I have changed the time back before playing I still have an extended length of time before my lives regenerate naturally . And I believe it to be adding on 180 minutes each time I do it . So I think king have sussed this cheat out and found a way to prevent folk from doing it persistently . There 's not enough hours in the day . But having said that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you reset the time before sleeping then the waiting time should have caught up by the next day . <p> I lost my orig minutes . Had to reload game . I was sent back to 1 and they have to have read tips , cheats etc . I feel creepy , like a its wrong to cheat . I know 70 is making me crazy , king has all but made it totally impossible to w7in . Howd yall do it . <p> Hi fran I was stuck on 70 did n't  think I would do it but a week later I got it I kept getting heaps of lives and determined not to pay for anything keep going then all of a sudden they all lined up heaps of satisfaction <p> Hi the catch is do n't  play the game when you forward the time just log into the map then go out and turn back the clock to normal time , and if its says 180 hrs until next life you need to fast forward days , so calculate how many days in 180 hrs go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the right date , I hope its not to confusing , hope this helps <p> If you do the cheat wrong , you can still fix it back without waiting . So like if you set it 3 hours ahead and go in and start playing before you set it back to regular time by accident , just go back into your clock and set it to whatever is 3 hours ahead of that . THEN go back and click on your Candy Crush app , then DO NT PLAY and go back to your clock and set it back to the regular time and should go back to normal w/ full lives . At least with an iPhone . If you did it a year ahead , set it to 3 hours later a year from now , then go back and set the regular time again . Shouldnt matter as long as you change the time , open Candy Crush , exit without playing , change time back , and go back to Candy Crush and play . <p> follow steps correctly , just set your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hours left , increase some more days ahead again . Now , open candy crush , check your lives , if found full , do n't  play it .. wait for a minute ( internet must be ON ) and then Exit it , set your date back to actual and start play again <p> Great , I went into panic mode for a sec as I played a game when time waz put fwd thn waz shocked to see tht I had to wait 787:45 before renewed lifes but after following ur instructions it back to normal ; ) , , , no more money wasted on buying new life .. ( - ) <p> Go into time and date go past the date you went on open candy crush you know you went far enough if you get five lives . Then close candy crush . Before you play at all and go back . To date and time to change it back to today then play candy crush <p> just set your date 3 to 4 years ahead , and check again , if you still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then open candy crush , check you lives , if found full , do n't  play it . wait for few minutes ( internet must be ON ) and then Exit it , set your date back to actual and start play again <p> If a situation comes that we have to wate millions of hours follow these steps Go to setting date and time and untick automatic date and time Set the daye to 30 years after save it Open candy crush saga there will be full lives Again go to date and time and set automatic date and time If The situation comes again follow the same procedure it also happned with me and it worked <p> Go to your settings , manage applications , candy crush app and clear data .

For those of you who CANT manually change the date and time on phone ( I have the Virgin Mobile LG LS720 OPTIMUS F3 ) , just make sure you are synced to Facebook so progress is saved .

No worries , just sync with Facebook again and you will have 5 new lives at the last level you were at . I notice that it resets the difficulty sometimes since cache is cleared and I get a lot of combos in levels that have ? Candies . Hope this helps some of you ! <p> I went in and used the time settings on my phone so I did n't  have to wait between quests .

I do not use Facebook or share with friends . <p> Its easy just open three facebook accounts where you befriend each account , hence when they say out of lives ask for friends , ask for Facebook friends , log out , log each of the three accounts and help , get back to your original playing account accept the help from the three accounts n u done . <p> Ive been playing candy crush since March 2014 &amp; have been changing the date ahead 1 day when I needed more lives . As of today , when I change my date ahead it reverts back to todays date right away . Any ideas why this has happened &amp; what to do to be able to Change the date again ? <p> My mother is 78 loves candy crush her granddaughter has tampered with her iPad and candy crush game- she now has to wait over 5 million minutes to get any lifes back : that 's over 10 yearsis there anyway I can revert this catastrophe without deleting and then reapplying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make fake fb profile , add it to your friends and you can through that profile send as many lives as you need to your real profile .

I have millions of minutes to wait for lives and can not seem to get it to go back . Any suggestions ? <p> I always just move the day up . I do n't  touch the hours . If it is wed I move to Thursday . Then when I run out of those 5 lives I go back to date and time and move it to Friday except after going back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start playing I go back to date time and put it back to the right day which is wed in this case . So I can move it forward 1 dayplay my 5 livesthen again and before playing the next 5 lives put it back to correct date . Been doing this for a year . The reason I put it back is because for some reason if I keep moving the date up suddenly I get the million hours thingsso I just stick to twice before resetting <p> There is a easier way to get 5 lives on andriod specifically galaxy s3 and note 4instead of doing the time cheat above go to the settings go to the app manager go to candy crush saga click and then clear data click ok and go back to the game connect to fb you should now have 5 lives you can do this as many times as you want umlimted lives with having to change the time . Good luck . <p> Anybody having these issues on android There is a fix .. First off turn off all Internet access which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crush app and change your date to 11:59 am . Wait one minute ! ! ! ! That 's a very important step . If you do n't  wait the minute then it time to wait for lives will only increase ! Once the clock strikes 12 pm then set your clock all the way to 11 59 pm .. Problem solved .. Then open the ccrush app and your lives are full .. Once done go back to clock and set automatic date and time zone . Then once you loose a life you should see normal waiting time .. Turn all Internet back on after all these steps ! That 's it <p> I have done this allot and I tried it again and when I set my clock up 2 hours then go to the game it says I have to wait like over 300 hours , when it should be given me lifes when I go back set time back it goes back to have to wait like 20 min I had to wait 120 now it at 20 what 's going on <p> I have one crack ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version in your android , you may clear its data in the app manager . When you have done this the life bar will be replenished to 5 but you will start from the first level . For you to get on the level you were on before , you must connect it to your Facebook account so that your progress , which is saved on the server , can be loaded on your devise . Try it out it is fully tested by me. 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

@@22792008 @2792008/ <h> Level 33 Cheat #1 : Make striped candies . <p> Since there are so few moves in level 33 , you need to create special candies to hit multiple boxes of jelly at the same time . The striped candies are most effective with this level , because they clear entire rows both horizontally and vertically . The wrapped candy is not as helpful , because it will only explode in the box that you swipe it in . But it is useful to combine these two special candies together the striped candy and the wrapped candy which leads to tip number 2 for Candy Crush level 33 . <h> Level 33 Cheat #2 : Make striped and wrapped candy combos . <p> The best move you can make in level 33 of Candy Crush is swiping the striped candy and the wrapped candy together . The striped and wrapped candy combo will clear the most jelly with one move . Making this candy combo is tricky with so few moves and space , so just keep it in the back of your mind . <p> li&gt;A more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candies together ) , but these are only useful if positioned carefully to hit the jellies . <h> Level 33 Cheat #3 : Start at the top . <p> Clear all the obvious matches on top of the board first , but only if it clears at least 2 jelly squares in 1 move . Next , work on creating special candies and clearing jelly on the bottom squares , while simultaneously shifting candies on the top squares into new cascading matches . <p> Whoever wrote this must have played and filmed the screen 1000 times . There is about as much way to win this level as to win the lottery . The first thing you have to do is clear the bottom squares . That helps to clear the top by the pieces dropping . But the chances of clearing all are virtually nil . The game is set up by mathematical algorithms . Certain levels are deliberately set up to be impossible to beat without paying money . The developers exploit human additive nature in order to profiteer off of it . A person well finally say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 15 million players . That 's $15 million from people just trying to advance past level 33 . So , remember , before you plop down your hard-earned money , just like a carnival game , Candy Crush is rigged , and should be banned , especially by Apple in the iTunes store . <p> If they go for an IPO like other foolish mobile game companies have in the recent past , you can feel confident theyll lose that " $30,000,000 " faster than I can pass level 33 . Also , " making $30,000,000 on virtual good sales " is not the same as making $30,000,000 profit . Its a numbers game they 're throwing out to impress would be share holders who would be about as bright to buy a share as they would to assume the game is actually free . You and Don know what you 're talking about of that there can be no doubt . But in all fairness you have to also consider the cost of business then its not as black and white . Once again I 'll say , if people do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ) <p> I love when people use the word " algorithms " - it makes me think of the scene in the movie Good Will Hunting where Matt Daemons character burns the university dude in the bar for trying to appear smarting that he is in a pompous , condescending way . If it is so silly than why in the f are you reading this blog post in the first place ? ? <p> Don is trying to explain that the game is designed to get you addicted , and then put you in a position where you 'll have to pay to sustain your addiction . And yes , they do that with algorithms . Theyre professional game developers , you know . You 're not . <p> Dude , I have a pass rate of about 33% at level 33 . Its best if you understand how the pieces interact with each other , and what effect they have when combined . You do n't  have to pay a penny to pass the levels of this game , just be smart enough to understand the concept and rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try this game , so I downloaded it . 24 hours later , I had completed levels 1-35 . The next day , I decided to go back and get 3 stars on every levelwhich is how I landed here . Completing level 33 is n't too difficult , but getting 3 stars has proven to be more of a challenge . <p> If you 're the type who ca n't have fun unless you win right away , do n't  play games like this . If you enjoy a challenge , simply keep trying . Quitters are losers . If you do n't  give up , you will succeed eventually . <p> Not my point . I got past the level eventually after about 60 or more attempts . But these are not just random pieces that appear . The game is mathematically set , so that the majority of levels can be accomplished in less than 10 attempts . But interspersed between those are levels that take at least 50 attempts , perhaps 100 . The developers of the game are counting on the fact that many will just pay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem like much , but when you figure that there are 44 million users at present , and if only 1% per day pay $1.99 , that 's $440,000 per day or $166,600,000 per year . So , okay , you say , the developers are entitled to a profit for a clever game . Again , not my point . My point is that the game ( or rather the developers ) cheat . The game is addictive , like gambling . Online gambling is illegal , because the law has understood many peoples addiction to winning and because there is a chance at a return of money . Here there is no chance of monetary return , so it is exempt from the law , but still the addiction caused many people to pump money into the slot machine or , in this case , the candy crush machine . Is it legal ? Of course . But those who are so savvy at the mathematical algorithms necessary to create such levels are also knowledgeable about the addictive nature of this sort of game and so they prey upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . But the game is rigged . <p> I do n't  believe your numbers add up to them gaining as much as that , though your point on their earnings is fair . The game being rigged is an axiom , its a shame others cant understand what you 're trying to tell them . However , I do n't  go as far to agree with you they are preying on people . They are offering a service of mindless entertainment and as you can see by the fans reactions here , its of good value at least to them . I said it before and I 'll say it again , if people do n't  consider what it is you 're trying to tell them , then their idiots . Maybe you and I should get together and try to sell them all a bridge ; ) <p> As I flatter you though I do flatter Candy Crush also as having a successful , and what I consider fair ( for the wise ) game for their customers . If they do go public THEN you 'll truly see the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick they can come up with on their way to the poor house . <p> You seem to keep banging on about the company charging so as people can progress . This company does n't  operate for fun , it has employees to pay the same as your own company . What company exists where staff work for free ? As for not be able to progress from this level , I found it quite easy completing it after 5 attempts . I have since revisited it and completed it <p> Don You are absolutely right and those not understanding what you are trying to point out are either oblivious or too fan stricken to give your argument credit . However , as a person who HATES in-app purchase games I must say I do believe Candy Crush to be fair . Let 's break it down : consider the number of employees this company likely has , let 's say 30 . Say 15 are low wage at $25,000 a year , that 's $375,000 per year . Now 10 at a fairly decent wage of $50,000 , that 's $500,000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them fat cats at $100,000 a year for another $500,000 . Now an advertising budget per year for another $150,000 . Operating costs say $250,000 for rent , cleaning , heating , etc . . . Now out of the 15 million players it is likely they are lucky if they can get a 10% return so that gives you $1,500,000 . Of course they bring in more than that due to multiple points within the game for in-app purchases . I do not purchase any items and I must say I find the game quite fulfilling for the free ride . Your point of peoples addictions is also accurate , but I do n't  believe Casinos are responsible for gamblers addictions nor bars responsible for alcoholics . My point being , I believe this company has found a fair balance for the player where by it can also make good money for its team . That being said , anyone not paying attention to your words of wisdom is an idiot : ) <p> I remember those daysI was determined not to EVER pay a cent for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 400s.not that I was spending tons of $ , but Its ALMOST impossible to get to the end w/out spending a few $ here and there . I say almost b/c I know there are ppl who have done it but most of us mere mortals break down at some point . Sigh . <p> Don Austen You are wrong . Every time some ignorant player whines about the game forcing you to buy adds , the developers have to point people to several faqs and articles that CLEARLY state that CC CAN be finished WITHOUT paying a dime . A person just needs skill , patience and a little luck BUT IT CAN BE DONE . I am guessing that a ) you have either never played this before and are ignorant about how the game and adds work , b ) Have played the game and was ignorant about how things worked and you quit with probably spending a ton of your " hard earned .99 c ) you are stuck in a level ( maybe 33 ) and feel that if you cant do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game is rigged IGNORANT . There are NO unsolvable levels . EVERY level can eventually be done . <p> What makes me think that you did n't  even read the article is the fact that your " strategy " for 33 is to start at the bottom squares . This is not correct . This article and others in similar postings regarding 33 will tell you that you should clear the TOP first and then work on getting striped and candies to take out the bottom . <p> Have some idea about what your talking about in the future before you accuse anyone of cheating . Your call to have the game banned because you are n't  clever enough to solve it is just IGNORANT . <p> Don is n't saying you cant beat it without paying . He s not even whining . He is being a bit naive wanting it banned , but he s just passionate about his knowledge . Calling him names ( or anyone in any forum ) is n't showing intelligence on your part so be careful the rocks you throw at glass houses . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind me being so bold . Don is correct , the game ( and any in-app purchase game ) is designed to make money . However , many apps out there are much worse in their designs than Candy Crush . CC is an enjoyable past time for all and if you choose not to pay do not expect to always have an easy time of it . I find it fine because of the numerous in between levels that are extremely enjoyable . I will take my patience through the " lowered odds " levels and I will not pay . That is because it will be a cold day in he** before I give any game fully funded through in-app purchases my money . Just as Don is passionate about his knowledge , you are passionate about yours and I believe being a loyal fan to something you believe in and enjoy is perfectly acceptable , even commendable . But neither side needs to make a villain of the other ; ) Not Don , nor we loyal fans . <p> Contrary to what Don Austen says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than several tries , and the trick is to create almost ONLY striped candies , wrapped candies and black candies , and combining those whenever possible . With patience you can do this for free . I am now up to level 50 and have never paid . It is addictive , but to me its a fun mental challengethat I refuse to pay for . : <p> I 'm done with this game . Ca n't get by level 29 . I have left a single tile many times and the game refuses to give me the matching colors I need . Played the level more than 50x . Sneaky programming bastards want me to buy something to get to the next level but to them I say , go screw yourself . I deleted it from my tablet and will NOT be downloading any games from the same dev company . <p> when you start you have 3 , they are in the top left of the screen , when you activate them and are going to use it , it will destroy whatever candy is on the tile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will still do its special function ) and if there is jelly under the candy it will also break 1 layer of jelly . <p> I am on the same level and am getting frustrated too . Like I 've said its good for a game to be challenging but when they make it this hard you start to lose interest . I will try the tips Ive learned here and then bye bye . <p> i do n't  wan na give up by saying " oh they are trying to get money boo hoo that 's why no one can beat it , they made it impossible " like , really , its someone elses fault that you ca n't figure it out ? = <p> anyway its fun ! thanks for the tips . tried them all and i am still stuck grr ! ! <p> Game got boring . Fun when you can work at it for a while and solve . Run out of lives and try again tomorrow only good for a little while . Several days and just had enough . I have a life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Feel better already . <p> Yep , that 's how they are going to lose players . Its fine for a game to be challenging but when you try and try and still cant pass it , its just not fun anymore . I do n't  want it to be too easy cause then it would be boring but when you 're stuck on the same level for days and days , it just makes me want to stop and move . Which I will . Soon <p> This is a very interesting post thread . I cant believe I sat and read the whole thing , but two weeks ago , I had shoulder surgery and have been pretty much stuck in a recliner since .

I just give my way more valuable time to my tablet . <p> It was probably just luck , but after reading this , I went back to level 33 and they lined up so that I was able to make 2 striped candies in 3 moves , and then shortly after that combine them . The rest of the moves worked out . I have never paid a cent , and never will . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763 
@@22792009 @2792009/ <h> Candy Crush Level 525 Cheats and Tips <p> These Candy Crush level 525 cheats and tips to show you how to beat level 525 of Candy Crush . The goal of level 525 is to bring down 3 hazelnuts and 2 cherries and score at least 60,000 points in 30 moves . <h> Level 525 Cheat #1 : Get rid of the meringues . <p> The three-layered meringues blocking the dispensers at the top of the screen are your first priority for this level . If you want to bring the ingredients down , you need to get the meringues out of the way . <p> Vertical striped candies are the easiest way to accomplish this goal . Make them as soon as you can and position them below each meringue . <h> Level 525 Cheat #2 : Watch out for bombs . <p> While breaking the meringues are necessary , removing them means you 'll have to deal with an onslaught of turn-based bombs . They vary from 20 moves to 5 moves . <p> You do n't  need to worry about the bombs with the larger number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs should be deal with as quickly as possible . <p> Do n't  worry about wasting time and resources on the bombs . There are no other obstacles preventing the ingredients from reaching the bottom of the screen , so you might as well deal with the bombs . <h> Level 525 Cheat #3 : Make room for the ingredients . <p> Keeping the bombs in mind , the rest of your energy should be directed towards clearing candies and bringing the ingredients down . <p> The best way to do this is to rely on striped candies . Vertical striped candies clear out entire columns of candy , making an ingredients passage to the bottom of the board much easier . <p> Why are no more people complaining . Even if you get rid of the meringues , and you disarm the bombs then you still do n't  have enough moves to get the 5 blasted ingredients down&gt; Because the all wait for each other to go before the next appears ! Give us at least some more moves so we have a chance . I have has several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . <p> This level 525 is a total waste of time &amp; waste of extra lives . I refuse to waste a bunch of saved lives on this . I have plenty of other things to use my time on in between . I guess I will just stay here forever . Lol They have more to loose then I do to be stuck here . Sucks to be them ! Lol lol <p> Level 525 is ridicules . There is no skill , only luck on this level . Once you break the meringues , if you 're lucky the bomb will fall into candy of the same color , if you 're not lucky , then you spend more of the very few moves that you are given trying to destroy the bomb . Then you have a few moves left to try and get 5 different ingredients , that do n't  even drop until the previous ingredient is dropped from the board . Everyone , stop at level 500 , do n't  bother going any further , its frustrating and a waste of time . Find something else to do ! ! ! 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763 
@@22792010 @2792010/ <h> Level 159 Cheat #1 : Work at the top and clear the chocolate . <p> The tip is to try and make your moves at the top of the board since that is where the chocolate regenerates and you will not have any additional chocolate in your way each time you make a move that touches the chocolate . <p> If you ignore the chocolate it could make you lose your turn regardless of the amount of points your score . <p> This means you want to be careful that you do n't  let the chocolate completely take over the top and block new candies from coming down , because you will run out of moves and lose your turn , even if you have scored over 20,000 points . <p> Sometimes you are not given a good board setup , and not allowing the chocolate to cover the top of the board is n't something you can avoid . <p> In this case , if you get stuck with the top of the board covered , try and make a vertical striped candy ( this is determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by how you made the striped candy ) . <h> Level 159 Cheat #2 : Take your time . <p> With Candy Crush level 159 , 2 minutes is actually a generous amount of time . It will allow you to keep the chocolate under control and also take time to plan special candy combos and moves that will score you enough points to get past the 20,000 mark and beat the level . And there are no minimum number of moves ! <p> With Candy Crush level 159 , its not only more important that you create special candies and combos to score enough points , but you need these in order to control the licorice and chocolate . <h> Level 159 Cheat #3 : Make special candies . <p> Do n't  forget about the Sugar Crush that is when you time is up , the level will still detonate all your special candies . <p> This can be the extra boost you need to get over the 20,000 point goal if you are just a small amount of points away . <p> Try and make as many special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to break open the chocolate , score maximum points with your combo , or have them left over for you Sugar Crush , they are what is going to get your through Candy Crush level 159 . <p> Has anyone had this happen ? I reach went over the goal of 20,000 points in 120 seconds and the game told me I failed to reach the points in the allotted time ? ? This is a hard level and to think you 've completed it and have this happen . FRUSTRATING . <p> Are u sure you did n't  run out if moves ? If the chocolate completely covers the top when time is out , does n't  matter what your score is u loose that game . If you make the point and still have time left make sure u have at lease one vertical stripe to brake open chocolate when time is out . Just stop playing and let time run out once you have made the points u need . The chocolate will stop regenerating if you do n't  make moves . <p> HELP ! ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to give up .. i just tried restarting the boards before a started playing each time for better set up to start and before I notice my lives where gone ? What 's up with that ? <p> Since I have been stuck on level 159 for weeks , I have lost all interest in playing candy crush ! ! This is no longer a fun game , it is nothing but frustrating and I am not going to waste my time on it anymore . There are lots of other games to play and you do not have to spend a cent in order to win .. enough ! ! ! ! <p> I finally passed this level by combining a WRAPPED CANDY and a COLOR BOMB . I literally won this level in 15 seconds ! ****** On a side note , if you are on a site that gives you HINTS , read them completely before you start whining about why you did n't  win after reaching the level requirements ! *** BTW , The 3rd bullet down TELLS YOU EXACTLY WHY <p> had to buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to clear the chocolate like I thought I did , once a used a color bomb , got thru the level with no problemotherwise couldnt come close to getting enough points 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763 
@@22792011 @2792011/ <p> Theres two ways to go about the level . The first is to free up the coconut wheels , move it left or right , and use them to damage the meringue blocking the vortex . <p> Use this method if you are having a hard time getting through the meringue and are worried about running out of moves . It should save you some turns . This is a surefire way to make your ingredients get through to the next board . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

There are two conditions to using this wheel : you must be connected to the Internet or cellular data and you really can only spin once a day on either Facebook or mobile . The lives refill trick of setting your clock forward willnot work with the booster wheel . <p> Do n't  feel alone . I did n't  receive this booster wheel either and I 'm connected . All my friends were hooping and hollering at my house on thanksgiving when it became available but I did n't  get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says the one whos constantly on here trolling and insulting people behind his/her computer . I 've seen a few of your unhelpful comments on here . You seem really obsessed with this game and site hence all the pointless coments you make . Why waste your time ? -- Candy crush is not only for children any one can play it if they choose to.My kids and i love it . Kindly get of the internet , grow up and let ADULTS do as they feel . <p> Thank you i hope this helps too . From a candycrush player who gets out a lot but enjoys this game when they 're not busy with work or the kids . <p> Beef curtains : I have a one year old and he loves watching mama play candy crush . My mom and grandma are awesome and they play as well ! So maybe YOURE the one who needs to get out more and meet new people = Instead of sitting on a forum meant to help , not harass . Sorry this is what we do in our free time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing that you cant respond to someone without an insult . I feel sorry for you . You must be a very unhappy person . Its interesting that you did n't  post a picture of yourself . Go ahead a TRY to insult me again . I am sure that it will be vulgar because people with weak minds and low intellect can not express themselves any other way . If you were a person with good character , I would care . <p> I hit the jackpot today ! Before I hit it the wheel would slow closer and closer to it to the point that the day before it landed right after the jackpot and before that right before it . Today it hit the jackpot it took 20+ consecutive attempts til I got it ! <p> No way that 's possible ! ! ! ! ! ! ! = Ive hit stop to hit it exactly and the damn thing passed it and landed after and the next time stopped before it , without slowing down enough like it usually does just to avoid it . TOTALLY RIGGED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a whole year laterI too had complained about never hitting the jackpot . I NEVER pay money to play any games btw . I actually did hit it about 2 weeks ago on my tablet ( was out of town , I usually play on my laptop ) . No foolin . I 'm sure it will be another year or ten before it happens again . <p> Since you 're only allowed to play once a day , I 'd like to know how you had 20+ consecutive attempts in one day . I 've spun it almost every day since it became available , and Ive never gotten itagainst ALL probability . <p> @everyone. this rebecca person claiming to hit a jackpot is clearly a candy crush employee and lying . Have a look at their profile . Theyve had discuss for an entire year and has only made 2 comments . this comment on candy crush was the users FIRST comment ever . Put 2 and 2 together . <p> Me too . I was almost not looking intentionally , lol . Thought-Im out of town , maybe that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got distracted by a phone call . And there it was ! I 'm sure its a once-in-a-lifetime thing . Ca n't have 8 sections and only hit 7 of them for two straight years <p> that 's funny me too ! Matter a fact about 1-2 months ago I set phone down while wheel was spinning 10-15 min later I hit stop and boom I got the Jackpot ! Only 2nd time in the few years I have been playing and I am at lvl 1119 . <p> I have gotten the jackpot ONCE I am on level 816 and play this game ALL THE TIME daily . I spend money too . A friend of mine has also gotten the JACKPOT once . It is possible , RARE but it will happen sooner or later . <p> Everyone seems quite distressed about the booster wheel . I just started playing Candy Crush a week ago , and I 'm ridiculously hooked . Lol . I get the booster wheel every 24hrs . I was only getting the jelly fishes ( Boo ! ! ) and the color bomb ( Yay ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was beginning to think it was rigged , too , but I just got the hammer ( Yay ! ) . Anyway , its working fine for me . Maybe the game does n't  work well on different iOS versions ? <p> I normally play from browser , Chrome and regularly collected all kinds of boosters . I played from an Android tablet this week . None of the boosters I collected ever showed up that I could see . Now I do n't  even see the wheel on my browser . Where did it go ? <p> I do n't  get jackpot either . Either side of it , it will bounce back to but never on it . If anyone ca n't get a booster or the wheel at any time or they are getting error messages that they are not connected &amp; to try again later . I was told that I " MUST " sign in thru Facebook if using my mobile device to play my game . So far , I 've had no problems getting my daily boosters . Just NEVER the JACKPOT.I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigged to make us think there 's a chance of getting it . Oh well , I save mine up so when I hit a specially hard level like the one Im having a hard time with now , level 323 . I 'll collect them for a while so that when I got a bunch I 'll just go gung ho &amp; keep playing 5 at a time . Meaning , a Bomb , a set of Fish , a set Stripe/Wrapped , a Switch Hand &amp; a Lollipop Sucker .. Five at once should do it along with 3 Extra Moves that Friends have sent me a bunch of for that Level cuz Ive been on it so long . LOL ! ! <p> I 've played for about the last month , had about 15 color bombs , so odds figure 1/2 ; gotten the hammer about 3x so odds fig 1/10 ; jellies 5x approx. 1/6 ; switching hand 3x so fig 1/10 ; double wrap 2x so1/4 CLAIMED all prizes but from what I can tell odds of winning jackpot are 0/100 . Most of the time I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop on . It seems to go around 1 full time , unless you stop on the jackpot in which case I normally get the fingerer hand . If anyone knows the TRUE odds , or where to hit stop would be appreciated . <p> The odds of hitting the jackpot are exactly the same as hitting the other spaces since they are all of equal size . Thus , the fact that most of us have NEVER gotten the jackpot despite playing daily is enough proof for me that the makers of this game are not dealing fairly with its players . <p> I hit the JACKPOT but now my iphone has locked up . I click away from candy crush &amp; when I come back its still there- frozen . How do I get this off my screen just so I can play ? screw the darn jackpot.anybody ? ? <p> I actually got the jackpot last night , and got 21 boosters-just like the description above ! So often the wheel slowed or sped up as I approached the jackpot , so I figured it was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift ! <p> I got the jackpot today . I figured it might be computer rigged . I figured most people hit the stop button rather fast . So I counted to 60-Jackpot ! ! Du n no if letting it spin for a minute had anything to go with it . Be interesting if it works out for any body else . <p> I cant use the wheel today for some reason . I have n't used it yet . Also I agree it is rigged . My wheel looks like its going yo land on a great booster then dramatically stops on the hammer or colour bomb <p> actually you can get two boosters a day if you play candy crush on your mobile phone and on facebook . Just press on the wheel at the same time on your phone and on facebook . Do everything exactly at the same time . It works . I do this everyday . And for the jackpot . Its rigged . You will never get jackpot those pathetic losers ! <p> Being one who believed it is totally riggedafter about 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes it is rigged meaning it does n't  come up as much as a color bomb , but it does come up . Kinda like the big Vegas jackpots , huh ? Cept its free . <p> I was using the Booster Wheel successfully then i connected to Facebook and then unconnected to it . I now can not use the Booster Wheel , it says I have to connect to Facebook.I do not want to , so have I lost the wheel ? ? ? ? <p> How come when its abt to stop on jackpot lt alrdy slowed down almost to a complete stop then it jumps to the one next to it its rlly annoying that I always get . The coconut wheel and the lollipop hammer please fix this bug <p> I am on level 655 and I play every day with very few exceptions . I also soon the wheel everyday that i play and I have never , ever hit that jackpot . Why put it out there if it is virtually unattainable ? <p> I hit the Jack pot also . Only once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got way more than 3 . I know my color bombs were 15 . That was the most I got , the least was hammer and I think I got just a few of those . I figured the game glitched and that is why I got it . Havent gotten it again and that was a year ago . But with the wheel , I 've managed to keep my boosters stocked ! = <p> FIRST of all.people , its just a game , second , even if you never hit the Jackpot , you still get a free help which I for one , have used to my advantage when I got stuck on a level . And lastly , it takes 2 seconds to do . If you are playing C.C. you do n't  have anything better to do for those few seconds anyway . <p> Having seen the many comments about the wheel , and those saying its rigged Of course it is , the game is designed to cost you money , why would a company who relies on " in game purchases " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now for a little over a year , and I play everyday , I have also spun the wheel everyday since I discovered it and I am yet to get the jackpot ! ! But its a game and does n't  really bother me , what I would like ( sometimes ) is the ability to skip the annoyingly difficult levels ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> Sad to say that I have played the jackpot wheel every day in 2014 . That would be 282 attempts in 2014 . I have never landed on the jackpot . With a one in eight chance , you would think that I should have won the jackpot several times this year . Since the wheel is obviously rigged , makes me wonder how many other aspects of Candy Crush are skewed in favor of King . <p> I have come to the same conclusion because of the laws of probability . Plus strange things happen with the speed of the spinner if it is about to land on the jackpot . Also , there are times when I have only 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet nothing comes down that I can use until I have only a few more moves left then suddenly the color I need appears . If I just had one or two more moves , I could clear that last jelly . Wait ! At that point , they coincidentally offer to sell me the moves I need to clear that level . I would say that that is an example of how this game is skewed in favor of King . The only reason I keep playing the game is that my competitive nature wants to be the highest scorer among my family and friends on each of the lower levels . <p> oh you know its rigged ! you can take this here booster wheel to heart ! this is you honest to God prime example of how gambling is for designed to rip you off ! Its a suckers game ! Do n't  be a sucker . Jesus is the only way ! <p> I 'm not surprised that I 'm not the only one who has never hit the jackpot . Since each space has an equal chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shouldve hit the jackpot many times by now since I 've have landed on the others many , many timesalthough some of them more than statistically I shouldve , such as the hammer . The spinner either suddenly gets a burst of speed and leaves the jackpot when it shouldve stopped in the space or it slows down quickly and stops in the spot before it . Apparently , the Candy Crush people think were all idiots and wo n't notice that weve never landed on it . Oh , wait ! Maybe we are all idiots because we continue to play a game when we know that the makers of it are n't  playing fair . <p> I have been spinning the wheel for a little over a year and finally hit the jackpot ! Thank you king ! It does change speeds everyday but it will eventually get there . The winnings gets three of everything on the wheel.i see people get very upset at this game but its a challenging game of strategy and you need patience for this this game and yes it can be won without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has taken me awhile but 8 still keep plugging away ! <p> I cant figure out how to make the candy switch booster work . It is not documented anywhere on this site . When I hit one candy then another they light up but do n't  do anything to switch . How can I switch two candies ? I 'm on Level 170 , and I could win it if I could make it work ! ! ! <p> Jessie I agreethe way the wheel is spinning . just when it goes to stop on the jackpot it suddenly drops back to the spot before the jackpot . This is so rigged worse than tbe slot machines in Vegas . I 'm close to deleting the game off my tablet and not playing it anymore . I use to pkay it lots and now I go days without playing . I do however spin the wheel . Again its same old same old . <p> I finally got kicked out of the daily booster wheel as others have complained . It no longer " permits " me to enter into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FB . Whatever .. Big surprise I got locked out of the booster wheel shortly after I sent back their survey questionnaire . <p> IT keeps re-writing the code to force people to buy boosters . I have finally uninstalled this junk game . I would not mind a few advertisements in lieu of wallet gouging . PLENTY of other free games even if they are not as flashy as CC . <p> The shit is rigged .. I hit a jackpot in the first week of using . havent seen one sense and I play pretty much every day , it was well over a year ago when I started 1 in at least 365 ? Do the math its rigged And if the booster wheel is rigged you better believe that the game itself is rigged ! <p> I have gotten the jackpot ONCE I am on level 816 and play this game ALL THE TIME daily . I spend money too . A friend of mine has also gotten the JACKPOT once . It is possible , RARE but it will happen eventually . <p> Totally rigged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umph to tick to the one behind it even if by all other spins it would have just stopped . Likewise , if you 're on the one just before its gon na tickover to JACKPOT it promptly hangs on the notch like its gon na go over but never does . It only gets the extra umph to tick over ONLY if its already on JACKPOT .. Ive been close to jackpot several times now and it always goes the same way . If they think this is gon na get me to purchase anything , lol they have another thing coming . I 've never gave them a single cent . I 'd rather just play the wheel for 2 weeks and then play the game . This game is only a 10 minute time filler for me and I 'm rather busy . <p> It is rigged as I landed on the jackpot today after spinning the wheel for two years , I was so excited and cant wait to find out what the jackpot wasnothing , zero all I got was spread the word , so I did to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was that NO jackpot prize just the game starting over again 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

This is honestly the first level Ive every felt is unreasonable . Other levels have been very tough , but I just do n't  see how this one can be done . Anyone ? ? ? Help ! ! ! <p> Level 276 is the reason i will probably remove this game from computer and phone . 300 blues in 40 moves . Impossible . I saw a walkthrough beat it by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bombs on the rescreen . This is not only unreasonable it is impossible to even get close . Dumb move as its not even tempting anyone to spend money . <p> Exactly . I 've seen other people complain how other levels are " impossible " and Ive thought , " they just do n't  know how to play " . 276 is ridiculous . I have never paid a dime to play this game , and as far as Im concerned , if I have to pay to pass the level , its not happening . <p> they gave you for free the new booster just to pass that level .. and i made it in my second try using it i think . if you allready used it and did n't  make it then yeah u will have to buy it to finish the level . but that 's just becouse u did n't  had the proper skills to make it with the free ones ! <p> Same here , I do n't  think it can be done without spending money on boosters and if that 's the case and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could do is about 160 blues , that 's not even close ! ! Its a game only , and as addictive and fun it is to play , I think it will turn many Candy Crushers away if this was done to get our money . If its just a glitch , here 's hoping that it will be fixed ! ! I 'm not paying ! ! ! ! <p> I consider myself to be a great Candy Crush player and even after 1 time playing this level , I knew that it was absolutely impossible . I 've tried close to 100+ times now and I cant get more than 170 blues and that was with 3 balls mixed with stripes . This is the end for 99.9% of us I guess ! <p> I beat it , on my third try . The key for me was to match the chocolate candy balls with the color that appears most on the board , but NOT BLUE , and not ones that Odus is balancing . Do that as many times as possible <p> Dreamworld 276 is physically impossible without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one extra moonstruck . This opened the screen up enough to allow for there to actually be enough wrapped , striped , and super candies to wipe out the necessary blues . That tells me that it would be SLIGHTLY more possible with an extra moonstruck near the end . With just one incorporated moonstruck , it is physically impossible though . Ive been appreciative of the continuation of the wheel for free stuff . Its helped on some pretty " impossible " levels relying mostly on luck to win , but there is no way I could get enough free extras to beat this level . The most I have cleared is just over 150 blues . I had multiple super candies and wrapped/striped candy combos , and STILL only half way ? Yeah . Pretty impossible . I 've never seen a level like this . <p> I have passed level 276 in dreamworld without paying or boosters ! ! ! ! I think they fixed it . I had combined two chocolate candies , which pretty much opened the board . I had lots of chain reactions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare . I am so glad that they fixed it ! Good luck ! ! <p> Hate to switch topics but can anyone give me sound advice on level 272 ? I have tried all different ways to beat this one but it is nothing like 272 in the regular world and the bombs are hard to avoid . Most amount of items I got down was 4 and 4 with no moves left and of course u have to mind odus ! Whatever advice anyone can give would be great thanks ! <p> I beat 276 on my third try .. but 277 is hard as fuck .. the same colors every time , even when they fall its still the same pattern and I can not figure it out.I am waiting for more levels on the regular one to open up <p> OK , I passed this one month ago , but it was so hard that when I finally made it through , I copied the steps down and sent them to a friend . I 'll copy them here . FYI when I was playing this level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and everyone i talked to said the same thing , so as long as you have the same patterns , this will work for youl <p> My game came up the exact same every time with Otis falling over green and orange . If you have the same game showing up for you , there are 6 columns . There is a purple one in the first column , bring it right to the second row to make a striped candy . Then go to the 5th column and pull the green candy over to the 4th row , crushing the green and bringing the blue down to the bottom . There is a blue on the bottom row , bring it up to the second row , crushing a column of orange . The on the top row , you can crush the purple and on the third row you can kill the green In the first column , bring the blue from the second over to create another striped candy . Bring the purple down to crush the bottom row with the striped candy . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonstruck , you just want to avoid killing orange or green unless you can crush equal amounts of each until you get to the moonstruck . When you get to the moonstruck level , there should be one blue candy stuck on the column where the wrapped candy was . Do NOT try to crush . Once it is gone , then timed bombs will begin to fall .

@@22792019 @2792019/ <h> Candy Crush Meringue Blockers <p> Meringues are a blocker in Candy Crush . They are often confused for whipped cream or frosting .

Grow up . <p> I am on Level 109 right now and I bet I have lost 100 lives since starting it . It is impossible to win unless you get the striped candies or the special one . By the time you do , time is up . You need to give more time or make it less impossible especially after trying so many times as I have . Your other games are just as bad . Such as Pepper Panic Level 48 . How can you win when you can not get all the colors , and nearly every time I play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't pay a dime for these games . They are suppose to be entertaining , not difficult . It is not like you win anything except the level if you get it . Please make some changes . <p> I always reset my board till I can start with a striped candy or candy sprinkler.I have ccombined MANY combos , horizontal and vertical and sprinkler . NOTHING touches the side candies or bombs ! They keep counting down and exploding . Ive read hints several times and horizontal candies are supposed to get rid of the bombs and side candies . WHY isnt it working ? <p> I feel the same ; it is starting to be no fun , which is what this silly addiction should be . This level is a tad too over-complex , and leaves you with one jelly on top level . Also , I have never not had a life deducted , on my kindle fire . <p> i 'm on the edge of quitting . this game is ridiuclous , there is no mathematical solution to it , simly not every game can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get . sometimes you only have one possible move , which will not do anything at all . the bombs can be removed , but even tho i have 20 more moves spare , i still can not reach the top jellies , making a horizontal striped candy end up two lines below the jellies , whis is impossible to bring two lines up to destroy them . This level is simply ridiculous one nees to be lucky <p> What a stupidly ridiculous level . I say sack the programmers . I will not spend a single penny buying gold bars or lives . Just make the levels easier you bunch of over paid techie nerds . Do n't  forget , without us , you would n't be multi millionaires . <p> I 'm giving this level 2 more days before I give it up as a bad joke absolutely pathetic no skill that beats it , so unfair , it must be made this impossible so that people will buy their way past it , I wont be doing that plus I am sending a complaint to facebook about this game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have to say that , for the most part , CC is pretty awesome . Most levels are extremely clever teaching you how to maneuver the candies or some other skill . Lots and lots of skill . Also fair amount of luck in the harder levels . Very , very addicting . Best cheat is to wait for a promising looking starting level . and keep restarting. do n't  spend money , though imagine this is next to last level you can get for free . <p> However some levels seem boringly unskilled the luck component too large . And some levels are too easy the game does n't  get continually more difficult in fact some of the most difficult levels were earlier than this . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

Man , if only you knew . <p> Could you explain in more detail what you mean by targeting a specific colour . I tried that but I must be doing something wrong as it did not work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not work either <p> Target one candy type with a colour bomb then , if this does n't  create another colour bomb , target another candy . You 'll very quickly get another CB made remember that CBs make more CBs very often . Once you have created enough CBs then end the game with a double CB attack . <p> I tried two strategies , yours which did n't  work three times , and then I went the other way , tried to remove all color bombs as quick as possible , so I had plenty of moves left to form the remaining six color bombs . Not an easy task , but on the second try I had made it , and still a couple of moves left So , three stars , that 's all i want <p> People are finding level 202 difficult because it IS difficult ! ! I have tried what was suggested here and it just wont work for me ! Targeting a specific color does n't  clear the board ! Most of this game is luck , anyway . Sooner or later you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Amen , Angie ! I 've tried concentrating on just one color , and some of the other suggestions . Havent won this level yet , but none of those ideas have worked for me . I have gotten the board down to just one more CB before running out . <p> I finally got through this level , Vickie , but believe me it was not due to some magical formula ! ! It was luck ! ! Its all in the way the colors and pieces fall . Now I am on level 254 and I cant get past this one ! Why do I put myself through this ! ! LOL ! ! <p> I finally got through it , too , and it was pure luck for me , too ! Most of the hints posted made no sense to me , but I did n't  feel compelled to get hateful with the people who were trying to help . Glad you succeeded , too . = <p> Okay , I 've upped the chances of me getting down to 2 colour bombs slightly , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What Rock City Clasher is telling you is only partially correct , perhaps he knows this , perhaps he does n't  , but there we go . So , do n't  use all your colour bombs in one big bang , yes . Target one candy colour at a time , yes . HOWEVER , when choosing a candy colour to target with one of the colour bombs , do n't  just choose any old colour , look to see which colour has most pieces on the board . In this way , say if green has 15 colours on the board and red has 9 , if you choose green you get rid of more candies and therefore have more room for , hopefully , an incoming colour bomb to appear . If Rock City Clasher knows this , but has n't  told you , then he s obviously trying to present a solution without actually letting you get the solution so to speak . In that way he can keep on flaunting his ego and looking clever . But there you go , that 's how you increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I can see at least . <p> Why do you feel the need to attack me like this ? Youve added really well to my explanation but for reasons that I can not fathom , you 've decided that I 've kept some details back intentionally to prevent other people form succeeding . What on Earth is your problem ? Why not be pleasant to people and about people instead of deciding I have an ego I need to flaunt ? Typical troll . <p> I freed one cb then used it to wipe out one color then freed another cb and used it to wipe out another color till I was able to make a cb . I kept doing that until I went through all the trapped cbs . That left me only needing one cb Nd 19 moves to get it . Got the last cb with one move to spare . <p> LEVEL 202 COMPLETED ! ! ! ! ! As I suspected , Rock City Clasher was n't telling you the entire truth As I said below , do n't  use all your colour bombs in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HOWEVER , and this is the bit that Rock City Clasher did n't  tell you , when choosing a candy colour to target with one of the colour bombs , do n't  just choose any old colour , look to see which colour has most pieces on the board . In this way , say if green has 15 colours on the board and red has 9 , if you choose green you get rid of more candies and therefore have more room for , hopefully , an incoming colour bomb to appear . I followed this strategy . It did n't  work the first time , but on the second attempt I managed to position a group of blues in a way which I suspected , with some hard thinking and intricate moves , I could get another blue on one side of the four blues ( notice that when I say four I mean three in line with a gap and the fourth hovering above the gap . ) You then have to negotiate an extra blue , in this situation , on the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side , which will create a three in line and knock the whole thing out . So I was doing this and also trying to maintain a nearly similar pattern among the greens a short distance away . Through carefully juggling the moves in this way I suddenly noticed I had managed to create a row of five , with one of them hovering out of place just above the gap . BINGO ! ! Just slotted into place and that was my last colour bomb completed . RESULT ! ! That 's how you do it . Hard work but determination and following this strategy should get you the result too . <p> And again , pointless personal attacks . You really do have some issues , do n't  you ? I was not intentionally not telling the whole thing , I just explained it the way I did it and did it several times . You need to take a long , hard look at yourself . Being a pointless troll really is n't an attractive trait , even though it may make you feel all big and clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doable . After several hours of trying and reading several tips here I finally did it . My first goal was to clear the meringues but while doing so trying to not make any 4-candy moves and also taking my time so not to miss any 5-candy opportunities . I was able to create two color bombs before using any that were already on the board . I then used all the color bombs one at a time trying to not use any on the striped candies because that just creates a whole new board with too much variety that you do n't  want . Between each move make sure to scan the board for any opportunities to slide a candy in between two sets of the same colored candy . Sometimes you only need to do a bit of shifting candies to make that happen . That was a major part of my winning . Remember all boards just are n't  winnable no matter what you do , cut your losses and try again . I hope my suggestions help and Good luck . <p> Thanks , Clasher ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what you suggested , but on my 4th try , I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it worked . ( Where were you when I struggled with level 201 ? ! ) <p> I just passed the level , and yes I like Rock City Clashers basic idea , but I had to refine it considerably . Its fairly easy to explode the 19 given Color bombs , but you 'll have to create 6 additional CBs to " fill the orders " . The odds are astronomically against even 1 CB falling into place by itself , but if you spot a horizontal pattern of two like pairs separated by a single different , you have a 1:6 chance of success by sliding the missing color down from above , and another 1:6 chance of sliding it up from below . OR , if you can make a vertical triple anywhere in the column between the two pairs , you have another 1:6 chance of a making a CB . Altogether that gives you 3:6 chance of success for ONE bomb . <p> Btw , I regularly use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see good opportunities to clear at least 5 meringues right away . <p> Now the revelation for me was that we can control the board better if make mostly VERTICALS triples ! I 've gotten pretty good at encouraging that pattern of two pairs separated by a single space . now its just a matter of <p> Thanks Rock City Clasher . Ive been on this level for over a week now but I followed your advice and cleared it first time . I also scored the highest score ahead of all my Facebook friends . Such a shame that others take such a bitter attitude towards someone who is only trying to help others . Jealousy is such a destructive emotion and not worth responding to . Ignore him . <p> Whew ! After reading all the comments , I just conquered the level . I used each of the color bombs to clear a color from the board . Each time I tried to choose the color that there were the most of . And then a couple of plays to make the group of 5 , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb this way gives you lots of opportunities , and you only need 6 . I am thrilled to move on ! <p> Thank you for the excellent suggestion on using sprinkle candies . I am getting closer . I have one question . When I am out of sprinkle candies and have 30+ moves left.should I keep playing in hopes of getting more sprinkle candies.or just give up then and start over ? In other words .. is it worth the time and moves in hopes of getting sprinkle candies ? I appreciate your input . <p> Thanks Rock City ! So simple and it worked ! Took me like three tries . and I really was convinced that this was a level I was going to be stuck at forever . The tricky thing with this is that you have to sort of play different than you do on other levels you do n't  want the most bang for your buck slow and steady wins on this one.this is what worked for me I did the individual colors one at a time and made sure not to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was so engrossed with the bombs that while I still had a lot of bombs on the board.I did n't  keep a close enough eye out for opportunities to make new bombsGreat tipthanks for taking the time to share it . <p> It is not true what you said " As shown in the screen shot , after activating a sprinkle candy + a striped candy , another opportunity for a sprinkle candy is available right away " . I have repeatedly smashed a sprinkle and stripe but another sprinkle never comes up nor an opportunity to create one . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

Focus on looking for wrapped candy formations . <h> Level 245 Cheat #2 : Keep your eye on the bombs . <p> The candy bombs in Candy Crush level 245 have 12 moveswhich is generous and let 's you be able to play the game without worrying about a bomb exploding . Keep an eye on the board to look for bomb combinations to clear them but do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of them . <p> The bombs will help you keep an eye on the board and let you not fixate on one areaitll also give you the chance to keep an eye out for wrapped candy combinations . Think of them as an asset for observation ! <h> Level 245 Cheat #3 : Break the ( risky ) mystery candy . <p> The 200 and 300 levels in Candy Crush Saga are ripe with a new kind of candythe mystery candy ! These question marks can bear good things and bad . <p> Theyre colored like normal candy crush pieces and can be cleared but when cleared , they give you a random itemit could be a multi-layered meringue , a licorice swirl or chocolate , it could also be a jelly fish or color bomb ! <p> Take the risk , though , its worth it in this level , especially if you get a wrapped candy . <h> Comments <p> I spent $$ on this level . Including $3.99 for 15 extra moves and still only got 4 combos . Done with this . I hated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level and move on to a Strategy Level , its worth it . This is a snake level , mainly based on chance not so much strategy . I think its aimed to get lots $$ from you , I spent $10.95 on it . I deleted Candy Crush from my iPad . Good Bye , Good riddance . Ciao , etc. : o ) <p> I feel the same way . What used to be fun has turned into a $$ game that I will not participate in . Deleting this game from all my computers , phones , etc . And for the person that passed with 3 stars , good for you , are n't  you special . do n't  believe it for a minute ! <p> am so DONE with this Level ! ! ! Already had a few Friends quit because of itand I am right on their heels ! If it does n't  clear by late tonight ( Friday ) .. I 'm deleting it off my computer AND my phone ! ! SO DONE ! ! <p> I am done with Candy Crush ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impossible ! ANDI will not buy my way through a Level ! ! After 2 weeks+HUNDREDS of Livesand Countless Hours ! NOT worth the mental aggravation ! ! .. its only a GAME ! . and I was getting tooo frustrated ! ! Good luck to all those that continue to play even into the over 500 Levels ! <p> The only thing that makes this level hard is trying to keep the bombs from blowing up and your wrapped candies , even though its very hard to get a wrapped candy in the first place .. but yes its only a game , walk away take deep breaths and go back another time , I wont let it beat me .. Ill probably quite at some point but not ready to give up just yet ( Italic is from typo ) <p> I saw a video showing how to win this level . Shockingly , wrapped candy after wrapped candy appeared on his screen . None of them exploded by themselves and he ( I 'm just using that pronoun ) never used a booster . And lo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they never detonated on him before he could find a match . Needless to say , I simply do n't  think that was real . I find that the more time you spend on a level , the more boring it becomes . I quit right in the middle of a game now when it becomes apparent that I could never make the matches necessary . <p> I have been on this level for 9 months and spent no money . Every time i get a wrapper it always just blows up without me making a move . I also beat it twice and it never moved to the next level . i am QUITING <p> I did break the level 245 twice now but still i cant access the next level and it keep saying that there will be more land to explore and says that i can still replay the previous stage.Can somebody help me about this ? <p> Its easy to say do n't  give up when u all made the game where it is almost . Impossible to beat , maybe u guys should reconsider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REASONABLE , that 's all we r asking ! If we did n't  enjoy the game we would n't be playing but come on u know as well as I do that it should n't be required to do so many of the combos with fewer turns it would make it a little easier and quicker to move on to the next level and continue plating YOUR game . If not ur gon na lose a lot of people . YOUR CHOICE <p> I beat Level 245 in 2 days and used no money ! do n't  give up ! ! You need to make a wrapped candy and striped combo off the bat it usually clears a path for more wrapped ones to fall down Also try to collect coloured bombs and free prize lollipops to clear a path to the mate . Take a chance on the mystery candies many times they have a wrapped in them . Also a bit of luck with a good board is needed but when I won and came in second I had to strategize &amp; make my first combination ! Good Luck ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make a wrapped candy , " everyone keeps saying . Well what about when you make one and then go to put it beside a stripe and it crushes because of some stupid method you cant understand ? I wish I had some of these crush and wipe methods on other levels that need them . Here you make a wrapped candy and it crushes before you even get near a stripe ! I 'm about to delete this silly crap also . A game should contain a largely workable strategy . This game is too much chance . I could go to the casino for that crap ! <p> I have been on this level for sometime . Waste of time . You make wrapped then they are surrounded by the same color so you ca n't move in any direction without crushing it . Or a mystery candy comes up wrapped right before you crush it with a striped . Waste of time . Just deleted it goodbye . <p> I passed the level and it only took 4 tries . I followed the advice of making the wrapped candies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even use bonuses . Wrapped candies are n't  that hard to make if you look at the board carefully and plan your moves . Its not as random as some people think . Patience people patience ! <p> had twelve goes it this , , , , came here for tips , , , saw the make wrappad candy first tip , , , did it first go and did n't  make first wrapped candy until move 26 , , , , after that each combo seemd to make a wrapped candy and had luck moving stripped next to it , , , on 4th combo and only three moves left the combo created a wrapped and stripped right next to each other , , , <p> So glad I looked this up ! ! ! Using the strategy of looking for or forming the wrapped candies 1st help me get through this in 1 game ! ! ! Thanks for the tip . It may have been a by chance of luck that my last board help me to get through . My whole strategy . Was wrong thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abt 3 days . Unlike others . Dnt quit try looking at the boards differently now . Form multiple wrapped ones first the maneuver the strip ones to get to the wrapped ones . Took all of 3 mins for me to get through that level . Again thanks ! ! ! <p> 245 is hard , which is why I came on here yesterday . Yes you do need to get wrapped candy first as they are harder to get , but you can only get them through a combination of thinking about it , and the game actually giving you the opportunity to do it ! Keep trying , you will get there in the end . Its taken me a couple of days , but tried five times this morning then i did it . Yay : o ) <p> I am at level 245 and can see I am going to be stuck here , mainly because this level apart from making a wrapped candy which either gets blown up , a bomb explodes game over little chance to get a striped next to it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no strategy and is based on pure luck which one can wait for weeks to happen . <p> In an earlier episodes there was a similar objective to hit a number of wrapped candies and suddenly the games object was changed . I hope King decides to do the same with this level because I am not going to pay and frustration is not my game and I will say goodbye as I am sure many players have done so already <p> This level is me out too . Spent FAR too long on it without ever getting close . I 've tried everything I can think of , and those of us who have come this far do know how to play the game ! Too random , too difficult , infuriating and ultimately frustrating . Might need a rethink from the developers because you know what ? Lifes too short ! <p> I was a Candy Crush fanatic until I got to level 245 and now Im turned off of this game and I an very disgusted with this level . I expect challenges but this is ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , on any other regular level its impossible to get 5 wrapped/striped candies now they want it all on one levelvery disgusted with this level and I am going to delete . <p> " concentrate on making wrapped candies " pointless statementif they are not there to be made how can you make them ? then when you do manage it they are crushed before you can use them ! . level is unreasonably difficult imoseriously losing patience now . <p> Just did this with 24 moves left , no boosters . Obviously luck was involved . Stop whinging about it being a money grab . I 'm at 246 without spending a single penny/cent on this game . Some of the levels are easier playing on a PC through Facebook than on mobile version . <p> Watching this video , its seems to be too good to be true . For some reason the best opportunities to make the combos are happening in the first moves on here already , something which has never happened in more than four weeks of trying the level myself . Five times I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then things went downhill . Bombs that just couldnt be removed because there was no other color just near to it in all 12 moves or the wrapped candy exploded because the same colored candys fell down from above , something which nobody could ever foresee or it was impossible to get an striped candy near the wrapped one . The moment that you get a wrapped one in the first few moves of a round you can bet your arm that the next steps are getting even harder and that you 'll never ever come even close to hit more than 2 combos at maximum . I 've tried every strategy and nothing works . The mystery candies are almost always chocolates for me , or stupid other blocking things I cant use . Whenever you come close to hit the last 2 combos you 'll get bombs in areas where there is no chance to get either striped candies or same colored candies close enough , no matter what you do . Coincidence ? This level has nothing to do with thinking it through or strategy , its programmed and predetermined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no riddle . I will stop playing this game . <p> Level 245 is evil ! I spend so much time on keeping the stupid bombs away that there no chance to get the 5 combos . Which is in itself not easy . Just as you delete one bomb near the top the other already pops through . No fun at all ! <p> Okay just my second day playing level 245 , and here are a few of my tips/observations . Most of the time if you combine a color bomb with a striped or another color bomb , it will produce 1-3 wrapped candies ! This is just like getting a mystery candy which is wrapped . Also Ive noticed it is very difficult to locate/position a striped candy piece , once you 've found a wrapped piece . Instead of wasting precious moves on this , start immediately forming other striped candies elsewhere on the board , and another wrapped candy will suddenly appear . <p> BTW , to anyone that continues to gripe about the difficulty/futility of these levels , get over it , learn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity is doing the same thing over and over again , hoping for a different result . I have spent as long as 3 weeks on just a couple of levels , but this week alone I went from level 201 to 245 . Patience , persistence and willingness to try new methods is the key to quickly get to level 600 . <p> Paying for anything on this or any other game , even $1 , is pure insanity ! ! ! <p> This game is about luck.bad luck ! I have been on Level 245 for a while now . I have tried endlessly to beat it but cant and I will not spend money on a game . As for the cheats on this website , it was useless . There is nothing on these cheats that we do n't  already know . Not even sure why it is called cheats . I 'm about to give up Candy Crush because of this level . Each day I play less and less.some days I do n't  play at all anymore . I think it is time to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this level . Im refuse to spend another dime on CC . I understand its trivial but damn u get all the way there but u need to buy extra moves that is BS ! Stop cheating us out of our money and fun for playing the game ! <p> It took some time , but I finished this level in less tries than level 244 . Just work on setting up wrapped candies and hope you get lucky with the bombs , because that 's your only hope . It sucks when you have to use a ton of moves just to explode a bomb . This is one of those levels that is meant to break you down and buy stuff , but that just makes me more determined not to buy anything . I 've had my butt saved by items Ive won on the free wheel , but I 'll be damned if I 'll pay to play a game that 's advertised as free . <p> Been on it about a month or so and its got me beaten , sad cos i loved CC , if only they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i know what i 'm doing , if you only had to make 3 matches it would really help . <p> This is a hard level , but it did n't  give me as much trouble as some before it , or after it . From the comments , it sounds like some people are making the wrapped candies and saving them until they have five , then going for striped candies . Of course the first combination you explode will take out all ( or most of ) your hard work . Work on a wrapped , then work on a striped to match it with . Do n't  save a wrapped candy for later . Even if you 're good at spotting moves ahead of time , luck is still a huge factor , so be patient . But do n't  say its not possible because it is . <p> I know as well as everyone else that the makers of the game ( who have NOTHING to do with these pages , btw ) , are trying to get people to pay . That 's what makes passing a difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level 266 and havent bought a thing . I 've beaten a couple of levels with things from the free spin wheel , but I have n't paid a dime . This is n't impossible , or even the worst level , so stick with it . Or do n't  . But stop with the melodrama about never playing again and getting ripped off . It discourages people who really would like to try . <p> Level 245 sucks , screw candy crush for making a completely unimaginative peice of crap level designed to either push people to buy their boosters or give them a wake-up call to uninstall a game app that has as much relevance as a conversation with a house plant or a fresh coat of wet paint on your bathroom wall <p> I just made it through this level after only a couple of days . If I can do it , you all can . I just kept resetting the board until I could make a wrapped candy with my first move and it finally worked out . Do n't  give up ! <p> Do n't  give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was impossible but its not as I got it . It took me weeks and I did not play the 5 games every time as it was so frustrating , but I just kept trying and lo and behold it all came together . Stck in there . Good luck <p> I am frustrated trying to get wrapped candies then have them blow up . It should be fun ! They just made it too hard . I am playing less now . I like Charm King , Farm Heroes , Juice Cubes and Forest Mania . They are challenging but not impossible . <p> well after reading all these comments I do n't  feel so stupid for still being on level 245 . It seems so impossible to combine the wrapped and striped candies once , little lone 5 times . I have studied the cheat tips , and they make it sound SO easy .. I wont give up just yet ( only been on it 1 1/2 weeks ) .. I have found most times its a matter of getting the right board , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. I also cant imagine being on the same level for months , where is the fun in that ? ? ? I shall see I suppose , I will come back here and post when I beat this level <p> I swear King is monitoring my internet bc whenever a few weeks go by when I 'm stuck on a level , I come here and read the " tips " , and read the complaints , then I always beat the level right after . Just happened again . I got a little lucky , but going slow , starting with a ready made wrapper , and thinking a lot got me through it . Good luck to all . DO NT SPEND MONEY ! <p> So , I 've been here for a couple of weeks . I 'm sure I beat this level yesterday and here I am again . It really helps to read your comments to know were all frustrated . I feel much better . It is just a game and , guess what , you just progress to another level that frustrates you also . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , so it gives you a break once in a while and I have n't read any complaints about that ! So its raining and here goes . I only spent .99 on level 70 but never again . <p> I thought i 'd seen it all but this level i think has really got me wanting to quit playing candy crush , been so mad i couldnt see straight so many times i cant count em , but i still persisted.this level i think is the straw that is going to break the camels backI really have n't even tried that hard to beat it , i 'm just tired of the constant " impossible " boards that they throw at you , threatened to quit a hundred times but this time i think i 'm done.have fun everyone.see ya .. <p> I was stuck at this level for about 3 days . I finally cleared it today . This is one of those levels where you need some luck . I was able to make the wrapped candies and for the final combo i did use the swap non matching candies booster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't spent a dime on this game yet , although my 8 year old daughter did spend about 70 bucks when she got on my account last year . Luckily , i was able to dispute the charges and get a refund . <p> I 'm getting tired of this level.been on it off and on for a month.Im in dream world now and cant get to new level till I pass level 245 . just when I have 1 combo left I run out of moves or get blown up.this level SUCKS.now Im stuck in both worlds <p> UnbelievableI just came onto this site to find out how to get through level 245 without paying , just went back to Candy Crush and sailed through 245 after being stuck there for 2 months ! ! ! ! They must have realised I was getting seriously pissed off and about to delete the game ! ! In can be done and without paying but not by skill unfortunately , just luck this time that all the sweets came up easily ! ! X <p> Took me a couple of days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did beat this level with 10 moves left . It is useful to think of it as a challenge to learn how to make wrapped candies more readily . Do n't  give up , and just really focus on making wrapped candies . It helps to have free lollipop and/or hand boosters saved up . Sprinkle candies can also be used to strategically set up candies beside each other by clearing a color in the way . <p> Good advice here , people . Last summer I got frustrated and started paying and I felt sick about it . Really . Its a silly internet game that was getting my money . So wrong , so I quit doing that .. but not until I spent a good amount . I 'm not proud of that but I 'm not a gambler and I got sucked in .. so again , I 'm glad to read most all whove posted have had the good sense to not pay BUT if someone will get me past level 245 , I may pay you ! <p> * do not worry about making the wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bombs soon they appear <p> * make as many stripped candies you can and try to align the next to each other . Then , combine them to have a big swap and the wrapped candies will fall down and you will have a bunch of wrapped and stripped candies to combine more easily <p> * to achieve the above , also extend your number of lives forwarding your clock , so you do n't  need to wait 30 minutes to get more lives <p> * DO eliminate the bombs soon they appear or they will be isolated and detonate fast , unless you can combined stripped candies to wipe them out <p> I do n't  buy anything and I did finish this level in a day of playing , once I figured out the stripped candies combo was the key to beat it . <p> Hi guys , So I was like many of you and gave up 1 year later I rejoined the battle because of my work being super slow ! LOL . Anyways , I noticed my facebook account skipped the level and let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my phone I could n't play the current level 256 .. I had to beat this .. SO I bucked down . Looked up any " stratagies " realised there really is n't any , except luck . If you get a t formation within 5 moves , you are on track to beating the level .. anytime I got to about 25 moves left , I would quit and start over again , maybe to some of you this is bad advice , but if you have to get five and half of your moves are gone its easier to start over ! Trust me ! Beat it today on my 4th try . Good luck wrapped candy is the key ! Try making the formations .. DO NOT make stripped until the wrapped candies are made ! ! <p> FINALLY ! Finished this damned level . Had one combo to go with 4 moves left and thought I was once again going to be denied . Right at the last moment I noticed a setup for a wrap . Then to my amazement , there was a setup for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat this demon spawn level . <p> By far the hardest most maddening level so far in this game . <p> A tip ? Focus on the middle of the board . Try to always take something from the middle 3 columns every move and you 'll make a lot more wraps . Also fire cookies immediately to remove a color from the board . <p> This level is all about perseverance and luck . I had been on it for about three months before I finally beat it . I had only 3 moves with 1 combo left to create when I just happened to miraculously get a wrapped candy with a stripped above it and with only 2 moves left I beat it ! It was 100% luck . So if you stay with it , eventually you will win <p> I am so done if I do n't  get pass tonight I will tell my friend not to ask for livees or help there feeling the same level 245 is stupid I cant get 3 candy srips and wrap let alone 5 I have tried for so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game forever <p> This is the stupidest level I have played , wrapped candies are blown up as fast as I make them . Then when wrapped candies are finally made if is hard to make stripped candies . I have been trying for weeks and will delete this game soon , tired of this ridiculous level , its no fun any more . Level 245 ! <p> This will be the day that I quit CC ! I mean , not only is it hard to get those combos , and get them close enough together , but then if I do n't  estimate the move correctly , more than I need will will drop down and they land in place for a fraction of a second , and then do their own bursting without giving me the points ! No wrapped-striped effect but lots of candies going off all over the place . And then there are the freaking bombs going off . Ive attempted complete turns just getting rid of the bombs ! Why did Satan help invent this one ? <p> The tip is spot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulating striped . Take your time .. you have to learn how to make wrapped , and this means often planning 2 or 3 moves ahead . This is a much slower process than in another previous game Ive done so far , and I think the only way to get through it . Took me about 15 tries , with 9 moves left , and what was learnt in the process will be useful for future levels . I have not spent a cent so far on candy crush .. just be patient . <p> This game is a scam . Several times I have made stripe/wrap combo but the game does n't  give me credit for it in the score . You cant win this game until they want you to because they cheat . I 'm done playing this idiotic game . No fun when they break the rules . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763 
@@22792057 @2792057/ <h> Level 197 Cheat #1 : First make vertically striped candies . <p> In level 197 you can not make any moves to eliminate the jelly until you unwrap the marmalade-covered candies . So your first moves should be vertical striped special candies that will hit any of the 6 columns that contain the marmalade . Once you have broken the marmalade , you can swipe 2 wrapped candies together as a special candy combo . This will trigger a chain reaction that can explode all of the remaining wrapped candies on the board . The columns closest to the center of the board are the most effective in clearing the most jelly . <h> Level 197 Cheat #2 : Focus moves on the bottom . <p> After you have utilized all the wrapped candies on the bottom half of the board by following tip number 1 , you should hopefully have a high number of moves left and a pretty decent amount of jelly and meringues cleared . Your main focus should now on making as many moves as you can on the bottom of the board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is difficult to position special candies and combos in useful ways . Even making regular 3 candy matches will keep opening the meringues in order to clear the jelly stuck in the border . Ideally you want to special candy combos in the bottom of the board , but if you cant just make any moves you can until a special candy opportunity appears . <h> Level 197 Cheat #3 : Use the best special candy combos . <p> The best special candy combos to use in Candy Crush Level 197 depends on which half of the board you in . The sprinkle candy + striped candy combo can help you on either side of the board , so if you have no moves on the bottom this is a good combo to make . <p> A wrapped candy and striped candy combo is very good at the bottom of the board since it will hit all rows and columns that contain jelly . Activate this combo on the far right and left hand sides of the bottom , since it will clear the most jelly with one hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the far edges of the board . <p> A wrapped candy + striped candy combo will help you on the top and the bottom of the board , but it is n't worth wasting moves to get this special candy combo at the top of the board . It will only clear 3 columns with 1 hit . <h> Comments <p> this level is about to make me quit , I spend a lot of money and time playing this game and to be on a level over 5 months is ridiculous how do you expect people to play and enjoy it if all you are trying to do is get them to buy stuff . every game I get a buy this popup from you guys . i 'm about to quit <p> I do not want to play a game that is simple and to be honest the hard levels keep me playing . Its not the game its you bud . Im stuck on this level but i do n't  whine about iti want it to be hard and i do n't  want the level spoon fed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quit crying and go play a baby gamemaybe get a leap-pad or something lmao . <p> Neil , the only thing that is frustrating a bit tho is that some level need mostly luck to get achieved .. too easy is surely more fun but when its ridiculously hard ( and by that I mean , its like lotery , you wait the right time to get the lucky combinaison possible ) <p> A hard core gamer will play ANY game , in any format , as long as its challenging . To me , the real challenge of CCS is to beat it without paying one red cent to King . If its too " simple " a game for you , go back to sniping in Halo and stop being so butthurt over the label " hardcore " . " Time passer " , maybe on lvls 1 100 , but the real game doeant begin until lvl 101 . <p> Haha really ? Hvnt you stiil noticed that this game is made to be like that ? To make you buy and buy more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few level and wince then hvnt purchased anything from them .. <p> Ups , I just made it in my second attempt . Yes , it is not easy , but you should be able to make a vertical striped candy on each side on the top and use it , afterwards combine the two wrapped candies on the bottom part , and then it is just a game of luck if you can get another striped plus sprinkle candy combined to clear the rest . <p> Hang in there Casey . I just completed it after about 5 tries . Used 2 lollipop hammers to start out and get the marmalade and then 1 more to get the second to last jelly . Got a lucky drop on the last jelly . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

I tried for months no matter how well I played the bottom center and crossed fish with stripes , a blast would occur and drop a bomb . Once the bombs appear , you 're screwed . <p> I have spent a couple of weeks on this level , like I have any of the other hard levels . I have gotten it down to 1 jelly &amp; even 2 jelly a few times . Just now I thought I had it ! Got all the jelly , but the bomb was at zero , too ! This level is absolutely maddening ! ! ! I might have to quit on this one . <p> ive been stuck on 275 for 2 weeks ive tried all the tips nothing works : ( ive been playing for 4months and have been stuck before but at least you could see some strategy nohing works for this level fron hell <p> This level serves no purpose other than to exasperate its playersso theyll ante up money to purchase extras . The stupid bombswith a whopping 3 moves eachare morale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , at least for me , no matter what I do to actively AVOID revealing them , something ALWAYS happens and there they are . Sometimes on my first or second move . That sucks . <p> I refuse to spend a penny buying extras , so that 's not going to happen . Much more likely I 'll just quit playing . <p> FWIW , I have no problem at all PAYING for games , and actually prefer to play paid games . I do n't  like ads , and I do n't  like being pushed to buy things in a free game , so I normally choose paid games . So its not like I 'm cheap , its just the principal of the thingif the game is free , it should be FREE . And levels should have some strategic valuewhich 275 definitely does not . <p> i played this game to no end but i noticed that when i played on my computer it gave me 8 tries in the upper corners but when i play on y cell phone it only gives me 3 , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to WIN the game in no time ! ! <p> So I have been stuck on this level for months now and have refused to play it until today . When I started the level , I noticed that in the top corners the chocolate has been replaced with double layer meringues ( on my computer , I have n't checked my phone yet ) and I beat the level on the first try . <p> Finally cleared this level after about 2 weeks . Like with many CC levels , all of a sudden things just line up and you 've cleared it . Keep trying . <p> I really did n't  focus on clearing the lower center , just not exposing the corner bombs and hoping for a little luck . <p> My tips : Avoid exposing the corner candy bombs at all costs . Get a color bomb and keep it safe in case the corner candy bombs are exposed . It can be used as a last resort . Try to clear the jellies at the top of the screen earlier in the game in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear swaths of jellies ( again be careful to not expose the corner candy bombs ) . Be very careful using wrapped candy / striped candy combinations ( due to exposing corner candy bombs ) . Only use these combinations if they appear near the center of the screen . Do not use color bomb / striped candy combinations unless you are sure you will not expose the corner candy bombs . Hope for a color bomb when you get close to clearing all of the jelly . <p> This is a frustrating level due to the corner candy bombs and their short duration . I got within 1 jelly several times before eventually clearing this level . <p> It took me a few days to clear the level I probably used my 5 moves up 2 times each day . I 'm not that great at CC btw . Okay , seriously , I missed noticing that the top corners were actual bomb dispensers . I kept seeing the bombs there and just knocked them out as I went sometimes cursing because of them . Never did I think to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to look to see the dispenser and I did n't  see it or notice it was one . here 's my best advice when you go into the game , if you do n't  like the board back out and then go back in and get a new board . You have to back out before you make a move . This works on everything but the timed levels . I never play a board that does n't  give me something good and I will back out 20 times and come back in until I get a board that I like . Why not start with a board that give you one move to get a color bomb ? That 's usually the boards I start with . Go slow on this its not timed . Got that . Go very slow on the ones not timed and you 'll pass them faster because you 'll make smarter moves . If they have bombs , go slower . Also , the truth is on the timed levels I move slower than usual as the move selections count more . <p> I have beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat it the target score keeps going up .

@@22792071 @2792071/ <h> Level 80 Cheat #1 : Do n't  open the chocolates too early . <p> You should n't open the chocolates too early since if you do n't  have a way to get rid of them , they can quickly take over your board . The best thing is to set up some special candies before you remove the meringues . This will help you get rid of the chocolate right away . <h> Level 80 Cheat #2 : Maintain an opening to the teleports . <p> Notice that the teleports at the bottom take the candies from the left side to the right side . This means that if the chocolates are blocking your candies on the left side from reaching the bottom , that the right side will not get any new candies . So you need to maintain a path for your candies to travel all the way down on the left side . Otherwise you will begin to run out of moves and the chocolate will overtake you . If you want good moves from the start , you may want to reset your board before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #3 : Make special candies and remove chocolate . <p> In my experience , the fastest way to remove chocolate on this level is to set up some special candies to take them out all at once . After removing a layer of meringue , use special candies or striped + wrapped in order to remove the chocolate . Its best to take out the chocolate in 2 or 3 moves . <p> I think i have got the message at least 10 times that I have completed but , for me as well , 81 wont open . On one occasion , after completing 80 , I got the message to complete three other levels to go forward . It opened at 12 which I did but I then got the message that I had done enough for the day and must wait 24 hours before continuing . After the wait , it opened at 80 again and no difference . <p> WowThats an asshole thing to sayWay to be the Candy Crush champ there Cupid StuntI bet it pays really well and makes you quite a success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're so far past level 80 hmm ? <p> I cant finish level 80 either , the more points I get the more I need to get ! So I must have learning difficulties too as cupid stunt reckons . Ive been trying for ages now and just about ready to not bother playing any more . Help ! <p> I too am stuck on 80 . I will try going back to 79 as suggested BUT at the moment 80 is trapped in a state of perpetual motion with candies pouring through a gap and through a portal . Its like Niagara and simply wont stop . The same candies have been going round and round for HOURS . how do I stop it ? ? 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

The goal of level 377 is to Collect all the orders ( 100 green , 100 purple , 100 yellow ) and reach 30,000 points in 50 moves . <h> Level 377 Cheat #1 : Break through the meringue layer . <p> Level 377 is a hard level to beatmostly because there are so many orders and blockers ! To get started , you need to take care of the meringue layers . Striped candies will be the most useful here , but do n't  put too much stalk in them , a 3-candy combination does almost as must damage . <h> Level 377 Cheat #2 : Focus on one side . <p> First off , go against your previous candy crush instincts and focus on one side and breaking down the meringues to the cake . You need to get to the cake so that you can have a cake explosion . Try to and wait until you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detonating itessentially , you need to time the cake explosion with the best candy board possible , then clear up the candy orders with your last moves . <p> Do n't  worry thoughyou really only need to explode one cake to defeat this level ! <h> Level 377 Cheat #3 : Use a color bomb with a NON-targeted color . <p> In order to fill these orders while taking care of the blockers , you want to get rid of all the extra colors getting in your way . Rather than try to get an exact color bomb+yellow/green/purple combination , try taking out the reds or the blues . Why ? Well , this opens up the board for making more order related moves and helps you clear the blockers too ! <p> did this only breaking one cake .. 3 go left i broke the first cake , , , it left me with 5 red 18 yellow and 7 purplebut it also gave me a bomb next to a yellow , i had 14 yellows to get so i did the bomb yellow comboone move left just needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went with two morw purples so did it one the last go , , pure luck , , , i did have a ton of combos that kept cominig the game , , was about my fifteenth go before coming here for tips , , , , started playing 4 weeks ago and not bought nay booster but these tip sites help a lot <p> I figure they are being paid to try over and over , so they can keep playing for free with the video recorder turned on until they get it . For all we know , it could have taken several months to capture a video they can show us . <p> Attention .. attention .. Level 421 is way harder than 377 . It will make you quit if you have n't already . Of course you do realize that the game is intended to make money . If you have n't spent any money on passing levels .. then you should have 20 bucks saved up to get through 421 . Officially done at 421 .. that 's the t-shirt . Ya ya .. 181 was tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you Candy Crush for a good run . I say good day " I SAID GOOD DAY ! " <p> Definitely a WTF level . I hit both birthday cakes , had at least one striped + wrapped , and still did n't  get it ( had , like 23 purple and 8 yellow to go ; I hit all the green ) . Gon na wait for the Tooth Fairy to be magnanimous on this one . <p> If you do n't  get a good board to start with you might as well end it.I am so sick of this level , after hundreds of tried I have only gotten close about 3 times.What is the point ? At 12:00 tomorrow night I will stop.I have had enough of this crap . <p> The videos always show a great board to start with.I hardly ever get that , it may start out good but then it fizzles.Too many of the wrong candies.Why the hell am I still putting up with this crap ? Where is the fun ? ? ? <p> You have 50 moves to collect 300 candies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove 6 candies with each move and break ground . IMPOSSIBLE ! My fiance passed the level but I 'm almost certain I cant . The one thing I do n't  like about candy crush are the luck levels . <p> No fun any more , no skill , only luck . Boring and incredibly hard . Supposed to be fun . I had 2 accounts and just deleted one . Next one within a few tries . Bye bye King and I do n't  regret it . There is more fun in the store then Candy Crush . <p> I finnally did it , but it was due to luck . I have been on this one for weeks ! I finally did it by having two chocolate sprinkle balls fall next to each other and matching them . I hate these kind of levels , and the ones with bombs ! <p> Got ta love this cheat . You tell us to concentrate on one side , yet the only way you were only to complete it was to get a lucky move which cleared the board from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once again , just pure luck , no strategy . <p> wow i have met my match , countless amt of times playing this level . can it b that we all do n't  know what we r doin ? i do n't  think so . when and if i complete this level 377 it will be pure luck and only luck . the best i did was come 9 away and i wanted 2 cry i thought i was goin 2 do it . when the game is ready for me 2 win that 's when it will happen . this sucks . <p> I just completed this level after a dozen attempts . I started the level with a striped and wrapped candy combo , managed to break both the cakes during the 50 moves . Not possible to win this level without loads of luck , atleast three extensions of moves after 50 moves are over , which means 30 plus gold bars I think , and some very careful moves . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

@@22792075 @2792075/ <h> Level 273 Cheat #1 : Clear the bombs . <p> The hardest part of this level are the 7 move bombs . They need to always be your #1 priority .

This means that bombs will appear throughout your game so you have to really pay attention to them dropping down ! <h> Comments <p> Level 273 is the level that will finally get me to quit candy crush . Candy crush is like giving a boy friend second , third , fourth and so on chances , until your soul is being taken . They you finally give him the boot forever . I am done moving candies around aimlessly and getting nothing in return . I have been a sucker far to long . While king is laughing all the way to the bank . See ya ! <p> I beat level 273 in a day by following this advice . Sure it was frustrating but the reward is going to 274 . I understand there is an end to the levels and then there 's the night ( owl ) levels one can begin . Eventually all games can be defeated until they add more levels but the thing I like about Candy Crush is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate in order to get future success . Its just a game after all . I 'm sure the day will come when I shelf it too but for now , it challenges me and is fun ! <p> This level of candy crush has just put me over the edge . Why do you think that it right to try and persuade someone to purchase extra moves or other items in order to proceed to the next level . My candy crush days are noe over . I will not be stressed and discourage over this game any longer , nor will I contribute to the $10 millon that you all are grossing on a weekly basis . You have taken all the fun out of a simple game . <p> I have been on this level for about six weeks . I know how to play the game or I would n't be on this level . It is no fun anymore . Do n't  know why they think that they have to make some levels so hard . I am just about done with candy crush . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid nothing at all . I got to this level without purchasing any additional lives or getting other bonuses ever . All on my own , and proud to say I did it all by myself yeah . I do n't  like this level though frustrating , been on it for several days now . This level is difficult , not as easy as they show it on the video , wish it was that easy . I keep getting bombs all over the place 4-5 bombs at a time ( unlike the video ) , which is really hard to clear ( unlike the video that only gets like 1 , 2 or 3 bombs max + many sprinkled candies ) . If I got all the nice candy combos and not so many bombs such as on the video I 'd beat it by now : ) . Persistence is the key to candy crush . I noticed that one time , I was really angry with one level so I quit for two weeks , after I came back and played again I guess candy crush mysteriously wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same for this level : ! SO conclusion , persistence is the key up to now . <p> I 've never spent a penny on this game and do n't  plan to . But , man this level is a witch . You get this far on Candy Crush and you learn the tricks . Nothing really useful in this tip blog ( though its been helpful in the past ) . <p> I just cleared this level after reading these tips they were very helpful . Start in the middle ( that will prevent bombs falling on the sides which are hard to get rid of ) and make eliminating bombs your top priority . Eventually you will get special candies which will take care of the jelly . Good luck ! <p> I actually deleted candy crush and the activity from my page over this level . This level is bullshit and next to impossible to beat without spending money and that wont even help . After counting and losing 260 times I called it quits . Good bye and you lost a player <p> I 'm a first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 273 ! ! I finally beat it with a combination of several strategies I saw here . First definitely start in the middle even if it takes a few turns to start breaking jellies . This way its easier to diffuse bombs . Watch the bottom row to see the upcoming bombs and try to prepare . Last , the color bombs are best when you can get a striped combo with it . I know these are rare though haha ! So I also beat it just once using the wrapped candys . They work best after getting some stripes out there to cause a little volley . A wrapped candy combo is super effective . One more thing , do n't  rush ! Its hard to remember that its not timed because the bombs are stressful . But a slow approach on every move worked better for me . Hope it helps . <p> ***DO NOT QUIT OR DELETE CANDY CRUSH** ! ! ! ! I hope this is helpfulthe ONLY way I have found to pass this Level is to be mindful of each bomb , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your best friend on this level is wrapped candies because they break surrounding candies AND bombsyou will need SEVERALminimum 5 and at least one hard candy hammer as an emergency to break a bomb if you cant get to it before it " blows up " . This should be your priority in this level IN THIS ORDER 1. eliminating bombs as they appear 2 . Creating as many wrapped candies and 3 . Striped candies . I promise you will pass this ! ( I was stuck for 2 1/2 weeks ) good luck guys <p> This level nearly broke me I was stuck on this for ages around a month at least , and it very nearly caused me to kiss goodbye to this mind torturing game once and for all ! My strategy was fairly straightforward and helped me crack this level <p> DAILY BOOSTER SPIN if you have access to this , play this every day , and keep playing it until you have all the Boosters you are able to use for this devious level . <p> REFRESH THE BOARD Keep refreshing the board before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a decent layout of candies ie you 're one move away from creating a Striped Sweet / Candy Bomb etc as the more Bombs / Striped Candies etc you have in this level the better ! ! <p> EXTRA MOVES If you 're playing through FACEBOOK , get your Candy Crush playing buddies to send you Extra Moves for this level EVERY move you can get helps make them count ! ! <p> BE PATIENT ! ! Most importantly do not rush your moves ! ! Plan ahead if you do this , you will be able to crack this level , once and for all . <p> As I say I was stuck on 273 for ages but persevering and sticking to these pointers was the key to eventually completing it good luck everyone happy Candy Crushing do n't  give up with this level it CAN be beaten ! ! <p> Level 273 is very easy to beat ! I did it in about 2 days without spending any money ! You need to eliminate the bombs as soon as you can , but still try to make progress downward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763 
@@22792077 @2792077/ <h> Level 162 Cheat #1 : Play on mobile and reset board for good moves . <p> You will want to play this game on mobile instead of Facebook because they have different goals . Facebook requires you to make two combinations of striped candy + wrapped candy , which is much harder . Play the mobile game as it is easier to beat . You need to use 3 wrapped candies and 10 striped candies . The difficulty is in the layout of the board as there is not much open space to make special candies . So it is especially helpful to start with a board that let 's you make one right away . If you do n't  see any good moves , get a new board without losing any lives by exiting and reopening the level . This must be done before you take your first turn . <h> Level 162 Cheat #2 : Prioritize making wrapped candies . <p> Because of the layout of the board , it is hardest to make wrapped candies . If you see an opportunity to make one , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a striped candy and making a wrapped candy , go for the wrapped candy as they are generally much harder to make . <h> Level 162 Cheat #3 : Watch out for the chocolate fountains . <p> The four chocolate fountains on this stage will keep spawning chocolates throughout the level . Make sure you regularly remove these chocolates before they keep multiplying . Since you do n't  have that much space on the board to begin with , you REALLY do n't  want chocolates to start taking over that limited space . <p> If its a timed level , you 'll lose a life if you reset , no matter what . The device you 're playing on may make a difference also , I 'm not sure . I 'm playing on a Kindle Fire and as long as its not a timed level , I can reset as often as I need to . <p> U have to close it down in the bottom left corner in the thing that pops out select the bottom one and it will go back to wit h level u went to play then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hitting ur " arrow back " or " home " icon you will loose a life . <p> Played on FaceBook . You just need to get 3 wrapped and 10 striped . Must have changed . Anyhow , I got it on FIRST TRY ! Luck I guess !

The goal is to collect all the orders ( 2 color bombs and 10 wrapped candies ) and reach 10,000 points , within 50 moves . <h> Level 347 Cheat #1 : Make matches near the bottom . <p> It is better to make moves from the bottom of the board as you are trying to set up your special candy orders . <p> Doing this gives a better chance of cascading more candies , giving you more chances to get a wrapped candy or color bomb . <p> POWER TIP : If you do not see any good first moves , you may want to get a new board . You can do this without losing a life by exiting and reopening the level BEFORE you make a turn . <h> Candy Crush Level 347 Cheat #2 : Do n't  make striped candies . <p> It may sound counterintuitive , but if you have a way to make a striped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A striped candy can easily take out an entire row or column of candies , ruining any wrapped or color bombs you were trying to set up . <p> You want to work hard to make your board as easy to make wrapped candies as possible . You do n't  want a striped candy to randomize your board when you were only a move or two away from making wrapped candies or color bombs . <p> Instead , you can try to turn your potential 4 in a row striped candy into a 5 in a row for a color bomb . <h> Comments <p> This can be a very frustrating level . My advice is to make as many wrapped candies before any chocolate is released . You do n't  have to clear them right away , just let them hang out awhile . I cleared 4 at once with a chain reaction . I needed 3 more wrapped candies , which I had on the board at once , but they were all near the bottom and I was afraid the chocolate would take one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear all 3 at once , and had 4 moves remaining . So it is possible to do this level with no boosters . <p> Well and fine with the strategies but a lot of luck is still needed . You need to concentrate and should stop after many failed tries as it strains the eyes and tires your brain and if you just haphazardly make your moves then it is futile . Try again after a rest . Ridiculous level if you refuse to spend money . One of the hardest for sure . <p> Omg I seriously hate this level . Its not fun period . I 'm sure I 'll get it beat at some point but Im bored trying . Maybe this is a good board to quit on . Lol . That will def make my family happy . Couple more days maybe then I surrender <p> Question : I have been playing this level for a while . I thought that if you matched a candy bomb with a wrapped candy , all the wrapped candies of that color would turn to a wrapped candy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need ? When I match a candy bomb with a wrapped candy it only credits one wrapped candy . Why else would the cheat recommend the move ? <p> This is not what happens when you match a color bomb and wrapped candy . When you match a color bomb and a wrapped candy , it essentially gives you a bonus color bomb so you can clear out two colors in one move . <p> Thank God for the Lucky Candy ( the " check " mark ) . I picked it to be there along with one chocolate bar and the Lucky Candy got repeated almost 10 times , morphing into a wrapped candy many many times . Ten moves left at the end . This Lucky Candy was also lucky for the jerk who has designed this level and other levels because without this candy , I would use all the legal means to hang him by his balls and physically destroy him . <p> oooohw I see ! So , if you get lucky , you get one of this lucky candys but its just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " kill " all the wraped candys with one Lucky Candy . Im stuck on this level for 2 or 3 days , man . I 'm getting bored <p> Lena , as I wrote above , if you collect and include *one* lucky candy for one game , it will reappear about 10+ times for the price of one . Once you destroy one wrapped candy that appears after the destruction of a lucky candy , another lucky candy appears elsewhere for free and this goes on about 10 times . So believe me or not , for the price of 1 lucky candy , you will get ten or so wrapped candies . <p> Unbelievable Lubos . I first entered this level , looked around , exited and immediately came here . After reading your suggestions I went back , used them and bang . I won . FIRST TIME ! I wish I had a mind that worked like yours . For anyone who doubts his strategy you are suffering unnecessary frustration . Thank you so much Lubos I owe you my firstborn child . <p> this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very good player ( but actually only good players are able to reach till this stage , so if you reached here u r a very good player ) . the only thing needed is luck nothing else .. ! ! otherwise I think this stage is made to urge and convince the candy crush players to leave this game forever after having a very very very impression of the gamedear " candy crush saga " , by making these kind of stupid stages you r doing nothing except putting hatred in the hearts of your players and increasing your dislikes and decreasing your ratingI have actually completed this level but it really was very stupid . <p> You have a better chance of hitting a Royal Flush on a slot machine then completing this level ! This is a new low for the SC game developers ! I 've made it to 347 in about a years worth of play , which is OK . I 'd spend a buck here and there to get over a hurdle . That 's OK too . But these SC people are all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . The worst part is this is an off-shore game and company ! Theyve seen my last dollar ! If any of the SC developers read this message here 's what I have to say ! GO FUCK YOURSELF ! <p> My advice : once you actually have a great start and gain momentum , put it down for a few hours and come back to it . I do this with some of the most challenging levels , works every time . Make sure you plug your phone/kindle/whatever ; this game takes serious battery life <p> I have been playing this level over a hundred times and have tried every hint suggested , but still cant come close to winning this level . Totally frustrated at this point . If something does n't  happen soon I 'm saying goodbye to Candy Crush . Not fun any more <p> Thank you SO MUCH , I was struggling with this level , then after reading your recommendations I combined a colour bomb with a wrapped and managed to complete the level comfortably . Having eliminated 2 colours from the board made making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complain that this level is undoable go for this combo and its likely you will be able to form a lot of wrapped candies , before the board gets too filled up with new candies of the two eliminated colours . <p> This level is putting me off the game altogether and I have been playing other games instead . It seems an impossible level . I do n't  want them all easy but I do not enjoy being stuck on a level for 4 weeks . Lost interest in the game now.never looked for tips or cheats before.but if I can not get past this level in a day or two the game is gone ! <p> to : Candy Crush Rep. I got a message that I WON gold bars . I clicked on it . They show up when you click the little circle where the lives from friends are shown and , of course , they have to be purchased . Seems like a false statement saying I WON them . I WILL NOT purchase them ; how can I get rid of them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish the person who writes the tips for the " daytime " levels would write the tips for the Dreamworld levels as well . Besides being some of the worst grammar and usage Ive seen on the Web , the Dreamworld levels are mostly useless . We all know " Keep Odus balanced " and " Use Moonstruck . " <p> Took Luboshs advice and selected both a color bomb and a lucky , then kept resetting the board until it gave me an opportunity to create a second color bomb on the first move . Detonated the color bombs on the first two moves , then detonated the lucky candy . Bye bye 347 ! I 'm on 350 today . Spasibo Lubosh ! <p> I feel so frustrated since I 've been stuck here for months . After reading this I was able to beat it after 3 tries with 3 stars ! Yehey ! Thanks for the advise . I just followed the matching near the bottom and combining the color bomb and wrapped candy . <p> It says if you have a colored bomb matched with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into all wrapped candied of that color , twice I had matches and only the color of wrapped candy exploded ? ? ? ? Something is wrong ? ? ? Help ? <p> so this video proves two things .. one , its almost 100% luck . Of the 12 items needed to form to win the level , perhaps three or four of them came from moves .. the rest were pure luck from cascading candies .. second , this is video proof that Candy Crush will arbitrarily fck you out of a move . This person had a green wrapped candy combo poised .. he put his cursor above the green candy to move into the corner position to make the wrapped candy , but Candy Crush decided to move the wrong candy and ruin the combo . Happens ALL the time to me .. I 've had lollipop hammers take out the wrong candy , and I 've had phantom moves like this . I understand King wants to make money , but do n't  screw over the clientele to do so . <p> I finally solved it without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times per day for 2 weeks before winning . My experience with Candy Crush is that if you get stuck on a level for awhile , eventually you will get one of the " lucky boards " that allows you to win . I cant say I used any great strategy to beat this level , other than to try to make explosions/combos on the lower half of the board and hope they resulted in cascades that generated new wrapped candies . If you persevere , you can get by this level . But it is mostly luck that allows you to beat it . <p> i did it ! ! ! like 10 tries . no special strategy other than went for the wrapped candy first , kept chocolate in check . Kept trying massive explosions to clear board . Thought this would be the level I would quit . Never will give a cent to King . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763 
@@22792079 @2792079/ <h> Level 181 Cheat #1 : Clear frosted jelly first . <p> Since the frosted jelly only needs one hit to be cleared , you need to clear the center jelly with as few moves as possible. - A good way to do this is to use vertical striped candies which will clear an entire column of frosted jelly in one move , also allowing cascading jellies to fall into the empty column . <p> Cascading jellies will automatically match and eliminate even more jelly from the same move . <p> Make sure you carefully look at the board in between each move to see which regular 3 candy match is going to hit the most pieces at once. - This is a very important tip for this level of Candy Crush because you are going to need to save as many moves as your can in order to clear the side blocks the most difficult part about level 181 . <p> When clearing the frosted jelly , it is important to remember that you do not need to clear it all. - It will benefit you to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horizontal striped special candy at the very bottom , it will not hit any of the side jelly . <p> By leaving the bottom row filled with frosted jelly , it can act as a platform if this type of special candy falls to the bottom. - It will save you more moves for clearing the side jelly . <h> Level 181 Cheat #2 : Know how to clear the side blocks . <p> The best special candy combo to use on this level is a wrapped candy + a striped candy combo . Make sure it is in the optimal position before you activate it . <p> A sprinkle candy + a striped candy can also help you on this level , but make sure there are many of the same colored candies you have on the board that are the same color as the striped candy . <p> Horizontal special candies are obviously needed in order to clear the side blocks on level 181 , but there are not enough moves for these to be effective on their own. - A wrapped candy + a wrapped candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sprinkle candy + a sprinkle candy ( which is helpful on almost any Candy Crush level ! ) will not be of much help either , since that combo only eliminates every candy on the board , but will not be effective on the blocks unless there is a candy touching it . <h> Level 181 Cheat #3 : Form a color bomb plus striped combo . <p> A color bomb alone is great , but a color bomb + striped candy combo is amazing in Candy Crush level 181. - The effect from the combo will stretch across the entire level . <p> This combination will not only damage the outside columns , but it will also potentially drop your ingredients in one swift move . <p> 181 it the hardest level I have ever been on they do n't  give you enough moves to beat this level . I just about ready to give up on candy crush and find me a new game , , I been on the level for months , its stupid , <p> There had been definitely harder levels then this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times until you should finish it off with a fair result . The above tips are very helpful and should be followed . Of course not every board will allow to finish , that would be too simple . But combinations of striped and wrapped candy are really helpful , even though it is sometimes hard to get these next to each other in the right row . <p> I feel ya . I still do n't  understand it either . I 'm not sure it even is understandable . I 'm so over Kings little tricks , like forced bad sprinkle ball moves ( because there ARE no other possible moves ) , repeated re-shufflesI mean back-to-back . Its not a fair fight . Its hideous , yet I cant break away from Candy Crack . I 'm just gon na sit here , all catatonic , playing on " cruise control " and just hope to hell for Divine Intervention . <p> I paid for extra moves to finally get the first cherry to drop , and then the second cherry never appeared ! ! It says to get 2 cherries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second cherry is n't even in the game ? ! I spent over $10 to finally beat the level and I got screwed over ! I do n't  mind spending a few bucks here and there to pass a level , but this is just unacceptable . Unless you can make this right , I am DONE with Candy Crush ! Very disappointed . <p> A wrapped candy plus a striped candy gives you one giant candy that will wipe out 3 of the 4 target rows at once . if you can do that 4 times on the same 3 rows it will take out all 4 layers of those jellys . But that is impossible to do as the game sabotages all of your efforts to beat it ! ! ! ! AARGH ! ! ! ! ! ! hope that helps .. <p> this is by far the most frustrating level . I have been stuck here for over a month , if i do n't  have any luck by the end of March i am giving up playing Candy Crush . You are suppose to enjoy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to do <p> My friend beat it the first time he played 181 . I however have been on it for over two months . I mean really , its not like they are giving away millions of dollars when you win the level , so why do they want to make it so hard to get . Its all set up anyway , because I notice that when it gets close to letting you win you start getting a lot of big moves in the few games before the win , lol . <p> I have to confess that , after posting for the first time here yesterday , today I just managed to beat this level . The trick for me was to make as many horizontal striped candies as possible and use them when they are in the right place . At the start , I was trying to save them to combine them with stripes or wraps , but to use them straight away seemed to work better . And is it just me , or are the coloured balls totally useless in this levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this walkthrough . Just play the game ten thousand times until pure luck beats it for you . I call it the " give enough monkeys enough typewriters approach . " Because that 's the only way to beat this level without just buying your way through it with bonuses . <p> I do n't  thing it wants me to win .. it sabotages all my attempts . SIGH . It is not even a fun level to be stuck on like levels 111 or 138 or 68 in Dreamworld where I got 801,600 points . And that was on my second try . That game was fun . Please King Guru , let me pass this level ! <p> Frankly I 'm sick of trying to pass this level cause I think it is impossible . Especially since the weather is nice now and I would rather be out sweating working in my yard than screwing with 181 . If anyone has any secrets other then what this sights tells you , please share . <p> totally agree with comments i am stuck on 181 also and my husband as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side by side which helped to remove side blocks , but run out of moves before i can remove all and win level . i fwd hints i found to friend and she got through it in like a day . but says does n't  remember what she did wasnt paying attention , she amazed herself .. do n't  buy it lol , . but no more hints to her from me lol <p> I finally got this one . Just concentrate on stripes plus wrapped or stripes plus stripes . I do n't  know how many times I missed passing the level by one move . Finally , it worked and I had three moves left . <p> It took a zillion tries and I finally wound up with a striped candy that would clear the last licorice but no way to activate it with one move left . Then I remembered I had a lollipop hammer from the free spin wheel ! Woo-Hoo ! <p> Just keep trying for striped/wrapped combos and setting them up in the right place . There 's not enough moves to beat it any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 days consistently and I then read all of these comments and just KNEW I was NEVER going to beat this level . I just woke up and of course I thought . let me go ahead and lose this level once again . With sleep still in my eyes , I noticed I had only 2 clear jellies at the bottom of each column and I remembered I had 2 lollipop candies . I hit those two clear F-ers and started my happy dance . For the love of God.this level was too hard and I almost gave up on CCS FOREVER ! ! ! All I can say is keep playing.Youll beat it when you least expect to . <p> Stupid fucking game , make it fun at least , same level for 5 months now .. I know its got ta be challenging , but not cheats work , never get any stripped or coated candynot work playing , way better games to play than this dumb impossible game ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> Enough ! ! ! Been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend just sailed past , no problem ! So what am I doing wrong , have read all hints more than once , but just cant get a high score , let alone getting the cherries down . This is n't fun anymore , and that is what a game should be . Come on king games- fair go ! ! ! <p> Can you people do me a favor ? please fix this stupid level 181 , ridiculous , i have many color bombs , that no do anything , when the color bomb is on the board , impossible to get the candy stripe to do a combination <p> I know what is required to finish level 181 . But after 12 months of trying , I know now the candy does n't  . I am going insane , no matter how much planning , the candy just does its own thing . I Truly think this level should be abandoned . Because there is no way of getting it out until the candy falls in precisely the one in a million sequence . I think I will win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those who have fluked it in the past . <p> The first time through , I thought 181 was impossible . Now Ive finished 590 real world and am stuck on 276 in Dreamworld . Just came back and played 181 again . Got it on the first try , 3 stars , with 4 moves left . Amazing what fighting bigger disasters later on does for your game . It IS possible . Have fun ! ! <p> Very aggravating . I 'm hitting those blocks with everything imaginable . Horizontal candies , color bombs/striped candies , wrapped candies/striped candies but the blocks need to be hit SO many times that I cant get them all gone . <p> The game is everything one defrauds . It is a program of casino . You do not have any chance of winning . The machine decides who and when it should happen but the majority loses all the time . Because they gain silver while you play . Make what you makes was not winning until it has not played them sufficiently . Accommodate the candies since you want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works . There is no way of winning . Only when the program decides . They continue betting and studying , they were not winning . It is the real one defrauds.Mathematically you do not have any chance . It needs to accommodate the candies . But there are candies that go down and up . They do not serve . When you tries to accommodate them , one falls of above that you do n't  see and finish with your plans . In fifty movements this calculated that you can not win . Only the program has a " bonus " that goes out like " special " 1 in 1.000 or 500 : not important . You paid with time in machine . They gain the money . <p> I 've loved playing Candy Crush these past few months , but level 181 seems virtually impossible to beat . I no longer enjoy the game . Too bad . Why would the makers of this game invent a level that drives its audience away ? Its effing stupid on their part . <p> This level is set up so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed playing the game , but I 'm tired of knocking my head against a brick wall in a fruitless effort to beat 181 .

I am not one for " easy ways out " , but after playing this same level day in and out , I do think the game should offer loyal players the option to move on after recognizing that the same level has been played over a hundred times Again , I usually am against short cuts , but after a myriad of attempts at this one level , I do wish there was some kind of cheat or code that would allow me to skip this rediculously unwinnable level .

I bought 150 gold for the first time ever because I needed one more move to win the level , but when I tried to use the extra moves it was not an available option anymore . Before I bought the gold I hade 2 bars available , when I started the next try I was starting with only 143 . Shame shame shame ! <p> Some of these levels are damn near impossible to beat .

Overall I found color bombs useless since they do not effect the side pieces we are trying to kill . But yesterday I crossed 2 color bombs Just Because to wipe out the board . <p> The BEST thing happened it hit all 8 targets once AND I did n't  need to line things up ! <p> Within 10 more tries I completed the level . Second is the wrapped / striped combo <p> Myself and a few friends have all been on this level for months . Basically we have all given up on playing but do check in once in awhile hoping the moniters have given up on stopping people from playing unless they spend $$$ . Apparently not . There are alot of other games out there which do not use this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day or two but let you through in a reasonable amount of time .

This is supposed to be a game and fun . It is neither . Guess you have to " buy " your way through the level . Thank you , NO . <p> I am stuck on 181 too . I am sure Kings deal is that they want us to " crack " and break down and spend money on their site .

If you do n't  have it- you 're screwed and you might as well quit . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763 
@@22792091 @2792091/ <h> Level 55 Cheat #1 : Focus on your moves . <p> In this level , its all about bringing down that oneingredient . Rather than trying to clear all the meringue , narrow your attention . There are very few moves so you need to make sure you are working on opening up an isolated area of the board rather than trying to clear the whole thing . <h> Level 55 Cheat #2 : Make striped candies and combos . <p> Like all ingredients levels , the best way to bring down an ingredient , even with blockers , is with a vertical striped candy . While a vertical striped candy can not clear a licorice X , it can clear meringues . <p> The only way to beat this level ( other than sheer luck ) is to make special candy combinations . A wrapped candy will do good work in clearing the board . If you want to get fancy , the most useful would be a striped+wrapped or a color bomb + striped , try to avoid a color bomb+wrapped in this game . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special candy , activate it quickly . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

I got down to 1 candy and used my last hammer to get to that point .. havent been close since . I have no Earthly idea how King is making any money .

They should look at Zynga to see a cautionary tale of an internet gaming company that takes their customer base for granted . <p> I 'm not asking for easy levels all the time .. challenges are fun .. but making a level impossible thrown in with their algorithm to f*ck you over when you have lined up a huge move again will only drive away players . <p> What a lucky hit that was ! !

Ill try to play it again and see what I can advise you . Its been so long ago as now I 'm on level 530 . Have you tried a couple of things ? There is now a roulette wheel that you can get a booster . Use these as many times as you can and save all the lollipop hammers . You can save unlimited of these and use in one game , perhaps then if you get to two left , you can hammer them out . Also , sometimes playing on the computer version is easier on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freebies from the roulette wheel . And really the only useful ones are the hammers , which Ive saved up and used before . I guess I 'll break through soon or stop playing . <p> Something really strange happened on Level 350 I play CC on my computer and my phone is also synched to play . They are usually on the same level . Anyway I have been stuck on this stinkin level for about a month . The other morning I went onto my computer to play and it had jumped to level 351 . It completely passed 350 and I never had to ask friends to help me board it was just on level 351 . My phone however , has not synched and remains in 350 even though I restarted my phone -thinking it would synch . Did a CC elf come play for me during the night ? ? ? Never had this happen before . Wonder if anyone else has experienced it . <p> Same thing happened to me , I crossed the bridge on to 351 . My phone stays on 350 but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bizarre but do n't  understand why my phone wont do it . I 'm still going back each few times to try 350 on my PC though , although I still cant get it as yet . <p> Driving me nuts ! I 've tried all kinds of strategies : Loading the board with candies and special combinations and setting them all off in one go .. I 've tried setting off individual combinations as I get them .. I 've tried avoiding the bubble gum machine and I 've activated it on purpose .. I 've tried everything . It seems that when you get down to the bottom rows , the candies just do not want to fall/drop in your favor . I might have to give up , I 've been at this level for I cant tell you how long . <p> If you have reached this level all the tips mentioned are quite obvious to you . The main issue is concentrating on the board and the most important is having a good board and luck . I have yet to beat this level after a day but I 'm waiting for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get past a level no matter how tough . I do n't  want to break my record . It appears very tough though but I read one comment somewhere that she got it on her first try . Must be very lucky as most seem to struggle . <p> This level took me around 70 tries to break without boosters . About 1/3 of the time I would finish with 6 jellies or less . My strategy was to make as many wrapped candies as possible . The candy bombs left too many lone jellies unless I got one close to the biginning . Drill down as fast as possible and a two wrapped candy does a lot of targeted dammage . <p> pleeeeease help me to either complete or skip level 350 I REALLY HAVE HAD ENOUGH NOW . I have been stuck on it for weeks and can see no point in continuing a game where I will never go any further xSusanne <p> I finally passed this horrid level . I broke down and bought 6 lollipop hammers . I figured I had saved a ton of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out to eat and party , so yeah I did it . gawd what a waste of time ! I recently read about being addicted to candy crush . They say its like crack , but cheaper lol <p> 2 bits of advice after countless hours of playing this level : 1 ) When you start off your game board , make sure its one that you can see will start you off breaking through the first few bottom layers . I always chose boards that I could set off a row of 3 or 4 candies at the bottom or a gum ball right away . If you do n't  make any moves , you can end that game without losing a life . Just look for a more ideal starting board . <p> 2 ) Save up at least 5 lollipops from the daily spins . ( took me 7 days to save up enough ) . All the tips on this page and in the comments work well but after 2 months , many times getting within one or two jellies , the only answer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I even came close once with just a couple of lollies but you really need about 5 . Get to a point where you have just a few jellies left . You will know when you have the right set up . In my case I had 8 jellies to go with 5 pops . There was a striped candy in direct line with 4 jellies . I first pounded that one . 4 jellies left and 4 lolliesyou get the picture . <p> I did it ! Finally connected to FACEBOOK through the phone . I deleted the App AND reinstalled it using the CANDY CRUSH FREE choice . The bad thing was that I was on 350 on the phone , but playing catch up , I was only on 345 on laptop . It did not advance so I am at 345 now on phone . Its better than the frustration of not being able to connect on FB . <p> Hi , I 've just completed 350 . Yeah .. So here is my tip . If you do what you have always done nothing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't  worry about the top half of the game . Work on the bottom half first and try to avoid triggering the bombs . Have a couple of lollipops and switches available but use them with caution when you can clearly see you only have two or three single jellies left . Good luck and be patient . Its taken me three weeks . <p> If you do what you have always done nothing will change . I cleared 350 todayHi , I 've just completed 350 . Yeah .. So here is my tip . If you do what you have always done nothing will change and you will fail . So change your strategy . Do n't  worry about the top half of the game . Work on the bottom half first and try to avoid triggering the bombs . Have a couple of lollipops and switches available but use them with caution when you can clearly see you only have two or three single jellies left . Good luck and be patient . Its taken me three weeks . <p> I was dreading this level as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cc . I was amazed to pass it after about 10 attempts . I did no special moves just made lots of combos which I found was easy to do . I think it was just down to sheer luck ! <p> The bombs will be the least of your worries . Just passed this with 16 turns left and I can tell you it is PURE luck . Combine all specials . Do n't  worry about the bombs . If they blow they blow but you need to get those specials . I found colour plus wrapped most helpful but combine anything you get . <p> I was stuck for ages on this level , never even close until I blasted it . Unfortunately , this is really luck based . <p> They must have made this level easier . I had 40 moves not 60 on my iPad . Second time got to one jelly which I took care of using a lollipop . Played 5 more times got to one jelly and then completed with no help . <p> I 'm thinking I may have to delete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you for sending requests only you 're not sending them ? Is the App sending them ? Please if you can she 'd some light on this .. <p> I find these brick breaking levels to be the most difficult . I have yet to pass one level containing bricks . I usually let my fiance beat them for me . What I find strange is I can best her levels easier than I can brick levels and she 's on level 647 . In one game I had 3 color bomb and stripped candy combos , two stalker candy combos , one set of two color bombs combos that cleared some of the board and I had 17 moves left AND I STILL LOST . LMAO Im doing something really wrong on these levels . When I watch my fiance beat the level she uses less candy serious and bombs and she wins with at least 7 moves left . I 'm at least 200 games in on this level . <p> Like you guys I was feeling this was a horrible board . BUTI guess I got real lucky . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a chocolate bomb on the first move . Then I got another one on the third move . Put them next to each other and eliminated almost all of the top section of the jelly . That left a lot of moves to do the bottom . It was a success . So it only took me four tries to do level 350 . I really think a lot of these hard levels can only be won by luck . <p> I tried the instructions given . Basically avoid the bombs , stick to the center with as many combos as possible ( I used striped plus wrapped on 3 occasions ) and especially in the end choose moves very carefully . Obviously I had to ( buy and ) use 3 hammers . Finished on the last move . <p> Some levels on CC are simply designed to be money generating for these guys . This is surely one of them . Impossible to break it without using hammers in the end . Almost all levels of Dreamworld are like that you invariably end up extending the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's any skill or technique involved in Candy crush what so ever . I passed this level after 3 or 4 tries and it was all luck . I happened to have a good board and the right candies fell down . Overall , I found this level much easier than some previous ones . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

Obviously they hope we will break down and pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block away from clearing , grrrrrr <p> there are no blue waves at the bottom two blocks in the game as in the video .. Why is it different ? ? ? so they do not move when other squares are changed as in the video .. please correct this game to match the video display , as it is un-beatable as it is in the game .. BEEN STUCK FOR MONTHS if bottom moved as in video as displayed it would be great ! <p> I think they need to fix this my candies do not cascade down like the video I do the bottom left and the top right comes down do the bottom right top left comes dow why in the video it shows both squares come down when you do the bottoms PLEASE FIX THIS <p> Got It ! My bottom 2 panels only moved the opposite top 2 , like most all others here . Took about 20 attempts . Concentrated on clearing bottom panels along with specials in top panels . One striped and wrapper combo taken in a top panel and luck was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last possible move of course . Good luck . <p> This level was not designed to play it or to have fun .. this level wad designed to either pay them or to hate the game and delete it which I finally did Sesriously ! ! It is a game and its supposed to be fun .. and this is not fun anymore see ya it was nice 322 levels which I guess are enough for one game <p> Oh ha ha . First remove the jellies from the bottom . I 'm lucky if there 's a match on the bottom . Candy Crush wants you to spend money to get past this level . Eventually , after numerous games , you will probably get a game that will let you go on without spending any money and then theyll try again after a couple more levels . I think I shall save up the daily boosters and use them all at once . In the mean time I shall get on with something more useful . <p> First , completely ignore this guys advice that you do n't  want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this level done . First , get more than one wrapped/striped combo . I beat the level with two , plus a little luck . Second , you can combine chocolate balls with striped candies . You will probably need two of those as well , but with a bit of luck only one . <p> This was not helpful at all . How is cheat #2 a " cheat " ? I would n't be on here in the first place if this level did n't  have any " Difficulty " . I 've tried making special candies on the bottom but its not enough to clear all the jelly ! -- <p> Had the same problem as everyone in that only the diagnol panels were connected . I was n't even getting close . I was thinking of quitting . One day I played and lucked into a chocolate ball/striped candy combo that cleared a lot . A striped here and wrapped there got me closer than ever needing 3 jellies . I looked and saw I could get rid of 2 of them by using a hand-switch I had won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3rd and boy was I happy to be done with this level . Do n't  know how much further ill get refusing to spend a penny but well see . Never thought I 'd pass that level . <p> OK , after 2 weeks of trying 3 times a day all 5 games I made it . I started noticing it would give me dead lower quadrants which means you are dead . Then it let me get close but put a 5 count bomb in an impossible position . I started second guessing them . If I had 10 to 15 moves left and knew I could n't get there I would quit the game and open the next one . Finally it gave me a package and stripe beside early and feed me plenty of stripe opportunities , Pay close attention to what is going to drop from the upper opposite quadrant before you move on the bottoms ans always focus on the bottoms . As always I speed right through the next one . Good luck . JF 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

Furthermore , this site is an open forum such as You Tube with very little moderation . If you are offended by words such as " smug " this may . not be the place for you . <p> Guest I 'm not being smug at all but .. lol but the best way to beat this level after 35 times of failure is to do what the tips say . Get 2 brown bombs and push together and tht will open the remaining bombs on the lower right side ! ! I passed the first time after reading it . I hope this helps ! ! ! <p> Isabel you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not pass this either but after reading the tips on here I passed the first time . Call it luck or being smug either one but at least we passed and the tips helped us ! ! ! What 's good for one might not be the other ! ! <p> It does n't  but if you just do the left side and get 2 color bombs together and then swap them , they release the locked up bombs and you only need one more then . Its really doable , but ignore the right side totally ! <p> I have read all kinds of tips and cheats . Well after playing 341 for three days , I find I still cant get it ? The boards I get sure do not look like boards in the video . Maybe I am just thick ? Kinda takes all the fun out of the game . I should give it up and become a productive member of society , instead of a candy crush dead head . <p> OMG , this SO worked I stopped trying to clear the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb , then another one , managed to get them side by side and combined , which gave me 2 , them freed up the others and then I only needed one more . Thanks , I tried this level about 50 times and finally gave up trying to clear the right , but I never thought to try to get 2 speckled ones next to each other it took a few goes , but I 'm finally off this level . Thanks so much ! <p> this level is just not beatable unless you have the freak occurence of getting 2 color bombs which is really difficult the way the candies are laid out or unless you buy the color bombs which i will not do . this level is definitely a money taker . the game is laid out psychologically so you 'll buy that " just one more move " to advance . go ahead and finance the creators that are lounging in their yachts in the carribean . <p> I swear I failed this level at least 30 times and cleared it with 3 stars on the FIRSTattempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left side which promptly fell to the right , so crushing two color bombs was n't an option for me . After detonating the first color bomb , I got two more on the left side in rapid succession , but too far apart to crush together . I left them alone and worked to build a striped candy to crush with one of the color bombs . Worked like a charm . That combo cleared the second and third color bomb and ( since I already had candy on the right side ) did enough collateral damage to uncover the two of the three remaining color bombs . I finished with 8 moves left ! <p> It still comes down to luck I say , I played this about 50 times b4 looking for help here , then tried another 20 times following these tips . In the end by pure luck I got two color bombs in the middle row , swapped them , the move gave me another one , and with the 3 at the right I had it , with 18 moves left ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. I read this and added my own method . ( using striped with a chocolate ball which clears a cross section . ) I won on the first try ! So the trick is to yes ignore the right side till you clear the left . Then work on the right all the while keeping your eye out on the left for a possible 5 in a row cause you need the extras , and combined with a stripe in the right spot can begin to uncover the 3 on the right . Good luck ! <p> Just to add my bit to this discussion which I read ( and found really useful ) because I could n't see a way through . I did finally manage to get a bomb on the left and used it . This opened up the right and I made my way down to the bottom and then used 2 bombs which were already together . After that , it was easy because more bombs were easy to produce by removing a colour and the job was done ! Thanks for the tip but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 bombs on the left to sort it ! <p> Ive been on this level over a week , I followed the tips but always found myself trying to clear the right side when candy drops I finally forced myself to clear/make bombs ONLY the left side , it took me about 5 , 6 tries but I finally made 3 color bombs on the left side which helps clear the right , " the stars lined up for me today " and a 4th and 5th bomb dropped to the right clearing and set off remaining 3bombs ! ! ! I still ca n't believe I passed this level ! ! ! <p> Thanks ! Followed advice and ignored right side . Got one color bomb and a few moves later got two side by side . That freed up the three bombs on the bottom right . Then eliminated the last two bombs that struck the last bomb ! Passed the level in one try ! <p> I worked at the merinque barrier an manged to have two colour balls ( one by one , not at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After breaking thru the meringue barirer , a vertical striped candy swapped to the right side .

Lol . Thank you so much everyone for the hints and tips . Great work all of you . <p> I found it easier to create a wrapped and a striped candy on the left side and then moves them to the right side . Get them side by side . Then put the 2 ( wrapped/striped candy ) together to uncover the color bombs at the bottom of the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together to clear the screen . Along the way I was able to get some additional color bombs to finish the level off . <p> I know that I got super lucky as I passed this level in 2 triesthis is what helped immensely.I combined a striped and wrapped on the lower left which unlocked the color bombs . I combined 2 color bombs which launched the 3rd color bomb . Then somehow I got the right combinations to make 2 more color bombs . Hope that this helps someone ! <p> Ignore the cheat aboveI have completed this now 3 times by clearing the blocks on the left as quickly as possible and with some work , moving a bomb and stripe to the right hand side . This will release 2 color balls at the bottom of the right side and allow you to wipe out the entire board in one move . Every time I have gotten this right side move , I was immediately rewarded with multiple color balls all over the board . The cheat does not work easily . <p> Oh wow . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery candies , which just happened to be a color bomb .

Ignored the chocolate , bombs first , then meringue so the candy could fall through to the 3rd quadrant , make as many of the special candies ( pair up if possible ) that you can and grab the extra time candies . In addition to all of that , it is just plain luck and circumstance .

Thanks Ann ! <p> I spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to get 3 stars on this . I finally decided to use a spotted candy and I paired it with one of the bombs ( there were two yellow bombs , so I paired it with a yellow candy ) and it went straight up to 3 stars !

I wish I had not started playing Candy Crush Saga and I certainly will not recommend it to anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after reading your suggestions I used one of my chocolate sprinkles and made it the first try . On level 181after trying for about two weeks I used two of the little hammer thingy and passed that level . So be patient and think what techniques you used in the past levels to complete them . You have the skills if you 've come this far . I am moving on to level 183 and have never spent any money on here . I use the little tools I have collected by spinning the wheel once every 24 hrs . I save them until I find a level I cant complete on my own . Good luck . <p> after weeks of frustration on this level , I finally did it not by scoring 30,000 on the outset but by leaving enough bombs , stripes and +5s to activate automatically after my time was up . I was at 18,000 and had 2 bombs , 2 stripes and about 3 +5s ( which turn into bombs ) and after they activated it kept creating a chain reaction of more bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just kept going up till it went over the required score .

Keep restarting until you can get rid of two Time bombs at once . Then work at the sides to get at the other two .

Keep destroying new bombs as fast as possible.The only objective is to be alive after all the moves .

The one shown above is just very rare , normally you wo n't get one like this and thus you can not beat the level .. <p> Kings level description is wrong .

Watch out that no bombs count to zero after you made the 75.000 points ! 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

But watch the corners ! You 'll find two chocolate fountains and once the meringue tins are cleared next to them , theyll begin creating chocolate . <p> Remove this is an unnecessary blocker if you can but keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the jelly ! If you can , avoid unleashing the fountains until you have cleared a majority of your board . <h> Level 213 Cheat #3 : Ignore the color bomb . <p> There will be a big temptation to go for the color bomb hidden under the marmalade but do n't  ! This color bomb is hard to get to and you will waste valuable moves going for it . It will clear on its own ! <p> Instead try to combine color bombs that are at the top of the board with horizontal or vertical striped candy instead . 12756 @qwx212756 12763 @qwx212763

Your objective is to get 7 striped+striped combos and at least 200,000 points in 50 moves . In order to complete a Candy Order level , you will need to crush a certain number of specific candy colors or types . Some early Candy Crush order levels just ask you to collect colored candies . Others will require you to get types of special candies later in the game . Youll have to approach Candy Crush order levels very differently from other stages of the game !

It also does n't  give striped candies when you get four in a row at times . I have n't even come close to solving this . It has become boring now . At least other difficult levels tease us by letting us almost get it out but this one is unreasonable . <p> I totally agree , this level is very unfair . just when you think you are getting 2 stripes together that stupid tornado thing comes and messes it all up . I refuse to spend on red cent on this level I have n't minded spending a few $ on a level now and then , but this must have been created to totally bankrupt people . Do n't  waste your money . I 'm done with candy crush unless they can create some kind of new object to stop that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this level ! Bye bye candy crush Been a fun ride up until now ! <p> I agree with you Karen . I have played for over a year now and even the hard levels are achievable . But this one is insane . It is n't hard its just impossible . There are way too many things going on . You concentrate on getting rid of the cakes and use up all your moves . You can make stripes , but they set themselves off or the tornando hits them or the plunger destroys them before you have a chance to swap them . I 'm so done with this game . This is the end . Enough is enough and it has become boring to me . It used to be a challenge that I had to conquer , but when it is impossible there is no challenge . BYE BYE Candy Crush ! <p> I agree and just deleted the game from my facebook . Its not about the game being difficult , it out and out cheats . The game cheats ! After 421 levels we all know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous . This lines of candy drop for no reason nothing has been touched on that line , all the striped candies just blow the heck up for no reason . They lost me and my money screw them . <p> level 421 on the iPad is a joke . I completed 4 striped candy combos and it only credit me for 3. that stinks . There is obviously some glitches in the programming of this level . I also saw two candies switch with each other , right before my very eyes ( I promise I did not move them ) . No ! It is not FUN at all . But I must admit , I made it this far with never spending one cent ! Thanks for the ride Candy Crush . Time to go back to Leps World ! <p> u sound like me lol I get so pod but hang in there ull do it . Its all in the board u got ta get the right set up . On androids and iphones u can " back out " before 1st move if u @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took a good starting arrangement for me to finally clear it . The first two moves resulted in 2 side by side stripes in the bottom corners . Even with that it took all 50 moves to clear the level . I do believe that without a very lucky starting arrangement this level is nearly impossible . <p> did u get by it ? I have been stuck to on diff lvls before some even for weeks . But once I read up on tip I usually get by it within a few tries not always though . Seems like there is always one really hard lvl outta every 10 lvls . <p> Got it after 10 or so gos.Thought it was n't possible after reading here.Looked to get at least 2 before clearing the dials.Then was just lucky at getting 3 colours with an adjacent colour next to the stripes whereas the other gos the stripe would always appear a few lines distant to the other ones . <p> I agree about the whirling dervish . I was about to make a striped combo and it came out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cascade which eliminated the other stripe . This level is difficult enough without that added nuisance . I can usually be persistent and eventually beat a level but this one looks impossible . <p> They have taken the fun out of CC , the moment one forms a striped candy the dervish eats it up . Its intentionally stacked so you will entertain buying gold to prolong session . The best I have done is clear 5 . <p> This does feel that is level is luck only you can set up as many double stripes as you want but there are too many enemies bombs cannons spiders all enemies ready to give up give the players some breaks . <p> I did it ! ! ! ! ! ! Been stuck at this level for 3 months ! You need a multi colour to start with and two lollipops . You have to get rid of at least one pie , go for them , not the candy stripes , this " confuses " the tornado . Use your multicolour and another one will come . Good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key , Even if it means losing a stripey . The tornado only goes away for a couple of moves when you blow it off the game field , But it helps to set up the game field . Good luck I managed to do it in about 50 OR SO with no boosters other than 1 Lolly hammer that Iwon on the wheel . <p> Is stopped playing CC because of this level . Ive lost count on the times i tried . I am waiting for CC developer to tweak this level and make it easier for everyone , they 've lost my loyalty to the game . <p> Is stopped playing CC because of this level . Ive lost count on the times i tried . I am waiting for CC developer to tweak this level and make it easier for everyone , they 've lost my loyalty to the game . Goodluck <p> I have tried level 421 at least 100 times and cant get it . The idiot creators of it lot control and somehow believe the people will spend their lives trying to get past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day how millions play it but I know for a fact that more people have stopped playing because they made it too hard . Games are supposed to be fun . They want you to spend money on this , what a joke . They literally still your moves from you . I am done . <p> I decided to give this level one more try after weeks of trying . I did it by using jelly hands which I had accumulated off the wheel . I wish I had thought of it before ! ! ! It made it easier to match the striped candies without using moves . I hated this level . A post earlier helped that you do n't  need to clear all cakes before matching . <p> I am seriously disappointed with this level . Hundreds of attempts later and still no closer . I used to enjoy this game like others below but there is no fun in this level at all . Please tweak this level ? <p> Tesstarosa , your points are without any chance whatsoever of panning out as you lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do n't  take it out on a website that does in fact give good advice and is not responsible for the programming code . I 'm sure if they could personally visit your grandmothers basement or wherever it is you live , they would personally help you . But they cant . <p> The owners of this site just give Pollyanna " do n't  give up " responses to people posting here with frustrations . I 'd really like to know how many tries it took them to get a board that works as well as the ones they show . It does seem that they have some connection to the game developers . ( I mean they 're using what I 'm pretty sure are King game trademarked icons all over their site . ) <p> The owners of this site do , indeed , need us to come to this site so they can make money off the ads on the site . ( Are they getting rich probably not but once the page is done , its just gravy money for them . ) <p> Will everyone quit playing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this site quit , they will lose their income stream . And , at some point in time , very few people will be playing Candy Crush . ( Very few people play Pac Man any more . ) <p> The vast majority of Candy Crush players do n't  come here so losing the ones who do would cause them to lose money . <p> What I do know from playing the game is that better advice is to use the tips and keep playing . You will eventually get a winnable board . ( It just might take a few weeks . ) <p> So much useless rant you have there . The videos they link are from different YouTube users , so you cant even say that those videos belong to the owner(s) of this site . This game %30 skill and wise decisions , and %70 luck . That 's why you need to keep trying to reach a lucky board , instead of saying a bunch of nonsense . <p> It is possible to beat this level with no boosters or extra moves . Its just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . I had almost given up , but my husband started teasing me ( he s stuck on level 120 or something , so he keeps waiting for me to give up . ) I finally got the one board that is possible . <p> I have been pretty patient , but after weeks and weeks of this level , someone was right when they said it became more frustrating than relaxing . I like a good challenge , but this one is too ridiculous . Every time I get down to 1 , every time without fail , that whirly eats any of the stripes I make . And I really do n't  mind buying stuff every so often . Too bad . Thank you for a fun 420 levels . Time to find a more relaxing game <p> Agree with you 1000% for all the reasons you stated . What really makes me made is this level the game is ricked to cheat , I mean its out and out cheating . I 'm sure everyone knows what I 'm talking about not just plunging the board when pies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , but the lines of candy just drop and delete colors you need even though you did n't  move any piece in that line , or the tornadoes popping and blocking things , stripes pop without touching or moving them , I 've watched my colors come down and oops they disappear so other colors come down I could also use and they disappear but none on either side that I do n't  need disappear . hmmmm Nope I wont support cheating so I 'm done . <p> This level is rigged ! Ive been stuck for months ! I 'm fixing to delete this game ! The candy bonus wheel is rigged too there has been several times i should have got the jackpot and it made an abrupt stop on the item before . You guys should be ashamed of yourselves being greedy for money and rigging levels ! <p> Whom ever the person(s) that came up with level 421 has a very large ego and really does n't  care much for the people that help pay his/her wages . Anyone of us who have gotten this far and probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idea how to get to the level . I realize king does n't  care if I dump candy crush , there will be others to take my place . This has left a bitter taste for me . <p> I have been stuck here for several months .. I think its a set up to spend money Every time I get down to 1 combo left .. I have no more moves .. Any other time I do n't  even get close .. This board will make you stop playing the game all together <p> Its rigged &amp; I do n't  say that lightly . I line 2 striped candies up together then it makes a move &amp; sets them off . Every time I set up a move , it takes over &amp; makes another move . I have in the past thought other levels were hard , but I have to say this has just defeated me . I am not normally one to give up but this is just ridiculous . <p> Do n't  give up I was there on it for about 2 to 3 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring the stripe down to meet the other a couple of times and used a hand to switch one combo .. be careful how you blow your stripes if you can avoid blowing up surrounding ones .. only other thing I can think of is clear the pies the sooner the better from my experience <p> I just completed 421 . It takes a good deal of luck , but there are a couple of strategic things you can do to help . Clear the four large squares before you start trying to get the seven combinations . If you can get a colored candy and take out one of the colors , do it . Other than that , just try to get as many striped candies as you can . Vertical moves are much easier than horizontal . <p> This is one of the worst levels . Its rather boring for one thing . Ive been stuck for a month and have n't even come close to filling the order . I was just playing it now and even though I had twenty moves to go , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without finishing . <p> Wow . I thought it was only me getting bored and wanting to give up . I find myself playing less everyday . Hopefully they will adjust this level so people can move up . I gotten up to 4 stripes then the tornado comes and you are out of turns . I made it this far without spending any money or buying anything and I wo n't so I 'm ready to give up . Bye Candy Crush . <p> Lucky Candy . Lucky candy is the answer ( or at least it was for me ) I had several hundred attempts at this level under my belt and just beat it when I decided to give it another go after some time off . I must have had 10 lucky candy drop during the attempt and I finished my 7th combo with a few moves to spare . Phew ! <p> Please do n't  think Im gloating but I finally did it . It took me a few weeks but never gave up . I needed a couple of lollipops to do it though . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to 425 this is devilish too <p> I totally agree with all the comments . I 've played this level hundreds of times on both pc and IPad . What can you buy to help you through this level besides extra moves and extra lives ? I 'm about to give up on CC for good . It should n't be this hard it takes all the fun out of it <p> I totally agree with all the comments . I 've played this level hundreds of times on both p and IPad .

Enough is enough and it has become boring to me . It used to be a challenge that I had to conquer , but when it is impossible there is no challenge . BYE BYE Candy Crush <p> I was having a lot of trouble with this level . Here is what got me close , and after a while of the same strategy got me through . <p> 1 The cakes can be helpful . Try to get 1 or 2 mixes with the given marma coated stripes . At the same time , you are inherently damaging the cakes a bit . Take 1 out , and you should still have 40 some odd moves left , and hopefully be down to 5 mixes to go ( If you do n't  have this , then you might just want to quit . ) <p> 2 Sometimes the cake explosion will leave you with a good set up , if it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed to destroy another cake . ( In my case , I managed to get another 2 mixes before destroying the third cake , but it can be really painful to lose your stripes if you inadvertently destroy a cake ) . <p> 3 Be greedy , it can be tempting to just mix the stripes , but not at the expense of losing a good set up . I pushed it a few times to line up another strip mix . Its a gamble , but honestly , you need to gamble on this level . <p> 4 If you have jelly hands and lollies this can help you line up the last 1 or 2 mixes . Other bonuses , up to you .. lucky would be my pick on this level , if you have some to burn I did n't  have any <p> install the program " cheatengine " on the pc and hack the facebook version of CC . They deserve this just for this level only . Its a pity to stop playing CC because this level is insane . wash away with cheatengine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it with this level . I 'm a smart strategic person , but this level is unfair . Every time I get down to one last striped candy combo for the win , the tornado shifts and takes it away from me . Ive been trying for weeks and I think I am over it . Bummer . Got ta find a new game . <p> At 3:21 what did you do ? There were about four striped candies two that were perfect for switching and the mouse moved to the right of the board and , viola , all the striped candies were gone but no rows or columns cleared . Its almost like its a different board . So , how do you do that cheat ? How do I get that board you 're playing so I can pass this level ? <p> Not sure why this one frustrates so many . The levels with bombs and chocolate fans drive me crazy and this has neither . I got past it in a few days ( about 20 tries ) . My first few tries were futile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped concentrating on lining up the striped candies and worrying about the cakes . Instead I just made as many striped as I could and swapped them when they happened to fall next to one another . I ignored the cakes , when they blew , they blew . This immediately got me closer to beating the level , and when I beat it it was without boosters and 3 moves left . Another tip I have is if you have a chance to take out the swirly with a striped candy , it is worth sacrificing that one stripe to be free of the dervish for a few moves . <p> I was stuck on this level for forever as well and was about ready to quit but what I did was gather a bunch of lollipops . After I broke all pies and got my striped candies , I put them together by smashing candy with the lollipop . Using the lollipop will not count as you using a move . Get the striped ones together and there ya go ! <p> What everyone says in this discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete it . I just did . Eventually you get lucky and get down to one stripe pair needed , and two or three stripe candies are close together or touching . Then you make a decision as to whether to pay . I chose to paytwice , so for $1.98 I broke this rotten level . I would not have paid if the candies were not lined up just right , but they were , so I did it . Eventually the chips fall with luck into their proper placeschips meaning candies . Get a whole bunch of new friends who are not at your level and suddenly you 're in the position of getting lots of extra lives without asking for them . Roll them out and play them all . If I got down to 15 turns left and still had 5 or more orders left , I did n't  allow myself to get frustrated . I exited the game and started a new one . Good luck all . Do n't  give up . Line up lots of friends below your level . <p> You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't  even mind spending money here &amp; there to get me thru certain levels , but not anymore . This level is impossible , unless you want to keep putting out ( and putting out even more ) for the things needed to get thru this level . I do n't  know whether to curse Candy Crush for taking away all of my fun or to praise them for helping to breaking my addiction . In any event , I 'm tired of trying to get thru this level Im done ; just not interested anymore . Everything deleted &amp; I 'm not going back . <p> thanks all of you for your comments . I 've only wasted about ten hours or so of my life into this pathetic impossible to beat level . Now i decided to delete it too . enough time in the garbage and i would never spend a cent . <p> I do n't  usually subscribe to the " everyones out to screw you over " mentality , and I have to admit that I often thought ( being of the instant gratification generation ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just werent trying hard enough . Ive been stuck on other levels for weeks at a time but would get close enough to know if I kept trying I 'd get it eventually . BUT after seeing things on this level happen that shouldnt happen and things not happen that should over and over again , there is no way anyone will convince me this level is n't rigged . <p> Do n't  even enjoy playing since this level , so I 'm done . It has no rhyme or reason , just a tornado with no rules and programmed to destroy stripes as soon as you set up any moves . You cant predict or plan because the patterns and rules change so it is boring and I quit quickly if I play because it is so annoying . Bye , bye candy crush , your programmers , or greedy king really blew it . <p> I get that people are annoyed I have been there TRUST me . I have been stuck on various lvls for MONTHS at a time . Not kidding either . Sometimes I will take a break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already knows this but YOU CAN GET MORE FREE LIVES by simply changing the time on your cell phone if you are playing from a cell phone like myself not sure about on a computer . On iphone and samsung smartphones I have/had both and done it MANY times .. open game , do not close game ( minimize or hit " home " button on iphone ) simply go to settings and change the time to THREE hours ahead of current time . GO back into game lives are refilled minimize go back to time and hit " automatic " or set correct time then go back to game your lives are full and the ticker will start at 30 min again . U MUST GO THE THREE HOURS to refill if your lives are at zero . IT IS SIMPLE trust me . That is how I am at 560 and waiting for more lvls and on lvl 200 dreamworld and waiting for more lvls . And No I do NOT buy that many boosters . Sometimes I buy stuff but never spend more than $5 . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its not impossible . This game has a lot of luck involved , and the twisters do annoy me , but this level is n't complete luck like 410 was . ( Worst level ever ) . You need to constantly be on the lookout for new stripes ; I think some people just hope theyll randomly fall into place . They give you plenty of moves to work it out and its a lot easier than the levels where you have to make a certain number of stripes/wrap combinations . <p> Tip : I could n't even get close to 3 combinations left on the facebook version , but the Android version almost lines them up itself . So , your best shot at clearing this level is trying ont he Android version . <p> Ill be on this level until candy crush takes pity on me and gives me a decent board . Instead of spending money on games my friend told me about Flow game which is just as much fun as c.c. and I can play that to get away from this level until they give me free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to clear the level . As several others mention below , the key for me was the beginning arrangement . The first two moves resulted in side by side stripes on both the bottom stripes that you always get at the beginning . Then chipped away at the cakes . It still took all the way to my last move to get it . I believe this level is nearly impossible unless you get dealt a huge break at the very beginning . Good luck . <p> Guys I had been stuck on this level for months and months . Spending money and getting sooo frustrated ! But I tried using the desktop ( computer ) and I passed this god forsaken level on my 2nd attempt . I cant explain why , but my tip Put down your phones and tablets and use the computer for this level ! <p> wowwowwow . I beat Candy Crush Saga Level 421 . I tried it more than 100 times to beat but every time , it give a hard time to win fortunately I have beaten it.Kindly play this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake at early as possible . However there is also some technical faults when you play it on mobile . I request to developers of the game to take up please . <p> Ive been stuck for a long time too . Its not fun anymore . I 've quit playing other games because of the same situation . Looks like Candy Crush is going to be off the list too pretty soon . Too bad cause I really enjoyed that game . After a certain length of time they should MAKE it possible to win . In fact , I really believe I beat it on my ipad because I advanced to the next level but when I used my desk pc it put me back to this level again . That really pissed me off . So I guess its good-bye CC ; there 's other games out there to play ! Too bad ; they are losing players ! <p> I was here just a few days ago , and agree with all that is said . I too was zbout to pack it in . But then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess I had done it about 80 times , perhaps . And without trying to finish it , or really paying attention , I found that I had indeed finished it . With one move left . Really surprised me . There is no rhyme or reason as to completing it , just dumb luck And btw , I did not buy extra moves or use any of the assists . It can be done . And the next few were easy . Now I am on 425 and that one may have me pulling what little hair I have left . But after completing 421 , I think any o c them can be done . So stick with it , best of luck . <p> i WAS STUCK ON THIS LEVEL FOR MONTHS ! ! ! I never even got close to beating it . Made me basically quit the game except for every once in awhile I 'd give it a try ( like once in 3 or 4 weeks ) to see if they had made it any easier . Today , I finally succeeded ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A couple lucky matches and then I was down to 3 moves with 3 striped candies on the board which werent anywhere near each other . So I used 4 " Switch Any Two Candies " help and moved one striped candy next to another and BINGO BANGO MISSION COMPLETE ! ! ! Good Luck Everyone . <p> I have done all of those hints for God knows how long and nothing works . I to am done with this game . Its just not funny anymore . There are no challenge in this level its just impossible . Whoever came up with the game or just that level ( 421 ) go fuck yourself ! ! ! <p> I passed it on my friends phone after failing miserably on my own when she asked I laughed in her face , and said I could n't , but I did . However , I just could n't on my own phone . So I went to my computer and passed It is much easier on a computer . <p> Tough level . This is a message from King that you play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one or two sessions of five games per day . Stock piled seven lolly pop hammers over a period of weeks . Play a friendly board where you can get two combos with before exploding the cakes . Then grind it out . If you can get five combos with ten moves left you have a chance . At that point use your hammers to help create or align the last couple combos . <p> I read all the comments before I played and thought oh great . I made it on the first game with 12 moves left . I could n't believe it . Its the luck of drawing a good board and whirling dervishes who must have been napping <p> This is by far the WORSE ! ! ! ! Took me two months and it was ridiculous and boringno tips help with this one .. nothing ! Finally passed but it was so bad you really want to give up . Even the skip a level did n't  workgood luck . <p> Been playing this level on my android for weeks and never could get more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer and you only need to make five striped combos- got it on the first try ! Go use the computer ! <p> Every time I have a hard level like this one , I read all of the sad stories here , go back and beat level . 421 done . PS , It is very frustrating but take your time and take breaks i 'd you notice that you are getting worse <p> That was a horrible level . I played it on the computer and had the five matches I cant even imagine trying to make seven . I passed it after a few weeks when I got a favorable board and had 20 moves left over . I think a favorable board must be the only way to pass this one . <p> i have finished level 421 after months , but , surprize ! ! ! some error came up just when the game would have showed me the 3 stars and the score ! this is ! ! ! ! i am deleting this game ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> I completed this level after about 4 days . I 'm no expert , but I tried to destroy all the cakes first . Do n't  waste moves making stripes , as they are destroyed by the hammer when a cake is completed . The tornado moves every third turn , and can be destroyed by a stripe activation if you are lucky ! It appears candy is moving on their own , but is caused by tornado leaving a spot , moving to a new one sometimes causes a match . If you get the chance to make a stripe do so , but do n't  waste moves until the cakes are destroyed . I agree there is no way to determine a good board in the beginning .. all random .. The hammer usually gets the wrapped corner stripes before you can use them . If you get a chance to activate two stripes , do so right away before a tornado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cakes early , you should have 30-40 moves to make stripes . I never pay for anything in this gameI use the free spin wheel and save those for really hard boards . Did n't  use any on this level . <p> Got through within a day . Here are some suggestions : start looking for striped candies from the get go and build as many as you can ( the cakes will get exploded one way or another so there 's no need to focus on exploding them quickly ) . If you can get down to 1 combo , its worth using goldbars to continue playing until the last combo is achieved . It usually wo n't take too long to get there if its just one combo left . Good Luck ! 12756 @qwx212756 12763
