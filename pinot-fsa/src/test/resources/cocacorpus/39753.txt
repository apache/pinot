@@71697405 @397405/ <h> SOME WAYS TO GET MORE OUT OF STUDYING <h> 1 . USE BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION ON YOURSELF . <p> It works . Remember Pavlov 's dogs salivating every time they heard a bell ring ? Just as association worked with them , it can also work with you . If you attempt , as nearly as possible , to study the same subject at he same time in the same place each day , you will find that after a very short while that when you get to that time and place , you 're automatically in the subject groove . Train your brain to think French on a time-place cue , and it should take you no longer than ten minutes a day to get into the French mood . Not only will you save the time and emotional energy you once needed to psych yourself up to French or whatever else , but the experts say you 'll also remember more of what you are studying . <h> 2 . DO N'T SPEND MORE THAN AN HOUR AT A TIME ON ONE SUBJECT . <p> In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend more then twenty to thirty minutes , first , when you are under an imposed time restriction , you use the time more effectively . ( Have you noticed how much studying you manage to cram into the day before the big exam ? That 's why it 's called cramming ) . <p> Second , psychologists say that you learn best in short takes . ( Also remember that two or three hours of study without noise or other distractions is more effective than ten hours trying to work amid bedlam . ) In fact , studies have shown that as much is learned in four one-hour sessions distributed over four days as in one marathon six-hours session . That 's because between study time , while you 're sleeping or eating , etc. , your mind is absorbing what you 've learned . <h> 3 . KEEP ALERT BY TAKING REST BREAKS . <p> The specialists say you 'll get your most effective studying done if you take ten minute breaks between subjects . ( Again , it 's akin to behavior modification . Pavlov 's dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tidbits . The break is your reward . ) Dr Walter Pauk , director of the reading and study center at Cornell University , suggests you take a short break whenever you feel you need one , so you do n't fritter your time away in clock watching and anticipating your break . <p> Another technique for keeping your mind from wandering while studying is to begin with your most boring subject or your hardest one , and work toward the easiest and/or the one you like best . <h> 4 . STUDY SIMILAR SUBJECTS AT SEPARATE TIMES . <p> Brain waves are like radio waves . If there is n't enough space between inputs , you get interference . The more similar the kinds of learning taking place , the more interference . So separate your study periods for courses with similar subject matter . Follow your hour of German with an hour of chemistry or history , not with Spanish . <h> 5 . AVOID STUDYING DURING YOUR SLEEPY TIMES . <p> Psychologists have found that everyone has a certain time of day when he or she gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , schedule some physical activity for that period . If you do have a pile of school work , use that time to sort your notes or clear up your desk or study with a friend . <h> 6 . STUDY AT THE MOST PRODUCTIVE TIME FOR YOUR COURSE . <p> If it is a lecture course , do your studying soon after class ; if it is a course in which students are called on to recite or answer questions , study before class . After the lecture you can review , revise , and organize your notes . Before the recitation classes you can spend your time memorizing , brushing up on your facts and preparing questions about the previous class . Question posing is a good technique for helping the material sink in and for pinpointing area in which you need more work . <h> 7 . MEMORIZE ACTIVELY , NOT PASSIVELY . <p> Researchers have found that the worst way to memorize--the way that takes the most time and results in the least retention--is to simply read something over and over again . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , use as many of your senses as possible . Try to visualize in concrete terms to get a picture in your head . In addition to sight use sound ; say the words out loud and listen to yourself saying them . Use association ; relate that fact to be learned to something personally significant or find a logical tie-in . For example , when memorizing dates , relate them to important dates that you already know . <h> 8 . TAKE MORE TIME FOR YOUR READING . <p> It really takes less time in the long run . Read with a purpose . Do not just read through your assignment from beginning to end . You 'll remember a lot more if you first take time to follow the ok4r method devised by Dr Walter Pauk . <p> ( R ) . OVERVIEW : Read the title , the introductory and summarizing paragraphs , and all the headings included in the reading material . This will give you a general idea of what topics will be discussed . Do this chapter by chapter . <p> ( K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text for the key ideas ( usually found in the first sentence of each paragraph ) . Also read the italics and bold , the bulleted sections , itemizations , pictures , and tables . <p> ( R1 ) . READ your assignment from beginning to end . You will be able to do it quickly because you already know where the author is going and what he is trying to prove . <p> ( R2 ) . RECALL : Put aside the text and say or write , in a few key words or sentences , the major points you have read . It has been proven that most forgetting takes place immediately after initial learning . Dr Pauk says that ONE MINUTE SPENT IN IMMEDIATE RECALL NEARLY DOUBLES RETENTION OF THAT PIECE OF DATA . <p> ( R3 ) . REFLECT : the previous steps help to fix the material in your mind .

Watch for the words--such as examples , especially in subjects such as math . <p> Research has proven that it is not how much time you study that counts but how well . Use your study time wisely .

Dynamics of Membranes <p> Molecules are not static , but rather are dynamic . This also applies to molecular aggregates . In the first part of the section , we will discuss the rigid movement of whole lipid molecules in a bilayer , within a leaftlet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplement , we will consider the movement of atoms within a molecule . The movements include motions like bond bending , bond stretching and torsion angle changes like we saw in the previous chapter section on the conformations of n-butane . The position of all atoms within a molecule can be simulated as a function of time - a molecular dynamics simulation . Such motions affect the energy of the molecule , which can be calculated for given atom positions using classical molecular mechanics and electrostatics . <p> Liposomes and bilayers in general must be somewhat dynamics , otherwise they would be impenetrable barriers across which nothing could pass . Cell membranes must separate the outside of a cell from the inside , but they must also allow passage of molecules and even ions across the membrane . What is the evidence that membranes are dynamic ? <p> First , lipids can diffuse laterally in the membrane . This can be shown as follows . Make a liposome from phosphatidylethanolamine , PE , which has been labeled with TNBS ( Trinitrobenzensulfonate ) . The NH2 on the head group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the expulsion of the SO3-2 . The TNB group attached to the PE head group absorbs UV light and emits light of higher wavelength in a process called fluorescence . Next , using a fluorescent microscope , the fluorescence intensity of a region of the surface can be recorded . Then shine a laser on a small area of the surface , which can photobleach the fluorescence in the area . Over time , fluorescence can be detected from the region again . The rate at which it returns is a measure of the lateral diffusion of the labeled lipids into the region . Lipids can undergo lateral diffusion at a rate of about 2 mm/s . This implies that the lipids can transit the surface of a bacteria in 1 sec . <p> Transverse , or flip-flop diffusion ( movement of a phospholipid from one leaftlet to the other , not within a given leaflet ) should be more difficult . Experimentally , this is investigated as shown in the diagrams below . <p> Liposomes experiments : To test flip-flop diffusion in an artificial membrane , liposomes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a nitroxide spin label ( has a single unpaired electron ) . Both inner and outer leaflets of the membrane have the labeled PC . Like a proton in NMR spectroscopy , a single electron has a spin which can give rise to an electron-spin resonance ( ESR ) signal ( as a proton gives rise to a nuclear magnetic resonance signal ) when irradiated with the appropriate frequency electromagnetic radiation ( microwave frequency for ESR , radio frequency for NMR ) in the presence of a magnetic field . The liposomes are kept at 0oC and the ESR signal is determined . Ascorbic acid , a water soluble vitamin and antioxidant/ reducing agent , is added to the liposomes . This reduces the spin labeled PC in the outer leaflet , but not the inner leaftlet of the bilayer since ascorbic acid can not enter the liposome or otherwise interact with it . This reduces the ESR signal to a lower , constant value . The sample is divided into two . One sample is left at 0oC , the other is raised to 30oC . The ESR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0oC prep shows no change in ESR with time , while the 30oC prep ESR signal decreases with time . This decrease resultsfrom flip-flop diffusion of labeled PC from the inner leaflet to the outer , and subsequent reduction by ascorbic acid . These experiments in experimental bilayer systems like liposomes shows that flip-flop diffusion is orders of magnitude slower than lateral diffusion . <p> Cell Experiments : An analogous experiment can be done with bacteria . Radiolabeled 32 PO4 is added to cells for one minute , which leads to the labeling of newly synthesized phospholipid ( PL ) which locates to the inner leaflet . The cells are then split into two samples . One sample is reacted immediately with TNBS , which will label only PE in the outer leaflet . The other sample is incubated 3 minutes ( to allow PL synthesis ) and then reacted with TNBS . After a short labeling period , the cells are destroyed by adding organic solvents which prevents new lipids biosynthesis . The lipids are extracted into the solvent and then subjected to TLC . <p> The lipids can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 32 P alone , some with TNBS alone , and some with both 32P and TNBS . TLC ( or other techniques such as HPLC or GC ) can easily separate PC and TNBS-labeled PC since they have different structures and hence will migrate to different places on a TLC plate . No chromatographic technique could , however , separate PC and 32 P-PC , since their molecular structure is the same , the only difference being in the nuclei of the P ( different number of neutrons ) . <p> Those lipids with double labels ( TNB and 32 P ) must have flipped from the inner leaftlet to the outer leaftlet where they could be labeled with TNBS . The cells incubated for 3 minutes before the addition of TNBS have a much higher level of doubly labeled PL 's . Quantitating these data as a function of differing time of incubation at elevated temperatures show that the rate of flip-flop diffusion is much higher in cells than liposomes , which suggests that the process is catalyzed , presumably by a protein transporter ( flipase or Transbilayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Flip/Flop diffusion in bacterial cells B : Labeling Cells in A with TNBS to detect Flip/Flop <h> C2 . Lipid Distribution in Cells <p> To understand movement of lipids in an actual cell , a better understanding of lipid synthesis and trafficking in cells is important . The table below shows the distribution of four classes of lipids in a macrophage , a type of immune cells ( Andreyev , A.Y . et al ) while the following figure shows how the lipids composition of membranes organelle membranes . <p> Lipids in membranes are often distributed asymmetrically . The inner and outer leaflet of a biological membrane usually have different PL compositions . For example , in red blood cell membranes , the outer leaflet is composed mostly of sphingomylein ( SM ) and PC , while the inner leaflet is composed mostly of PE and phosphatidyl serine ( PS ) . This phospholipid contains the amino acid serine linked through its side chain ( -CH2OH ) to phosphate in position 3 of diacylglyerol .

Certain lipids often cluster within a leaftlet to form lipid " rafts " which can be considered to result from a lateral phase separation of the lipids within one leaflet of the bilayer . Divalent cations like calcium , which can bind to negatively charged PLs like PS , can cause " rafts " of PS to form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bilayer . Rafts also appear to be enriched in cholesterol and lipids with saturated fatty acids , especially sphingolipids , which would lead to regions of enhanced packing and reduced fluidity . Cholesterol would stabilize packing in spaces created with lipids with large head groups . <p> Cholesterol appears to be a key player in the formation of lipid rafts . It is planar and inflexible and would pack better with saturated fatty acid chains and could also induced them to elongate to form lower energy zig-zag structures in which all the methylene groups are anti . Lipid rafts would represent a more ordered lipid phase ( Lo ) compared to the more disordered surrounding phase ( Ld ) . Also compared to the structure of glycerophospholipids , the atoms in the region linking head group and the nonpolar fatty acid chains in sphingolipids have greater potential for H bond interactions with cholesterol and other sphingolipids , as shown below . <p> Rafts probably bind or exclude binding of other biological molecules like proteins . Some proteins are chemically modified with a glycosylphosphoinositol ( GPI ) group at the carboxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anchoring the protein to the bilayer . Protein also appear to induce raft formation . Lipids rafts appear to be enriched in GPI-anchored proteins . Recent studies have shown that the Ebola virus interacts with lipid rafts in the process of entering and exiting the infected cell . Rafts are also involved in how cells sense and respond to their environment . Signaling molecules on the outside of the cell can bind receptor proteins in the membrane . As we will see later , conformational changes in the receptor protein signals the inside of the cells that the receptor is bound with a ligand . Once bound , the receptor can move in the membrane and often cluster in outer leaflet rafts that contain cholesterol and sphingolipids . Inner leaflet rafts have also been observed . The figure below shows two versions of an animated version of a lipid raft . The large shapes represent membrane proteins selectively found in the rafts ( a topic which will be discussed in Chapter 2G ) . The most modern definition of a lipid raft is a nanoscale assemblies of sphingolipids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> C4 . Lipid Conformational Transitions <p> If a liposome preparation is placed in a sensitive calorimeter and the temperature slowly increased , it is observed that the liposome preparation absorbs a significant amount of heat at a temperature characteristic of the PL which compose the liposome . This is analogous to what would happen if solid water was heated . At the melting point of water , an increment of heat is required , the heat of fusion , to break H-bonds and cause melting . Likewise the heat of vaporization is measured when H-bonds are broken on the liquid-gas transition . These transition are associated with non-covalent processes , namely , breaking H-bonds . Graphs of heat absorbed ( Q ) as a function of temperature , or heat absorbed/T ( i.e. the heat capacity ) vs temperature are shown below for the melting and evaporation of water , and for liposome transitions . <p> The transition observed with liposomes is caused by conformational chains in the packing of the acyl chains of the PLs , as the acyl chains change from trans to gauche conformations . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and between bilayers but rather the movement of atoms within the molecules . These kinds of motions can be modeled using molecular dynamics simulations . <p> Before the transition , the acyl chains are more tightly packed in the gel phase , and after they are less tightly packed in the liquid crystalline phase , since many chains are in the gauche conformation . <p> Differences in Gel and Liquid Crystalline Phases in Phospholipids Bilayers <p> The midpoint of the phase transition is called the melting point , Tm . Vesicles in the liquid crystalline phase are more fluid , dynamic , and hence more permeable . Note that the liposomes have not been destroyed but simply have undergone a phase change , much like ice turning to liquid water . Liposomes made of different PL have different Tm . <p> Vesicles make from PLs with bigger head groups have a lower Tm , since they are less " stable " . For example , the Tm for vesicles of di-16:0 versions of PA , PE , and PC have Tms of 67 , 63 , and 41 degrees C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of animal cell membranes . Its size will allow it to fit into either leaftlet with its polar OH pointed to the outside . One function of cholesterol in membranes is to keep the membrane fluid at any reasonable temperature . When a membrane is at a temperature less than the Tm , it is ordinarily in a gel , not liquid crystalline phase . The cholesterol helps prevent ordered packing of the acyl chains of the PL 's , which increases their freedom of motion . Hence the fluidity and permeability of the membrane is increased . At temperatures greater than the Tm , the rigid ring of cholesterol reduces the freedom of the acyl chains to rotation , and hence decreases the number of chains in the gauche conformation . This decreases the fluidity and permeability . <p> Large scale conformational transitions can occur in lipid bilayers . These include bud formation , formation of vesicles which split off from the membrane , and fusion of membrane vesicles , all of which are important biologically . To some extent , the tendency to engage in these larger shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which depends on the local phospholipid composition and fluidity of the membrane . We have previously seen that segregation of lipids into rafts ( or domains ) within a leaflet depends on the phospholipid content . Baumgart et al . have made giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUV ) containing a mixture of three lipids : sphingomyelin ( SM ) , **26;130;TOOLONG ( DOPC ) , and cholesterol ( C ) to study transitions in the bilayers . SM and C segregate laterally into a " liquid phase " domain characterized by significant order ( Lo ) while DOPC forms a " liquid phase " with more disorder ( Ld ) . They could detect the different phases through fluorescence microscopy of GUV 's labeled with fluorophores ( molecules that absorb visible or UV light and emit photons of lower energy ( higher wavelength ) . The first , N-lissamine rhodamine **35;158;TOOLONG ( red fluorescence ) , partitions almost exclusively into the Ld phase . The second , perylene ( blue fluorescence ) , partitioned with great selectivity into the Lo phase . The results of their studies are shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lipid domains ( rafts ) including those in the shapes of circles , stripes , and rings . Their works shows that the boundary between the domains is important in determining lipid structures . Structures are favored which reduce the perimeter at the boundaries of the phases . It appears that the Ld phase ( and associated lipids ) is found preferentially in area of high membrane curvature , while the Lo phase is found is regions of lower curvature .

Imaging coexisting fluid domains in biomembrane models coupling curvature and line tension . Nature . 425 , pg 821 ( 2003 ) <h> C5 . Membrane Permeability <p> Another indicator of membrane dynamics is the measured permeability coefficient of ions and molecules across the bilayer . ( We will discuss these coefficients in the chapter on Passive and Facilitated Diffusion in the Transport and Kinetics Unit . ) Permeabilities are correlated to the partition coefficient of the molecule or ion in organic solvents . If the molecule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to pass through the hydrophobic barrier of the membrane . Obviously the size of the molecule would play a part as well . Hence charged ions like Na+ and K+ have low permeabilities . Cl- has a higher permeability , since the charge density on the larger Cl anion is smaller . Water has a surprisingly high permeability although it is polar . It is small and can enter down deep into the head group region through sequential H-bonding which must assist its transfer across the membrane.

Maple leaves have approximately the same size , but with some variation . Descriptive statistics are an attempt to use numbers to describe how data are the same and not the same . The box plot ( a.k.a. box and whisker diagram ) is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on the five number summary : minimum , first quartile , median , third quartile , and maximum . In the simplest box plot the central rectangle spans the first quartile to the third quartile ( the interquartile range or IQR ) . A segment inside the rectangle shows the median and " whiskers " above and below the box show the locations of the minimum and maximum . <p> This simplest possible box plot displays the full range of variation ( from min to max ) , the likely range of variation ( the IQR ) , and a typical value ( the median @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximums or surprisingly low minimums called outliers . John Tukey has provided a precise definition for two types of outliers : <p> Outliers are either 3+IQR or more above the third quartile or 3+IQR or more below the first quartile . <p> Suspected outliers are are slightly more central versions of outliers : either 1.5+IQR or more above the third quartile or 1.5+IQR or more below the first quartile . <p> If either type of outlier is present the whisker on the appropriate side is taken to 1.5+IQR from the quartile ( the " inner fence " ) rather than the max or min , and individual outlying data points are displayed as unfilled circles ( for suspected outliers ) or filled circles ( for outliers ) . ( The " outer fence " is 3+IQR from the quartile . ) <p> If the data happens to be normally distributed , <p> IQR = 1.35 s <p> where s is the population standard deviation . <p> Suspected outliers are not uncommon in large normally distributed datasets ( say more than 100 data-points ) .

Outliers may deserve special consideration : they may be the key to the phenomenon under study or the result of human blunders . <p> Notice that both datasets are approximately balanced around zero ; evidently the mean in both cases is " near " zero . However there is substantially more variation in A2 which ranges approximately from -6 to 6 whereas A1 ranges approximately from -2+ to 2+ . <p> Below find box plots and the more traditional error bar plots ( with 1-s bars ) .

The sun then illuminates the whole hemisphere of the earth which is turned toward it , from pole to pole . The days and nights are equal all over the earth . This time is called that of the Vernal Equinox , because the season in our hemisphere is spring , and the days and nights are equal . <p> Summer Position of the Earth . -- Three months later , about June 21 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north end of its axis now tipped toward the sun .

Its radius will be 23+ of the earth 's meridian , the same as the obliquity of the ecliptic . As the earth revolves on its axis in this position , the region within the arctic circle will never be carried outside of where the sun is shining .

This circle is called the Tropic of Cancer . <p> At the equator EQ the days will be equal to the nights . The further north we go from the equator , the larger the fraction of a circle of latitude round the earth which will be sunshine . Hence on the 21st of June the days are longer and the nights shorter as we go toward the north . <p> South of the equator the days get shorter and the nights longer , as we travel south , until we reach the antarctic circle , when the sun will simply show himself on the horizon at noon . <p> Autumn Position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the equator again passes through the sun , and the latter shines over one hemisphere of the earth , from the north to the south pole .

Now day and night are the reverse of what they were with the earth at B. Figure 17 will still answer for us , only it is now night where it is represented as day in the figure , and vice versa .

What they wanted was a school of the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had discontinued his studies in Rome because its worldly environment was not what he sought . His name was Benedict . <p> Benedict 's reputation rests on the Rule he wrote for his monastery . It is a work of genius . The monastic movement shaped by the Rule of Benedict is generally credited with a major role in preserving the learning of the past and creating a social fabric that provided security and a stable environment for new growth in Christian Europe . Yet Benedict did n't invent anything people had nott thought of before . There was already a long tradition of Christian monastic life-sometimes solitary , sometimes in community . Benedict drew on this long tradition when he set down the rules for his followers at Monte Cassino . <p> What resulted was a work stamped with his deep respect for the person and his unerring sense of proportion . With typical modesty he calls it " a little rule for beginners , " but the Rule of Benedict was to be adopted by hundreds and eventually thousands of religious communities great and small , male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a model for many other civic and social bodies . In the words of a modern commentator , Benedict had come up with a guide for developing sustainable communities that is as relevant now as it was 1,500 years ago . <p> Let 's look at that a bit . How does Benedict build a community ? I 'm dwelling on this because in some respects it is as relevant to academic communities as it is to monasteries . <p> To start with Benedict puts all of the members on the same footing . Age , wealth , professional accomplishments , social prominence does not count . Rank in the community is simply by when you arrived . A certain respect for the elders of the community is appropriate , but this is simply one aspect of the mutual respect that all the brothers should have for one another . And bear in mind that this is a cross-generational community , from youths to men of advanced years , who go on living together year after year . <p> The line of authority is clear . The community is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst . Benedict details the qualifications of the abbot , above all the discretion and sensitivity required in dealing with individuals as individuals . He must be aware that he will have to give an accounting to God for the welfare of each member of the community . The sick and the elderly may need a special diet that includes meat . Those with heavy responsibilities should be given the help they need in order to carry out their duties with a tranquil spirit . In community decision making the young should be heard . And so on . <p> There is also a strong horizontal relationship . The members need to care for one another , even be obedient to one another with mutual respect and love . " The brothers should serve one another " Benedict says , " for such service increases reward and fosters love . " ( Chapter 35 . ) A sense of serving the common good is pervasive . As far as possible the community is to be self-sustaining . This means that somebody has to plow the fields , herd the sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of other practical skills . <p> Everybody is expected to take a turn at the domestic chores . An English writer describes arriving very late at a monastery where he had an appointment to see the abbot . He got lost in the countryside and arrived long after dark . Someone in black pants and a T-shirt opened the door when he rang the bell , said , " Ah , yes , we were expecting you , " got him to a room , brought him a bite to eat , told him when breakfast was in the morning . The guest asked one thing : " Do you suppose I shall still be able to see the abbot ? " " Oh , I 'm the abbot , " his host said , " but you must be tired now . I 'll see you in the morning . " <p> This incident catches the spirit of the Rule to a tee . It reminds me of a story told about Abbot Basil Hume , the future archbishop of Westminster , who came to christen the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hostess get the house ready by vacuuming the living room rug . The framework of community comes alive under the warmth of Benedict 's persuasion that nothing is to be preferred to Christ 's love in their midst . Equal standing ; caring and wise authority ; mutual respect and service : there you have the building blocks of Benedictine community . <p> Historically what did Benedictines do in community ? For one thing , many monastic communities became centers of learning . This is the second point I want to make about Benedictines and the bearing of their fundamental values on higher education . <p> A focus on learning was there in embryo from the first in Benedict 's emphasis on reading . You had to be a reader to follow the way of life he prescribes . Besides work and prayer the monks were expected to spend two , three , maybe even four hours a day reading . The chapter of the Rule that deals with the daily manual labor devotes as much attention to the hours reserved for reading as it does to the hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the monk 's life explains why copying manuscripts and making books became such a characteristic occupation for monks . Every cloister had its library as surely as it had its chapel . First of all the monks read Sacred Scripture and the great church writers like Augustine and Basil and Ambrose , but they also preserved and made new copies of profane authors like Cicero , Pliny , Tacitus-the whole body of classical literature that medieval scholars called Grammar with a capital " G , " what Jean Leclercq calls " the first stage and the foundation of general culture " ( The Love of Learning and the Desire for God , 17 ) . <p> Despite this emphasis on books the monks did not found universities , although as the universities developed Benedictines were often university students and sometimes professors . However , both monks and nuns provided schooling for their own members . A famous product of this schooling was the eighth-century English monk , Bede , born in 673 , who came to the monastery of Jarrow as a youth and lived his entire life there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History of the English Church and People , a full length history which remains the major source for its period . He lived from 673 to 735 . In his lifetime the monasteries of northern England were the focal point of learning in Western Europe . <p> " From the start , " as I noted in an article I wrote some years ago , " Benedictine life required a certain level of disciplined intellectual activity . . . . It is not surprising that in the centuries following Benedict , monasteries became centers of literary culture , preserving the ancient texts in new copies and composing a body of liturgical texts , homilies , commentaries , and chronicles of their times " ( The American Benedictine Review June 1995 , 123 ) . English Benedictines undertook to send a portion of their membership-one for every twenty monks-to Oxford or Cambridge , a practice that continued until Benedictine life in England was violently terminated by Henry VIII in the 1540s . ( See Benedictines in Oxford , ed . Henry Wansbrough , OSB , and Anthony Marett-Crosby , OSB , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first printing presses in Europe was founded at the great Spanish abbey of Montserrat as early as 1499 . Toward the end of the sixteenth century Benedictines founded communities in the New World with monasteries and schools in Brazil that continue today . In the nineteenth century Benedictines came to North America and began to offer education at high school , college , and seminary level . Suffice it to say that it 's a long history of learning as an integral part of Benedictine life that we continue in contemporary schools and colleges under Benedictine auspices . <p> Finally let me note , however briefly , the particular character of Benedictine spirituality . Krista Tippett , author of Speaking of Faith , puts her finger on the key to what is distinctive about Benedictine spirituality when she remarks that <p> Benedictines " take great pride in the fact that their order began in the sixth century , predating the major divisions in the church " ( Tippett , 117 ) . <p> One of the results of that early origin is that monastic spirituality is firmly rooted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sources leads Benedictines to a comprehensive and ecumenical view of the Christian life . <p> It is ecumenical in the original sense of the word , " belonging to or representing the whole Christian world . " It is also ecumenical in the more limited way we generally use the term today to mean bridging the gap between Catholic and Protestant or between Eastern Orthodox and Rome . Benedictine spirituality took shape long before the split between Eastern and Western branches of the church in the 11th century and the further divisions that resulted from the Reformation in the 16th century . It is a spirituality that transcends ecclesiastical divides because it is rooted in religious sources that antedate the sometimes bitter theological and political differences of more recent centuries . <p> In addition , Benedictine spirituality continues to be shaped by daily immersion in the hours of prayer and Eucharist that make up the monastic liturgy . A life steeped in the Psalms and the Gospels affords a large common ground with other people of faith within the Christian tradition and in interreligious dialogue . <p> Seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " often seen at the entrance to a monastery takes on dynamic meaning . It does n't mean passive toleration-You go your way , I 'll go mine-but active commitment . As Paul puts it : " Live in peace and the God of love and peace will be with you " ( 2 Cor. 13.11 ) . On the contemporary American campus with its new interest in spirituality this commitment to building peace by the way we live is a Benedictine strength that should not be disregarded but treasured and cultivated . <p> Let me summarize what I 've said . I 've dwelt on three major facets of the Benedictine heritage that continue to have a deep effect on education under Benedictine auspices . They are the distinctive structure of community that Benedict worked out so wisely in his Rule for monasteries , the central role of disciplined intellectual activity in the Benedictine tradition , and the deep theological and spiritual grounding of the Benedictine tradition in Sacred Scripture and the writers whom Benedict calls " the holy Catholic fathers " in the stirring conclusion to his Rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the life of those ancient men and women who devoted themselves to the science of charity , in willing exile from the world of social prestige and power , may perhaps again become the model that Christians will find themselves compelled to emulate " ( Atheist Delusions New Haven , 2009 , 241 ) . " Compelled " may be too strong a word , but called upon to recognize and value sounds right for an institution that prides itself on its Benedictine heritage .

Working throughout the state of Minnesota and on a national level , we have been committed to developing pastoral knowledge , skills , and opportunities for ministers , both ordained and lay ecclesial , to interpret theologically and pastorally the movement of God within the life of the Church . <p> Minnesota Common Standards for Lay Ecclesial Ministers ( 1999 to 2003 ) In 1999 , Saint John 's School of Theology and Seminary was awarded a grant by the Lilly Endowment for Sustaining Pastoral Excellence .

This first symposium , " Working in the Vineyard of the Lord , " was dedicated to responding to the call from the U.S. Bishops to foster communion for Christ 's mission by expanding in the study of critical issues facing lay ecclesial ministry and dialoguing about effective ways to support and advance ministry in the Church.For more information and documents , please visit the site for the 2007 Collegeville National Symposium on Lay Ecclesial Ministry <p> In 2011 , a second national symposium was held to advance the national will for the authorization and certification for lay ecclesial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vocation of the lay ecclesial minister . Saint John 's School of Theology and Seminary convened national partners and theologians to a focused dialogue . The first fruits of this dialogue were theologians testing their theological developments with the experience of lay ecclesial ministers , writing and re-writing as consensus developed . The dialogues were harvested in the book : In the Name of the Church : Vocation and Authorization of Lay Ecclesial Ministry ( Liturgical Press , 2012 ) . Twenty-five national partners , consisting of the USCCB , academic institutions , diocesan offices and national organization were given small grants as requested to continue the dialogue and/or research . One such study that was commissioned was by the Canon Law Society of America ( CLSA ) through The Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate ( CARA ) . This study entitledAuthorization of Lay Ecclesial Ministers for Ministry became a primary focal point of dialogue for an event in the 10th year anniversary celebration events in 2015 in Collegeville.For more information and documents , please visit the site for the 2011 Collegeville National Symposium on Lay Ecclesial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Saint John 's School of Theology gathered national partners in Orlando , Florida to explore the desires and sensibilities of the national partners towards a third national symposium .

It was the consensus of those gathered to move toward a 2017 Lay Ecclesial Ministry Symposium in Collegeville . Building upon the work of the previous National Lay Ecclesial Ministry Symposia and continuing the efforts at understanding the pathways to , formation for , authorization and certification of , and leadership and collaboration within lay ecclesial ministry , participants will advance , by way of a Third National Symposium , three new goals were established:1 . Intercultural Competency : To engage theological and pastoral reflection on the diverse nature and experience of leadership and community by lay ecclesial ministers in defining pathways and applying standards.2 . Co-Responsibility : To interpret the concept of co-responsibility for the Church in light of the new evangelization and how it informs an understanding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lay ecclesial ministry and the ordained.3 . Advancing the Vision of Co-workers : To gather the wisdom and insight of symposium participants about the advances made by Co-workers and areas for further development to deepen the vision of lay ecclesial ministry in the United States . <p> 10th Anniversary Celebration of Co-WorkersIn 2014 , the Pastoral Excellence Network funded by the Lilly Endowment offered a small grant to the Saint John 's School of Theology and Seminary to mark the 10th anniversary of the publication of Co-Workers . To this end , St. John 's School of Theology sought to continue the work begun in the last symposia through a close reading of the research authorized by the Canon Law Society of America . <p> In November , 2014 , a group of 20 lay ecclesial ministers met for a three-day conference to explore Co-Workers through the lens of an " Inter-generational Assessment of Lay Ecclesial Ministry . " Aware that perspectives on lay ecclesia ministry change over the course of the lifecycle , the intent of this event was to observe how lay ecclesial ministers with various lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in light of the articulated vision in Co-Workers . The group was composed of ministers who had 3 or fewer years , between 4 and 10 years , between 11-10 years , and more than 20 years of ministry experience . From the intergenerational group , the question of how clergy read the Co-Workers document arose . In March of 2015 a day of discussion for priests in Minnesota was held to interpret the Co-Workers document in light of their ministry and in relationship to serving and working with lay ecclesial ministers in the parish setting . <p> In May 2015 , two major conversations were held to explore the document commissioned by the Canon Law Society of America entitled : " Toward Canonical Consideration of the Authorization of Lay Ecclesial Ministers for Ministry " . The first was a gathering of 25 partners to discuss this study and documents from the 2007 and 2011 symposia . A grassroots listening process was established with our partners . This listening process generated a list of recommendations to advance the will for lay ecclesial ministry at the national , diocesan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States through a listening session and force-field analysis process . By way of preparing for the process , the partners practiced the process by using the force-field analysis process . The group took one recommendation , a national recommendation to " provide opportunities for dialogue , formation , and education for bishops and clergy around lay ecclesial ministry " and further discussed the enabling and restraining forces , through a force field analysis . The following day , about 40 lay ecclesial ministers and clergy from the area joined in the conversation , learning more about the national state of certification and a prioritization of recommendations for the national , diocesan and parish levels and for a luncheon celebration of the 10th anniversary of the publication of Co-workers and to honor H. Richard McCord with the Wisdom and Service Award .

Our partners will develop conversations within their dioceses , parishes , and organizations to repeat the same process they participated in at Collegeville . The recording of speakers , prayer services and other documents are available here for group process . As Saint John 's School of Theology and Seminary continues to advancing the national will for lay ecclesial ministry , it is important to continue to gather and listen to the grassroots conversation on the local level throughout the country .

( It turns out that if the number of items is even , as in this example , there is no exact middle . 7.2 is 5 places from the front and 6 places from the back ; 7.3 is 6 places from the front and 5 places from the back . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , producing Xmed=7.25 in this example . ) <p> The mode " typical " value will be of less use to us : it is the most repeated value in the data set . In the above example , no value is repeated ( each value occurs exactly once ) . This is commonly the case with so few data items ; hence its limited utility for us . <p> The geometric mean is useful for " log-normal distributions " . To obtain the geometric mean , multiply all the numbers together and then take the result to the power 1/N ( where N is the number of data items -- 10 in our example ) . So the geometric mean is : <p> ( X01+X02+X03+ X04+X05+X06+ X07+X08+X09+ X10 ) 1/10 = Xgeo <h> Estimates of the Range of Variation <p> In some sense , the range of variation is limited only by your willingness to search through ever larger piles of leaves . Generally , the more data you record the more extreme your highs and lows will be . Nevertheless , you should find that the range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remains about the same even if you look through ever larger piles of leaves . That is to say , there is a common range of variation even as larger data sets produce rare " outliers " with ever more extreme deviation . Estimates of the range of variation seek to put a number to this common range of variation that does n't depend on sample size . <p> The most common way to describe the range of variation is standard deviation ( usually denoted by the Greek letter sigma : ) . The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance , so let 's start by describing the variance . To obtain the variance start by subtracting the average from each data item . Since there will be about as many items above average as below average , the resulting list of numbers will have about as many positive values as negative values . ( In fact this list of deviations-from-average must itself average to zero ! ) Square each deviation , and proceed to find the average of the squared-deviations . However , in finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result is the variance ; take its square root to get the standard deviation . <p> For data that is " normally distributed " we expect that about 68.3% of the data will be within 1 standard deviation of the mean ( i.e. , in the range Xavg ) . In general there is a relationship between the fraction of the included data and the deviation from the mean in terms of standard deviations . <p> Thus we should expect that 95% of the data would be within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean ( i.e. , in the range Xavg 1.96 ) . This is called a 95% confidence interval for the sample . <p> The average deviation or mean absolute deviation is calculated in a similar manner as standard deviation , except here you subtract the median from each data item producing a list of deviations from the median . Instead of squaring each deviation , you take the absolute value of each deviation . Finally you average in the usual way : using N not N-1 . <p> If the data is " normally distributed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard deviation : <p> average deviation = 0.80 + standard deviation ; where 0.80 = ( 2/ ) + . <h> Five-Number Summary <p> The median , you recall , is in the middle of the sorted data . In a similar way we can define the first quartile to be 1/4 of the way through the sorted data , and the third quartile to be 3/4 of the way through the sorted data . ( The preferred name for the second quartile is the median , so that 's what we 'll call it . ) The range between the first and third quartiles includes half of the data . The size of the range ( i.e. , the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile ) is another measurement of variability called the interquartile range or IQR . For normally distributed data : <p> IQR = 1.35 + <p> The five-number summary of the data consists of the minimum data point , the first quartile , the median , the third quartile , and the maximum data point . Thus these five numbers display the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the common range of variation ( from first to third quartile ) , and a typical value ( the median ) . <h> Standard Deviation of the Estimated Means <p> The above procedure describes how to define a " typical " leaf using 10 sample leaves . Clearly if another group uses the same procedure on its own sample of 10 leaves , it is unlikely to come up with exactly the same value for a " typical " leaf . How much variation is there in the estimates of " typical " described above ? Clearly if we expand the sample beyond 10 ( to 100 , or 1000 , ... ) we would expect to come closer to the actual " typical " leaf ( i.e. , that determined by looking at all the leaves in the world ) . Thus the larger the sample you average over , the smaller is your expected deviation from the exact result . But how much variation should you expect in a calculated average leaf ? The standard deviation expected in a calculated average is : <p> /N1/2 <p> Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leaves if you " average " over just one leaf , and decrease as the square root of N as N increases . Thus one can expect to get quite close to the exact mean if the sample size N gets very big . <h> " Normal " and other Distributions <p> Many pages have been written by others on this topic . To be brief , a common assumption of statistics-users is that data is " normally " distributed . Occasionally the folks making this assumption know what it means and even test to see if it 's a valid assumption . I 'm going to leave you in the dark ( like many statistics-users ) about what this assumption means and how you test it . There are several good courses and books that would include these topics . I will give you two ( not very helpful ) hints . <p> ( Bad News ) Many things in nature are not " normally " distributed . ( Good News ) Much of what is not " normally " distributed in biology would be " normally " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus there is a button on the descriptive statistics calculation page to do this conversion for you . The result is that the geometric mean is calculated for you and a different kind of standard deviation is produced . With the usual standard deviation you add or subtract the standard deviation from the mean in order to test for fractions of included data ; with the log standard deviation , you multiply or divide . Thus you would expect 68.3% of your data to be between Xgeo+ and Xgeo ; 95.4% of your data would be between Xgeo+ 2 and Xgeo 2 <p> ( Bad News ) Much of what 's in books about statistics has to do with " normally " distributed data . Statistics that provide useful information even if applied to not- " normally " distributed data are call robust statistics . Median and average deviation are considered robust statistics . ( Good News ) The program always calculates them for you . <p> There is one additional distribution you should know a bit about : the Poisson distribution . The Poisson distribution particularly applies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per acre or the number of radioactive decays in an hour . The main upshot is that with things distributed according to the Poisson distribution , the standard deviation of the count can be estimated as the square root of the count . Thus if in a particular experiment you detected 1000 radioactive decays , a full repeat of that experiment might yield 1030 or 970 or 1037 or 998 ... The standard deviation of the counts in the repeated experiments should be close to the square root of 1000 ( 31.6 ) . Thus if you do n't have the time to do lots of full repeats , the range of variation you would experience can still be estimated .

" Really ? What about that dream ? " he keep asking . White lady hesitates for a little while , finally she says , " I dreamed that I lost you forever " . The prince looks surprised , and he seems to be pretty happy about her answer . He gets down to her level and says right next to her ear : " I would never leave you alone , my sweetheart .

( p. 167 ) <p> The architect chosen for the new college building and the chapel was Mr. George Stauduhar of Rock Island , Illinois , and plans were drawn up for a $50,000 chapel and a $50,000 college hall.Before the buildings were completed , however , the total cost was $335,467 .... ( p. 168 ) <p> The new college hall , St. Teresas , was a four-story brick structure with a full basement and a flat roof , the first of its kind on the premises.The basement contained the gymnasium ; the first floor , the library , the museum , and art and sewing rooms ; and the second , the assembly hall and two classrooms.The two upper floors , the residence section , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened into a spacious " rotunda , " an oblong social center , with a balcony , and a full skylight as a ceiling.Like the chapel , the college soon became a show place of central Minnesota . ( p. 169 ) <p> .... The new college building , St. Teresas Hall , was completed and opened for classes in the fall of 1913 . The first students registered were sisters , candidates for the order , and a few lay students.Helen McDonald of Eau Claire , Wisconsin , was the first lay student to sign.She was followed by Esther Mueller of St. Joseph , Margaret Grant of Minneapolis , Margaret McKeon of Montgomery , and Josephine Skluzacek of Lonsdale , Minnesota.The old records show that Helen McDonalds program of studies included logic , psychology , geometry , Greek , and history.Margaret Grant registered for history , English , philosophy , Latin , and chemistry.During the first ten years , very crucial years , the classes remained small , but the staff under the guidance of Sister Dominica Borgerding and Sister Adelgundis Bergmann pursed its way through all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college was still novel in the Midwest . ( p. 190-191 ) <p> Despite the very small student body the administration within two years opened third and fourth year classes.The decision was made because the faculty believed that a two-year offering was an obstacle to growth , for many students refused to enroll in a college in which they could not finish.Accreditment came early for this embryo college ; in 1918 , within five years after its founding , the University of Minnesota inspected the institution and placed the junior college on its list of accredited junior colleges . <p> Discipline in a Catholic womens college during the early part of this century was strict.At St. Benedicts , where the college evolved as it did under the same roof as the academy , retaining the same officers and at times the same teachers , it was but natural that the life and the discipline of the college students would differ little from that of academy students.It was some time before such things as " late pers , " uncensored mail , and the privilege of receiving calls from young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties , picnics , dramatics , debates , and musicals helped to break the routine.Entertainment of a higher order was provided by the administration , and in its first years the college established the policy of arranging programs by noted speakers and musicians and of bringing the best of artistic talent to its students.During these years such well-known Shakespearean interpreters as Francis ODonnell and C.E. Griffith made annual appearances , as did Henry Southwick , president of Emerson School of Expression at Boston.Among the musicians were Madame von Unschuld and Rose DArina.Professors of the University of Minnesota frequently spoke at student convocations . <p> The first college degree was issued in June of 1917 , but the first group or class to receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts was that of 1918 .... ( p. 191-192 ) <p> The College of St. Benedict located as it is in the quiet of a Minnesota village might have been out of touch with the general current of national and international affairs.However , the student body soon included young women of various races and from many countries .... ( p. 192-193 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student body was made up mainly of young women from Minnesota and the Dakotas with an occasional student from Canada , Montana , and Nebraska.But during the 1930s the college took on a more cosmopolitan character.In 1930 Lucy Chung and Florence Chi of Peking were enrolled , and since that date students from the Far East have continued to be registered at St. Benedicts .... ( p. 195 ) <p> These developments were taking place despite the pressures inherent in the effort to conform to the pattern of state education.Looking for full accreditment and recognition it had been natural to turn to the University of Minnesota and to the State Department of Education rather than to regional or national agencies.As a result , the college had in some things patterned itself on the University.Like the University , St. Benedicts divided the school year into quarter terms instead of semesters.The sequences of studies often followed that of the University.To be assured of state approval , most of the faculty continued to attend the University of Minnesota and received advanced degrees from it.Full accreditment of the senior college to the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college.The reason was that after 1918 it became the policy of the University to accredit but a few departments at a time instead of accrediting a college as a whole.This policy prolonged the suspense and uncertainty of the standing of the college in the educational system of the state.Besides , the sisters began to see the possibility of developing the more distinctly Christian character of the college by looking beyond the state university for educational advisement and leadership.With the appointment of Sister Claire Lynch as dean in 1932 the college entered on a new programthat of throwing off its dependence on one local accrediting agency and of seeking membership in the North Central Association of Colleges.Some of the faculty feared that such a powerful organization might exert undue influence in Catholic institutions.But neither the president of the college , Mother Rosamond Pratschner , nor the dean , Sister Claire , was of that mind.Under their guidance the college applied for membership in the North Central Association in 1932 and was admitted within a year.With this step taken , administration and faculty worked to bring the program of studies back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a central discipline.The departments of studies were reorganized and grouped into eight divisions.Because of pressure from the University of Minnesota inspectors , philosophy as a distinct department had been dropped and only a few courses had been offered.In 1937 the department was not only reinstated but ten quarter hours of philosophy were required of all students.Today the requirement is sixteen semester credits for both the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science degrees .... ( p. 195-196 ) <p> When the disturbances of two world wars broke in upon the normal life of the college , students and faculty cooperated with the governments war efforts.During World War I sisters and students did all they possibly could in sewing and knitting for soldiers.In World War II the college was permitted to establish its own Red Cross unitone of the first college units to be set up in Minnesota.The output of this surgical dressing unit doubled that of any other unit of the county.Faculty and students signed up as blood donors each time the mobile blood donor unit came to St. Cloud.On occasion seventy sisters from the college and the convent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enrolled in the gallon club.Some sisters and students joined in first aid classes ; others conducted the sale of war bonds and stamps . <p> World War II brought to the college some of the same problems that it brought to other colleges.On two of these the administration and the faculty took a conservative stand , unswayed by war hysteria.Should St. Benedicts follow the lead of the colleges which were planning to shorten the four-year term by means of long summer sessions ? Should the college stress subjects and courses of a more practical nature ? To the first question Mother Rosamond and the faculty answered that a great number of students were dependent on summer employment to help defray the expenses of their college education.Part-time work the year round would enable students in large cities to dispense with summer salaries , but such opportunities were not available in the small village of St. Joseph.To the second question , should St. Benedicts follow the new trend or keep to the traditional Benedictine cultural program of the sciences , literature , and the arts and prepare its students not only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living , there could be but one answer .... ( p. 193 ) <p> The erection of four hospitals at Bismarck , St. Cloud , Ogden , and New Prague had so absorbed the attention and the financial assets of the community that nothing had been done to enlarge and improve the college buildings at St. Joseph.A residence hall had long been needed.Since in its early years the college was located too far from St Cloud to draw a large number of day students , most of the students enrolled would have to live on campus.Insufficient residence accommodations compelled the college administration to refuse entrance to a large number of students each year and hampered the growth of the institution.Finally in 1954 , the situation became so acute that building was imperative.A committee chosen from the college faculty was appointed by Mother Richarda to study the needs of the college and to make plans for its future growth.After putting the project under the patronage of St. Joseph , they called in the assistance of the architects , Mr. Richard Hammel and Mr. Curtis Green of St. Paul.The committee and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction were necessarya dormitory to house 200 students , a recreational center , and an auditorium.The vacated dormitory space in the old building would provide room for the expansion of instructional facilities.It was soon evident that an auditorium would not be built until a later date . <p> The plans drawn up by the architects provided for a three-story dormitory to accommodate 200 students and for a common building or recreational center to include guest rooms , recreation rooms , snack bar and a lounge for day students.Though both buildings were to have a brick exterior to harmonize with the older buildings on the campus , the plans revealed a decidedly contemporary handling of materials and spaces.To prevent bigness from destroying the family spirit which has been such a marked feature of school life at St. Benedicts during its century of existence , the dormitory was divided into six units , each having its own living room , kitchenette , and laundry.Early in 1955 the building contract was given to the Wahl Construction Company of St. Cloud.The estimate for construction , furnishing , and architects fee was $981,117.68 .

@@71697522 @397522/ <p> We have all seen light shine on different objects . Some objects are shiny and some are matte or dull . Some objects are different colours . Light interacts with these objects in different ways . Sometimes , light goes straight through an object , such as a window or a piece of glass . <p> Because chemical reactions are frequently conducted in solution , we will think about light entering a solution . <p> Imagine sunlight shining through a glass of soda . Maybe it is orange or grape soda ; it is definitely coloured . We can see that as sunlight shines through the glass , coloured light comes out the other side . Also , less light comes out than goes in . <p> Maybe some of the light just bounces off the glass , but some of it is definitely absorbed by the soda . <p> So , what is the soda made of ? Molecules . Some of these molecules are principally responsible for the colour of the soda . There are others , such as the ones responsible for the flavour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old water molecules . The soda is a solution ; it has lots of molecules ( the solute ) dissolved in a solvent ( the water ) . <p> Light is composed of photons . As photons shine through the solution , some of the molecules catch the photons . They absorb the light . Generally , something in the molecule changes as a result . The molecule absorbs energy from the photon and is left in an excited state . <p> The more of these molecules there are in the solution , the more photons will be absorbed . If there are twice as many molecules in the path of the light , twice as many photons will be absorbed . If we double the concentration , we double the absorbance . <p> The amount of light absorbed depends on the concentration of the solution . <p> Alternatively , if we kept the concentration of molecules the same , but doubled the length of the vessel through which the light traveled , it would have the same effect as doubling the concentration . Twice as much light would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell holding the solution . <p> These two factors together make up part of a mathematical relationship , called Beer 's Law , describing the absorption of light by a material : <p> A = e c l <p> in which A = Absorbance , the percent of light absorbed ; c = the concentration ; l = the length of the light 's path through the solution ; e = the " absorptivity " or " extinction coeficient " of the material , which is a measure of how easily it absorbs a photon that it encounters . <p> That last factor , e , suggests that not all photons are absorbed easily , or that not all materials are able to absorb photons equally well . There are a couple of reasons for these differences . <p> Problem PC1.1 . <p> Calculate the absorbance in the following cases . <p> a ) A sample with a molar absorptivity e = 60 L mol-1cm-1 is diluted to a 0.01 mol L-1 solution in water and placed in a 1 cm cell . <p> b ) A sample with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3.5 x 10-5 mol L-1 solution in water and placed in a 1 cm cell . <p> c ) A sample with a molar absorptivity e = 1.4 L mol-1cm-1 is diluted to a 0.25 mol L-1 solution in water and placed in a 0.5 cm cell . <p> d ) A sample with a molar absorptivity e = 23,000 L mol-1cm-1 is diluted to a 2.5 x 10-6 mol L-1 solution in water and placed in a 1 cm cell . <p> e ) A sample with a molar absorptivity e = 14,000 L mol-1cm-1 is diluted to a 0.015 mmol L-1 solution in water and placed in a 1 cm cell . <p> Problem PC1.2 . <p> Calculate the extinction coefficient in the following cases . <p> a ) 30% absorbance is observed with a 0.01 mol L-1 solution in a 1 cm cell . <p> b ) 25% absorbance is observed with a 0.025 mol L-1 solution in a 1 cm cell . <p> c ) 95% absorbance is observed with a 0.00175 mol L-1 solution in a 0.5 cm cell . <p> d ) 66% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1 cm cell . <p> Often a particular soda will absorb light of a particular colour . That means , only certain photons corresponding to a particular colour of light are absorbed by that particular soda . <p> How does that affect what we see ? If the red light is being absorbed by the material , it is n't coming back out again . The blue and yellow light still are , though . That means the light coming out is less red , and more yellowy-blue . We see green light emerging from the glass . <p> A " colour wheel " or " colour star " can help us keep track of the idea of complementary colours . When a colour is absorbed on one side of the star , we see mostly the colour on the opposite side of the star . <p> Problem PC1.3 . <p> a ) What colour of photon is probably most strongly absorbed by a glass of orange soda ? <p> b ) What colour of photon is most strongly absorbed by a glass of lime soda ? <p> c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass of blue raspberry kool-aid ? <p> d ) What colour of photon is most strongly absorbed by a glass of pineapple soda ? <p> e ) What colour of photon is most strongly absorbed by a glass of cherry soda ? <p> Why do certain materials absorb only certain colours of light ? That has to do with the properties of photons . Photons have particle-wave duality , just like electrons . They have wave properties , including a wavelength . <p> That wavelength corresponds to the energy of a photon , according to the Planck-Einstein equation : <p> Alternatively , the Planck-Einstien equation can be thought of in terms of frequency of thr photon : as a photon passes through an object , how frequently does one of its " crests " or " troughs " encounter the object ? How frequently does one full wavelength of the photon pass an object ? That parameter is inversely proportional to the wavelength .

The former is the wavelength of violet light and the latter is the wavlength of red light . Which one has higher energy : a photon of blue light or a photon of red light ? <p> Problem PC1.9 . <p> Ultraviolet light -- invisible to humans and with wavelengths beyond that of violet light -- is associated with damage to skin ; these are the cancer-causing rays from the sun . Explain their danger in terms of their relative energy . <p> Different materials absorb photons of different wavelengths because absorption of a photon is an absorption of energy . Something must be done with that energy . In the case of ultraviolet and visible light , the energy is of the right general magnitude to excite an electron to a higher energy level . <p> However , we know that energy is quantized . That means photons will be absorbed only if they have exactly the right amount of energy to promote an electron from its starting energy level to a higher one ( producing an " excited state " ) . Just like Goldilocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick . Neither will a photon with too little . It has to be just right . <p> If the absorption of a UV-visible photon is coupled to the excitation of an electron , what happens when the electron falls back down to the ground state ? You might expect a photon to be released . <p> This phenomenon was observed during the late nineteenth century , when scientists studied the " emission spectra " of metal ions . In these studies , the metal ions would be heated in a flame , producing characteristic colours . In that event , the electron would be thermally promoted to a higher energy level , and when it relaxed , a photon would be emitted corresponding to the energy of relaxation . <p> By passing this light through a prism or grating , scientists could separate the observed colour into separate lines of different wavelengths . This evidence led directly to the idea of Niels Bohr and others that atoms had electrons in different energy levels , which is part of our view of electronic structure today . 74907 @qwx694907

@@71697531 @397531/ <p> This is the best of times and the worst of times : both the power and corruption of statistics are daily on display . This is not new : Darrell Huff 's book How to Lie with Statistics ( Norton , 1954 ) attempted to expose the tricks of the statistical spin-doctors for the " self-defense " of " honest men " . In 1883 ( Life on the Mississippi p.120 ) , with tongue firmly in check , a trifling investment of fact <p> Since the eye is a " fat pipe " to the mind , that is , since a great deal of ( mis ) information can be quickly communicated visually , the ( i 'm ) proper display of statistics offers a fast track to selling ideas , and potentially to lying with statistics . Thus I see the greatest abuse of statistics when I see them graphically displayed . ( Nevertheless the majority of the book How to Lie with Statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These pages assume that your aim is simple and accurate display of statistical information mostly for yourself ( as part of doing experiments ) , but perhaps also for your scientific peers . Illustrators working in public relations or for a general readership publication like USA Today often have different aims and audiences in mind . My bias for display is plain and simple , which conveniently matches what is easy to make , what is part of the standard scientific visual vocabulary , and what journals are willing to publish . Do not be mislead : Simplificy is not a foolproof tonic against distortion ( in fact many striking optical illusions are quite simple ) , and " standard practice " has hidden many important phenomenon . For a much more complete discussion of visual display see the works of Edward R. Tufte or , for example , Elements of Graph Design by S. Kosslyn . <p> Everything should be made as simple as possible , but not simpler Albert Einstein <h> Statistics Display : Simple and Accurate Please ! <p> With production of nice drawing programs like Adobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chapter 6 of How to Lie with Statistics : <p> Presumably this graph shows that there were a bit more than 10 frogs in May and something like 40 frogs in September . However , because the frog picture is not regular ( and lacks clear and distinct start and stop points ) it is impossible to read precise values from the chart . ( My best measurement on this chart finds 11.6 frogs in May and 38.2 frogs in September . ) At face value the chart suggests that frogs were simply bigger in September than in May ... The title may correct that false impression , but still leave the impression of a much bigger change . The frog on the right is about 3+ longer and 3+ wider than the frog on the left and hence takes up 32=9 times more area ( and presumably the eye judges 33=27 times more mass and volume ) . Thus this sort of diagram leaves the viewer with a distorted view of the actual data : a change much larger than a factor of 3 . <p> We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot : <p> Now it is clear that there were something like 3 times more frogs in September than in May . Of course , it is unlikely to have been exactly 3 times more frogs ... a confusing fractional frog will generally be required . If your aim is accuracy rather than art , your proper display choice here is an old fashion bar chart : <p> The purpose of a bar is to put the raw numbers into perspective . This purpose is thwarted if a truncated scale is used : <p> Truncated scales are the topic of chapter 5 in How to Lie with Statistics . I believe it is never fair to use truncated scales on bar graphs . On the other hand , sometimes you will feel that a small change is significant and that accurate display of the statistic requires clearly displaying the change . ( Examples : A small increase -- say 5% -- in the volume of the oceans would mean an almost total loss of important coastal regions . A small decrease in species -- say 5% in a decade -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) If you feel you must use a truncated scale , consider using a line graph , where truncated scales are more expected . However , any use of truncated scales leaves you open to the charge of trying to Lie with Statistics . Huff cites with approval Time magazine 's use of both types of graphs in ambiguous cases . <p> I have no idea how the frog populations were determined . It is possible that this was done by complete enumeration , for example , by draining the pond and counting each and every frog . In this case the values are precise . However , it is also possible that the frog populations were estimated for example by re-capture ratios . Estimated populations have standard uncertainties ( a.k.a. errors ) which should be displayed with an error bar . <p> Note that there really is n't a standard meaning for the size of an error bar . Common choices are : 1 ( the range would include about 68% of normal data ) , 2 which is basically the same as 95% limits , and 0.674+ which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a population standard deviation or a standard deviation of the mean . Because of this lack of standard practice it is critical for the text or figure caption to report the meaning of the error bar . <p> Dilbert invented 3D bar graphs as a joke . Unfortunately his boss liked them and now we 're stuck with them . 3D bars simply make the data harder to precisely evaluate and easier to distort . Do n't ever use them ( unless you have a boss as dumb as Dilbert 's ) . <p> Tables of data , while not as immediately comprehensible as graphs , are a precise form statistics display . Here are a couple of examples of tables from scientific papers : <p> Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society ( 1999 ) 129 187-205 <p> Ecology ( 1996 ) 77 2302-2311 <p> One of the first things you need to decide in making a table is the number of significant digits to display . If a value has a known " error " ( e.g. , standard deviation , standard error ) , it is inappropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , the first table reports natural-pollinated seed viability as 76.0825.39 . This should have been reported as 7625 ; the .08 is totally irrelevant if the range of variation is 25 . ( It is almost never useful to report more than 2 significant digits of an " error " . ) If the base number lacks a statistical error , the number of digits reported is often determined by the accuracy of the measurement . Thus masses measured with an analytical balance might be displayed with more digits than masses measured with a triple beam balance . Only rarely is it useful to record more than 4 significant digits .

An Overview of Metabolic Pathways - Anabolism <h> Henry Jakubowski <p> Anabolism : Anabolic reactions are those that lead to the synthesis of biomolecules . In contrast to the catabolic reactions just discussed ( glycolysis , TCA cycle and electron transport/oxidative phosphorylation ) which lead to the oxidative degradation of carbohydrates and fatty acids and energy release , anabolic reactions lead to the synthesis of more complex biomolecules including biopolymers ( glycogen , proteins , nucleic acids ) and complex lipids . Many biosynthetic reactions , including those for fatty acid synthesis , are reductive and hence require reducing agents . Reductive biosynthesis and complex polymer formation require energy input , usually in the form of ATP whose exergonic cleavage is coupled to endergonic biosynthesis . <p> Cells have evolved interesting mechanism so as not to have oxidative degradation reactions ( which release energy ) proceed at the same time and in the same cell as reductive biosynthesis ( which requires energy input ) . Consider this scenario . You dive into a liver cell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where did it come ?

Cells have devised many ways to distinguish these opposing needs . One is by using a slightly different pool of redox reagents for anabolic and catabolic reactions . Oxidative degradation reactions typically use the redox pair NAD+/NADH ( or FAD/FADH2 ) while reductive biosynthesis often uses phosphorylated variants of NAD+ , NADP+/NADPH . In addition , cells often carry out competing reactions in different cellular compartments .

One of the main methods , as we will see , is to activate or inhibit key enzymes in the pathways under a given set of cellular conditions . The key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis , acetyl-CoA carboxylase , is inhibited when cellular conditions require fatty acid oxidation . <p> The following examples give short descriptions of anabolic pathways . Compare them to the catabolic pathways from the previous section . <p> Glucose synthesis , better known as Gluconeogenesis : In glycolysis , glucose ( C6H12O6 ) , a 6C molecule , is converted to two , 3C molecules ( pyruvate ) in an oxidative process that requires NAD+ and makes two net ATP molecules . In a few organs , most predominately in the liver , the reverse pathway can take place . The liver does this to provide glucose to the brain when the body is deficient in circulating glucose , for example , under fasting and starving conditions . ( The liver under these conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reactions in gluconeogenesis are the same reactions in glycolysis but run in reverse , with the exception of three glycolytic steps which are essentially irreversible . These three steps have bypass enzymes in the gluconeogenesis pathway . Although the synthesis of glucose is a reductive pathway , it uses NADH instead of NADPH as the redundant as the same enzyme used in glycolysis is simply run in reverse . Gluconeogenesis , which also occurs in the cortex of the kidney , is more than just a simple reversal of glycolysis , however . It can be thought of as the net synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors . Pyruvate , as seen in the section on catabolism , can be formed from protein degradation to glucogenic amino acids which can be converted to pyruvate . It can also be formed from triacylglycerides from the 3C molecule glycerol formed and released from adipocytes after hydrolysis of three fatty acids from triacylglycerides . However , in humans , glucose can not be made in net fashion from fatty acids . Fatty acids can be converted to acetyl-CoA by fatty acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enzyme that catalyzes the formation for acetyl-CoA from pyruvate , pyruvate dehydrogenase , is irreversible and there is no bypass reaction known . The acetyl-CoA can enter the TCA cycle but since the pathway is cyclic and proceeds in one direction , it can not form in net fashion oxaloacetate . Although oxaloacetate can be remove from the TCA cycle and be use to form phosphoenolpyuvate , a glycolytic intermediate , one acetyl-CoA condenses with one oxaloacetate to form citrate which leads back to one oxaloacetate . Hence fatty acids can not be converted to glucose and other sugars in a net fashion . <p> Figure : Gluconeogenesis <p> Pentose Phosphate Shunt : This two-part pathway does n't appear to start as a reductive biosynthetic pathway as the first part is the oxidative conversion of a glycolytic intermediate , glucose-6-phosphate , to ribulose-5-phosphate . The next , nonoxidative branch leads to the formation of ribose-5-phosphate , a key biosynthetic intermediate in nucleic acid synthesis as well as erthyrose-4-phosphate used for biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids . The oxidative branch is important in reductive biosynthesis as it is a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fatty acid and isoprenoid/sterol biosynthesis : Acetyl-CoA is the source of carbon atoms for the synthesis of more complex lipids such as fatty acids , isoprenoids , and sterols . When energy needs in a cell are not high , citrate , the condensation product of oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle , builds up in the mitochondrial matrix . It is then transported by the citrate transporter ( an inner mitochondrial membrane protein ) to the cytoplasm , where it is cleaved back to oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA by the cytoplasmic enzyme citrate lyase . The oxaloacetate is returned to the mitochondria by conversion first to malate ( reduction reaction using NADH ) , which can move back into the mitochondria through the malate transporter , or further conversion to pyruate , using the cytosolic malic enzyme , which uses NADP+ to oxidize malate to pyruvate which then enters the mitochondria . The acetyl-CoA formed in the cytoplasm can then be used in reductive biosynthesis using NADPH as the reductant to form fatty acids , isoprenoids , and sterols . The NADPH for the reduction comes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction catalyzed by malic enzyme . The liver cells can still run the glycolytic pathway as the NADH/NAD+ ratio is low in the cytoplasm while NADPH/NADP+ ratio is high . <p> Now its time to see how the various pathways fit together to form an integrated set of pathways.

@@71697556 @397556/ <p> The rate law shows how the rate of a reaction depends on concentrations of different species in solution . The proportionality constant , k , is called the rate constant . It contains other information about the energetic requirements of the reaction . <p> All reactions must overcome activation barriers in order to occur . The activation barrier is the sum of the energy that must be expended to get the reaction going . An activation barrier is often thought of , cartoonishly , as a hill the molecule has to climb over during the reaction . Once , there , it can just slide down the other side of the hill to become products . At the top of the hill , the molecule exists in what is called the " transition state " . At the transition state , the structure is somewhere between its original form and the structure of the products . <p> Figure LS5.1 . The activation barrier for a ligand dissociation step . <p> The type of diagram shown in figure LS6.1 is sometimes called a " reaction progress diagram " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds . One or more activation barriers may occur along the reaction pathways , as various elementary steps occur in the reaction . In the above case , it is easy to imagine the source of the energy barrier , because some energy must be expended to break the bond to ligand C. <p> However , after that barrier is passed , energy is lowered again . This can happen for several reasons . Once C has separated from the metal complex , it is free to vibrate , tumble , roll and zip around all on its own . That means it can put its energy into any of those modes , independently of the metal complex . As a result , the entropy of the system increases . That lowers the overall " free energy " of the system . In addition , there may be some relief of crowding as the molecule changes from a four-coordinate complex to a three-coordinate complex , so strain energy is also lowered . <p> Problem LS5.1 . <p> Make drawings depicting the relationship between reaction progress and energy for the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a four-coordinate complex , forming a five coordinate complex . <p> b ) a two-step process in which a new ligand binds to a four-coordinate complex , forming a five coordinate complex , and then an old ligand dissociates to form a new , four-coordinate complex . <p> The rate constant gives direct insight into what is happening at the transition state , because it gives us the energy difference between the reactants and the transition state . Based on that information , we get some ideas of what is happening on the way to the transition state . <p> The rate constant can be broken down into pieces . Mathematically , it is often expressed as <p> The ideal gas constant , Planck 's constant and Avogadro 's number are all typical constants used in modeling the behaviour of molecules or large groups of molecules . The free energy of activation is essentially the energy requirement to get a molecule ( or a mole of them ) to undergo the reaction . <p> Note that k depends on just two variables : <p> ? G or the energy required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings , which is an index of the available energy <p> The ratio of activation free energy to temperature compares the energy needs to the energy available . The more energy available compared to the energy needed , the lower this ratio becomes . As a result , the exponential part of the function becomes larger ( since the power has a minus sign ) . That makes the rate constant bigger , and the reaction becomes faster . <p> The activation free energy is constant for a given reaction . It can be broken down in turn to : <p> ? G = ? H - T ? S <p> in which ? H = activation enthalpy and ? S = activation entropy . <p> The activation enthalpy is the energy required for the reaction . The activation entropy deals with how the energy within the molecule must be redistributed for the reaction to occur . These two parameters can be useful in understanding events leading to the transition state . <p> For example , in ligand substitution , an associative pathway is marked by low enthalpy of activation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of activation results because bonds do n't need to be broken before the transition state , so it does n't cost much to get there . That 's favourable and makes the reaction easier . However , a decrease in entropy means that energy must be partitioned into fewer states . That 's not favourable and makes the reaction harder . The reason the energy must be redistributed this way is that two molecules ( the metal complex and the new ligand ) are coming together to make one bigger molecule . They can no longer move independently of each other , and all of their combined energy must be reapportioned together , with a more limited range of vibrational , rotational and translational states to use for that purpose . <p> Associative pathway : two molecules must be aligned and come together ; fewer degrees of freedom for energy distribution ; decrease in entropy <p> On the other hand , the dissociative pathway is marked by a higher enthalpy of activation but a positive entropy of activation . The higher enthalpy of activation results because a bond must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourable . However , the molecule breaks into two molecules in the rate determining step . these two molecules have more degrees of freedom in which to partition their energy than they did as one molecule . That 's favourable . <p> Dissociative pathway : one molecule converts to two molecules in rate determining step , greater degrees of freedom in two independently moving molecules , entropy increases <p> Thus , looking at the activation parameters can reveal a lot about what is going on in the transition state . <p> Problem LS5.2 . <p> What factor(s) other than entropy might raise the free energy of the transition state going into an associative step between a metal complex and an incoming ligand ?

@@71697560 @397560/ <p> If you go into a forest you find yourself surrounded by many types and sizes of trees . If you consider just one species of tree a natural assumption is that the largest trees are the oldest . While we expect that there is a correlation between the size of a tree and its age , the relationship between between these two variables is probably not exact : you would expect that genes and environment would also play a role . A tree that happened to have access to more light or better soil or proper moisture or whose parents were unusually large will probably grow more per year than a less " lucky " tree . Furthermore , not all years are the same : we expect trees to grow little during years of drought . Even though we expect that each individual tree has its own growth history , we expect on average there will be a relationship between tree size and tree age . <p> The age of a tree can be determined by counting each annual growth ring in the trunk of the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stump to count these growth rings : a thin core of wood -- reaching from bark to dead center -- can be extracted from a living tree using a borer . ) A common measure of the size of a tree is the " diameter at breast height " DBH . " Breast height " is defined as 4 + feet above the uphill side of the tree . Since a tree trunk is not a perfect circle , " diameter " is defined as the circumference divided by . <p> Note that the DBH of a tree is easy to determine : it just takes a measuring tape whereas the age of a tree requires specialized instruments and additional work and time . This is one reason why it can be helpful to know the average relationship between size and age : we can then use an easy measurement ( DBH ) and some calculations to determine a hard-to-measure quantity ( age ) . Of course , this easy measure of age is also only an approximate measure of age . <p> Consider the following data on 12 northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Age(years) <p> DBH(inch) <p> 97 <p> 12.5 <p> 93 <p> 12.5 <p> 88 <p> 8.0 <p> 81 <p> 9.5 <p> 75 <p> 16.5 <p> 57 <p> 11.0 <p> 52 <p> 10.5 <p> 45 <p> 9.0 <p> 28 <p> 6.0 <p> 15 <p> 1.5 <p> 12 <p> 1.0 <p> 11 <p> 1.0 <p> We can display this data in an x-y scatter plot . One of the first decisions that needs to be made is which variable ( age or DBH ) to put on the x ( horizontal ) axis and which on the y ( vertical ) axis . <p> One rule is to put the least precisely measured variable on the y axis . The counting of annual growth rings should be precise ; of course the trees are probably a bit older than the count as it took a few years for the tree to grow to the height at which the core was taken . The DBH could have been measured to greater accuracy : the students were told to measure to the nearest + inch . The errors in age ( a systematic understatement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( roundoff error of + inch ) are difficult to compare since they have different units and different natures . If we compare them in percent terms using typical values ( say 2 out of 50 years = 4% or + inch out of 8 inches = 3% ) the errors are similar . <p> Another rule is to put the " controlling " variable on the x axis and the dependent variable on the y axis . I think of age causing growth rather than growth causing age , so I would put age on the x axis . <p> On the other hand , if the aim of this process is to come up with a formula predicting age based on DBH then we must put age on the y axis . <p> The choice of which variable goes where is not just a matter of display : different " trendlines " will be generated by different choices . On the other hand the " correlation coefficient " r and its associated P value ( see below ) will not depend on this choice . <p> You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> It should be clear that there is a general trend for the old trees to be big trees . On the other hand , there is a lot of variation : For example , the the biggest tree is not the oldest . I hope it is clear that the relationship between age and DBH is not that given by " connecting the dots " . ( It is almost always wrong to produce such " connect the dots " plots ! ) . <p> On the other hand , the relationship between age and the average DBH , might be a smooth curve that misses individual data points ( some high and some low ) , but instead hits some sort of average between the points like this : <p> If we do a least squares analysis of the data the following results are reported : <p> We are given a line ( displayed above ) that represents an average relationship between age and DBH ( the parameters that describe that line , the y intercept a and the slope b are given along with estimates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a correlation coefficient , r , with an associated probability p . The small value of p indicates that is highly unlikely that the apparent relationship between age and DBH came about by chance . Do not be highly impressed by small p values : they are not uncommon particularly in larger datasets . Instead focus on r , which will always be between -1 and 1 . The fact that r is positive for this data indicates that larger age generally goes along with larger DBH -- a " direct " relationship . If r is negative more x goes along with lessy -- a negatively sloping " inverse " relationship . Values of r near zero indicate no particular relationship between the variables . It is often said that r2 is the fraction of the variation in y that is explained by its relationship with x . What this means is the standard deviation of the data 's deviation from the trendline ( the blue lines shown below ) divided by the the standard deviation of the y data is 1-r2 : <p> 1-r2 = ( deviations from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Clearly , if r is near 1 or -1 , the deviations from the trendline must be " small " . <p> Thus if r is near 1 or -1 , there must be relatively small deviations from the line . <p> Please guard against the not uncommon situation of " statistically significant " correlations ( i.e. , small p values ) that explain miniscule variations in the data ( i.e. , small r2 values ) . For example , with 100 data points a correlation that explains just 4% of the variation in y ( i.e. , r=.2 ) would be considered statistically significant ( i.e. , p&lt;.05 ) . Here is what such data looks like in a scatter plot : <p> The correlation may be statistically significant , but it is probably not important in understanding the variation in y . <h> " Trendlines " <p> The name " least square " comes from the process of defining a trendline . The line is adjusted until the sum of the squares of the y deviations from the line ( shown above in blue ) are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produced such trendlines ( a topic addressed in greater detail here ) . <p> The solid line , which does a very good job matching most of the data but leaves 4 points well off the line , is based on minimizing the length of the horizontal deviations from the line ( shown above in red ) . It has a significantly steeper slope than the least squares line ( about 4++ b more than the least squares b ) . The dotted curve , which badly misses only 3 points , is a parabola chosen to minimize the square of the y deviations . There really is not a way of selecting the best trendline from among all the possible trendlines . You may be guided by the suggestions of known theory , by the requirements of a particular instructor , by standard practice ( usually a least squares line ) , by knowledge of which points are most likely to be anomalous , or ( unfortunately ) by a desire to produce a particular answer . The option to push an answer onto the data -- to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in this data . If the relationship were " tighter " all possibilities would be quite close . <p> Trendlines are often used just to " guide the eye " : to display an average trend . They may also be used to make quantitative predictions . You can answer questions like " how big will my oak tree be in 20 years ? " or " How old is this 10 inch diameter tree likely to be ? " . It is safest to use the predictive abilities of trendlines only within the range of the data that defined the trendline ( this is basically interpolation ) . When used outside the tested range ( extrapolation ) trendlines may well give wrong or even crazy answers . For example the above solid line ( with minimum horizontal deviations ) suggests a 1 year old tree has a negative diameter . The parabolic trendline suggests trees actually start to shrink for ages beyond about 80 years and would have negative diameters when older than about 150 years .

The Director of Financial Aid notifies via email those students whose academic record falls short of the standards as detailed above .

A student placed on an academic plan may continue to receive financial assistance as long as the terms of the plan are being met . A student without a successful appeal will be suspended . <p> Appeal Process <p> All appeals should be in writing and sent to Director of Financial Aid at CSB for CSB students , or the Director of Financial Aid at SJU for SJU students . Students on suspension will be given a time frame to complete the appeal .

Neither paying for classes nor sitting out any length of time affects a student 's academic standing so neither is sufficient to re-establish eligibility . However , if a previously suspended student applies for readmission to CSB/SJU ( which would include a new reason for an appeal ) after an academic suspension , that student may be allowed to return , with the benefit of financial assistance , if an academic plan is created to assist the student in attaining satisfactory progress .

@@71697576 @397576/ <h> Ethical Issues in Psychology <p> Psychologists often work with vulnerable individuals in sensitive situations . An important step in becoming a mental health professional or consumer of psychological services is to be aware of the ethical issues faced by psychologists . If you are providing psychological services you are obligated to remain informed regarding current ethical standards or issues . If you are a consumer of psychological services , the professional should keep you informed regarding your rights . If you find yourself in a situation where ethical standards are being violated or have doubts regarding the correct course of action , consult with a colleague . <p> The faculty of the College of Saint Benedict/Saint John 's University joint Psychology Department have identified several key ethical issues with which we believe our students should be familiar . This list is not complete and students will learn much more about ethical issues while going through the psychology curriculum . Near the end of their study , students are asked to demonstrate knowledge of these ethical issues as they apply them in their senior integrative experiences . <p> COMPETENCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the practitioner is competent to provide the services offered . Generally , competence is established through training , experience , supervised practice , or a combination of these activities . Any practitioner should be willing to discuss their competencies with any consumer of services and be ready to make referrals to others when an administration of tests like the MMPI or the Wechsler intelligence scales requires understanding of the intricacies of both administration and interpretation . Graduate course work and many hours of supervised practice are needed to acquire the necessary skills . The practitioner is also obligated to keep skills up to date with formal course work , reading , or other professional development activities . <p> CONFIDENTIALITY : Psychologists and consumers of psychological services are frequently concerned about the issue of who is allowed to see and use information about individuals generated during research , consultation , or therapy . In most circumstances private information must be kept confidential , that is , it is not revealed to others . However , there are important exceptions to this , mandated by state law and court decisions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These exceptions tend to concern situations in which information that is normally confidential can be used to prevent harm to another person . For example , if a client describes abusive behavior toward their children , the therapist is mandated to file a report with social services . Clients , themselves , need to be aware of both the requirements and the limits of confidentiality . <p> INFORMED CONSENT : In their roles as researchers , therapists , and consultants , psychologists offer a variety of services . Informed consent is a central principle in these actions . This means that consumers of psychological services have the right to know precisely what services are being offered , what benefits can be expected , and what risks are involved . After being so informed , consumers then have the right to refuse the services or terminate participation . In research , therapy , or other activities accompanied by some identifiable risk , consent needs to be in writing . When individuals , for some reason , ca n't give their consent , a surrogate or guardian may be allowed to consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently interact professionally with clients who are less powerful than themselves because of their age , species , emotional insecurities , intellectual ability , legal status , or other attributes . As a general rule , psychologists are expected to act in the best interests of such individuals , to avoid taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of clients , and to treat animal subjects humanely in accordance with accepted practice . A romantic relationship between a therapist and client is one way that this ethical principle may be violated and is one of the most common causes of lawsuits against therapists . <p> A GENERAL CONCERN FOR ETHICAL PRACTICE : The issues outlined here provide a broad outline of ethical practice in psychology . Specific courses will elaborate on these issues and help you identify situations in which they apply . However , each individual , whether a practitioner or consumer of psychological services , needs to be aware of the role that ethical guidelines play in directing the application of psychology to the problems of the real world . We hope that awareness of specific ethical issues in psychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it applies to any endeavor . Whether you go into politics , education , business , manufacturing , law , medicine , or any other vocation , you will need to take the time and effort to examine what you are doing in terms of its ethical implications and have the courage to confront unethical behavior.

This wailing 5-year-old is receiving the very same treatment , a full leg plaster cast , as this young , perfectly happy infant . <p> The therapy here in Mumbai 's Wadia Charitable Hospital will save these children from a life of pain and social isolation that comes from club foot . It 's a common birth defect that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in the developing world , it remains largely untreated and becomes a disability , says orthopedist Dr. Alaric Aroojis . <p> DR . ALARIC AROOJIS , Orthopedist : It is probably the second or third important cause of physical disability in India , after road traffic accidents and trauma . It 's more of a cosmetic problem initially . And as they grow older and they can find that they can no longer play with their friends , that 's when it starts sinking in that this is a functional problem as well . <p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO : Club foot is congenital birth defect in which a foot , in some cases both feet , grow inward . Patients learn to walk on the side of the foot . <p> Twenty-six-year-old Madhu Varma says it 's painful for sustained periods , but like most sufferers , she 's learned to adapt . What she could not deal with was the sight of her daughter , Madhuri , when she too was born with club foot . <p> MADHU VARMA , Mother With Clubfoot ( through interpreter ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I saw my child 's foot . I could not eat . I was just sick with worry . But they told me that , with plaster , they could treat it . <p> DR . ALARIC AROOJIS : So this is the daughter and this is the mother . And the daughter 's foot is fully corrected . <p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO : That correction once required extensive surgery , Dr. Aroojis says . Now treatment in most cases is a series of casts over several weeks : , less invasive , less expensive and less painful . <p> DR . ALARIC AROOJIS : It 's such a supple method . We do n't force the foot in any way at all . So , as you can see , that every time we move the foot just as much as the child allows . This is a procedure which is done without any anesthetic . <p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO : Once corrected , patients like 5-year-old Nishant wear a brace attached to an outward-facing pair of shoes . In a few months , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nap time . Nishant shows no sign of an abnormal gait . His parents , struggling slum dwellers , spent hundreds of dollars at ill-equipped and poorly informed private clinics with little success . <p> KETAN DHEPE , Father of Child With Clubfoot ( through interpreter ) : We had never heard of club foot until he was born . We felt terrible , but when we brought him to Mumbai , two or three people told me that Wadia Hospital has the best treatment . <p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO : That treatment was developed by an orthopedic surgeon named Ignacio Ponseti half-a-world away here in Iowa and half-a-century ago . It would take decades before the Ponseti method became standard practice for treating club foot . <p> Why do you suppose it took as long as it did ? <p> CHESCA COLLOREDO-MANSFELD , Executive Director and Co-founder , MiracleFeet : One is that the kinds of people that were treating club foot , at least in the U.S. , were orthopedic surgeons . And I think they became surgeons for a reason . They like doing surgery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there was some resistance to that . <p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO : Chesca Colloredo-Mansfeld , a business consultant , lived in Iowa city , where Ponseti , a Spanish immigrant , was a local legend . <p> CHESCA COLLOREDO-MANSFELD : Dr. Ponseti 's dying wish " he was in his 90s at that time " was to try to get his treatment out to the rest of the world . <p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO : Colloredo-Mansfeld started one of several nonprofit efforts to fulfill Dr. Ponseti 's wish to take the nonsurgical approach , finally standard in the U.S. , to developing countries . <p> She co-founded a charity in 2010 called Miracle Feet , supported mostly by high net worth individuals and foundations . It 's taken the Ponseti method and message to clinics in 19 countries so far , with some 23,000 patients , including those in Mumbai , providing training and supplies at low or no cost , including braces patients will use after their cast treatments are done . <p> In India , casting is done by surgeons , but in countries where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key role is that of clinic assistants , paid by Miracle Feet . <p> CHESCA COLLOREDO-MANSFELD : They work to educate that family during the bracing phase to make sure that the children wear the brace at night and complete the treatment over the next four years . <p> So , the correction itself only takes two to three months , but the follow-up period of maintaining that correction is absolutely critical . <p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO : Veteran orthopedic surgeon Rujuta Mehta says parents of club foot patients , once terrified at the prospect and cost of surgery , are elated when they discover it 's no longer needed . <p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO : Its much simpler , less intimidating and it 's cheaper ? <p> DR . RUJUTA MEHTA : Yes , absolutely . Yes , it 's cheaper . And this is the kind of thing you can apply in a public health program . <p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO : The number of children being treated has tripled over the past decade or so .

RUJUTA MEHTA : Absolutely , and the more awareness there , the earlier they come , the easier to treat , the better the deformity correction . <p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO : A deformity that is correctable even in adulthood , as Madhu Varma discovered when getting her daughter treated . She became the oldest patient this clinic has ever treated . <p> DR . ALARIC AROOJIS : There 's a very good possibility that , just with serial castings by the Ponseti method , we should be able to get a full correction in her . <p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO : She had a wedding to attend , she told the doctors , where she and daughter Madhuri would be able to dance . <p> For the PBS NewsHour , this is Fred de Sam Lazaro in Mumbai . <p> JUDY WOODRUFF : And that is something to celebrate . <p> Fred 's reporting is a partnership with the Under-Told Stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@71697586 @397586/ <h> Constellations : Frequently Asked Questions <p> Throughout the centuries , people have looked to the stars to help them navigate across open oceans or featureless deserts , know when to plant and harvest , and preserve their myths and folklore . Ancient peoples used the appearance or disappearance of certain stars over the course of each year to mark the changing seasons . To make it easier to " read " this celestial calendar , they grouped the brighter stars into readily recognizable shapes , the constellations . <p> Astronomers officially recognize 88 constellations covering the entire sky in the northern and southern hemispheres . Currently , 14 men and women , 9 birds , two insects , 19 land animals , 10 water creatures , two centaurs , one head of hair , a serpent , a dragon , a flying horse , a river and 29 inanimate objects are represented in the night sky ( the total comes to more than 88 because some constellations include more than one creature . ) It is important to realize that the great majority of star patterns bear little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to represent and whose name they bear . The ancient constellation-makers probably meant for them to be symbolic , not literal , representations of their favorite animals or fabled heroes , a kind of celestial " Hall of Fame . " <p> Our modern constellation system comes to us from the ancient Greeks . The oldest description of the constellations as we know them comes from a poem , called Phaenomena , written about 270 B.C. by the Greek poet Aratus . However , it is clear from the poem that the constellations mentioned originated long before Aratus ' time . No one is sure exactly where , when , or by whom they were invented . And yet a little detective work reveals a plausible origin . <p> The first clue is that Aratus ' constellations did not include any near the south celestial pole ( the point on the celestial sphere directly above the Earth 's south pole ) because that area of the sky was always below the horizon of the ancient constellation-makers . From the size of this uncharted area of the sky , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived near a latitude of 36 north -- south of Greece , north of Egypt , but similar to the latitude of the ancient Babylonians and Sumerians . <p> In addition , the constellation-free zone is not centered exactly on the south celestial pole . Because of a " wobble " of the Earth 's axis of rotation , the position of the celestial poles changes slowly with time , a phenomenon known as precession . The uncharted area is centered on the place in the sky where the south celestial pole would have been around the year 2000 B.C. This date matches the time of the Babylonians and Sumerians . <p> Thus it seems likely the Greek constellations originated with the Sumerians and Babylonians . From there , knowledge of the constellations somehow made its way to Egypt ( perhaps through the Minoans on Crete who had contact with the Babylonians and settled in Egypt after an explosive volcanic eruption destroyed their civilization ) , where early Greek scholars first heard about the constellations and wrote about them . <p> In 150 A.D. , the Greek scientist Ptolemy published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almagest , which contained a summary of Greek astronomical knowledge , including a catalog of 1022 stars , with estimates of their brightness , arranged into 48 constellations . These 48 formed the basis for our modern constellation system . <p> Over the years , astronomers have added constellations to fill in the gaps between Ptolemy 's figures and map the uncharted regions of the sky near the south celestial pole . Major contributors of new constellations included Dutch cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1551 and Pieter Keyser and Frederick de Hautmann , navigators aboard some of the first trading expeditions to the East Indies in the early 1600s , who mapped the southern sky . Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius in 1690 and French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the 1750s filled in the remaining gaps in the northern and southern skies . <p> Over the centuries , some astronomers have attempted to name constellations after themselves or to flatter a patron or king . This reached a peak during the heyday of celestial mapping in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . Few of these survived longer than the astronomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in antique star charts . For example , in 1678 , Edmond Halley ( of Halley 's Comet fame ) invented a constellation called Robur Carolinum , or Charles ' Oak , in honor of King Charles II of England . This constellation did not last long , especially after its rejection by the French astronomer Lacaille in his maps of the southern sky . In 1754 , the English naturalist and noted satirist John Hall invented thirteen constellations based on rather unappealing animals such as a toad , a leech , a spider , an earthworm , and a slug . Fortunately , even though they may have been intended as a joke , they never caught on . <p> At its first meeting in 1922 , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) , astronomy 's governing body which is responsible , among other things , for assigning names to celestial objects and features on those objects , officially adopted the list of 88 constellations that we use today . Definitive boundaries between constellations , which extend out beyond the star figures , were set in 1930 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how faint , now lies within the limits of one constellation . For today 's astronomer , constellations refer not so much to the patterns of stars , but to precisely defined areas of the sky . <p> The ancient Greek tradition was to name stars by their position within a constellation . For example , Ptolemy refers to one star by the description " the reddish one on the southern eye , " a star we now know as Aldebaran in the constellation of Taurus the Bull . But these descriptions could get quite involved . Ptolemy refers to another star in the obsolete constellation of Argo the Boat as " the northernmost of two stars close together over the little shield in the poop , " a bit cumbersome if you are trying to learn the names of many stars . <p> When Al-Sufi , one of the greatest Arabic astronomers , published his own version of Ptolemy 's Almagest in the tenth century , he introduced many individual star names . For centuries , bedouin Arabs had given names to bright stars -- for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing people and animals . Many of the original meanings of the names had been forgotten even in Al-Sufi 's time , but some were direct translations of Ptolemy 's descriptions . For example , the star name Fomalhaut ( in the constellation of Pisces ) comes from the Arabic for " mouth of the southern fish , " which is how Ptolemy described it in the Almagest . <p> After the tenth century , the works of Ptolemy and others were re-introduced into Europe by the Islamic Arabs , and the Greek books were translated from Arabic into Latin , the scientific language of the day . Thus we know Ptolemy 's work from its Arabic translation , The Almagest , not by its original Greek title . And it explains why we have a system of Greek constellations with Latin names containing stars with Arabic names . <p> Nearly every culture on Earth has seen patterns in the stars . But , not surprisingly , very few have seen the same patterns . Take , for example , the Big Dipper , perhaps the most recognizable star pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constellation itself , but is part of a larger pattern known to the Greeks as Ursa Major , the Great Bear . The seven stars of the Big Dipper have inspired many stories , perhaps because they are bright and located so near the north celestial pole , around which the stars rotate during the course of the night . But not everyone calls it a Dipper . The British call it a Plough . In Southern France , it is a Saucepan . The Skidi Pawnee Indians saw a stretcher on which a sick man was carried . To the ancient Maya , it was a mythological parrot named Seven Macaw . Hindu sky lore called it the Seven Rishis , or Wise Men . To the early Egyptians , it was the thigh and leg of a bull . The ancient Chinese thought of it as a special chariot for the Emperor of the Heaven or some other celestial bureaucrat . For the Micmac Indians of Canada 's Maritime Provinces , along with several other North American Indian tribes , the bowl of the Big Dipper was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters tracking the bear . And in the nineteenth century , the Big Dipper became a symbol of freedom for runaway slaves , who " followed the Drinking Gourd " to the northern states . <p> No . With few exceptions , the stars in a constellation have no connection with one another . They are actually at very different distances from the sun ( see Activity Corner ) Chance alignments of stars have created the patterns we see in the sky . <p> Ancient astronomers often spoke of the " fixed stars , " which maintained permanent positions in the sky . And , indeed , the stars do seem almost fixed in place ; the patterns they form look much the same today as they did when the constellations were first named nearly 3000 years ago . But the stars are all moving relative to the Sun , most with speeds of many kilometers per second . Because they are so very far away , it will take thousands of lifetimes to see significant changes in the star patterns . But , over time , they will change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , the handle of the Big Dipper will , in about 50,000 years , appear significantly more bent than it is today ( see figure at left ) . We will , no doubt , keep the same names for the constellations , even if the stars change their positions . Constellations are , after all , products of human imagination , not nature . <p> Given a star chart without constellation figures marked on it ( whether real star charts or made-up star patterns ) , students can invent their own constellations , looking for patterns in the stars that appeal to them . Students can then be asked to make up stories to go with their new constellations . <p> Older students can research the constellation patterns and stories that other cultures saw in the night sky and compare them to the more familiar Greek ones . This can be done by reading books and articles , or by interviewing family members or friends . <p> Maps of the stars in the constellations can be useful in the classroom . Slide sets , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front page of this newsletter ) which show actual pictures of each constellation in the night sky and separate line drawings of the constellation figures , can help students identify the constellations as part of homework assignments or evening " star parties . " This can be especially helpful for students without easy access to a planetarium.

Introduction <p> " Of all the biochemical inventions in the history of life , the machinery to oxidize water photosystem II using sunlight is surely one of the grandest . " ( Sessions , A. et al , 2009 ) <p> We have just seen how we can transduce the chemical potential energy stored in carbohydrates into chemical potential energy of ATP - namely through coupling the energy released during the thermodynamically favored oxidation of carbon molecules through intermediaries ( high energy mixed anhydride in glycolysis or a proton gradient in aerobic metabolism ) to the thermodynamically uphill synthesis of ATP . There is a situation that occurs when we wish to actually reverse the entire process and take CO2 + H2O to carbohydrate + O2 . This process is of course photosynthesis which occurs in plants and certain photosynthetic bacteria and algae . Given that this process must by nature be an uphill thermodynamic battle , let us consider the major requirements that must be in place for this process to occur : <p> A strong oxidizing agent must be formed which can take water and oxidize it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of stronger to weaker oxidizing agent ( just as acid base reactions are thermodynamically favored in the direction of strong to weak acid ) . Somehow we must generate a stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen , which often has the most positive standard reduction potential in tables . <p> Plants must have high concentrations of a reducing agent for the reductive biosynthesis of glucose from CO2 . The reducing agent used for most biosynthetic reactions in nature is NADPH , which differs from NADH only by the addition of a phosphate to the ribose ring . This phosphate differentiates the pool of nucleotides in the cells used for reductive biosynthesis ( NADPH/NADP+ ) from those used for oxidative catabolism ( NADH/NAD+ ) <p> Finally , plants need an abundant source of ATP which will be required for reductive biosynthesis . <p> We will discuss only the light reaction of photosynthesis which produces these three types of molecules . The dark reaction , which as the name implies can occur in the dark , involves that actual fixation of carbon dioxide into carbohydrate using the ATP and NADPH produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electron Transfer <p> Obviously , the energy to power the light reactions comes directly from sunlight . Clue two is that plants have an organelle that animal cells do n't - the chloroplast . Its structure is in many ways similar to a mitochondria in that it has internal membranes ( thylacoid membranes ) surrounding enclosed compartments . <p> Plants have many pigments ( chlorophyll , phycoerthryins , carotenoids , etc. ) whose absorption spectra overlap that of the solar spectra . The main pigment , chlorophyll , has a protophorphryin IX ring ( same as in heme groups ) with Mg instead of Fe . When the chlorophyll absorbs light , the excited electrons must relax eventually to their ground state . It can do this by either radiative or nonradiative decay . In radiative decay , a photon of lower energy is emitted ( after some energy has already been lost by vibrational transitions ) in a process of either fluorescence or phosphorescence . In nonradiative decay , the energy of an excited electron can be transferred to another similar molecule ( in this case other chlorophyll molecules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electron in the second molecule to the same excited state . ( It is as if a photon is released by the first excited molecule which then is absorbed by an electron in a second molecule to excite it to the same exited state , although the excitation occurs without photon production ) . In this fashion , energy is transferred from one chlorophyll to another . This type of energy transfer is called resonance energy transfer or exciton transfer . <p> One type of chlorophyll has slightly different characteristics , however . Because of its unique environment , the energy level of the excited state electron is lower than in the rest of the chlorophyll molecules , in much the same way that pKa 's of amino acid side chains differ with environment , and the standard reduction potential of FADs that are tightly bound to enzymes differ due to the different environment of FAD/FADH2 These unique chlorophyll centers are called reaction centers . <p> ( reprinted with permission from Kanehisa Laboratories and the KEGG project : www.kegg.org ) <p> An electron in an adjacent excited state chlorophyll ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy of the reaction center ) can then be transferred to this lower energy state level in the reaction center , in a process which forms a positively charged ion from the first excited state molecule and an anion from the recipient reaction center . This process of energy transfer is called electron transfer . <h> D3 . The Light Reactions of Photosynthesis <p> Photoexcitation of the non-reaction center chlorophyll turns that molecule into a good reducing agent , which transfers its electron to the nearest excited state level of the reaction center chlorophyll . If you count both step together , the non-reaction center chlorophyll gets " photooxidized " , in the process producing the " strong " oxidizing agent which is the positively charged chlorophyll derivative . The extra electron passed onto the second molecule will eventually be passed on to NADP+ to produce NADPH . The light reaction of photosynthesis in green plants is shown below . In this process , in a scheme that is reminiscent of electron transport in mitochondria , water is oxidized by photosystem II . Electrons from water are moved through PSII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to form its reduced form , PQH2 . PSII is a complicated structure with many polypeptide chains , lots of chlorophylls , and Mn , Ca , and Fe ions . A Mn cluster , called the oxygen evolving complex , OEC , is directly involved in the oxidation of wate . Two key homologous 32 KD protein subunits , D1 and D2 , in PSII are transmembrane proteins and are at the heart of the PSII complex . Another photosystem , PS1 , is also found further " downstream " in the electron transport pathway . It takes electrons from another reduced mobile carrier of electrons , plastocyanin ( PCred ) to ferredoxin , which becomes a strong reducing agent . Ferrodoxin is a protein with an Fe-S cluster ( Fe-S-Fe-S in a 4 membered ring , with 2 additions Cys residues coordinating each Fe ) . It ultimately passes its electrons along to NADP+ to form NADPH . A summary of the light reaction in plants and standard reduction potentials of the participants , are shown below . Note that many of the complexes produce a transmembrane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as compared to the mitochondrial matrix ) becomes more acidic that the other stroma . Protons then can move down a concentration gradient through the C0C1ATPase to produce ATP required for reductive biosythesis of glucose . <h> D4 . Photosystem II <p> The net reaction carried out by PS2 is the oxidation of water and reduction of plastoquinone . <p> PQ + H2O --&gt; PQH2 + O2 ( g ) <p> Note that water is not converted to 2H2 + O2 , as in the electrolysis of water . Rather the Hs are removed from water as protons in the lumen of the cholorplast , since the part of PSII which oxides water is near the lumenal end of the transmembrane complex . Protons required to protonated the reduced ( anionic ) form of plastaquinone to form PQH2 , an activity of PSII found closer to the stroma , derive from the stroma. which then can be used to protonated the " anionic " form of reduced PQ to form PQH2 . <p> A quick look at standard reduction potentials shows that the passing of electrons from water ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SRP of 0.11 ) is not thermodynamically favored . The process is driven thermodynamically by the energy of the absorbed photons . <p> An early crystal structure of PSII from a photosynthetic cyanobacterium showed that it consists of 17 polypeptide subunits with metal and pigment cofactors and over 45,000 atoms . ( Zouni , Nature , 409 , 739 , 2001 ) . Of particular interest is the P680 chlorophyll reaction center , which consists of four monomeric chlorphylls adjacent to a cationic Tyr-D side chain which destabilizes the chlorophyll molecules . When H2O gets oxidized to form dioxygen , 4 electrons must be remove by photoactivated P680 . In PSII , this process occurs in 4 , single electron steps , with the electrons first being transferred to a Mn4 cluster cofactor ( of composition Mn4Ca1Cl1-2(HCO3)y . This inorganic Mn cluster is often called OEC ( oxygen evolving complex ) or WOC ( water oxidizing complex ) . The electrons passed through the Mn complex are delivered to P680 by a photoactive Tyr free radical ( Tyr Z ) . The actual structure of the OEC could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data support the structure below ( Chem . Rev. , 2001 , 101 , 21-35 ) , which also shows a possible mechanism for electron and proton transfer from water to form dioxygen. 5 discrete intermediates of the OEC , S0-S4 , are suggested from the experimental data ( Kok cycle ) . These were postulated from experiments in which spinach chloroplast were illuminated with short light pulses . A pattern of dioxygen release was noted that repeated after 4 flashes . Ultimately , light absorption by P680 forms excited state P680* which donates an electron to pheophytin ( which passes them to quinones ) to form P680+ , which receives electrons from the OEC , specifically the TyrZ radical . As we will see in a bit , this structure and mechanism has been called into question by new crystallographic structures . <p> Investigators have made non-peptide mimetics of superoxide dismutase to facilitate therapeutic removal of excess superoxide formed in brain and heart tissue . These may arise after an oxidative burst from reperfusion of these tissues after heart or brain attacks . Likewise , scientist are trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dioxygen or hydrogen gas for fuels . <p> In summary , for PSII in plants <p> a pair of chlorophylls ( P680 ) in the D subunits absorb light ( maximum absorbance around 680 nm ) and reach an excited state <p> electron transfer from P680 to a nearby chlorophyll with a lower energy level for the excited state electron occurs . This chlorophyll has 2 H+ ions in the chlorophyll instead of Mg2+occurs . The P680 now becomes cationic , P680+ . <p> This " anionic " chlorophyll transfers an electron to oxidized plastoquinone . <p> The P680+ , a strong oxidizing agent , removes one electron from H2O-OEC complex . <p> Steps 1-4 repeat three more times , each requiring another photon and each cycle producing another electron which passes on through the system . Remember that when O2 acts as an oxiding agent , it gains four electrons . The first produces superoxide , the next peroxide , and two more produce oxide which when protonated is water . Hence two waters and four cycles are required to remove the four electrons required to produce dioxygen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastacyanin , not dioxygen is oxidized , with electrons moved to ferrodoxin . This is likewise a difficult process since the reduction potential for oxidized plastocyanin ( the form that can act as a reducing agent ) is +0.37 while for ferrodoxin it is -0.75 . This transfer of electrons is an uphill thermodynamic battle since the more positive the standard reduction potential , the better the oxidizing agent and the more likely the agent becomes reduced . What drives this uphill flow of electrons . Of course , it is the energy input from the photon . <h> D5 . The Oxygen Evolving Complex ( OEC ) <p> The crystal structure of PS2 from T. vulcanus has significantly improved our understanding of the OEC and electron flow on water oxidation.Because of its similarity to other pathways you have studied , we will concentrate on developing an understanding of the amazing Photosystem II from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus , a cyanobacteria ( 19 subunits with 35 chlorophylls , two phenophtyins , 11 beta cartotenes , 2 plastoquinones , 2 heme irons , 1 non heme iron , 4 Mn ions , 3-4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and around 2800 water molecules ) . <p> Nature has appeared to evolve a single gene for the part of PSII that binds an inorganic cluster involved in oxygen formation . The cluster is called the Oxygen Evolving Complex ( OEC ) and is bound to a central protein in PS2 . The cluster , Mn4CaO5 , appears identical in all photosynthetic organisms , and is shown below . Researchers were surprise to find that the Ca ion was an integral part of the basic geometric " framework " of the OEC instead of a Mn which was found to be " dangling " from the basic geometric framework . <p> The shape outlined by O5-Ca-O1-Mn1 and Mn3-O2-Mn2-O3 is similar to what organic molecule ? Describe how every two adjacent Mn are linked . Describe the coordination of Ca . Four waters ( W1-W4 ) are coordinated to the OEC . No others were found in the region . What role may some of the waters have in the complex ? <p> The amino acid side chains that interact with the OEC are shown below . The coordination number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is identical . What is it for Mn1 ? For Ca ? ( Note that the Ala 344 is at the carboxy terminus of one of the protein subunits . ) <p> The OEC can be thought of as a distorted chair with a Mn3-O4-Mn4-O5 back . Bonds to O5 are longer than the other bonds . What might that imply about the strength of the bonds compared to the other metal-oxygen bonds ? What is the expected charge of the oxo ligands in the OEC ? If the metal-O5 bond lengths are longer than the others , what might that imply about the charge on O5 ? Would it be consistent with a ligand other than an oxo ligand ? What might it be ? <p> Which waters are most proximal to O5 ? Ultimately an O-O bond must form between two waters . Which are the most likely candidates based on the structure above ? Which ion , Ca or Mn , would most likely be involved in electron transfer to water oxygens ? Write the electron configuration for both ion . Standard reduction potentials for Mn are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each compound . Which oxidation state might be sufficient for the oxidation of H2O in the OEC ? <p> Mn2+ ( aq ) + 2 e- ? Mn ( s ) -1.185 <p> MnO4- ( aq ) + 2 H2O ( l ) + 3 e- ? MnO2 ( s ) + 4 OH- 0.595 <p> MnO2(s) + 4H+ + e- ? Mn3+ + 2H2O +0.95 <p> MnO2(s) + 4H+ + 2e- ? Mn2+ + 2H2O +1.23 <p> MnO4- ( aq ) + 8 H+ ( aq ) + 5 e- ?

Water Oxidation - The Kok Cycle <p> The mechanism by which water is oxidized occurs through a 5 stage Kok cycle illustrated below ? <p> The Sn states in the Kok diagram denote different discrete oxidation states where n the number of oxidative " equivalent " stored in the OEC during cycle progression . <p> What happens to Mn ions in the OEC during the cycle ? What is required to initiate the next stage of the cycle starting from So ? What is the role of Y161. + , an amino acid in PS2 that is very close to the OEC as shown in the figure below ? <p> A new mechanism has been proposed based on the recent crystal structure . A possible model for S3 is shown below with the distorted cubane structure and with an oxy and oxyl ligands . Add a curved arrow to show how an oxygen-oxygen bond is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Given the maximal packing of ligands ( including water ) around the OEC , there must be a way for water to enter the site and for protons that are removed to move away from the complex and toward the lumen where they would contribute to the development of a proton gradient . <p> Tyr 161 is a critical amino acids that is situated proximal both to the OEC and to the source of electrons that reduce water . The figure below shows the immediate environment around Y161 and the OEC . Describe the role of the groups shown in the figure below . An expanded view of the OEC and part of the protein is shown to the right . Tyr 137 lies near the luminal interface of the protein complex . Describe the figure below and the role of the groups shown . <h> D7 . Chlorophylls and the Reaction Center <p> In PS2 there are 35 chlorophylls . Seven of them use water for ligand to the Mg ion , while the rest use His ( as shown in the example above ) . Why might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Chl ) are arranged in a very specific arrangement as shown below . <p> Two special chlorophylls , ChlD1 and ChlD2 , accompanied by partner chlorophylls , PD1 and PD2 that are coplanar to each , are found near the OEC and are the key chlorophylls that turn OEC into a powerful enough oxidant to oxidize H2O . These 4 chlorophylls are called the reaction center . What might be the role of chlorophylls in the " antennae " subunit " activating " the reaction center ? <p> Now we will consider the key process : how the reaction center chlorophyll becomes natures most powerful oxidant . <p> Why might molecule " b " have a lower excited state energy ? Show by adding arrows and moving the given electrons in the above diagram how excitation of molecule a can lead to the final state shown to the right . What would be the charge on molecule " a " ? Molecule " b " ? Which would might be a powerful oxidant ? <p> Next we must consider how the oxidant made at the reaction center , denoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrated in the S0-4 oxidative intermediates in the Kok cycle . <p> Based on the figures above , which chlorophyll in the reaction center , ChlD1 or ChlD2 represents molecule " a " in the top left figure ? Molecule " b " ? What might be the role of the coplanar partner molecules PD1 and PD2 ? <p> In reality , quantum mechanical calculations show a coupling between ChlD1 or ChlD2 such that 80% of the positive charge and radical character is situated on ChlD1 and 20% is on ChlD2 . ) How does Y161. + lead to sequential transfer of " oxidizing " equivalents to the OEC ? How is Y161 regenerated so that catalysis is continued ? <p> The last feature to consider is the fate of second member of the reaction pair represented by molecule " b " to the right . It must also be regenerated . What must is lose to be regenerated ? <p> Cofactors bound in the reaction center allow a path for electron flow . These include pheophytins ( PHE ) and plastoquinones A and B. Pheophytins are chlorophyll a molecules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is show above . Trace a likely path for electron flow from molecule " b " to Phe , PQA and then to PQB ( with the realization that quantum mechanical coupling and tunneling occur in this process so that the process are coupled ) . <h> D8 . Plant Protection <p> Plants have evolved a great ability to absorb light over the entire visible range of the spectra . Can they absorb to much energy ? The answer is yes , so plants have developed many ways to protect themselves . IF too much light is absorbed , the pH gradient developed across the thylacoid membranes becomes greater . This is sensed by a protein , PsbS , and through subsequent conformational changes transmitted through the light-harvesting antennae , the excess light energy is dissipated as thermal energy . Mutants lacking PsbS showed decreased seed yield , a sign that it became less adaptable under conditions of stress ( such as exposure to rapidly fluctuating light levels ) . Molecules called xanthophylls ( synthesized from carotenes - vit A precursors ) such as zeaxanthin are also important in excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chlorophyll ( a singlet like excited state dioxygen ) to become deexcited . Without the xanthophylls , the excited state chlorophyll could deexcite by transfer of energy to ground state triplet dioxygen , promoting it to the singlet , reactive state , which through electron acquisition , could also be converted to superoxide . These reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) can lead to oxidative damage to proteins , lipids and nucleic acids , alteration in gene transcription , and even programmed cell death . Carotenoids can also acts as ROS scavengers . Hence both heat dissipation and inhibition of formation of ROS ( by such molecules as vitamin E ) are both mechanism of defense of excessive solar energy <p> Given that both plants and animals must be protected from ROS , antioxidant molecules made by plants may prove to protect humans from diseases such as cancer , cardiovascular disease , and general inflammatory diseases , all of which have been shown to involve oxidative damage to biological molecules . Humans , who ca n't synthesize the variety and amounts of antioxidants that are found in plants , appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products . These phytomolecule also have other properties , including regulation of gene transcription which can also have a significant effect on disease propensity . <h> D9 . Production of Hydrogen : Hydrogenases ( repeated from 8B ) <p> Our world desperately needs an energy efficient way to produce H2 for energy production without producing waste pollutants . Catalytic cracking of molecules and newly developed fuel cells offer two possibilities . Would n't it be great if a reactant like water could be used for H2 production ( without the use of electrolysis ) or expensive metal catalysts ? Nature may show the way . Bacteria ( even E. Coli found in our GI system ) can use simple metals like iron to produce H2 from H+ with electrons for the reduction of H+ coming from a donor ( such as a reduced heme in proteins ) : <p> Dred+ H+ &lt;=&gt; Dox + H2 <p> The reaction is also reversible in the presence of an acceptor of electrons from H2 as it gets oxidized : <p> Aox+ H2 &lt;=&gt; Ared + H+ <p> The enzymes that catalyze hydrogen production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name hydrogenases best reflects the reverse reaction when a molecule ( P ) in an oxidized state gets reduced ( to S ) and H2 gets oxided to H+ . <p> Crystal structures of hydrogenases show them to be unique among metal-containing enzymes . They contain two metals bonded to each other . The metal centers can either be both iron or one each of iron and nickel . The ligands interacting with the metals are two classical metabolic poisons , carbon monoxide and cyanide . Passages for flow of electrons and H2 connect the buried metals and the remaining enzymes . The metals are also bound to sulfhydryl groups of cysteine side chains . It appears that two electrons are added to a single proton making a hydride anion which accepts a proton to form H2 . In the two Fe hydrogenases , the geometry of the coordinating ligands distorts the bond between the two iron centers , leading to irons with different oxidation numbers . Electrons appear to flow from one center to the other , as does carbon monoxide as well .

@@71697604 @397604/ <h> Fisher Exact Test <p> The Fisher Exact Test looks at a contingency table which displays how different treatments have produced different outcomes . Its null hypothesis is that treatments do not affect outcomes-- that the two are independent . Reject the null hypothesis ( i.e. , conclude treatment affects outcome ) if p is " small " . <p> The usual approach to contingency tables is to apply the X2 statistic to each cell of the table . You should probably use the X2 approach , unless you have a special reason . The most common reason to avoid X2 is because you have small expectation values . This problem and some solutions are discussed here . <p> In the exact method , we view the particular contingency table found by assigning treatments and observing outcomes as embedded in a universe of similar tables that have the same outcome probabilities as our table ( i.e. , have the same row totals ) and the same distribution of treatments ( i.e. , have the same column totals ) .

( The " unusual " tables are those that have probabilities less than or equal to the given table . ) If the total probability of such unusual tables is " small " --that is if it is rare to have observed such unlikely tables-- we can reject the null hypothesis that the outcome is independent of the treatment . <p> Note that the universe of a 2+2 table can be arranged in the linear form shown above so the term : " more unusual than " is well defined without reference to any particular statistical measure of " unusualness " like X2 .

When bonds are made or broken , charged intermediates are often formed which are higher in energy than the reactants . Since the intermediate is higher in energy than the reactants , the transition state would be even higher in energy , and hence more closely resemble the charged intermediate . Anything that can stabilize the charges on the intermediate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy of the transition state and catalyze the reaction . In this section will will investigate the mechanism underlying the catalysis by small molecules of chemical reactions . Presumably , biological macromolecular catalyst ( like protein enzymes ) will use similar mechanisms in their catalytic effects ( which will be discussed in the next section ) . <p> Catalysts , including enzymes , can employ at least 5 different ways to stabilize transition states . <h> A1 . General Acid and Base Catalysis <p> Charge development in the TS can be decreased by either donation of a proton from general acids ( like acetic acid or a protonated indole ring ) to an atom such as a carbonyl O which develops a partial negative charge in the TS when it is attached by a nucleophile . Proton donation decreases the developing negative in the TS . Alternatively , a nucleophile such as water which develops a partial positive charge in the TS as it begins to form a bond to an electrophilic C in a carbonyl can be stabilized by the presence of a general base ( such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreases the developing positive charge <h> A2 . Metal Ion or Electrostatic Catalysis <p> A metal such as Cu2+ or Zn2+ can also stabilize the TS . The metal must be able to be bound to the charged intermediate and hence the TS . The tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate of the reaction of an electrophilic carbonyl C can interact with a metal if there is an O on an adjacent atom which can help coordinate the metal ion . This charge stabilization of the developing negative in the TS and the full negative in the intermediate is often called electrostatic catalysis . This method is likely to be found in many enzymes since nearly 1/3 of all enzymes require metal ions . A classic example of an enzyme using metal ion catalysis is carboxypeptidase A. <p> Metals can also act in a different way . They may coordinate a water and by further polarizing the H-O bond increase the acidity of the bound water . For instance , the water molecule in the **25;725;TOOLONG ion has a pKa of 6.6 , compared to pure water , with a pKa of 15.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression for water : H2O + H2O &lt;==&gt; H3O+ + OH- . Then write the Ka expression , as for a generic acid , which is H3O+ OH-/ H2O = 10-14/55.5 . The pKa is 15.7 ) . The complexed hydroxide is a better nucleophile than bulk water . An example of an enzyme whose bound metal increases the nucleophilicity of water is carbonic anhydrase . <h> A3 . Covalent or Nucleophilic Catalysis <p> One way to change the activation energy of the reaction is to change the reaction mechanism in ways which introduces new steps with lower activation energy . A typical way is to add a nucleophilic catalyst which forms a covalent intermediate with the reactant . The original nucleophile can then interact with the intermediate in a nucleophilic substitution reaction . If the nucleophilic catalyst is a better nucleophile than the original nucleophile ( usually water ) then the reaction is catalyzed . The nucleophilic catalyst and the original nucleophile usually interact with a carbonyl C in a substitution reaction , initially forming the tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate . <p> If an amine is used as the nucleophilic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) can become dehydrated , since the free pair of electrons on the N are more likely to be shared with the carbon to form a double bond than electrons from the original carbonyl O , which is more electronegative than the N ) . An imine or Schiff Base forms , with a pKa of about 7 . <p> This is easily protonated to form a positively charged N at the former carbonyl O center . This serves as an excellent electron sink for decarboxylation reactions of beta-keto acids and illustrates an important point . Electrons in chemical reactions can be viewed as flowing from a source ( such as a carboxyl group ) to a sink ( such as an nucleophilic carbonyl O or a positively charged N in a Schiff base ) . <p> In a subsequent section , we will discuss how protein enzymes use these same catalytic strategies . An intriguing question arises : how much of the structure of a large protein is really needed for catalysis ? Much work has been directed to the development of small molecule catalysis mimetics of large protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of a protein and still get catalysis . One important feature of enzyme catalysis is that they catalyze reactions in which only one enantiomer is produced . That is , the synthesis is assymertric . This is typically a consequence of the asymmetric enzyme ( itself chiral ) binding only one enantiomer as a reactant and/or the imposition of steric restrictions on the possible reactions of the bound substrate . Recently , it has been show that L-Pro alone can act as such an assymetric catalyst in an aldol condensation reaction . <h> A4 . Intramolecular Catalysis ( reference ) <p> Consider the hydrolysis of phenylacetate . This reaction , a nucleophilic subsitution reaction , could be catalyzed by the addition to solution of the general base acetate , as described above . Since this reaction would double with the doubling of the solution acetate , the reaction is bimolecular ( first order in reactant and catalyst ) . Now consider the same reaction only when the the general base part of the catalyst , the carboxyl group , is part of the reactant phenylacetate . Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. aspirin . When the carboxy group is ortho compared to the acetylated phenolic OH , it is in perfect position to accept a proton from water , decreasing the charge development on the O in the transition state . The general base does not have to diffuse to the appropriate site when it is intramolecular with respect to the carbonyl C of the ester link . The rate of this intramolecular base catalysis is about 100 fold greater than of an intermolecular base catalyst like acetate . It is as if the effective concentration of the intramolecular carboxyl base catalyst is much higher due to its proximity to the reaction site . <p> Another type of reactions involving a carboxyl group ( in addition to simple proton transfer ) is when the negatively charged carboxyl O acts as a nucleophile and attacks an electrophilic carbonyl carbon . When the carbonyl is part of an ester , the carboxyl group engages in a nucleophilic substitution reaction , expelling the alcohol part of the ester as a leaving group . The remaining examples below consider the nucleophilic ( carboxyl ) substitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reactions in effect transfer an acyl group to the carboxyl group to create an anhydride . <p> First consider acyl transfer with aspirin derivatives . Aspirin , as you know , contains a carboxyl group ortho to an ester substitutent . Hence the carboxyl group can act as a nucleophile and attack the carbonyl carbon of the ester in a nucleophilic substitution reaction . The net effect is to transfer the acetyl group from the phenolic OH to the carboxyl group converting it to an anhydride . This is an intramolecular reaction . Compare this reaction to a a comparable bimolecular reaction shown below . <p> The first order rate constant of the intramolecular transfer of the acetyl group to the carboxyl group , k1 = 0.02 s-1 . The analogous bimolecular reaction rate constant k2 10-10 M-1s-1 . Dividing k1/k2 gives the relative rate enhancement of the intramolecular over the intermolecular reaction . With units of molarity , this ratio can be interpreted as the relative effective concentration of the intramolecular nucleophile . This makes the effective concentration of the carboxylate in the aspirin derivative 2 x 107 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the nucleophile . The products are acetic anhydride and phenolate . This is a bimolecular reaction ( a slow one at that ) , with a bimolecular rate constant , k2 which I will arbitrarily set to 1 for comparison to some similar reactions . <p> If you assign a second order rate constant k2 = 1 M-1s-1 to the analogous intermolecular reaction of acetate with phenylacetate ( as described above ) , the first order rate constant for the intramolecular reaction of phenylsuccinate is 105 s-1 . The ratio of rate constants , k1/k2 = 105 M. That is it would take 105 M concentration of acetate reacting with 1 M phenylacetate in the first bimolecular reaction to get a reaction as fast as the intramolecular reaction of phenylsuccinate . An even more sterically restricated bicyclic phenylcarboxylate shows a k1/k2 = 108 M. <p> Another example is anhydride formation between two carboxyl groups . The + " Go for such a reaction is positive , suggesting an unfavorable reaction . Consider two acetic acid molecules condensing to form acetic anhydride . For this intermolecular reaction , Keq = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dicarboxylic acid succinic acid . It condenses in an intramolecular reaction to form succinic anhydride with a Keq = 8x10-7 ( no units ) . The ratio Keq-intra/Keq inter = 3 x 105 M. It is as if the effective concentration of the reacting groups . because they do not have to diffuse together to react , is 3 x 105 M. <p> How does this apply to enzyme catalyzed reaction ? Enzymes bind substrates in physical steps which are typically fast . The slow step is chemical conversion of the bound substrate , which is effectively intramolecular . These three kinds of reactions , intermolecular , intramolecular , and enzyme-catalysed can be broken down into two hypothetical steps , a binding followed by catalysis . <p> If the rate constants for the chemical steps are all identical , the advantage of the intramolecular and enzyme-catalyzed reaction over the intermolecular reaction is KINTRA/KINTER and KENZ/KINTER , respectively . <p> The advantage of intramolecular reactions can be seen by studying the Ca-EDTA complex . Calcium in solution exists as a octahedrally coordinated complex with water occupying all the coordination sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of its potential six electron donors to Ca in a reaction which is entropically disfavored from the the Ca-EDTA perspective , although one water is released . Once this first intramolecular complex is formed , the rest of the ligands on the EDTA rapidly coordinate with the Ca and release bound water . The former is no longer entropically disfavored since it is now an intramolecular process while the later is favored through the release of the remaining five water molecules . <p> We modeled the catalytic advantage offered by intramolecular reaction in terms of a dramatic increase in the effective concentration of reactants , which sometimes reached levels of 108 M. Another way is to look at entropy changes associated with dimer formation . The table below shows that an intramolecular reaction is favored over an intermolecular reaction since in the latter , significant decreases in translational and rotation entropy result . <h> A5 . Transition State Stabilization <p> Linus Pauling postulated long ago that the only thing that a catalyst must do is bind the transition state more tightly than the substrate . That this must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shows how S and S* ( the transition state ) can react with E to form a complex which then proceeds to product , or can go to product in the absence of E. From this diagram , it should be evident that c - a = d -b , where a is the+ " Go for the binding of S to E , and b is the + " Go for the binding of S* to E. For an enzyme to be a catalyst the activation energy for the reaction in the presence of E , d , must be less than in the absence of enzyme , c . Therefore c-d = a-b &gt; 0 . Since + " Go = -RTln Keq , Keq for binding of S* to E is greater than for S binding to E. <p> The stability of the transition state also affects the reaction kinetics ( which makes sense given that the activation energy clearly affects the speed of a reaction ) . As you probably remember from organic chemistry , SN2 reactions are slow when the central atom where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sterics once again . ) We discussed this in context to nucleophiliic substitution on a sp2 hybridized carbonyl carbon in carboxylic acid derivatives versus on a sp3 hybridized phosphorous in phosphoesters and diesters . The explanation for this phenomena has usually been attributed to hindered access of the central atom caused by bulky substituents ( intrinsic effects ) . Is this true ? Studies on SN2 reactions of methylchloroacetonitrile and **25;752;TOOLONG ( with the reagent labeled with 35Cl ) using 37Cl- as the incoming nucleophile in the gas phase shown that the more hindered t-butyl derivative 's activation energy was only 1.6 kcal/mol higher than the methyl derivative , but in aqueous solution , the difference is much greater for comparable reactions . They attributed the differences to solvation effects of the transition state . The bulkier the substituents on the central atom , the more difficult it is to solvate the transition state since water ca n't reorient around it as well . In effect there is steric hindrance for both reactant and solvent . <p> Abyzmes - Antibody Catalysis <p> What does it take for a macromolecule ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems the minimum criterion are : <p> M binds a reactant <p> M binds the transition state more tightly than the substrate <p> Anything above these is just " icing on the cake " . If different functional group are present in the " active " site of the enzyme that would allow electrostatic , intramolecular , covalent , general acid and/or base catalysis , the better the catalyst . <p> Linus Pauling recognized the two key factors decades ago . He made the following hypothesis : Antibody molecules ( immune system proteins that bind foreign molecules ) that can be made to bind to transition state analogs of a substrate , should also presumably catalyze the conversion of substrate , through the transition state , to product . About a decade ago , his prediction was verified . Lerner et al . made a transition state analog of an ester . When an ester is hydrolyzed , the sp2 hybridized carbonyl carbon is converted to an sp3 hybridized center in the intermediate , with the carbonyl oxygen becoming an oxyanion . The transition state presumably looks more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthesized a phosphonate , an ester mimic with a sp3 hybridized phosphorous replacing the carbonyl C. It also has a negatively charged oxygen as does the intermediate for the ester . This phosphonate ester is very resistant to hydrolysis . When injected into a mouse ( after first being covalently attached to a carrier protein so the small molecule becomes " immunogencic " ) , the mouse makes a protein antibody which binds to the phosphonate . When the corresponding carboxylic acid ester is added to the antibody , it is cleaved with nominal kcat and Km values . Site specific mutagenesis can then be done to make it an even better catalyst ! The antibody enzymes have been called abzymes . The structure below shows how phosphonamides act as transition state analogs as well . <p> Transition state theory can be used to more clearly quantify the relationships described in the graphical analysis above . This analysis will use the equilibrium constant ( in contrast to the last two chapters which used dissociation constants to characterize macromolecule , receptor , and enzyme binding to ligand ) . Let assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state S. Hence Keq = S/S . The following reaction can be written : S --&gt; S --&gt; P. Based on our previous kinetic analysis and experience in writing differential equations , dP/dt = k1S . By analogy , enzyme bound S ( ES ) can be converted to ( ES ) and then on to product as shown in the following chemical equation : E + S &lt;----&gt; ES --&gt; ES --&gt; E + P. <p> For the non-enzyme catalyzed reaction , transition state theory can be used to show that the first order rate constant k1= kT/h where k is the Boltzman 's constant , T is the Kelvin temperature , and h is Planck 's constant . Hence , using Keq = S/S , equation 1 can be derived <p> 1 . <p> where kn ( hereafter written as kN ) = ( kT/h ) K is the effective first order rate for the non-catalyzed rate . Now let 's create a more complicated linked equilibrium showing the same reaction in the presence of an enzyme . <p> Remember that the K values for this analysis are equilibrium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , KS , the equilibrium constant for the binding of free S to E , and KT , the equilibrium constant for the binding of free S to E ( assuming that free S could bind to E before it converted to product ) . As we have seen for linked equilibrium before , since the Keq values are related to the standard free energy changes which are state functions , the sum of the standard free energies going from E + S to ES ( by either the top or bottom paths ) are path independent so the products of the Keq for the top path are equal to those for the bottom paths . This gives the following equation : <p> 2 . <p> The right hand side is the ratio of the effective first order rate constant for conversion or ES --&gt; E + P , kE dvided by the rate constant for the conversion of S --&gt; P for the noncatalyzed rate , kN . The final ratio of rate constants can be derived from the simple relationship that kx= ( kT/h ) Kx where x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enzyme catalyzed ) . Equation 2 states that the equilibrium constant for the binding of S to E , KT , is greater than the equilibrium constant for the binding of S to E , KS ( as kE &gt; kN ) . KT/KR ranges from 108 - 1014 . Given common values for the equilibrium constant for binding of S to E ( 103 - 105 M-1 ) which is equivalent to dissociation constant values Kd = 10 uM -1 mM , the calculated value of KT = 1015 M-1 which gives a dissociation constant for the enzyme and transition state of Kd = 10-15 M ( 1 femtomolar ) . This is as tight as one of the highest affinity binding interactions in the biological world , the binding of avidin and biotin . As we noted in Chapter 5A , assuming that the second order rate constant for avidin/biotin binding and as shown above for E/S is diffusion controlled ( about 108 M-1s-1 ) , the off rate for the avidin-biotin or EScomplex is 10-7 s-1 , equivalent to a half life of the complex of 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The figure below represent an image of an enzyme and three different molecules , 1-3 , that could bind to it .

For the usual drain-source voltage drops ( i.e. , the saturation region : positive voltages from a few volts up to some breakdown voltage ) the drain current ( I 'd ) is nearly independent of the drain-source voltage ( VDS ) , and instead depends on the gate voltage ( VG ) . ( This is unusual behavior : usually more voltage produces to more current , but here the current only increases slightly with increasing VDS . ) The transconductance , i.e. , the ratio of the change in drain current to change in gate voltage , often denoted by g @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the simplest approximation the characteristic curves of a nMOSFET are a set of flat lines : <p> Each ( flat ) curve shows that I 'd does n't change with changing VDS .

The spacing of the constant-ID curves is usually not constant , instead I 'd depends quadratically on VG : <p> ID=K(VG-VTO)2 <p> where the threshold voltage VTO and K are constants . <p> A slightly more complicated approximation takes into account the sloping of the characteristic curves . In bipolar transistors this is due to the Early Voltage , here a very similar equation results from quite different physics : channel length modulation . The equation looks like : <p> 1/VA = <p> So in this model all the characteristic curves all have a common x-axis intercept at the large negative voltage -1/ .

For example yos is the slope of a characteristic curve , which is small for voltages near threshold and increases for larger VG . <p> The defining parameter -- the transconductance g or yfs -- is not at all constant .

Below is the measured relationship : I 'd vs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the drain current is well approximated by the quadratic , whereas for VG&lt;VTO ( i.e. , sub-threshold ) the drain current depends approximately exponentially on VG . Thus the drain current is not strictly zero below threshold , merely exponentially small . <p> ( Note that VG=0 is sub-threshold , so the IDSS parameter is a very small current . ) <p> The characteristic curves focus on the output of the transistor , but we can also consider the behavior of the input . In normal operation the gate is separated by an insulating layer from the rest of the transistor , and so IG is essentially zero ( which should sound like a huge input resistance ) . As a result the outputs have little effect on the inputs , but if we follow the traditional analysis the actual functional relationship giving the gate current ( IG ) from the gate voltage ( VG ) and drain-source voltage drop ( VDS ) is some complicated function which we can denote : <p> IG ( VG , VDS ) <p> Like any function we can again approximate it near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion : <p> The small values of yrs and yis shows that the input is largely unaffected by the output and that the input resistance is huge . In fact this input resistance is so large that the capacitance reactance is almost always of greater significance . <p> Particularly for MOSFETs it should be noted that in the small VDS region -- before the saturation region -- the MOSFET characteristic curves look like nearly straight lines through the origin . VG controls the slope of these lines , so the MOSFET acts like a variable resistor with a voltage ( VG ) control . Here is a plot of this region for the above 2N7000 :

The method we will use in this lab is both fairly straight forward and the equipment needed is fairly minimal . We will be creating sounds and recording them with two microphones . We will measure the difference in distance between the paths the sounds take from going to the two microphones . We will then study the recorded signals of the sound to see the time difference between how long the sound took to get to each microphone . Our measurement of the speed of sound will be the result of dividing the difference in distance by the difference in time . <h> 1.1 Theory <p> Sound is a vibrational wave that travels through a medium . The speed of sound in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be transferred across the medium . While the details of the equations that are used to find the speed of sound will vary depending on the state of the medium , the basic equation <p> ( 1 ) <p> describes the wave where u describes the medium the wave is moving through , and c is the speed of the wave ? . <p> In a sound wave , the general method to find the speed is from <p> ( 2 ) <p> where p is the pressure and ? is the mass density ? . In fluids , the speed can be recast in terms of the bulk modulus , B , <p> ( 3 ) <p> which describes the change in volume undergone by a medium when the pressure changes ? . Similarly , in a solid the sound speed depends on the Youngs modulus , Y , <p> ( 4 ) <p> which describes the stress divided by the strain . <p> For gases , the bulk modulus is not always easy deal with , since it will in general vary with temperature , pressure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often recast using the terms of ideal gases : <p> ( 5 ) <p> where ? is adiabatic index ( which is equivalent to the specific heat at constant pressure divided by the specific heat at constant volume ) , k is Boltzmanns constant , T is the temperature and m is the molecular mass ? . For dry air we will take ? = 1.4 and m = 28.9645 u . Unfortunately , air is not a perfectly ideal gas , so to determine the speed of sound more exactly pressure and humidity must be considered . Consideration of these effects does not lead to simple equations , though , so in practice tables or numerical approximations are typically used . <h> 2 Procedure <h> 2.1 The Speed of Sound in Air <p> In this lab we will be using the program audacity on a Linux computer to record sounds received by two microphones . Using the provided adapters you will save one microphones sound as the left track of a stereo recording and one as the right track . For all of the measurements that you make below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes in your lab notebook about why you picked the uncertainties that you used . <p> Record the air temperature , pressure and humidity for the time of your measurements . Currently we have 1 device that will make all three measurements . <p> Your first order of business is to figure out how you need to use the provided adapters and cords to hook up the microphones to the computer . Once you believe that you have the cords set up right , open up audacity and configure that program to receive stereo input . Then test each microphone separately , to be sure that they are providing signals to the correct channel . Once you are convinced that each microphone is working correctly , try both microphones at the same time . Play with causing a sound closer to one microphone or the other and see if your recorded signals make sense . <p> Once you are convinced that your setup is correctly recording the signals to both microphones , take several sets of data that you can use to find the speed of sound . Remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in the path length traveled by the sound to each microphone . <p> For the time difference between how long it takes the sounds to get to each microphone , first use audacity directly . Zoom in on your recordings , pick notable locations in the sound waves , and read off the time difference between when those portions of the wave appear in the left and the right channels . Be sure to assign an uncertainty to the time difference . Be sure to print off at least one set of sample signals from audacity and use the plots when explaining your method . You may need to create a screenshot in order to extract plots from audacity . <p> Mathematica can be used to increase the precision of your measurements of the time delays . A file called soundanalysis.nb shows examples using some of the commands below . <p> Repeat this process for at least five different path length differences for the sounds travel to the two microphones . Be sure to have your path difference use the entire range of possible values allowed by the supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time delay and fit the line to find a value for the speed of sound in air . <h> 2.2 The Speed of Sound in Some Other Material <p> In this section of the lab you are in charge . Use the techniques that you learned in the previous section to find the speed of sound in some material other than air . In your lab notebook describe in detail what you do on this portion . Note that you should be very careful to consider the fact that the sound may travel both through the material that you are attempting to test and the air . <h> 3 Conclusions <p> Find online or in a book a source for the speed of sound in air that considers temperature , humidity , and pressure . This source may have equations , tables , or web forms that give the speed of sound . Cite your source . Find the speed of sound using equation 5 and your source and compare .

Use these values to come up with a theoretical value of the speed of sound in air with uncertainty for the time of your measurements .

@@71697625 @397625/ <p> It is helpful to have a way of comparing Bronsted-Lowry acidities of different compounds . If the chemistry of protons involves being passed from a more acidic site to a less acidic site , then the site that binds the proton more tightly will retain the proton , and the site that binds protons less tightly will lose the proton . If we know which sites bind protons more tightly , we can predict in which direction a proton will be transferred . <p> Figure AB9.1 . In which direction will the equilibrium lie ? Which base gets the proton ? <p> There is an **25;779;TOOLONG parameter that tells us how tightly protons are bound to different compounds . " Experimental " often implies to students " untested " or " unreliable " , but here it means that someone has done the work to measure how tightly the proton is bound . Experimental in this sense means " based on physical evidence " . <p> This experimental parameter is called " the pKa " . The pKa measures how tightly a proton is held by a Bronsted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , such as -3 or -5 . It may be a larger , positive number , such as 30 or 50 . The lower the pKa of a Bronsted acid , the more easily it gives up its proton . The higher the pKa of a Bronsted acid , the more tightly the proton is held , and the less easily the proton is given up . <p> For example , nitric acid and hydrochloric acid both give up their protons very easily . Nitric acid in water has a pKa of -1.3 and hydrobromic acid has a pKa of -9.0 . On the other hand , acetic acid ( found in vinegar ) and formic acid ( the irritant in ant and bee stings ) will also give up protons , but hold them a little more tightly . Their pKas are reported as 4.76 and 3.77 , respectively . Water can certainly give up a proton , but not very easily ; it has a pKa of around 14 . Methane is not really an acid at all , and it has an estimated pKa of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water is very , very weakly acidic ; methane is not really acidic at all . <p> The pKa measures the " strength " of a Bronsted acid . A proton , H+ , is a strong Lewis acid ; it attracts electron pairs very effectively , so much so that it is almost always attached to an electron donor . A strong Bronsted acid is a compound that gives up its proton very easily . <p> A weak Bronsted acid is one that gives up its proton with more difficulty . Going to a farther extreme , a compound from which it is very , very difficult to remove a proton is not considered to be an acid at all . <p> When a compound gives up a proton , it retains the electron pair that it formerly shared with the proton . It becomes a conjugate base . Looked at another way , a strong Bronsted acid gives up a proton easily , becoming a weak Bronsted base . The Bronsted base does not easily form a bond to the proton . It is not good at donating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only weakly . <p> In a similar way , if a compound gives up a proton and becomes a strong base , the base will readily take the proton back again . Effectively , the strong base competes so well for the proton that the compound remains protonated . The compound remains a Bronsted acid rather than ionizing and becoming the strong conjugate base . It is a weak Bronsted acid . <p> Figure AB9.5 . The pKa scale and its effect on conjugate bases . <p> " Strong " Bronsted acids ionize easily to provide H+ . <p> This term is usually used to describe common acids such as sulfuric acid and hydrobromic acid . <p> " Weak " Bronsted acids do not ionize as easily . <p> This term is often used to describe common acids such as acetic acid and hydrofluoric acid . <p> However , the terms " strong " and " weak " are really relative . pKa values that we have seen range from -5 to 50 .

Is that a very , very , very , very weak acid ? How many " verys " are there in a pKa unit ? <p> This idea is also true when considering the opposite : a base picking up a proton to form a conjugate acid . How tightly that conjugate acid holds a proton is related to how strongly the base can remove protons from other acids . The weaker something is as a source of protons , the stronger its conjugate is as a proton sponge . <p> Figure AB9.6 . Examples of a strong base and an even stronger one . <p> Be careful . The terms " strong acid " and " weak acid " can be used relatively , rather than absolutely . <p> The same is true for " strong base " and " weak base " . <p> Sometimes , whether something is called " strong " or " weak " depends on what else it is being compared to . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help you decide which of the following pairs is the most Bronsted acidic in water . <p> a ) HNO3 or HNO2 b ) H2Se or H2O c ) HCl or H2SO4 d ) Be(OH)2 or HSeO3 <p> Problem AB9.2 .

@@71697635 @397635/ <p> There are a number of important biomolecules that could occur as enantiomers , including amino acids and sugars . In most cases , only one enantiomer occurs ( although some fungi , for example , are able to produce mirror-image forms of these compounds ) . We will look later at some of these biomolecules , but first we will look at a compound that occurs naturally in both enantiomeric forms . <p> Carvone is a secondary metabolite . That means it is a naturally-occurring compound that is not directly connected to the very basic functions of a cell , such as self-replication or the production of energy . The role of secondary metabolites in nature is often difficult to determine . However , these compounds often play roles in self-defense , acting as deterrents against competitor species in a sort of small-scale chemical warfare scenario . They are also frequently used in communications ; this role has been studied most extensively among insects , which use lots of compounds to send information to each other . <p> Figure SC5.1 . The two naturally-occurring enantiomers of carvone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these forms , called ( - ) -carvone , is found in mint leaves , and it is a principal contributor to the distinctive odor of mint . The other form , ( + ) -carvone , is found in caraway seeds . This form has a very different smell , and is typically used to flavour rye bread and other Eastern European foods . The structural connectivity in these two compounds appears to be identical , but they are n't the same in three dimensions , as you will find if you build models of them . Instead , ( + ) - and ( - ) -carvone are mirror images of each other , like a right hand and a left hand . <p> Note that ( + ) -carvone is the same thing as ( S ) -carvone . The ( + ) designation is based on its positive optical rotation value , which is experimentally measured . The ( S ) designation is determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules for designating stereochemistry , which deal with looking at the groups attached to a chiral center and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chiral center actually has three carbons attached to it ; they all have the same atomic number . We need a new rule to break the tie . <p> If two substituent groups have the same atomic number , go one bond further to the next atom . <p> If there is a difference among the second tier of atoms , stop . <p> The group in which you have encountered a higher atomic number gets the highest priority . <p> If there is not a clear difference , proceed one additional bond to the next set of atoms , and so on , until you find a difference . <p> In carvone , this decision tree works as follows : <p> . The chiral center is connected to a H , a C , a C and a C. <p> The H is lowest priority . <p> One C eventually leads to a C=O . However , at the second bond from the chiral center , this C is connected to a C and two H 's . <p> A second C is also part of the six-membered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . At the second bond from the chiral center , this C is connected to a C and two H 's , just like the first one . <p> The third C is part of a little three-carbon group attached to the six-membered ring . At the second bond from the chiral center , it is connected to only one H and has two bonds to another C ( this is counted as two bonds to C and one to H ) . <p> Those first two carbon groups are identical so far . <p> However , the third group is different ; it has an extra bond to C , whereas the others have an extra bond to H. C has a higher atomic number than H , so this group has higher priority . <p> The second-highest priority is the branch that reaches the oxygen at the third bond from the chiral center . <p> Figure SC5.2 . Comparing atoms step-by-step to assign configuration . <p> How different , exactly , are these two compounds , ( + ) - and ( - ) -carvone ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In most ways , the answer is no . These two compounds have the same appearance ( colourless oil ) , the same boiling point ( 230 C ) , the same refractive index ( 1.499 ) and specific gravity ( 0.965 ) . However , they have optical rotations that are almost exactly opposite values . <p> Two enantiomers have the same physical properties . <p> Enantiomers have opposite optical rotations . <p> Clearly they have different biological properties ; since they have slightly different odors , they must fit into slightly different nasal receptors , signaling to the brain whether the person next to you is chewing a stick of gum or a piece of rye bread . This different shape complimentarity is not surprising , just as it is n't surprising that a left hand only fits into a left handed baseball glove and not into a right handed one . <p> There are other reasons that we might concern ourselves with an understanding of enantiomers , apart from dietary and olfactory preferences . Perhaps the most dramatic example of the importance of enantiomers can be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly prescribed during the 1950 's and 1960 's in order to alleviate nausea and other symptoms of morning sickness . In fact , only one enantiomer of thalidomide had any therapeutic effect in this regard . The other enantiomer , apart from being therapeutically useless in this application , was subsequently found to be a teratogen , meaning it produces pronounced birth defects . This was obviously not a good thing to prescribe to pregnant women . Workers in the pharmaceutical industry are now much more aware of these kinds of consequences , although of course not all problems with drugs go undetected even through the extensive clinical trials required in the United States . Since the era of thalidomide , however , a tremendous amount of research in the field of synthetic organic chemistry has been devoted to methods of producing only one enantiomer of a useful compound and not the other . This effort probably represents the single biggest aim of synthetic organic chemistry through the last quarter century . <p> Enantiomers may have very different biological properties . <p> Obtaining enantiomerically pure compounds is very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thalidomide . <p> Problem SC5.1. a ) Draw thalidomide and identify the chiral center with an asterisk . <p> b ) Draw the two possible enantiomeric forms of thalidomide . <p> Problem SC5.2 .

For the following compounds , identify four chiral centers in each , mark them with asterisks , and identify each center as R or S configuration . <p> The following is the structure of dysinosin A , a potent thrombin inhibitor that consequently prevents blood clotting . <p> Ginkgolide B ( below ) is a secondary metabolite of the ginkgo tree , extracts of which are used in Chinese medicine . <p> Sanglifehrin A , shown below , is produced by a bacteria that may be found in the soil of coffee plantations in Malawi .

@@71697638 @397638/ <h> Structure &amp; Reactivity <h> AT . The Atom <p> AT6 . The Periodic Table and Periodic Trends <p> The aufbau process is a set of rules that allows us to predict the electronic configuration of an atom if we know how many electrons there are in the atom . If the periodic table is used as a tool , this process is pretty easy . <p> For atoms found in the first two columns of the periodic table ( figure AT5.1 ) , the configuration is a closed shell of core electrons , plus s electrons in a new shell . For example , potassium has a configuration Ar4s1 . These atoms are often called the alkali and alkaline earth elements . Alkali elements , from the first column , have a configuration ending in s1 ; alkaline earth elements , from the second column , have configurations ending in s2 . Together , these elements are often called the s-block elements , because their valence electrons are s electrons . Remember , the valence electrons are the ones beyond the noble gas core . In the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Figure AT6.1 . The periodic table . Red elements are the alkali and alkaline earth metals ( s-block ) . Yellow elements are the transition metals ( d-block ) . Orange elements are the lanthanides and actinides ( f-block ) . Green , blue and purple elements are the p-block ; together with the s-block , they are called the main group elements . The main group is divided into metals ( green ) , metalloids ( teal ) , non-metals ( blue ) and noble or inert gases ( purple ) . <p> The first two and the last six columns of the periodic table are called the main group elements . Alternatively , they are sometimes called the s-block and p-block elements , respectively . For example , phosphorus has a configuration , Ne4s24px1py1pz1 , or simply Ne4s24p3 . <p> The middle block of the periodic table consists of the transition metals or the d-block elements . For example , scandium has configuration Ne4s23d1 . <p> The final two rows of the periodic table are the lanthanides and actinides . Collectively , they are called the f-block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These elements could really be inserted at the left-hand side of the d-block in the appropriate rows . Notice that lanthanum , element 57 , is followed by hafnium , element 72 , in the table . The element that really occurs next is element 58 , cerium , and it is shown in the lanthanide row down below . The f-block elements are usually shown below in order to save space . <p> Really , the periodic table should look like this : <p> Figure AT6.2 . The periodic table shown with the lanthanides in their proper places . <p> The periodic table is divided into columns of atoms with similar electron configurations . <p> Atoms with similar electron configurations have similar properties . <p> Chemical reactions depend on the movement of electrons . In a reaction , one atom may accept electrons from another atom . One atom may donate electrons to another atoms . The valence electrons are the outermost electrons in an atom ; they are closest to the surface of an atom . That fact makes the valence electrons more likely to interact with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an atom , and most likely to participate in a reaction . <p> For these reasons , atoms with similar electron configurations generally behave in similar ways . The repeating properties in each row of the periodic table , as observed by Mendeleev and others , reflect the repeating electron configurations in subsequent rows . The periodic table organizes atoms with similar configurations and properties together in columns . <p> Problem AT6.1 . <p> For the following elements , suggest two other elements that would have similar properties . <p> Make a diagram showing the energy levels of different orbitals , arranged by principal quantum number . <p> " Periodic trends " refer to the way in which physical properties of atoms change across the periodic table . One of the most commonly used periodic trends in chemistry is electronegativity . Electronegativity is closely connected to the basic idea of chemical reactions : the transfer of an electron from one neutral atom to another . It refers to how strongly an atom attracts electrons from other atoms . <p> Electronegativity is a measure of an atom 's ability to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold electrons tightly . <p> There are many scales of electronegativity , based on different physical measurements . Usually , electronegativity is set to an approximately 4-point scale . Atoms with electronegativity of around 4 draw electrons very strongly toward themselves . Atoms with electronegativity of 1 ( or lower ) only weakly draw electrons toward themselves . <p> The following data use the Allen scale of electronegativity . The Allen scale uses spectroscopic measurements to estimate the energy of valence electrons in an atom . From these values , the relative attraction of the atom for its valence electrons is placed on a 4 point scale ( approximately ) . <p> Table AT6.1 . The Allen electronegativity values of the second-row elements . <p> Some electronegativity scales do not have values for the noble gases , because they are based on experimental measurements of compounds , and noble gases do not commonly form compounds with other elements . Instead , they exist as single atoms . The Allen scale just depends on the ability of an atom to interact with light , which is something even noble gases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also given electronegativity values on this scale . However , on many scales , fluorine would be the most electronegative atom here . As a result , fluorine is usually thought of as the most electronegative element . <p> Often it is useful to plot data on a graph . That way , we can get a better look at the relationship . For example , a quick glance at Figure AT5.2. shows that there is a smooth increase in electronegativity as we move across a row in the periodic table . <p> Figure AT6.3 . A plot of electronegativity versus atomic number in the second row of the periodic table . <p> Problem AT6.3 . <p> Take a look at the graph in figure AT6.2 . Can you explain why the electronegativity increases as atomic number increases ? . <p> Problem AT6.4 . <p> Suppose you need an electron . You have a boron atom and an oxygen atom . You try to take an electron away from one . Use Figure AT6.2. to predict which atom will give up the electron more easily . <p> Problem AT6.5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send it into a vessel that contains a carbon atom and a fluorine atom . Use Figure AT6.2. to predict which atom is more likely to take the electron . <p> Problem AT6.6 . <p> A covalent chemical bond is a pair of electrons shared between two atoms . Suppose you have a carbon-oxygen bond . Will the electrons be shared evenly between the two atoms , or will one atom pull the electrons more tightly towards itself ? Use Figure AT6.2. to make your prediction . <p> What is happening as we move across a row in the periodic table ? Why does electronegativity increase ? <p> Keep in mind that the only difference from one element to the next is the number of protons in the nucleus . The number of protons is called the atomic number . If you know the number of protons you have , then you know what atoms you have . Electronegativity may have something to do with the number of protons in the nucleus . In fact , it should . The more protons there are in the nucleus , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional proton should add more electrostatic attraction for an electron . Fluorine , with nine protons , should attract electrons much more strongly than lithium , which has only three protons . <p> Moving across a row of the periodic table , as protons are added to the nucleus , electrons are held more tightly . <p> Electronegativity increases across a row in the periodic table . <p> It seems like that effect should be offset by the increasing number of electrons in the atom . Each time a proton is added , so is an electron . That electron should repel other electrons in the atom , cancelling out the effect of more protons in the nucleus . <p> However , the structure of the atom minimizes electron-electron repulsion a little bit . Remember that all the protons are in one place , the nucleus . All the electrons are a relatively great distance from the nucleus , in many different directions . Chances are , an additional electron is much farther away ; it may be twice as far away as an additional proton in the nucleus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the atom . Because electrons are spread out in the atom , and the distances between them is pretty large , the repulsive effect is a little smaller than the attractive effect of additional protons . <p> We can see that this trend is generally true across the periodic table , with a few exceptions here and there . <p> What happens as we move down a column in the periodic table ? Table AT5.2. shows the Allen electronegativities of the alkali metals . These elements are also called the Group 1 elements or the Group IA elements . The " Group 1 " designation is used because they are the first column or group in the periodic table . The data are also presented in Figure AT5.4 . <p> Table AT6.2 . The Allen electronegativity values of the alkali elements . <p> Figure AT6.5 . Plot of the Allen electronegativity values of the alkali elements . <p> There is a different trend here . In this case , lithium ( atomic number 3 ) has more protons than hydrogen ( atomic number 1 ) . However , hydrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 87 protons in its nucleus , is the least electronegative alkali element . <p> Problem AT6.7 . <p> Take a look at the graph in figure AT6.4 . Can you explain why the electronegativity decreases as atomic number increases , going down this column ? <p> Problem AT6.8 . <p> An ionic chemical bond is a pair of ions attracted by their opposite charges . A cation is a positively charged ion ; it may be an atom that has lost an electron . An anion is a negatively charged ion ; it may be an atom that has gained an extra electron . Ions can form by moving an electron from one atom to another . <p> a ) Suppose you have an ionic cesium-fluorine bond . Which ion is the cesium and which is the fluorine ? Use Figure AT6.2 and Figure AT6.4. to make your prediction . Cesium is Cs . <p> b ) Suppose you have an ionic sodium-oxygen bond . Which ion is the sodium and which is the oxygen ? Use Figure AT6.2 and Figure AT6.4. to make your prediction . Sodium is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c ) Suppose you have an ionic potassium-hydrogen bond . Which ion is the potassium and which is the hydrogen ? Use Figure AT6.2 and Figure AT6.4. to make your prediction . Potassium is K ( from the Latin , kalium ) . <p> Periodic Trends and Atomic Radius <p> The biggest difference between two atoms in the same group ( column ) in the periodic table is the principal quantum number . Remember , that corresponds to the " valence shell " . Think of electrons as forming layers around the nucleus . Electrons with principal quantum number one form a first layer . Those with principal quantum number 2 form a second layer , and so on . Each layer is further away from the nucleus . Remember , electrostatic attraction gets weaker as charges get further away from each other . As electrons get further from the nucleus , they are less tightly held . <p> Moving down a column in the periodic table , valence electrons are held less tightly because they get further from the nucleus . <p> Electronegativity decreases as we move down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this general size trend in the following periodic table . This table presents covalent radii , which are related to the sizes of the atoms ( although not exactly the same ; data on atomic radii are not available for all atoms , however ) . <p> We can clearly see the expanding radii of atoms if we look at Group 1 , the first column ; these elements are called the alkali metals . Hydrogen , at the top , is very small . Lithium is much bigger . Sodium is much bigger than lithium , however , and potassium is much bigger than sodium . And so on : francium is bigger than cesium , which is bigger than rubidium , which is bigger than potassium . <p> Each time an electron is added to an orbital that is significantly farther from the nucleus , of course it is going to result in a bigger atom . Remember , the atom is mostly empty space , and its size is described by the outermost reaches of its electrons . So when we go to the next principal quantum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the periodic table , from the first row to the second row , for example -- the next electron is much further away from the nucleus . It has to be that way , because electrons repel each other . They ca n't all be equally close to the nucleus , because there would be too much repulsion . Instead , they form these layers , and when the first layer is so full that there would be too much repulsion if anothe relectron were added , we start the next layer . <p> Of course , the very first layer is very , very small . There just is n't that much room so close to the nucleus . For the first row , only two electrons are allowed . Then they have to start the next layer . For the second row , eight electrons are allowed ; that 's the origin of something called the " octet rule " ( think " octopus " ) for common compounds , which you 'll see later on . Eventually we get to eighteen electrons in a shell , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like layers of an onion , or like nested Russian dolls . <p> There is another important trend if you look carefully . As you move from left to right across the periodic table , from one group to the next , the atoms get bigger . That does n't make any sense , does it ? If we are adding more electrons , why would the atom get smaller ? <p> The key thing is , not only are we adding more electrons , but we are also adding more protons in the nucleus . The new electrons we are adding are all roughly equidistant from the nucleus ; they are all equally close to the protons . So as the charge on the nucleus gets bigger , those electrons are all more strongly attracted to the centre . The atom shrinks . <p> Eventually , we get to the point at which we could n't possibly add more electrons ; the radius has shrunk so much that repulsion would become too great if we added one more electron . Then we just start another row . Just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the point at which the attraction between the nucleus and the outermost electrons is so strong , and the electrons are held so tightly , that the atom becomes very , very stable . This last column in the table contains the noble gases , which are particularly stable and unreactive . <p> Problem AT6.9 . <p> Why does electronegativity fall so sharply between hydrogen and lithium , and much more subtly between lithium and sodium ? <p> Problem AT6.10 . <p> Which atom , in the following pairs , is more electronegative ? <p> a ) magnesium , Mg , or calcium , Ca <p> b ) lead , Pb , or tin , Sn <p> c ) silver , Ag , or antimony , Sb <p> d ) gallium , Ga , or arsenic , As <p> e ) tungsten , W , or copper , Cu <p> f ) thallium , Tl , or sulfur , S <p> Problem AT6.11 . <p> Electron ionization is the energy that must be added in order to pull an electron away from an atom . <p> a ) Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an electron away from an atom ?

Plot of the ionization energies of the second row elements . <p> Problem AT6.13 . <p> Explain the trend in the following data on ionization energy . <p> Table AT6.4 . The ionization energies of the alkali elements . <p> Problem AT6.14 . <p> Electron affinity is the energy released when a free electron is picked up by an atom . <p> a ) Why would energy be released when a free electron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general trend in the following electron affinity data . <p> Table AT6.5 . The electron affinities of the alkali elements . <p> Problem AT6.15 . <p> a ) Explain a general trend in the following electron affinity data . <p> b ) There are several exceptions to the general trend . Why do beryllium and neon have such low electron affinities ( almost zero ) ? <p> c ) Nitrogen also has an electron affinity that is close to zero . Why ? <p> Problem AT6.16 . <p> Usually , elements become bigger as we go down a column in the periodic table . However , in a phenomenon called " the lanthanide contraction " , some elements are actually smaller than the ones in the row above them . Specifically , osmium , iridium , platinum , gold , and mercury are smaller than their relatives , ruthenium , rhodium , palladium , silver , and cadmium , respectively . <p> Use the periodic table in Figure AT6.2. to offer a possible explanation for this phenomenon . 74907 @qwx694907 
@@71697639 @397639/ <p> Optical resolution refers to the separation of two different enantiomers from each other . Very rarely , this has been done if the crystalline forms of two enantiomers are visibly different from each other .

The crystals that formed had multifaceted habits that were visibly mirror images of each other .

Their interactions with those chiral molecules may be strongly influenced by how they fit together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieving a child 's athsma or making it worse . <p> Chiral compounds , of course , are often compared to hands .

Handedness or chirality : a left and a right hand . <p> ( You do n't like hands with three fingers ? Start reading the comics page . It 's a well-established convention . ) <p> The fact that the interaction of chiral compounds with other chiral compounds is influenced by their stereochemistry is often compared to the fit of your two hands to the same glove . Not surprisingly , one hand fits the glove better than the other one . <p> Figure SC14.1 . Handedness or chirality : a left and a right hand , and one glove . <p> One way to separate two enantiomers is through chiral column chromatography . Chiral column chromatography uses something like a hand-glove approach to separate two enantiomers from each other . <p> In case you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at it in general terms first . Chromatography describes the separation of compounds through their different physical interactions between two different phases as the compounds pass through a long column or tube . <p> The column is packed with one material , called the stationary phase , whose job it is to stick to the compounds and keep them from moving through the tube . The stationary phase could be simple alumina or silica ( like very finely powdered sand ) or it could be a complicated synthetic material protected by a patent . <p> Another material , called the mobile phase , flows through the column . The job of the mobile phase is to tug the compounds along and get them through the column . The mobile phase could be a gas , allowed to flow through the column from a compressed tank , or a liquid , pushed through with a pump . <p> A tug-of-war ensues between the mobile phase and the stationary phase . Different compounds will have different affinities for each phase . Compounds that are more strongly attracted to the mobile phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly by the stationary phase will move more slowly . <p> Chiral column chromatography involves the use of one of those patented stationary phases . The stationary phase has a specific kind of chiral molecule ( or a chiral moiety , just a piece of a molecule ) bonded all over it . The differing interactions between the two enantiomers and the chiral elements of the stationary phase result in the two compounds moving through the column at different rates . The compound that fits together with the chiral stationary phase will slow down and take longer to come through the column . <p> A second major way of separating two enantiomers is through the use of a chiral resolving agent . A chiral resolving agent is a compound that already has a chiral centre of its own . It is used in its pure form : only one enantiomer and not the other , having already been purified somehow ( or selectively synthesized ) . This compound has to be able to react somehow with the target compound . When it does , it will form a third , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centres : the one from the target compound and the one from the chiral resolving agent . <p> That changes everything . The compound contains two chiral centres . One of these is identical among all the molecules in the sample ; that 's the one from the pure chiral resolving agent . The other one is present in either of two configurations ; that 's the one from the enantiomeric target compound .

@@71697644 @397644/ <h> On-Line Study Guide - OLSG Chemistry 111 <h> Measurement - Chapter 1 <p> In lab 2 you will determine the mass of dissolved solids and all solids in a sample of water . It sounds simple , but there are some important features of measurements that you need to understand . Chapter 1 presents some information , and Appendix 2 has a review of significant figures . In this handout , we will explore important features of measurement . In this document , we will use a simple question , " What is the weight of a 1997 penny ? " to to illustrate several points : . Lab workers must make measurement everyday . They might have an unknown chemical substance and would like to know what it is , so they devise tests to measure fundamental properties of the substance . They then can compare these measured properties to the properties of known substances to determine the nature of their unknown . Lessons learned from measuring the weight of water apply to many circumstances . <p> PROBLEM : MEASURE THE AVERAGE WEIGHT OF PENNY <p> Ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There are many ways to measure the weight of a penny . There are many questions that are raised by the simple question . Did I mean what is the most accurate weight of a single penny , or did I mean what is the average weight of 1997 pennies in general ? Each penny must have a slightly different weight . The simpler problem is to determine the weight of a single penny . You could simply weigh it one time and take that as the weight . A better way might be measure the weight of the same penny 5 times , and average them , since you would probably get a different weight each time , depending on you measuring device and how you read it . A more complicated problem is to determine the average weight of 1997 pennies . The complexity increases since you would get slightly different weights for the same penny each time you weighed it , and each different penny would also have a slightly different weight to start with . If I am asking about the average weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure the weight of each one , add the weights , and then divide by 5 . Alternatively , you could determine the weight of all 5 together , and divide by 5 . Which method is better ? We will investigate this problem later . It probably is intuitive that the more pennies you measure and/or the more times you weigh a given penny , the more accurate your average weight would be . <p> Imagine that you measure the weight of a single penny a thousand times on each of two different analytical balances . You will get a distribution of measured values for the penny for each of the balances used . Balance 1 reads to 0.005 grams but balance 2 reads to 0.05 grams . You have been told that the mass of the penny , determined on an ultra sensitive balance , is 5.015000005 g . What is the best value for the weight of the penny ? What kind of error might be associated with your best value ? The kind of distribution of values you would get for a typical measurement is shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution , the one most likely recorded most often , represents the best value for the measurement . The measured values farthest away on the x axis are those least likely to be recorded . <p> Before we can discuss how good your measured values are , we need to discuss two common terms - accuracy and precision . The following example will help you explore the different between these two concepts . You are throwing darts at a dart board . You can throw them with great precision , but little accuracy . In this case all the darts would be clustered together on the board , but unfortunately not at the bullseye . In contrast , you can throw with great accuracy and precision if the darts are all clustered at the bullseye . <p> How accurate is your measurement ? How should you report it ? <p> In they penny example above , you used two balances which differ in their sensitivity . Let us assume that your measuring devise is accurate ( properly calibrated so the average weight of the pennies is centered on the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits on the measuring ability of the instrument . A simple example illustrates these points . A friend of yours , who dropped chemistry after the first lab , thought he could accurately determine the mass of objects just by holding them in his hand . To test his abilities , you blindfolded him , gave him a 5.00 g mass ( to calibrate his arm ) , and then had him hold a new mass of 10.0 g . In his blunt and arrogant fashion , he calmly announced that the mass was 7.2345430783 g . <p> What was wrong with his determined mass ? First , his number was not accurate . He was low at least 2.7 g from the actual mass of the object in his determination . Second , he reported the result to such a degree of sensitivity , that one would have thought he was a bionic man with a built in modern electronic microbalance , not just a simple lever and pulley system of bones , muscles , tendons , and ligaments . He reported his mass to 10 decimal places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure mass to an accuracy of + 0.0000000001 g . What he really implied by his measurement was that the actual mass was between 7.2345430782 and 7.2345430784 g . He measured ( in his mind ) with absolute certainty the numbers 7.234543078 ( 10 figures ) and the last one ( the 10th decimal place ) he estimated with some uncertainty . He actually then measured 11 figures , and each figure contains significant information concerning the mass of the object . Each of these figures in significant . He has reported his answer to 11 significant figures . A bit too many sig. fig. ' s do n't you think ? <p> There is a place and time for such profound accuracy , sensitivity , and such a large number of significant figures . For example , consider Dirac 's number , which describes the magnetic properties of a spinning electron . Recent experimental measurements put this number at 1.00115965221 + 0.00000000004 . Not bad , given that the theoretical value for this number , derived from the modern theory of quantum electrodynamics , is 1.00115965246 + 0.00000000020 ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the large number of significant figures , the small associated certainty , and the closeness to the theoretical value . Richard Feyman suggests that is equivalent to measuring the distance between New York and Los Angeles to within the distance of a human hair . Some rules for determining the number of significant figures are : <p> all digits other than 0 are significant <p> zero 's that come before the first nonzero digit are not significant ( Ex : 0.0512 has 3 significant figures <p> zero 's that come after the last nonzero digit are significant if the number is a decimal ( Ex : the following have 3 sig. figs - 5.00 , 0.00500 , 500 written with a decimal point ( 500 . ) The later can be expressed in scientific notation as 5.00 x 102 . The number 500 without a decimal should be considered to have only 1 sig . fig . The best way to avoid the ambiguity in the last value is to write it in scientific notation . Hence , 5 x 102 has 1 sig. fig , 5.0 x 102 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sig. fig , <p> What use are significant figures . It became clear when you realized that some properties can not be measured directly on a fancy instrument , but rather must be calculated from a series of other measurements ( for example the average of many measurement , the density of water , calculated from mass and volume . It is here where significant figures come in handy in allowing us to determine the uncertainty of a calculated result . Another example pops to mind to clarify this use of significant figures . In the lab you had to make a solution of sodium chloride ( NaCl ) containing 30.80 g NaCl in water so that the final volume of the solution was 5.27 X 102 ml . You needed to measure mass of NaCl , the volume of the solution , and from that to calculate the concentration of the solution in g/ml . <p> So what is the concentration in g/ml of the NaCl solution ? Is it 0.058 , 0.0584 , 0.05844 , or 0.058444 g/ml ? This is not a trivial question . For calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer should have the same number of significant figures as in the number with the fewest sig. figs . <p> for addition/subtraction , the answer should have the same number of decimal places as the term with the fewest decimal places - i.e. the number of significant figures does n't matter . <p> You now have an idea of what will be required of your measurements . You must measure some property of the pennies with an instrument of sufficient sensitivity to measure small differences in the property of interest . In addition , you must know the limits of accuracy of your instruments , so that you can report your measured property to the right number of decimal places and significant figures . For those properties which are calculated from a series of measurements , the final result must have the correct number of significant figures . You should try to achieve the most accurate measurements and results possible , with the maximum number of significant figures allowable , based on the measuring instruments available to you . <p> Reading the best value for a measurement . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some instruments such as electronic balances show the measure value digitally . Just read the value from the digital readout but remember that the last digit is uncertain with a tolerance of x + some number . If the values has to be read between lines , such on an analog scale , you can usually divide the distance between the two lines into tenths and estimate the best value to that level of certainty . The last estimated number has some significance so it is still a significant digit . The example below shows a special case that will help you determine if 0 's in a number are significant . <p> All the flasks read 500 mL , but how many sig. fig 's should you use ? Scientific notation works best . The best values are <p> All measurements have errors associated with them . Hence all calculated results must have an error associated with it , which can be determined by taking into account the errors associated with the individual measurement . There are many ways to estimate the error associated with a calculated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of possible values : : ( Example : measuring the average weight of 5 pennies , either by measuring them individually and calculating the mean , or weigh them all together , and calculate the mean . ) How much error is associated with this calculated result ? The easiest way to quantitate it is to use the relative error . Assume that the absolute error in each measurement is + 0.001 g . Imagine in a worst case scenario that each of the five measurements was 0.001 g to high . The other worse case scenario would be that each of the measurements was 0.001 g to low . ( In reality , some of the measurement would be 0.001 too high , and some too low . ) That implies that if each pennies were measured individually , the sum of the measured masses for 5 pennies would be x + 0.005 g . The average mass per penny would be 1/5 of that result , or x/5 + 0.001 g . If the five penny were weighed together , the weight would be y + 0.001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/5 of that result , or y/5 + 0.0002 g . <p> Standard Deviation as a measure of error : ( Ex : Measuring the weight of a single penny ) In this example , we obtained a distribution of measured values . We can obtain the best value for the weight by determining the mean of the measurement . One way to calculate the error is to determine the standard deviation ( S.D ) of the measurements , using statistics . Clearly the S.D. obtained using the more sensitive balance is less than the with the less sensitive balance . To calculate the S.D. , first calculate the mean , X. Then take each X value you measured and subtract from it the mean , X. This gives the deviation from the mean of each measurement : Xi-X . If your measured value is greater ( &gt; ) than X , then Xi-X &gt; 0 . If the measured value is less than ( &lt; ) the mean , Xi-X &lt; 0 or negative . You expect some deviations to be positive and some to be negative . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 2 . All these numbers are now positive . Next add all the squared deviations for all the measurements and divide by n-1 where n is the number of measurements . <p> S ( Xi - X ) 2/n-1 which gives the approximate average of the deviations squared . ( If you divided by n instead of n-1 it would be the average of the deviations squared ) . Now take the square root of this number and you get the standard deviation for the measurement . Remember our normal distribution curve in the beginning . It should follow that if we measured one penny 1000 times on balance that reads to 0.005 grams , the S.D. for those measurements will be less than one the reads to a value of 0.05 g.

There are three basic steps that are clearly accomplished during the course of the reaction : the C-H bond is broken , the C-Br bond is formed , and the Br-Br bond is broken . <p> When is the C-H bond broken ? That question can be answered by looking for what is called an " isotope effect " . The most common isotope of hydrogen is 1H , or protium , but 2H is also available ; it is called " deuterium " . Deuterium is often represented by the symbol D and protium by the symbol H. Deuterium is twice as heavy as the common protium .

@@71697664 @397664/ <h> Introduction to Chemical Potential <p> We have studied the intermolecular forces involved when single chain amphiphiles and double chain amphiphiles form micelles and bilayers , respectively . To gain a greater insight into the these processes , we need to understand the thermodynamics of micelle and bilayer formation . First we must understand the concept of chemical potential , which is related to the free energy of a reaction . <p> DG , the free energy chance for a reaction , determines the spontaneity and extent of a chemical or physical reaction . The free energy of system depends on 3 variables , T , P , and n , the number of moles of each substance . If the system is composed of two different parts , A and B , the system is at equilibrium ( ? G=0 ) if Ta = Tb , Pa = Pb , and dG/dn for A ( a ) equals b. is the chemical potential of a substance , where a is given as =o +RTlnA . The chemical potential is really the free energy per mole . <p> Expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of G and are T , P , and n , we can write : <p> dG = ( G/T ) P , n + ( G/P ) T , n + ( G/n ) P , T <p> where ( G/x ) y , z is the derivative ( partial ) of G with respect to x at constant y and z .

Ho - T ? Sois analogous to ? o = ? Ho - T ? So <p> ? Go = - RTlnKeq is analogous to ? o = - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , let 's consider the thermodynamics of micelle formation , based on the equation below : <p> n SCA &lt;==&gt; 1 micelle <p> where SCA represents a single chain amphiphile . At first glance we might suspect that : <p> ? Ho&lt; 0 since the van der Waals interactions among the buried acyl chains in the micelle would be much more favorable than the water - acyl chain interactions for the monomeric amphiphile in solution . This notion is supported by our aphorism , " like dissolves like " . Of course , we could n't ignore polar interactions ( H bonding for example ) among the head groups and water , but we might expect these to be equally favorable in both the monomeric and micellular states . <p> ? So&lt; 0 since we are forming a state ( a single micelle ) with much less positional entropy from a state ( single chains amphiphiles dispersed in solution ) with much more positional entropy . <p> Hence it would appear that micelle formation is enthalpically favored but entropically disfavored . Let 's examine this issue more closely . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should give us a clue as to where a SCA would " want " to be in this mixture . Remember , ? o depends only on the relative stability of a molecule in a given environment and not its concentration . <p> Traube , in 1891 , noticed that single chain amphiphiles tend to migrate to the surface of water and decrease its surface tension ( ST . ) He observed that the decrease in ST is directly proportional to the amount of amphiphile , added up until a certain point , at which added amphiphile has no additional effect . In other words , the response of ST saturates at some point . <p> We are more interested in what happens to amphiphiles in bulk water , not at the surface . As we mentioned earlier , monomeric single chain amphiphiles are in equilibrium with single chain amphiphiles in micelles . Assume you have a way to measure monomeric single chain amphiphile in solution . What happens to its concentration as you add more and more SCA to the mixture ? Turns out you observe the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This explanation goes like this : as more amphiphile is added , more goes into bulk solution as monomers . At some point , there are enough amphiphiles added to form micelles . After this point , added amphiphiles forms more micelles and no further increases in monomeric single chain amphiphile are noted . The concentration of amphiphile at which this occurs is the critical micelle concentration ( CMC ) . <p> measure the amount of NaCl(aq) in solution as more NaCl(s) is added to water . At some point , the water is saturated with dissolved NaCl , and no further increase in NaCl ( aq ) occurs . <p> measure the amount of a sparing soluble hydrocarbon ( HC ) into water . After saturation , phase separation occurs . <p> Consider the example of adding a great excess of NaCl(s) to water . At the very time the salt is added , the system is clearly not in equilibrium . Therefore , ? &lt; 0 . Write the reaction as follows : NaCl(s) ------------&gt; NaCl ( aq ) . Let x stand for NaCl . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ln x(aq) - ( o x(s) + RT ln x(s) ) <p> In this equation , all terms are constant except RT ln x(aq) , since all the ? o values are constant , independent of concentration . Remember , RTln x(s) is constant since the concentration of a solid is constant . With time , ? becomes less negative , until the system reaches equilibrium , and ? = 0 . The term RT ln x(aq) becomes more positive since the x(aq) is increasing . When x(aq) = x(s) , no further NaCl dissolves . Remember , a condition for equilibrium is a = b . <p> Now consider the addition of a drop of a slightly soluble hydrocarbon ( HC ) into water , as pictured in the diagram below . At t=0 , the system is not at equilibrium and some of the HC will transfer from the pure liquid to water , so at time t=0 , ? &lt; 0 . <p> Figure : ? for transfer of a sparingly soluble liquid solute into water <p> Now add a bit more complexity to the last example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water and octanol . At t = 0 , the system is not at equilibrium . A simple favorable reaction can be written for this system x aq -------&gt; x oct . Clearly , ? &lt; 0 . Also , ? o &lt; 0 , since this term is independent of concentration and depends only on the intrinsic stability of x in water in comparison to that of octanol . The following equation holds as well : <p> Most of the time , we will be interested in ? o , which depends only on the relative stability , in this case , of x in octanol vs water . Clearly , in this case , ? o &lt; 0 . At equilibrium ? = 0 . By setting the last equation equal to 0 , we can see that <p> ? o = - RT ln ( x(oct)/x(aq) ) <p> where the concentration are equilibrium concentrations . We can rewrite this equation as <p> ? o = - RT ln Keq <p> where Keq is the equilibrium partition coefficient for X in octanol and water . This can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separatory flask with a biphasic system of octanol and water after injecting a bit of X. Then separate the layers and determine the concentration of x in each phase . Plug these numbers into the last equation . Remember , you should be able to predict the sign and relative magnitude of ? o since it does not depend on concentration , but only on the intrinsic stability of the molecules in the different environments . <h> Introduction to the Hydrophobic Effect <p> Now we can apply our understanding of ? o to the formation of micelles and bilayers . Remember , ? o = ? Ho - T ? So .. <p> ? o = ox(HC) - ox(aq) , which should be less than 0 . In each graph , ? o is less than 0 , and the value of ? o decreases ( gets more negative ) in a linear fashion with increasing numbers of C in the alkyl chain . Notice the lines are unbelievably straight and parallel . Nature is speaking to us in these figures . By figuring out the surface area of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CH2 ( methylene group ) , one can calculate that the ? o decreases by 25 cal/sq. angstrom of hydrocarbon chain added . <p> Figure : Standard free energy of transfer of HC from aqeuous solution to a pure liquid hydrocarbon . <p> We expected that ? o for the transfer of x to a pure liquid HC would be negative . The same is true for the transfer of aliphatic alcohols and fatty acids , both single chain amphiphiles , to organic solvents , as shown in the figure linked below . We could get more information if we would determine the entropic and enthalpic contributions . Such data is presented in the table below , which shows the transfer of single chain alcohols from the pure liquid to water ( the opposite of the previous figures . ) We expect the ? o to be greater than 0 for these cases , since it should be disfavored . What is perplexing about this data is not that it is disfavored , but that the process is enthalpically favored . This seems to be counterintuitive since it goes against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed earlier . From an enthalpic point of view , the amphiphiles prefer ( albeit marginally ) to be in water . What makes this reaction disfavored is entropy . The data shows that the aliphatic chains would prefer not to be in water because it is disfavored entropically . This seems to go against our notion from above that when single chain amphiphiles form micelles , it should be entropically disfavored . This chart shows us the if we were to take a single chain amphiphile from water into a micelle , ( again the opposite of the direction used in this chart ) , that the entropy would be positive , and hence be favored ! <p> Figure : Transfer of Aliphatic Alcohols and Fatty Acids from Water to Pure Liquid ; Thermodynamic Parameters for Transfer of Aliphatic Alcohols From the Pure Liquid to Water . <p> The table below shows the thermodynamic parameters for transfer of HC from water into the interior of sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) micelles and from water to a pure HC liquid . Both of these processes are favored , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favors the process of a HC transferring from water into a micelle ( which models at least part of micelle formation ) is entropy not enthalpy . Enthalpy disfavors this process or , at minimum , is neutral . <p> How can we explain this counter-intuitive favorable entropic process . Again , at first glance it seems that entropy should disfavor micelle formation , since a single multimolecular aggregate of lower positional entropy ( fewer possible microstates for amphiphile dispersal ) is formed from many SCA . However , this is only part of the process . What we have n't considered is the entropy of water . To place a HC in water , a literal cavity in the water must be created that will accommodate the HC . Creation of this more ordered cavity must be entropically disfavored ( again because the process proceeds to a state with fewer microstates and lower positional entropy ) . Now transferring the HC from water to a micelle will dissipate the cavity , and lead to more available microstates for the released solvent , bulk water . It is this entropic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this scenario . When you place a HC group in water , water still wants to maintain its hydrogen bonding . Hence it is forced into a more ordered structure around the HC to maintain its H-bonding , characterized by fewer microstates .

Again , this goes against our adage of " like dissolves like " . The negative DH suggests interactions among all the participants are more favorable when the nonpolar group is in water . One source of such interactions could be the highly structured water in the " cage " that surrounds the nonpolar molecule . If it were more structured than bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the formation of these extra H-bonds would contribute to the negative enthalpy change . When the nonpolar molecule is removed from the water , a process which proceeds with a positive ?

Heat energy must be supplied to break the H-bonds as ice changes state to liquid water .

They kept living in difficulties without any complaints since they strongly believed that God would hear and see them from the Heaven soon . Every day , the King 's soldiers came to all villages and houses to plunder almost everything that the families worked all days and nights to earn .

Without any concern and consideration , his son immediately accepted that offer and asked when he needed to get ready for this mission , although his father was quite worried for his son 's safety . Since it was his first mission on the earth , he was quite worried whether he could succeed or not .

However , when she tried to sit up , she felt something strange on her stomach .

She was so frightened that she did not why and how come her stomach got bigger after a day . People in a town also looked at her with a big surprise and had the same question as she did .

Opposite to what people guessed , after 9 months and 10 days , she actually gave birth to a little boy . The day he was born , the sky changed color from blue to dark and lightning appeared so many times . This was a sign of Gods to claim the existence of one of the God 's son . Some elder people in the town believed that this kid was not like other kids here . He was very special and was brought with miracles that could change the whole country in the future . No matter what other people said about her and the kid , she did not care ; instead , she was so happy with the fact that she had a kid and was no longer lonely .

Unluckily , in that year , the weather was so dry and hot that all the harvests were almost in danger . On the verge of the cliff , she could not find a way out for both her and her child and cried out for help from the Gods . Surprisingly , while she was crying to Gods , she suddenly heard a voice speaking to her , " Do n't worry . I can grow up strongly and healthily , even though our family was poor . Do n't cry !

" Naturally with a love of a mom , she embraced his son tightly and had a happy smile on her face . Her tears began rolling down on her face . She cried because she was so happy for his son . She cried because her son understood her situation and her love . At that time , a name for her son popped out in her mind . She called him Thanh Giong , which meant a son of Gods .

Bearing that thought in mind , he asked his troops to go there and bring the mom and her son back to him . After 7 days travelling by horses , the King 's troops finally arrived to that town and looked for her family everywhere . By the time the trooped arrived to the town , the child was not a little kid , but he grew up so fast and became a muscular , intelligent , and handsome man in a town . He helped people in town do work and manage almost all the heavy tasks . His mom was very proud of him for being nice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son during a difficulty period . Now it was the time for him to pay back what people had done to his family . When the King 's troops came to find him , the elder people could sense that something bad would happen to Thanh Giong .

In contrary , they showed the troops a longer way to get to his house , so that they would have time to let him know about this unexpected visit from the King . <p> When his mom knew about the bad news , she was so worried about her son 's safety that she wanted to run away and temporarily hid in somewhere , until the King 's troops left the town . However , Thanh Giong did not agree on his mom 's idea ; instead , he knew it was time to stand up and do something to save not only her mom and people in this town , but also the whole country .

In the next morning , when the soldiers came to his house , he was working on the yard behind the house without knowing that there were people coming to visit him . The soldiers came up to him and asked if he was Thanh Giong . He replied them without looking at their faces . After a few questions , as the soldiers were about to get mad at his attitudes , he stopped working and looked up to see all the faces .

Knowing that there was no way to persuade him to stay , she said those final words to him : <p> My son , you have been always a good son to me and nice person to people in the town . I thank Gods for giving me a son like you to live for and work hard for . You have been working hard here and I believe it is time for you to go outside and help the whole country .

After a long day of travelling , he was brought to a nice room to take a rest before meeting with the King the following morning . At night , he could not sleep because he was busy thinking of the way to save this country . As the night passed by and the morning came , he dressed up and got ready to see the King .

However , Thanh Giong turned down the King 's offer immediately without any consideration , even though the King promised to pay him lots of money . Thanh Giong said : <p> I am sorry that I could not listen to you and do as you want me to . I still have old mom at home and lots of housework to finish . I think you should find another person who suited for this position . By the way , are n't you afraid of consequences for those bad things you have done to other people ?

With his power as a son of a God , he easily beat up all the soldiers and walked away . Nevertheless , the King did not stop there . He asked his troops to come to his town and burn down the whole village at night . As a result , when he arrived at his town , he was so surprised with what he was seeing in front of him . A whole town was burnt down and no one was alive . He knew immediately who caused this trouble to his town . After cleaning up the town and burying all dead bodies , he was rushing toward the palace to take revenge for his people in the town .

The History of Oxygen <p> Oxygen may be considered one of the most important element in chemistry . Not counting hydrocarbons , there is a greater diversity of molecules with oxygen than with carbon . Given its role in the molecular world , very little time is spend on the chemistry of oxygen in undergraduate chemistry classes . Why is oxygen so special ? <p> Oxygen reacts with atoms of all elements except the Noble gases to form molecules . One of the most important molecules of course , from a biological sense is water . It : <p> provides a perfect solvent for biomolecules <p> moderates the earths climate <p> is the source of almost all the dioxygen in the air <p> From a chemical point of view , water is a(n) : <p> nucleophile and electrophile <p> acid and base <p> oxidizing agent and reducing agent <p> a protic solvent that can form H-bonds <p> The formation of earth and the development of life : <p> The gaseous and dusty environment from which earth formed contained metals and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ react to form hydrogen gas . H2 reacts with nonmetals ( under various conditions of temperature and pressure ) to form H2S , HCl , CH4 , and NH3 which contributed to the reducing nature of the early atmosphere . This kept the transition metals in their lowest oxidation states . Many metals , including the coinage metals ( Cu , Ag , and Au ) and the platinum group ( Ru , Rh , Pd , Pt ) were stable in elemental form . <p> Then , around 2.7-2.8 billion years ago , photosynthetic organisms ( blue/green algae- also called cyanobacteria ) developed which could oxidize water to form dioxygen . Oxygen was generally unavailable for redox chemistry before then as photosynthesis , the process that would evolve to oxidize water to produce dioxygen , was unavailable . Remember that to oxidize water to dioxygen , itself a strong oxidizing agent , requires a stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen and lots of energy . Fossilized remains of cyanobacteria are found in stromatolites . Using knowledge of how atmospheric oxygen can alter the chemistry of different sulfur isotopes of SO2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the atmosphere as a whole above 1 ppm earlier than 2.4 billion years ago , although there might have been isolated pockets with higher concentrations . After that it rose , presumably as a result of cyanobacteria . Before this time , bacteria oxidized a similar molecule , H2S to form elemental sulfur . It could do this through photosynthetic reduction of CO2 by H2S . It is probable that volcanic gases like H2 might have kept oxygen levels from rising between 2.7 billion year ago and 2.4 billion years ago , when its build-up started . Hydrogen in the form of H2 and methane , probably decreased around 2.4 billion years ago as methane with its hydrogen atoms escaped to the upper atmosphere and space . Methane levels would also be decreased by its easy reaction with dioxygen in the presence of UV light to form CO2 . This would paradoxically lead to a cooling of the earth and pronounced glaciation as a more potent greenhouse gas , methane , was replaced with a less potent one , carbon dioxide . <p> Over the next billion years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present levels of 20% ) Why ? Because the early atmosphere was reducing , the added oxygen combined with a large " sink " of reduced metals ( like elemental Cu and Fe ) or nonmetals ( like C and ammonia ) , preventing a large buildup . Only after these reduced substances were " titrated " did dioxygen build up to present levels . In addition , the oxygen might have increased weathering ( by oxidation ) of sulfur deposits which can lead to sulfides entering the ocean , where they could precipitate ocean iron ions that are necessary for cyanobacterial chemistry . This would place constraints on cyanobacterial growth until dioxygen levels in the atmosphere increased enough so sulfides were converted to sulfates . This first increase in atmospheric oxygen is often called the Great Oxidation Event as it correlated and presumably caused one of the greatest mass extinctions ( of anerobic organisms ) of all time . <p> Around 2.3 billion years ago , as trace dioxygen had accumulated in the atmosphere , redox chemistry changed , although isotope evidence suggest that little dioxgen was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the earth 's atmosphere became somewhat oxygenated , which was also coincident with the development of eukaryotic organisms . Until then , life was restricted to the oceans since there was no ozone to absorb dangerous UV radiation . The buildup of dioxygen in the air must have led to another extinction of anaerobic organisms , since as we shall see , products of oxygen metabolism are very toxic . Some evolved to use dioxygen . Ozone developed , and life could then migrate from the sea to the land . It was n't until around 600 million years ago that animals arose , however . Was this event associated with the development of a fully oxygenated ( 20% ) atmosphere ? Recent evidence , which shows that substantial oxygen was n't available in the deep sea until about 600 million years , seems to suggest that . Based on analysis of iron compounds in waters in Newfoundland , it appears that oxygen was very low in the sea 580 million years ago , during the Gaskiers glaciation period . Immediately after that it rose to levels consistent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals . Similar trends in carbon and sulfur isotopes in marine rocks in Oman also suggest large increases in oxygen at the end of the Gaskiers glaciation period . What caused this second great oxygenation event ? One possibility is that organic matter was sequestered from reaction with atmospheric dioxygen , as clays bound organic molecules in the ocean and lichens and zooplankton facilitated weather and production of insoluble organic material in the oceans . <p> Dioxygen is obviously critically important for higher organisms , so an understanding of its chemistry becomes important . This chapter will show that dioxygen is a ground state diradical that has low solubility in aqueous solution , reacts in a kinetically sluggish fashion in oxidation reaction , and forms toxic byproducts as it gets reduced . Life forms hence evolved ways to deal with these problems , including ways to increase its solubility ( with dioxygen binding and transport proteins ) , and enzymes ( that could activate it kinetically and also detoxify oxygen by-products ) . Dioxygen is toxic to many cells . Obligate aerobes die in an oxygen environment as many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several strains of bacteria actually swim away from high levels of dioxygen . A graph showing log of survival vs log pO2 is linear with a negative slope for a variety of organisms , including mice , fish , rats , rabbits , and insects . Pure oxygen can induce chest soreness , coughs , and sore throats in people . Premature infants put in pure dioxygen environments often developed blindness due to retrolental fibroplasia ( a build-up of fibrous tissue behind the lens ) . The trade off for this toxicity is clear . Energy is derived from organic molecule through oxidation . Before dioxygen became available to power aerobic catabolism of reduced molecules like fatty acids and the less reduced sugars , such molecules were only partially oxidized . The glycolytic pathway , found in most organisms , oxidizes glucose ( 6 Cs ) to two molecules of pyruvate ( 3 Cs ) . It was only with the availability of dioxygen did pathways evolve ( Kreb Cycle , mitochondrial electron transport/oxidative phosphorylation ) that allowed pyruvate to be fully oxidized to carbon dioxide , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Properties of Dioxygen <p> It is important to understand the properties of dioxygen since oxidation reactions using it power not only our bodies but our entire civilization . We will obviously concentrate on biological reactions , but even these show the same characteristics as non-biological ones . <p> oxidation of organic molecules by oxygen is thermodynamically favored but kinetically slow . <p> pure oxygen environments are toxic to cells and organisms . <p> First we will try to understand these properties of oxygen , and then we will see how organisms overcome these problem to use dioxygen . <p> We can understand both of these properties by looking at the molecular orbitals of oxygen and its reduction products as shown in the diagrams below . Ground state oxygen is a diradical , which explains the paramagnetic behavior of oxygen . The two unpaired oxygens each have a spin state of 1/2 for a total resultant spin S of 1 , making ground state oxygen a triplet ( 2S+1 ) = 3 . Organic molecules typically undergo 2 electron oxidation steps . Consider the stepwise oxidation of methane below . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in methanol , 0 in formaldehyde , +2 in formic acid , and finally +4 in carbon dioxide , indicating two electron losses in each step . <p> The two electrons lost by the organic substrate are added to oxygen , but since the two lost electrons are spin paired , a spin flip must occur to allow the electrons to enter the unfilled oxygen orbitals . Alternatively , energy can be put into ground state dioxygen to produce excited state singlet oxygen ( S=0 , 2S+1 = 1 ) . The source of the large activation energy required ( about 25 kcal or 105 kJ/mol ) to flip the electron spin accounts for the kinetic sluggishness of reactions of dioxygen with organic reactants . <p> A traditional Lewis structure for ground state dioxygen can not be easily written since the electrons are added in pairs , and dioxygen is a diradical . There are 6 electrons in the sigma molecular orbitals from second shell electrons ( two each in -2s , -2s* , and -2p , ) and 6 electrons in the pi molecular orbitals from second shell electrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one electron each in two different -2p* ) , so the net number of electrons in bonding orbitals is 4 , giving a bond order ( or number of 2 ) . In contrast it is easy to write the Lewis structure of singlet , excited state oxygen , since all electrons can be viewed as paired , with two net bonds ( 1 sigma , 1 pi ) connecting the atoms of oxygen . This Lewis structure will be used to represent singlet , excited oxygen , which should react more quickly with organic molecules . The excited state single on the far right ( below ) is unstable and decays to the middle singlet state . The middle state is approximately 94.3 kJ/mol higher in energy than the ground state triplet ( on the left ) . In quantum mechanical parlance , the transition from the ground state triplet to the singlet state is forbidden for a number of reasons , making it unlikely that absorption of a photon will induce the transition . <p> The Reductions of Dioxygen <p> When oxygen oxidizes organic molecules , it itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the molecular orbitals of ground state dioxygen we produce the step-wise reduction products of oxygen . On the addition of one electron , superoxide is formed . A second electron produces peroxide . Two more produces 2 separated oxides since no bonds connect the atoms ( the number of electrons in antibonding and bonding orbitals are identical ) . Each of these species can react with protons to produce species such as HO2 , H2O2 ( hydrogen peroxide ) and H2O . It is the first two reactive reduction products of dioxygen that make it potentially toxic . <p> How are the potential problems in oxygen chemistry dealt with biologically ? <p> Kinetic sluggishness : Enzymes that utilize dioxgen must activate it in some way , which decreases the activation energy . Enzymes that use dioxygen typically are metalloenzymes , and often heme-containing proteins . Since metals such as Fe2+ and Cu2+ are themselves free radicals ( i.e. they have unpaired electons ) , they react readily with ground state oxygen which itself is a radical . The molecular orbitals of the metal and oxygen combine to produce new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Likewise , dioxygen reacts more readily with organic molecules which can themselves form reasonably stable free radicals , such as flavin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD ) , as we shall see later . <p> Dioxygen toxicity : Since toxicity arises from the reduction products of oxygen , enzymes that use oxygen have evolved to bind oxygen and its reduction products tightly ( through metal-oxygen bonds ) so they are not released into the cells where they can cause damage . In addition , enzymes which detoxify free dioxygen reduction products are widely found in nature . For example : <p> It can be made from triplet oxygen by photoexcitation . Alternatively , it can be made from triplet oxygen through collision with an excited molecule which relaxes to the ground state after a radiationless transfer of energy to triplet oxygen to form reactive singlet oxygen . ( This later process accounts for photobleaching of colored clothes when the conjugated dye molecules absorb UV and Vis light , relax by transferring energy to triplet oxygen to form singlet oxygen , which then chemically reacts with the conjugated double bonds in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydroperoxides , potentially through a epoxide intermediate <p> Dienes reacts with oxygen in a Diels-Alder like reaction to form endoperoxides <p> In contrast to dioxygen which contains multiple bonds between the O atoms , peroxide has only one bond . In fact , it is quite weak and requires only 38 kcal/mol to break it . Remember , bonds can be broken in a heterolytic way ( both electrons in a bond go to one of the atoms , or in a homolytic fashion , in which the one electron goes to each atom . <p> As mentioned above this species is extremely reactive . It will react with any molecule it encounters and does so immediately . It can abstract a H atom leaving another free radical . For example , the hydroxy free radical could extract a hydrogen atom from a polyunsaturated fatty acid to from a carbon-centered radical . A particularly nasty reaction is the insertion of the hydroxy radical into bases in DNA , as shown in the diagram . <h> A4 . Oxidative Modification of Proteins <p> Oxidized levels of proteins ( as evidenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially after age 40 ) . The reactions seem to be catalyzed by metals and may proceed by generation of hydroxy free radicals . Diseases associated with premature aging ( Werner 's Syndrome , another link to Werner 's Syndrome , Progeria ) show very high levels of oxidized proteins at an early age . Fibroblasts from 10 yr. old children with progeria have levels of oxidized proteins usually not seen until the age of 70 . Beta amyloid protein deposits ( found in Alzheimer 's and Down 's Syndrome ) cause neurotoxicity and death , partly by increasing superoxide production by endothelial cells , causing **25;833;TOOLONG , and ultimately disease progression . Beta amyloid aggreagates appear to increase H2O2 levels , in a process facilitated by Fe2+ and Cu+ . Free radical scavengers ( antioxidants ) help to prevent this damage . Recent studies suggest that vitamin E may delay the symptoms of Alzheimers . <p> Lou Gehrigs Disease ( Amyotrophic Lateral Schlerosis ) is a disease of progressive motor neuron degeneration , which affects 1/100,000 people , and is 10-15% familial . Of the familial cases , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper-zinc enzyme . About 2-3% of ALS patients carry 1 of 60 different dominant mutations in this enzyme . Mutations often decrease the stability of the protein which decreases Zn2+ affinity 5-50 fold . The A4V mutation ( valine at amino acid 4 substituted for Ala ) has the weakest Zn affinity and causes rapid disease progression . In the absence of Zn2+ , the apoprotein somehow seems to induce cell death in neurons . This superoxide dismutase also expresses a second activity . It also acts as a peroxidase which takes ROH + H2O2 to form an RHO ( an aldehyde ) plus water . In some cases , the enzyme retains normal activity against superoxide but altered peroxidase activity . <p> Is your hair going white ? : Wood et al have shown that millimolar concentrations of hydrogren peroxide build up in hairs that have grayed and whitened . This was associated with a decrease in catalase and in increases in Met oxidation ( to Met-sulfoxide ) in proteins , also associated with a decrease in the repair enzyme Met-sulfoxide reductase , Met 374 in the active site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hair follicles , is also damaged , leading to lack of melanin , a pigment necessary for hair coloration and " senile hair graying " . <p> ROS and Protein Folding <p> As discussed in Chapter 2D : Protein Folding in Vitro and in Vivo , the cytoplasm has sufficient concentrations of " +-mercaptoethanol " -like molecules ( used to reduce disulfide bonds in proteins in vitro ) such as glutathione ( +-Glu-Cys-Gly ) and reduced thioredoxin ( with an active site Cys ) to prevent disulfide bond formation in cytoplasmic proteins . Disulfide bonds in proteins are typically found in extracellular proteins , where they serve to keep multisubunit proteins together as they become diluted in the extracellular milieu . These proteins destined for secretion are cotranslationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum ( see below ) which presents an oxidizing environment to the folding protein and where sugars are covalently attached to the folding protein and disulfide bonds are formed ( see Chapter 3D : Glycoproteins - Biosynthesis and Function ) . Protein enzymes involved in disulfide bond formation contain free Cys which form mixed disulfides with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein disulfide isomerases ) have a Cys-XY-Cys motif and can promote disulfide bond formation or their reduction to free sulfhydryls . They are especially redox sensitive since their Cys side chains must cycle between and free disulfide forms . <p> Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) can significantly affect redox chemistry , and if present in excess can place the cell in a condition of " oxidative " stress . ROS can indiscriminately oxidize lipids , nucleic acids , and proteins , but more specifically , they may also oxidize proteins involved in creating and maintaining the normal disulfide bond formation in proteins . As the concentration of ROS increase , the concentration of cytoplasmic proteins with incorrect disulfides should increase . Using a two dimension PAGE system ( first dimension run under nonreducing and the second reducing conditions ) of neural cell proteins derived from cells exposed to normal and differing oxidative conditions ( hydrogen peroxide or decreased intracellular glutathione levels , Cumming et al showed that oxidizing stress increased the levels of disulfide bonds in redox sensitive enzymes and , unexpectedly , among other cytoplasmic proteins involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellular processes , suggesting that disulfide bond formation may have not only a structural but regulatory role . <h> A5 . Oxidative Modification of Lipids : <p> The initial stages of cardiovascular disease appear to involve the development of fatty acid streaks under the artery walls . Macrophages , an immune cell , have receptors which appear to recognize oxidized lipoproteins in the blood , which they take-up . The cells then become fat-containing foam cells which form the streaks . Oxidation of fatty acids in lipoproteins ( possibly by ozone ) could produce lipid peroxides and to protein oxidation in lipoproteins . Cortical neurons from fetal Down 's Syndrome patients show 3-4 times levels of intracellular reactive O2 species and increased levels of lipid peroxidation compared to control neurons . This damage is prevented by treatment of the neurons in culture with free radical scavengers or catalase . <p> A recent study of peroxiredoxins by Neumann et al showed the importance of these gene products in mice . Peroxidredoxins ( which catalyze the conversion of a peroxides and thioredoxin into water and oxidized thioredoxin ) are small proteins with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Transcription of the mammalian peroxiredoxin 1 gene is activated by oxidative stress . They inactivated the gene which produced a mouse that could reproduce and appeared vital , but which had a shortened lifespan . These mice developed severe hemolytic anemia and several types of cancers . High levels of reactive oxygen species and resulting increased levels of oxidized proteins were found in red blood cells of the knockout mice with anemia . High levels of 8-oxoguanine , resulting from oxidative damage to DNA , were found in tumor cells . <h> A6 . Oxidative Modification of DNA <p> Significant evidence suggests oxygen free radicals are linked to aging and diseases . Mutations caused by hydroxylation reactions ( presumably from the generation of hydroxyl free radicals as shown above ) can potentially lead to cancer . Recently it has been shown that mitochondrial DNA is more susceptible to oxidation that is nuclear DNA . Human mitochondria has its own small genome ( 16.5 Kb compared to the nuclear genome of 3 Gb ) which code 13 protein subunits involved in respiration , 22 tRNAs and two ribosomal RNAs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaded an early cell and established a symbiotic relationship with the cell ) . A recent study has shown that there is an inverse correlation of oxidized mitochondrial DNA 8-oxoG with maximal life span of an organism , but this correlation is not seen with nuclear DNA . Presumably the nuclear DNA is somewhat protected from oxidative damage since it is bound to histone proteins ( which form nucleosome core particles with DNA ) and by DNA repair enzymes . DNA repair enzymes that are encoded in the nucleus are found in the mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA is package with mitochondrial transcription factor A ( TFAM ) . Examination of human bladder , head and neck and lung primary tumors reveals a high frequency of mitochondrial DNA mutations . In addition most dioxygen use by the cell occurs in the mitochondria . Hence this organelle probably faces the highest concentration of toxic oxygen reduction products . Recently , the crystal structure of an enzyme , adenine DNA glycosylase ( MutY ) , that repairs 8-oxyG modified DNA has been determined in complex with the oxidatively damaged DNA . If not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cytosine , causing a GC to AT mutation on DNA replication . <p> Although oxidative damage in mitochondria clearly can promote premature aging , other independent mechanisms may also . In a recent study , Kujoth et al . developed a mouse model that expressed a mutant form of mitochondrial DNA polymerase that was defective in the proofreading activity of the enzyme . These mice displayed premature aging but showed no increased levels of oxidized mitochondrial lipids or hydroxylated G residues in mitochondrial DNA . They did show significant activation of a cytosolic enzyme called caspase-3 , which when active lead to the programmed death of cells ( a process called apoptosis ) . This calcium-activated aspartic acid proteases ( with an active site Asp ) is activated by binding mitochondrial cytochrome C that has " leaked " into the cytoplasm from its normal location in the intermembrane space in mitochondria . The process is usually associated with DNA damage ( mutations , fragmentation ) that would arise if the proofreading function of DNA polymerase was defective . This was indeed found in these mice . <p> Oxidative damage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather might be a secondary effect of other initiating events . . Reversing or preventing oxidative damage might slow the progression of aging and disease . Aging is a complex feature of organisms and would be expected to have complex causes and biological effects . At the organismal level , aging has been studied in the round worm C. elegans which lives for only a few weeks . Genetic analyses can be easily used to find gene alterations associated with premature aging . One hormonal system that has recently been associated with aging in eukaryotes ( and in C. elegans ) involves the signaling pathways for insulin and insulin growth factor I ( IGF-1 ) , which regulate carbohydrate , lipid , and reproductive pathways in C. elegans . Mutations that decrease signaling from this pathway increase C. elegans life span . These mutations lead to increased activity of the DAF16 transcription factor , which upregulates the expression of many genes . In contrast , wild type organisms , when exposed to insulin or IGF-1 , decrease the activity of DAF16 . Using DNA microarrays , investigators determined which DAF16-controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the organism . These genes included , among others , peroxisomal and cytosolic catalase , Mn-superoxide dismutase , cytochrome P450s , metallothionein-related Cd-binding protein , and heat shock proteins . We will investigate the function of several of these gene products in the next section , but needless to say , they are all involved in cellular responses to stress , often involving dioxygen metabolites . Over expression of mitochondrial catalase in mice increased their lifespan by 20% . It has also been showed that decreased levels of insulin-like growth factor also promote longevity in mice , indicating again that mechanisms in addition to oxidative damage by ROS are involved in aging . <h> A7 . Biological Uses for Reactive Oxygen Species - ROS <p> ROS can be used in the body as defense mechanisms . The can be generated by immune cells that phagocytize ( engulf ) bacteria and other foreign substances . After uptake , these immune cells undergo an oxidative burst , increasing the amount of dioxygen that they consume , leading to production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide which can be used to kill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go even farther . They demonstrated that antibody molecules ( protein which bind to foreign molecules and target them for clearance or further immune response ) can also generate ROS when they bind to their target . Such an outcome was totally unexpected , but not inconsistent with the observation that antibodies can have catalytic activity if made against transition state analogs of substrates . Over 100 different antibodies were found to generate hydrogen peroxide through the reaction of singlet oxygen ( possibly generated by phagocytotic neutrophils during oxidative bursts ) with water to form H2O2 . ( We have previously discussed the idea that singlet O2 can be generated from ground state O2 by excitation through UV light or through collisional activation with an excited state chromophore - a conjugated alkene or aromatic molecule ) . They postulate the following reaction to form hydrogen peroxide . The oxygen in the peroxide comes from water , as shown by labeling water with 18O : <p> 2H2O + 1O2 ( singlet oxygen ) --&gt; H2O3 + H2O --&gt; H2O2 + ? <p> Antibodies show this effect to a much greater extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of energy , the rate of production of H2O2 was linear with time , but decreased from the initial rate as H2O2 concentrations increased . If it was removed with catalase , the initial rate returned to normal , suggesting that H2O2 was a product inhibitor of the reaction . The reactions also saturated with dioxygen as well . The maximal wavelength of UV irradiation to produce H2O2 was identical to the maximal wavelength of absorbance for tryptophan in the protein . The excited state tryptophan presumably deexcites by energy transfer to triplet dioxygen ( 3O2 ) in much the manner described earlier for photobleaching . A significant source of electrons needed to be found to account for the production of so much H2O2 which if it was made from singlet oxygen would require 2 electrons for each H2O2 . These numbers of electrons could not come from photooxidation of aromatic amino acids in the protein . Hence they theorized that water would add as a nucleophile to the singlet oxygen , providing the source of electrons required to make H2O2 . This reactions would go through the H2O3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the same team discovered that antibodies can not only produce H2O2 but also ozone . O3 is used in killing pathogens but also might lead to inflammation . In their previous work described above , they generated singlet oxygen in a " non-physiological " way - through UV irradiation of the antibodies . They also did n't show that the ROS produced can kill bacteria without any other immune mediators . They used a new singlet oxygen generating system which led to insufficient peroxide formation to account for the extensive killing of E. Coli that they observed ( 95% ) . This led them to look for the generation of a more potent oxidizing agent - which they believe is consistent with the formation of ozone . They also showed that neutrophils were the source of the required singlet oxygen as described above . <p> In an additional study ( Dec 02 ) , the showed that antibodies in the presence of singlet oxygen and in the absence of immune cells or other immune proteins ( like complement proteins ) can " destroy antigenic target " . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing by neutrophils ( which produce singlet oxygen ) and in inflammatory states . Signaling through ozone might amplify other immune molecules that signal the activation ( or hyperactivation ) of the immune system . <p> In a subsequent study ( Nov. 03 ) they examined the involvement of ozone ( generated from antibodies in the presence of singlet O2 from neutrophils ) in the oxidation of lipoproteins , a process which has been associated with atherosclerosis in coronary arteries . First they tested if ozone could be generated by atherosclerotic lesions treated with phorbol myristate acetate . 14/15 plaques produced ozone , as evidenced by the photobleaching of the dye indigo carmen to isatin sulfonic acid . This conversion , known to be specific for ozone , is shown below . <p> They then looked for the telltale signature of the reaction of ozone with plaque cholesterol ( cleavage of the + " 5,6 double bond to form 5,6-secosterol as shown below and found it . This reaction is known not to occur with other oxygen oxidants , including both triplet and singlet oxygen , superoxide , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product was also produced . They named these new products atheronals . <p> Significant increases in secosterol was found in plaques treated with the phorbal ester. 6 of 8 patients with atherosclerosis had elevated plasma levels of the secosterol , while only 1 of 15 of control patients did . They also showed that these ozone products caused normal macrophages to fill with cholesterol ( presumably from oxidized LDL ) , and that the structure of the LDL apoprotein B100 changed . These findings might provide a link between the immune system and cholesterol in the generation of cardiovascular disease . <h> A8 . Just Say NO - The Chemistry of Nitric Oxide <p> In the last decade , the role of another gaseous free radical , nitric oxide ( . NO ) has become apparent . This molecule is synthesized biologically through the action of an inducible heme enzyme , nitric oxide synthase , which forms NO by the oxidation by dioxygen of the guanidino group of Arg , which gets converted to citrulline . .

Under low dioxygen concentrations , a family of protein transcription factors called hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) become activated . The functional proteins appears to be a dimer of HIF-+ and HIF-+ . In contrast to the concentration of the beta form , the activity of HIF-+ is increased under low dioxygen concentrations .

@@71697684 @397684/ <p> The mechanism of electrophilic aromatic substitution follows two elementary steps . First , donation of a pair of p electrons to the electrophile results in a loss of aromaticity and formation of a cation . Second , removal of a proton from that cation restores aromaticity . <p> How does the electrophile form in the first place ? The details of that part of the reaction vary from case to case . With the catalysed bromine reaction , the Lewis acid activates the halogen to render it more electrophilic . The activation may even go so far as to form a bromine cation , as suggested earlier . Otherwise , the positive charge on the bromine atom that ligates the Lewis acid can be nullified , indirectly , when the arene donates to the terminal bromine atom . <p> The appearance of a bromide ion to deprotonate the cation simply results fom the equilibrium of the Lewis acid-base complex . <p> Problem AR3.1 . <p> Show the mechanism for chlorination of benzene in the presence of ferric chloride . <p> The reactions of alkyl and acyl halides also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AlCl3 ) is employed . These two reactions are called Friedel-Crafts reactions after the French and American co-discoverers of the reaction . Typically , Friedel-Crafts reactions are believed to occur through initial formation of cationic electrophiles , which then react with aromatics in the same way as halogen electrophiles . <p> The alkyl cation is a potent electrophile . It is able to temporarily disrupt the aromaticity of the aromatic ring , forming an arenium ion . <p> The arenium ion intermediate is probably deprotonated by halide ion ; some amount of these ions would be in equilibrium with the Lewis acid-base adduct . <p> Because Friedel-Crafts alkylations occur via alkyl cations , the reactions of primary alkyl halides are generally pretty slow . Those cations just are n't stable enough to form . Although it sometimes seems like formation of a stable intermediate would slow things down , because it would not be motivasted to react further , usually the reverse is true . Because an intermediate is at high energy , it is inherently difficult to form in the first place . This difficulty acts as a blockade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very easily . <p> Forming the intermediate more easily , therefore , allows the reaction to proceed more quickly . For example , the tert-butyl cation is relatively stable , so that intermediate is formed relatively easily . Alkylation of aromatics rings with tertiary alkyl halides is especially easy to accomplish . <p> It is worth noting that in some cases , multiple products may result via rearrangements . These observations provide additional evidence for the cationic nature of the intermediate . <p> Problem AR3.2 . <p> Show the mechanism for the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with 2-chloropropane in the presence of aluminum chloride . <p> Problem AR3.3 . <p> Why is the Friedel-Crafts reaction of 1-chloropropane so much slower than the reaction of 2-chloropropane ?

Amino Acid Analysis and Chemical Sequencing <p> As described in the Introduction to Proteins , we can understand proteins structure at varying level of complexity . <p> Figure : Protein Analysis from low to high resolution . <p> In the last chapter section , we learned about the charge and chemical reactivity properties of isolated amino acids and amino acids in proteins . The analysis of a whole protein is complicated since each different amino acid might be represented many times in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid and secondary structure . Some proteins exists biologically as multisubunit proteins , which adds to the complexity of the analyses since now the proteins would have multiple N- and C-terminal ends . In addition , isolated proteins might have chemically modifications ( post-translational ) which add to the functionalities of the proteins but also add to the complexities of the analyses . To illustrate some of these issues , view the structure of the RhoA program below . <p> At a low level of resolution , we can determine the amino acid composition of the protein by hydrolyzing the protein in 6 N HCl , 100oC , under vacuum for various time intervals . After removing the HCl , the hydrolysate is applied to an ion-exchange or hydrophobic interaction column , and the amino acids eluted and quantitated with respect to known standards . A non naturally- occurring amino acid like norleucine is added in known amounts as an internal standard to monitor quantitative recovery during the reactions . The separated amino acids are often derivitized with ninhydrin or phenylisothiocyantate to facilitate their detection . The reaction is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , since amino acids with OH ( like ser ) are destroyed . A time course allows the concentration of Ser at time t=0 to be extrapolated . Trp is also destroyed during the process . In addition , the amide links in the side chains of Gln and Asn are hydrolyzed to form Glu and Asp , respectively . <p> The amino acid composition does not give the sequence of the protein . The N-terminus of the protein can be determined by reacting the protein with fluorodinitrobenzene ( FDNB ) or dansyl chloride , which reacts with any free amine in the protein , including the epsilon amino group of lysine . The amino group of the protein is linked to the aromatic ring of the DNB through an amine and to the dansyl group by a sulfonamide , and are hence stable to hydrolysis . The protein is hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl , and the amino acids separated by TLC or HPLC . Two spots should result if the protein was a single chain , with some Lys residues . The labeled amino acid other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid can be determined by addition of carboxypeptidases , enzymes which cleave amino acids from the C-terminal . A time course must be done to see which amino acid is released first . N-terminal analysis can also be done as part of sequencing the entire protein as discussed below ( Edman degradation reaction ) . <p> Analysis for Specific Amino Acids <p> Aromatic amino acids can be detected by their characteristic absorbance profiles . Amino acids with specific functional groups can be determined by chemical reactions with specific modifying groups , as shown in section 2A . <p> Figure : amino acid absorbance profiles <p> Amino Acid Sequence - Edman Degradation <p> Two methods exist to determine the entire sequence of a protein . In one , the protein is sequenced ; in the other , the DNA encoding the protein is sequenced , from which the amino acid sequence can be derived . The actually protein can be sequenced by automated , sequential Edman Degradation . <p> Figure : Edman Degradation <p> In this technique , a protein adsorbed to a solid phase reacts with phenylisothiocyanate . An intramolecular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can be washed from the adsorbed protein and detected by HPLC analysis . The yields in this technique are close to 100% . However , with time , more chains accumulate in which an N-terminal amino acid has not been removed . If it is removed on the next step , two amino acids will elute , creating increasing " noise " in the elution step - i.e. more than 1 amino acid derivative will be detected . Hence the maximal length of the peptide which can be sequenced is about 50 amino acids . Most proteins are larger than that . Hence , before the protein can be sequenced , it must be cleaved with specific enzymes called endoproteases which cleave proteins after specific side chains . For example , trypsin cleaves proteins within a chain after Lys and Arg , while chymotrypsin cleaves after aromatic amino acids , like Trp , Tyr , and Phe . Chemical cleavage by small molecules can be used as well . Cyanogen bromide , CNBr , cleaves proteins after methionine side chains . The individual proteins must be cleaved using two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the order of the cleaved peptides with known sequence can be pieced together by comparing the peptide sequences obtained using different cleavage methods . Many proteins also have disulfide bonds connecting Cys side chains distal to each other in the polypeptide chain . Proteolytic or chemical cleavage of the protein would lead to the formation of a fragment containing two peptides linked by disulfides . Edman degration would release two amino acids from such fragments . To avoid this problem , the protein is oxidized with performic acid , which irreversibly oxidizes free Cys , or Cys-Cys disulfides to cysteic acid residues . A summary of the steps involved in protein sequencing are shown below : <p> PROTEIN SEQUENCING STRATEGY - 8 STEPS <p> If the protein contains more than one polypeptide chain , the chains are separated and purified . If disulfide bonds connect two different chains , the S-S bond must be cleaved ( as described in step 2 ) and each peptide independently purified . <p> Each polypeptide chain is cleaved into smaller fragments , and the amino acid composition and sequence of each fragment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different cleavage procedure to generate a different and overlapping set of peptide fragments . <p> The overall amino acid sequence of the protein is reconstructed from the sequences in overlapping fragments . <p> The position of the S-S is located .

Sequence Determination Using Mass Spectrometry <p> Mass spectrometry is supplanting more tradition methods ( see above ) as the choice to determine the molecular mass and structure of a protein . Its power comes from its exquisite sensitivity and modern computational methods to determine structure through comparisons of ion fragment data with computer databases of known protein structures . In mass spectrometry , a molecule is first ionized in an ion source . The charged particles are then accelerated by an electric field into a mass analyzer where they are subjected to an external magnetic field . The external magnetic field interacts with the magnetic field arising from the movement of the charged particles , causing them to deflect . The deflection is proportional to the mass to charge ratio , m/z .

The most common methods for protein/peptide analyzes are electrospray ionization ( ESI ) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization ( MALDI ) . <p> Electrospray ionization ( ESI ) - The analyte , dissolved in a volatile solvent like methanol or acetonitrile , is injected through a fine stainless steel capillary at a slow flow rate into the ion source . A high voltage ( 3-4 kV ) is maintained on the capillary giving it a positive charge with respect to the other oppositely charged electrode . The flowing liquid becomes charged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The high field leads to the emergence of the sample as a charged aerosol spray of charged microdrops which reduces electrostatic repulsions in the liquid . This method essentially uses electrical energy to produce the aerosol instead of mechanical energy to produce a liquid aerosol , as in the case of a perfume atomizer . Surrounding the capillary is a flowing gas ( nitrogen ) which helps to move the aerosol towards the mass analyzer . The microdrops become smaller in size as the volatile solvent evaporates , increasing the positive charge density on the drops . Eventually electrostatic repulsions cause the drops to explode in a series of steps , ultimately producing analyte devoid of solvent . This gentle method of ionization produces analytes that are not cleaved but ready for introduction into the mass analyzer . Protein emerge from this process with a roughly Gaussian distribution of positive charges on basic side chains . In organic chemistry you studied mass spectrums of small molecules induced by electron bombardment . This produces ions of +1 charge as an electron is stripped away from the neutral molecule . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or M+ ion . The highest m/z ratio detectable in the mass spectrum is in the thousands . However , large peptides and proteins with large molecular masses can be detected and resolved since the charge on the ions are great than +1 . In 2002 , John Fenn was awarded a Noble Prize in Chemistry for the development and use of ESI to study biological molecules . <p> An example of an ESI spectrum of apo-myoglobin is shown below . Note the roughly Gaussian distribution of the peaks , each of which represents the intact protein with charges differing by +1 . Protein have positive charges by virtue of both protonation of amino acid side chains as well as charges induced during the electrostray process itself . Based on the amino acid sequence of myoglobin and the assumption that the pKa of the side chains are the same in the protein as for isolated amino acids , the calculated average net charges of apoMb would be approximately +30 at pH 3.5 , +20 at pH 4.5 , +9 at pH 6 , and 0 at pH 7.8 ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by direct injection into the MS of apoMb in 0.1% formic acid ( pH 2.8 ) . Charges on the peptide are a combined results of charges present on the peptide before the electrospray and changes in charges induced during the process . LONG ... . <p> The molecular mass of the protein can be determined by analyzing two adjacent peaks , as shown in the figure below . <p> If M is the molecular mass of the analyte protein , and n is the number of positive charges on the protein represented in a given m/z peak , then the following equations gives the molecular mass M of the protein for each peak : <p> Mpeak2 = n(m/z)peak 2 - n(1.008) <p> Mpeak1 = ( n + 1 ) ( m/z ) peak 1 - ( n +1 ) ( 1.008 ) <p> where 1.008 is the atomic weight of H. Since there is only one value of M , the two equations can be set equal to each other , giving : <p> n(m/z)peak 2 - n(1.008) = ( n + 1 ) ( m/z ) peak 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for n gives : <p> n = ( m/z ) peak 1- 1.008/ ( m/z ) peak 2 -(m/z)peak 1 . <p> Knowing n , the molecular mass M the protein can be calculated for each m/z peak . The best value of M can then be determined by averaging the M values determined from each peak ( 16,956 from the above figure ) . For peaks from m/z of 893-1542 , the calculated values of n ranged from +18 to +10 . <p> Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization ( MALDI ) : In this technique , used for larger biomolecules like proteins and polysaccharides , the analyte is mixed with an absorbing matrix material . Laser excitation is used to excite the matrix , leading to energy transfer that results in ionization and " launching " of the matrix and analyte in ion form from the solid mixture . Parent ion peaks of ( M+H ) + and ( M-H ) - are formed . <p> Mass Analyzer : <p> Quadrupole ion trap ( used in ESI ) - A complex mixture of ions can be contained ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common type are linear and 3D quadrupoles . <p> As dipoles display positive and negative charge separation on a linear axis , quadrupoles have either opposite electrical charges or opposite magnetic fields at the opposing ends of a square or cube . In charge separation , the monopole ( sum of the charges ) and dipoles cancel to zero , but the quadrupole moment does not . The quadrupole traps ions using a combination of fixed and alternating electric fields . The trap contains He at 1 mTorr . For the 3D trap , The ring electrode has a oscillating RF voltage which keeps the ions trapped . The end caps also have an AC voltage . Ions oscillate in the trap with a " secular " frequency determined by the frequency of the RF voltage , and of course , the m/z ratio . By increasing the the amplitude of the RF field across the ring electron , ion motion in the trap becomes destabilized and leads to ion ejection into the detector . When the secular frequency of ion motion matches the applied AC voltage to the endcap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ions increases , also allowing leakage out of the ion trap into the detector . <p> Time of Flight ( TOF ) tube ( used in MALDI ) - a long tubes is used and the time required for ion detection is determined . The small molecular mass ions take the shortest time to reach the detector . <p> Tandem Mass Spectrometry ( MS/MS ) : Quadrupole mass analyzers which can select ions of varying m/z ratios in the ion traps are commonly used in for tandem mass spectrometry ( MS/MS ) . In this technique , the selected ions are further fragmented into smaller ions by a process called collision induced dissociation ( CID ) . When performed on all of the initial ions present in the ion trap , the sequence of a peptide/protein can be determined . This techniques usually requires two mass analyzers with a collision cell in-between where selected ions are fragmented by collision with an inert gas . It can also be done in a single mass analyzer using a quadrupole ion trap . <p> In a typical MS/MS experiment to determine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an enzyme such as trypsin , which cleaves on carboxyl side of positively charge Lys and Arg side chains . The average size of proteins in the human proteome is approximately 50,000 . If the average molecular mass of an amino acid in a protein is around 110 ( 18 subtracted since water is released on amide bond formation ) , the average number of amino acids in the protein would be around 454 . If 10% of the amino acids are Arg and Lys , the on average there would be approximately 50 Lys and Arg , and hence 50 tryptic peptides of average molecular mass of 1000 . The fragments are introduced in the MS where a peptide fragment fingerprint analysis can be performed . The MWs of the fragments can be identified and compared to known peptide digestion fragments from known proteins to identify the analyte protein . <p> To get sequence information , a tryptic peptide with a specific m/z ratio ( optimally with a single +1 charge ) is further selected in the ion trap and fragmented on collision with an inert agent ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the thousands , tryptic fragments with a single charge can easily be detected and targeted for MS/MS . The likely and observed cleavages for a tetrapeptide and the resulting ions with a +1 charge are illustrated below . Ions with the original N terminus are denoted as a , b , and c , while ions with the original C terminus are denoted as x , y , and z. c and y ions gain an extra proton from the peptide to form positively charged -NH3+ groups . The actual ions observed depend on many factors including the sequence of the peptide , its original charge , the energy of the collision inducing the fragmentation , etc . Low energy fragmentation of peptides in ion traps usually produce a , b , and y ions , along with peaks resulting from loss of NH3 ( a* , b* and y* ) or H2O ( ao , bo and yo ) . No peaks resulting from fragmentation of side chains are observed . Fragmentation at two sites in the peptide ( usually at b and y sites in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak represents the C-terminal Lys or Arg ( in this example ) of the tryptic peptide . Peak y2 has one addition amino acid compared to y1 and the molecular mass difference identifies the extra amino acid . Peak y3 is likewise one amino acid larger than y2 . All three y fragments peaks have a common Lys/Arg C-terminal and the charged fragment contains the C-terminal end of the original peptide . All b fragment peaks for a given peptide contain a common N terminal amino acid with b1 the smallest . Note that the subscript represents the number of amino acids in the fragment . By identifying b and y peaks the actual sequence of small peptide can be determined . Usually spectra are match to databases to identify the structure of each peptide and ultimately that of the protein . The actual m values for fragments can be calculated as follows , where ( N is the molecular mass of the neutral N terminal group , ( C ) is the molecular mass of the neutral c terminal group , and ( M ) is the molecule mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N ) + ( M ) -CHO <p> b : ( N ) + ( M ) <p> y : ( C ) + ( M ) +H ( note in the figure above that the amino terminus of the y peptides has an extra proton in the +1 charged peptides . ) <p> m/z values can be calculated from the calculated m values and by adding the one H mass to the overall z if the overall charge is +1 , etc . <p> Table : Masses of amino acid residues in a protein . <p> ( For N terminal amino acid , add 1 H. for C terminus add OH ) <p> Residue <p> Code <p> Monoisotopic Mass <p> Average Mass <p> Ala <p> A <p> 71.03714 <p> 71.0779 <p> Arg <p> R <p> 156.101111 <p> 156.1857 <p> Asn <p> N <p> 114.042927 <p> 114.1026 <p> Asp <p> D <p> 115.026943 <p> 115.0874 <p> Cys <p> C <p> 103.009185 <p> 103.1429 <p> Glu <p> E <p> 129.042593 <p> 129.114 <p> Gln <p> Q <p> 128.058578 <p> 128.1292 <p> Gly <p> G <p> 57.021464 <p> 57.0513 <p> His <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 113.084064 <p> 113.1576 <p> Leu <p> L <p> 113.084064 <p> 113.1576 <p> Lys <p> K <p> 128.092963 <p> 128.1723 <p> Met <p> M <p> 131.040485 <p> 131.1961 <p> Phe <p> F <p> 147.068414 <p> 147.1739 <p> Pro <p> P <p> 97.052764 <p> 97.1152 <p> Ser <p> S <p> 87.032028 <p> 87.0773 <p> Thr <p> T <p> 101.047679 <p> 101.1039 <p> Trp <p> W <p> 186.079313 <p> 186.2099 <p> Tyr <p> Y <p> 163.06332 <p> 163.1733 <p> Val <p> V <p> 99.068414 <p> 99.1311 <p> As an example , sing these MW values , the sequence of the human Glu1- fibrinopeptide B can be determined from MS/MS spectra shown in an annotated form below . Note that most of the b peaks are b* resulting from lost of NH3 from the N terminus . <h> B3 . Levels of Protein Structure <p> A protein can be considered to have primary , secondary , tertiary , and quaternary structures . <p> primary structure : the linear amino acid sequence of a protein <p> secondary structure : regular repeating structures arising when hydrogen bonds between the peptide backbone amide hydrogens and carbonyl oxygens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strand ) of a protein ( as in the alpha helix ) or between two adjacent strands ( as in beta sheets and reverse turns ) <p> quaternary structure : oligomeric structure of a multisubunit protein in which separate proteins chains associate to form dimers , trimers , tetramers , and other oligomers . The different chains in the oligomers may be the same protein ( homooligomers ) or a combination of different protein chains ( heteroliogomers ) . The different chains within the oligomer may be held together by noncovalent intermolecular forces or may also contain covalent interchain disulfides . <p> The peptide ( amide ) bond absorbs UV light in the range of 180 to 230 nm ( far-UV range ) so this region of the spectra give information about the protein backbone , and more specifically , the secondary structure of the protein . The main transitions are n --&gt; p* at 220 nm and p --&gt; p* at 190 nm . There is a little contribution from aromatic amino acid side chains but it is small given the large number of peptide bonds . The lone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered to be rehybrized to sp2 from sp3 allowing for conjugation of the p electrons ( which lowers the energy of the electrons ) . The Huckel diagram below shows 3 MOs generated form the 3 atomic p orbitals . The middle one ( with 1 node ) has energy similar to the separate atomic p orbtials and is considered a nonbonding MO ( consistent with the lone nonbonding pair on the N atom ) . <p> The peptide bonds in a protein 's asymmetric environment will absorb this range of light ( promoting electrons to higher energy levels ) . In different secondary structures , the peptide bond electrons will absorb right and left circularly polarized light differently ( for example , they have different molar absorptivities ) . Hence a , b and random coil structures all have distinguishable far UV CD spectra . <p> Stated in another way , if plane polarized light , which is a superposition of right and left circularly polarized light , passes through an asymmetric sample which absorbs right and left circularly polarized differently ( i.e they display circular dichroism ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the right and left hand circularly polarized light gives elliptically polarized light . ( Great link ! ) The <p> If the chiral molecules also have a different index of refraction for R and L circularly polarized light , an added net effect is rotation of the angle of the ellipitically of the polarized light . The far-UV CD spectrum of the protein is sensitive to the main chain conformation . The CD spectra of alpha and beta secondary structure are shown in the figure below . <p> Figure : The CD Spectra of Alpha-Helix , Beta-Sheet , and Random Coils <p> Protein side chains also find themselves in such an asymmetric environment . If irradiated with circularly polarized UV light in the range of 250-300 nm ( near UV ) , differential absorption of right and circularly polarized light by the aromatic amino acids ( Tyr , Phe , Trp ) and disulfide bonds occur and a near UV CD spectra result . If the near UV CD spectra of a protein is taken under two different sets of conditions , and the spectra differ , then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different , and hence the proteins have somewhat different conformations . It will not give information about secondary structure of the backbone since that requires lower wavelengths for absorption of occur . Rather it can show differences in tertiary structure . <h> B5 . Analysis of Protein Tertiary Structure <p> Clearly , the highest resolution understanding of protein structure requires a solution to the 3D structure of the protein . Once that is determined , it is easy to devise computer programs which will determine what part of the structure is in secondary structure . Three methods are presently useful to determine the 3D structures of proteins . <p> A. X-Ray crystallography : If crystals of the protein can be made , traditional x-ray crystallographic techniques can be used to solve the structure . X-rays irradiate a crystal , which scatters the x-rays , leading to constructive/destructive interference patterns . Using appropriate math , the interference pattern can be reconverted into the actual structure of the protein . Check out a fun example showing such a reconstruction of the Parthenon from its diffraction pattern ! <p> These structures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do represent the solution structure . For instance , x-ray structure contain many water molecules which interact with each other and the protein , a finding expected for a structure that represents the solution structure of the protein . In addition , substrates and inhibitors can be infused into the crystal and bind with the protein , suggesting again a native-like structure for the protein in the crystal . <p> B. NMR : There are many protons in proteins which give a proton NMR spectra . The problem is one of assignment , since there are so many . Nuclei in different environments absorb energy at different resonant frequencies . When a proton spin flips , it goes to a higher energy state . It will return to the equilibrium state with some time delay . <p> Figure : 1D NMR spectra of a protein <p> If an unexcited proton is proximal in space , the magnetization can be transferred to the unexcited proton .

NMR and X-ray structure of the protein are almost superimposable . <p> Of course , to characterize proteins rigorously , they must be purified from a solution containing many proteins . We will cover these techniques in the laboratory . Here is a quick summary of some of them :

An example of a bidentate ligand is ethylenediamine . It can bind to a metal via two donor atoms at once . <p> Bidentate binding allows a ligand to bind more tightly . Tridentate ligands , which bind through three donors , can bind even more tightly , and so on . This phenomenon is generally called the " chelate effect " .

@@71697711 @397711/ <h> nJFET Characteristic Curves <h> Measured Characteristic Curves for 2N5457 <p> The behavior of an n-channel junction field-effect transistor ( nJFET ) is largely controlled by the voltage at the gate ( usually a negative voltage ) . For the usual drain-source voltage drops ( i.e. , the saturation region : positive voltages from a few volts up to some breakdown voltage ) the drain current ( I 'd ) is nearly independent of the drain-source voltage ( VDS ) , and instead depends on the gate voltage ( VG ) . ( This is unusual behavior : usually more voltage produces to more current , but here the current only increases slightly with increasing VDS . ) The transconductance , i.e. , the ratio of the change in drain current to change in gate voltage , often denoted by g or yfs , is <p> g = yfs = ID/VG <p> In the simplest approximation the characteristic curves of a nJFET are a set of flat lines : <p> Each ( flat ) curve shows that I 'd does n't change with changing VDS . The different levels show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant-ID curves is usually not constant , instead I 'd depends quadratically on VG : <p> ID=K(VG-VTO)2 <p> where the threshold ( or pinch-off ) voltage VTO and K are constants . The maximum drain current ( which occurs at zero-gate voltage , i.e. , VG=0 ) is denoted IDSS . The value of K can be determined from IDSS and VTO : <p> IDSS = K(0-VTO)2 <p> A slightly more complicated approximation takes into account the sloping of the characteristic curves . In bipolar transistors this is due to the Early Voltage , here a very similar equation results from quite different physics : channel length modulation . The equation looks like : <p> 1/VA = <p> So in this model all the characteristic curves all have a common x-axis intercept at the large negative voltage -1/ . ( The dashed curves are far from the active region and in no way represent the actual behavior of the transistor for negative VDS . In fact , the transistor is not designed to be operated with negative VDS . ) <p> ( For the above measured 2N5457 , 1/ ranges from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small but variable slopes . ) <p> The actual relationship between the drain current ( I 'd ) and the controlling gate voltage ( VG ) and drain-source voltage drop ( VDS ) is some complicated function which we can denote : <p> I 'd ( VG , VDS ) <p> Like any function we can approximate it near a particular point using just the first terms of a Taylors expansion : <p> Clearly these admittance ( y ) parameters are not constants . For example yos is the slope of a characteristic curve , which is small for voltages near threshold and increases for larger VG . ( Note that slope on an I-V is basically the inverse of the resistance . Thus 1/yos can be described as the output impedance . A typical value for 1/yos would be 100,000 . ) <p> The defining parameter -- the transconductance g or yfs -- is not at all constant . To the extent that the drain current depends quadratically on the gate voltage , the transconductance -- which is the derivative : dID/dVG -- depends linearly on VG above threshold . Below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above 2N5457 . Notice that for VG&gt;VTO , the drain current is well approximated by the quadratic , whereas for VG&lt;VTO ( i.e. , sub-threshold ) the drain current depends approximately exponentially on VG . Thus the drain current is not strictly zero below threshold , merely exponentially small . <p> The characteristic curves focus on the output of the transistor , but we can also consider the behavior of the input . In normal operation the gate is a reversed biased diode , and so IG is essentially zero ( which should sound like a huge input resistance ) . As a result the outputs have little effect on the inputs , but if we follow the traditional analysis the actual functional relationship giving the gate current ( IG ) from the gate voltage ( VG ) and drain-source voltage drop ( VDS ) is some complicated function which we can denote : <p> IG ( VG , VDS ) <p> Like any function we can again approximate it near a particular point using just the first terms of Taylors expansion : <p> The small values of yrs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output and that the input resistance is huge . In fact this input resistance is so large that the capacitance reactance is almost always of greater significance . <p> Finally it should be noted that in the small VDS region -- before the saturation region -- the FET characteristic curves look like nearly straight lines through the origin . VG controls the slope of these lines , so the FET acts like a variable resistor with a voltage ( VG ) control . Here is a plot of this region for the above 2N5457 :

They also may involve collisions between molecules . <p> If two molecules need to collide in order for a reaction to take place , then factors that influence the ease of collisions will be important . <p> The more energy there is available to the molecules , the faster they will zip around . The faster they zip around , the more likely they are to bump into each other . So higher temperatures ought to lead to more collisions and a greater frequency of reactions between molecules .

( Reactions may involve atoms or ions , rather than moleules , but the same arguments apply . ) Not many collisions happen . As a result , reactions often happen extremely slowly in the solid state . Reactions are mostly limited to the grain boundaries : the surfaces of the grains , where they are in contact with each other .

In the liquid phase , molecules are much more mobile and collisions are much more frequent than in the solid phase . <p> It is also very common to run reactions in solution . In solution , a compound that is meant to undergo reaction is dissolved in a solvent .

@@71697724 @397724/ <p> I. Fundamental QuestionsBiologists have long been interested in two fundamental questions : ( a ) what determines how an organism looks and behaves ? and ( b ) why does an individual look like its parents ? <p> The answer to both of these questions suggests that : ( a ) organisms have genetic information , a plan , or blueprints for constructing a new individual ; and ( b ) there must be a mechanism for transmitting the information , blueprints , from parent to offspring . <p> Let 's quickly review some terms in light of these observations:genotype - refers to the specific genetic plan , the blueprints.phenotype - refers to the outward expression of the genetic info ( i.e. , what the organism looks like or how it behaves ) . <p> II . Criteria for the BlueprintsAlthough early biologists did n't know what the blueprints were , they realized that the geneticinformation must meet several criteria : <p> be able to store information ( enough to code for all of the traits/features of a complex organism ) ; <p> account for variability/diversity among individuals.Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> transmit the message ( inheritance ) ; <p> be able to be copied exactly ( replication ) ; and <p> account for mutations ( for evolutionary changes ) . <p> So , exactly what is the plan ? We 'll answer this question somewhat historically .... <p> III . Location of the Blueprints In order to identify the nature of the genetic blueprint , we need to determine exactly where in the cell it is located.Hammerling 's ( 1930 's ) transplant experiments with Acetabularia showed that the nucleus was required for regeneration of the cap and that the nucleus released temporary chemical instructions.Steward 's work with carrots and Gurdon 's work with the African clawed toad , Xenopus , showed that a single cell , with a single nucleus , contained all the genetic instructions necessary for an entire new individual.Conclusion:in eukaryotic cells , the genetic information is contained in the nucleus . <p> IV . What is the molecule of inheritance ? Protein or DNA ? During the first half of this century there were two main candidates for the genetic information : protein and DNA.Both occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential to store information . The predominant paradigm was that proteins , with their greater variation and complexity , were the most likely candidates for the genetic blueprints . DNA was thought to be too small and too uniform to be able to code for all of the instructions necessary for a complex individual . <p> A.Griffith ( 1928 ) &amp; Sugar-Coated Microbes Frederick Griffith worked with virulent ( disease-causing ) and avirulent ( non-disease causing ) strains of pneumonia.The virulent , or smooth ( S ) strain , is " sugar-coated " . In other words , it has a polysaccharide ( carbohydrate or sugar ) capsule that gives the colonies growing in culture a smooth appearance.This strain kills experimental mice because it does n't activate the immune system.The non-virulent strain lacks a polysaccharide capsule , has a rough ( R ) appearance in culture , is attached by the immune so does not kill experimental mice . He performed the following experiments : <p> heat kill the virulent strain + live avirulent + mouse n++ mouse dies . Yikes - what happened ? In addition , live virulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The virulent strain somehow converted the avirulent strain into a virulent one.Thus there must be passage of instructions , called a transforming factor , to permanently convert the avirulent into the virulent strain.The nature of the instructions ( transforming factor ) were unknown . <p> B. Avery et al. ( 1944 ) By the early 1940 's it was known that just an extract ( grind the cells up ) of a virulent strain could transform an avirulent strain into a virulent one.Avery and colleagues chemically identified the transforming factor by selecting destroying different macromolecules in an extract of a virulent strain and observing if they killed the mouse.The experiment was basically : <p> Conclusion : since digesting ( removing ) only the DNA results in preventing transformation , then DNA must be the hereditary instructions.Although it sounds logical and obvious , many still refused to believe these conclusions ( biologists are pig-headed , too ) because : <p> bacteria were not considered " typical " or representative models for all organisms ; <p> the bacteria were considered too " crippled " and not behaving " normally " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samples ; <p> the paper was rather difficult to understand ( i.e. , poorly written with an obscure title ) ; <p> published in a medical journal ; <p> experiments were hard to replicate ; and <p> Avery was too cautious and modest . <p> C. DNA/Protein Content During the Cell CycleOne assumption biologists have always made about cell division is that just before a cell divides it would have to make a copy of the genetic instructions to pass on to the daughter cells ( i.e. , replication ) . It was discovered that the DNA , but not protein , of cells doubles prior to cell division . Hence , the ploidy level of the cell was correlated with the DNA content but not the protein . Conclusion:the blueprint is made of DNA . <p> D.Hershey/Chase ( 1952 ) They worked with bacteriophages , which are viruses that attack bacteria.It was well known that : ( a ) these viruses contained only DNA and protein ; ( b ) when these viruses infected a cell , the coat remained on the cell surface and genetic instructions are injected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses the viral instructions to make more virus ; and ( d ) the host cell splits open releasing the new virus.So , which was injected - the DNA or protein ? <p> They grew E. coli bacteria and the bacteriophage T2 in a growth medium enriched with either radioactive sulfur ( 35S ) or phosphorus ( 32P ) . These were used as a marker for proteins ( which contain sulfur ) or nucleic acids ( which contain lots of phosphorus ) , respectively.Then , they could see whether the radioactive material was inserted into the infected cell , or whether it remained on the bacterial cell surface.A brief outline of the experiment : <p> After an incubation period , homogenize the cells to separate the viral coat from the infected cell . <p> Centrifuge the mixture . The bacterial cells form a pellet at the bottom of the tube and the virus shells will remain in the supernatant because they are too light to form a pellet . <p> The <p> 35S was recovered in the supernatant and 32P was recovered in the pellet <p> Conclusions : Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the viral coat must be made of protein . Since the 32P was recovered in the pellet , the injected instructions must be made of DNA.Hershey/Chase ( 1952 ) - " We infer that protein has no function in phage replication and that DNA has some function " . This was the final and conclusive evidence that DNA is the hereditary information although even Hershey was still a little doubtful ( " My own guess is that DNA will not prove to be a unique determiner of genetic specificity ; " 1953 ) . <p> E. Mutagens Mutagenic agents were known to interact with DNA , not protein . <p> F. Conclusion These studies convinced biologists that the genetic information was DNA . But , what did the molecule look like ? <p> V. Structure of DNA What is the structure of DNA ? This was another difficult question to answer.After a very competitive race , Watson and Crick finally pieced together all the parts of the puzzle in 1953 and won a Nobel prize for their efforts.Note - they did n't do any experimental work.Rather , they worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were available to them.The pieces : <p> Miescher - first isolated DNA from sperm and pus cells ( 1868 ) . These studies showed the genetic informationwas acidic and had an approximate chemical formulaC29 H35 N11 O18 P3.The molecule was rich in phosphorus . Later studies confirmed it was a nucleic acid - a polymer constructed from nucleotides . <p> Isolating DNA showed that it was fibrous and stringy.Thus it must be a long , filamentous molecule . <p> For convenience , biochemists refer to each carbon atom in both the sugar and nitrogenous bases by number.To distinguish between the two , the numbers of the carbons in the sugar are indicated by a prime ( ' ) symbol.Thus , the carbons in the sugars are numbered from 1 ' to 5 ' . <p> The three components of the nucleotides are linked like this : phosphate - 5'sugar1 ' - nitrogenous base <p> To make DNA : the phosphate of one nucleotide is linked via a covalent bond to the 3 ' carbon of deoxyribose of the next nucleotide , and so on .... <p> DNA has a linear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stick out 90 degrees from the chain . The phosphate of one nucleotide is linked to the sugar of the next . This comes from the x-ray crystallographic data from Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins . <p> Chargaff observed that : ( 1 ) the content of A , T , G , and C between individuals of each species ( 2 ) the amount of A = T and C = G. Conclusion : adenine and thymine are complementary and pair with one another ; guanine and cytosine are complementary . <p> DNA is a uniform diameter ( more x-ray data ) , about 2 nm . <p> Model Building Inferences : ( 1 ) The DNA molecule is double stranded - held together by hydrogen bonds . There are two H-bonds between adenine and thymine and three between cytosine and guanine ; and ( 2 ) the two strands are antiparallel ( run in opposite directions ) . One end is the 3 ' side , the other is 5 ' <p> DNA is a helix . The helix makes 1 turn every 3.4 nanometer . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 0.34 nm apart . This comes from Franklin 's data . <p> Putting it all together - overview of the structure of the DNA molecule ( see pix in text , and provided in class ) . <p> Conclusion : DNA is a double-stranded molecule that looks like a ladder that was sawed in half and then put back together with velcro . Each half of the ladder is made of a rail with half-rungs sticking out perpendicularly . The rails of made of alternating sugar and phosphates and the rungs are nitrogenous bases . The rails run in opposite directions ( anti-parallel ) . Velcro represents the hydrogen bonds holding the rungs together . <p> VI . Checking the Model Remember our criteria for the DNA.The structure of DNA fit the model beautifully since it could : <p> Store information Information is stored in the sequence of nucleotides.Thus , a gene is simply a segment of DNA that has a particular sequence of nucleotides . <p> Transmit the message Although it was well known that DNA duplicated prior cell division , the exact mechanism by which the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcription and translation ) . <p> Be able to be copied exactly ( replication ) Even Watson and Crick noted that if each half of the molecule made the other , or complementary half , it would allow DNA to exactly replicate itself . ( " It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism . " ) Clever lads . <p> Account for variability/diversityThe number of combinations of nucleotides is infinite.For example , how many ways can you arrange 2 objects ( A &amp; B ) in 3 positions ? <p> position 1 : <p> A <p> A <p> A <p> B <p> B <p> B <p> A <p> B <p> position 2 : <p> A <p> A <p> B <p> B <p> B <p> A <p> B <p> A <p> position 3 : <p> A <p> B <p> B <p> B <p> A <p> A <p> A <p> B <p> This can be mathematically expressed as nx where n is the number of objects and x is the number of position . Thus , for the example above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects ( A , B ) in two different ways is 23 = 8 . Now , consider a typical gene that is 300 nucleotides long . There are 4300 possible ways to arrange the nucleotides ! That 's a lot of potential information storage . <p> Account for mutations to allow for evolutionary changeIt is easy to imagine that a mutation is simply a change in the sequence of nucleotides . <p> VII.Replication - the process by which DNA makes an exact copy of itself . <p> A. Where does it occur ? In the nucleus ( at least in eukaryotes ) <p> B. When does it occur ? During interphase ( specifically S ) <p> C. Why does it occur ? To provide genetic information for each of the daughter cells produced during mitosis/meiosis ( or fission in bacteria ) <p> D. How does it occur ? There were three major hypotheses for how DNA replicated : <p> Conservative Model - each molecule serves as a template to make another molecule such that you wind up with the original molecule and a brand new one ; <p> Semi-conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DNA molecule , one half of the " ladder " ) serves as a template to make the other half ( complementary strand ) . Thus , each new molecule is made up of one original strand and one new one ; and <p> Dispersive Model - the DNA breaks up and makes hybrid molecules each with old and new DNA interspersed . <p> Based on the structure , the most likely model was semi-conservative ( even Watson &amp; Crick speculated this from the structure ) . So , how did biologists demonstrate this to be true ? <p> Meselsohn/Stahl ( 1958 ) ExperimentThey demonstrated that DNA replication occurs by a semi-conservative method.Brief overview of the experiment:Grow E. coli in medium enriched with heavy ( 15N ) nitrogen.Then transfer to regular medium medium ( 14N ) and allow to grow for one generation ( or more ) . Grind up the cells , extract the DNA and centrifuge in a cesium chloride gradient to separate the DNA molecules based on density.Thus , an individual can potentially have three possible types of DNA : ( a ) " heavy " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - neither strand labeled ; and ( c ) " semi-heavy " - one strand is labeled , the other is not . <p> Cells grown in 15N containing medium all have heavy DNA.After one generation in regular medium , all the daughter cells have semi-heavy DNA.After several generations , some cells have light DNA and others have **33;860;TOOLONG is semi-conservative . <p> DNA is made in replication " factories " that are comprised of a variety of enzymes ( see below ) and proteins . In short , the DNA is essentially threaded into the factory complex and is duplicated . This process is obviously rather complicated but involves : <p> The DNA is threaded into the replication factory complex . Among other things the replication factory contains a large complex of enzymes such as DNA polymerase , ligase , primase , and helicase . In addition , there are an assortment of proteins that are required for the process . <p> The DNA must be unwound and the two strands are separated . Enzymes ( helicases ) in the factory unwind the DNA helix at specific initiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined the specific sequence of nucleotides in the DNA . There are many such sites in eukaryotic DNA , only one in a bacterial chromosome . The result is a " replication bubble " at each origin of replication . The DNA unwinds in both directions - called the replication fork ; <p> The unwound &amp; unpaired DNA must be stabilized . Unpaired DNA is " unstable " and wants to rejoin with its complementary half . To help to stabilize the replication bubble additional proteins ( single-strand binding proteins ) attach to the DNA . <p> Complementary nucleotides are matched with the unpaired nucleotides in strand.DNA polymerase is the primary enzyme responsible for replicating DNA . Adenine is matched to thymine , cytosine to guanine ; and vice versa . <p> DNA polymerase can only add a new nucleotide to the end of a pre-existing strand of DNA or RNA . A small piece of RNA , called a primer , is first matched with the DNA at the origin of replication by the enzyme primase . Primase occurs in an aggregate of proteins called a primosome ( remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> DNA polymerase can only add new nucleotides to the 3 ' end of the primer or the elongating strand of DNA ( i.e. , to the sugar part ) . Thus , DNA is always made in the 5 ' direction toward the 3 ' direction.This is no problem with one strand ( leading strand ) of the DNA.It is made in one long continuous piece.However , the other strand , the lagging strand , which is anti-parallel , is made in short segments ( called Okazaki fragments ) , again in the 5 ' to 3 ' direction . <p> The RNA primer pieces are snipped out by other enzymes ( ligase ) and the gaps are filled and the chains sealed . <p> F. Fixing Mistakes Just like occur in any factory line , some mistakes are made as the DNA is replicated . In fact , DNA polymerase makes about on mistake every 106 nucleotides ( about one in a million ) . Although Detroit would be happy if this was the mistake rate for one of their factories - it is unacceptable for life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile , the mistakes in making DNA are fixed before it leaves the factory : <p> DNA polymerase proofreads the DNA as it goes and wrong bases are removed and replaced . <p> any mistakes missed in proofreading are usually caught by final quality control inspectors - mismatched bases are replaced ( mismatch repair ) or damaged nucleotides are snipped out ( excision repair ) . <p> The net result is that the mistake rate is very low - only one about 1 base in every billion nucleotides ! <p> VII . PCR - Copying DNA in a Test Tube ( not on exam ) <p> PCR = polymerase chain reaction <p> technique to magnify ( increase ) small concentrations of DNA . <p> DNA polymerase obtained from a thermophilic methanogen ; enzymes can tolerate heating ( do n't denature ) which is necessary to ' melt ' or separate the two strands of DNA <p> Complete nucleotide sequences now known for several species , including humans <p> DNA synthesis , in vitro , requires : a template strand , a supply of dNTP 's ( nucleotides like adenine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and DNA polymerase <p> The sequencing technique also incorporates ddNTP - dideoxynucleotides . These are similar to the normal nucleotides ( dNTP ) EXCEPT the ddNTP 's are missing a hydroxyl group on the 3 ' carbon . Thus , if DNA polymerase uses one of these for DNA synthesis instead of the normal dNTP 's , no additional nucleotides can be added because there is no free 3 ' hydroxyl group to add the next nucleotide . <p> To distinguish the four ddNTPs ' - each is bonded to a different fluorescent dye . <p> Sequencing technique : single strand of DNA serves as a template ? mixed with primer , DNA polymerase , ' normal ' nucleotides ( dNTP ) , and dideoxynucleotides ( ddNTP ) ? DNA polymerase , starting with the primer , begins to match complementary nucleotides on the template strand with - at random - either dNTP or ddNTP nucleotides ? if dNTP is used the chain continues to grow , if ddNTP is chain growth stops ? ultimately all chains are terminated with a ddNTP newly made strands separated from template DNA ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each strand terminates with a ddNTP a laser is used to determine the dye by the ddNTP results in sequence of original template strand <p> Check out the Human Genome Project video on-line for a description of the techniques used to sequence the human genome.

@@71697730 @397730/ <p> The n + 1 rule ( number of lines in a multiplet = number of neighbouring H + 1 ) will work for the majority of problems you may encounter . Occasionally , you may see more complicated coupling . The spectrum of methyl acrylate is a good example . There are a couple of points to note in this spectrum , beginning with the number of peaks . <p> Figure NMR21.1H NMR spectrum of methyl acrylate . <p> Source : Simulated spectrum . <p> the vinyl portion of the spectrum ( hydrogens adjacent to the C=C double bond ) shows three peaks , not just two . <p> although there are two protons on one vinyl carbon , each H is different because of cis/trans relationships : one H is cis to the carbonyl and the other is trans to it . <p> these hydrogens are symmetry inequivalent . <p> In addition , there is a problem with coupling in the vinyl region . <p> the proton adjacent to the carbonyl , at 6 ppm , has two neighbours and should give a triplet . <p> instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not three . <p> this peak is not a quartet ; the middle two peaks are not three times as tall as the edge ones . <p> the lines within this multiplet are symmetrically spaced , but not evenly ; the middle space is smaller than the spaces on the edges . <p> This pattern is called a " doublet of doublets " . The two symmetry-inequivalent neighbors on the other end of the double bond each act as if the other one is n't there . They couple to the proton next to the carbonyl independently , each one splitting the peak for this proton into a separate doublet . <p> There are a few cases in which this independent coupling will occur rather than the ( n+1 ) type coupling we saw first . Generally , independent coupling occurs when protons are not freely rotating . That can happen if one of the protons is attached to a double-bonded carbon , because we ca n't rotate around a double bond . It may also happen with protons that are directly attached to the carbons of a ring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know more about coupling . <p> in coupling , magnetic information is shared between two protons . How fully this information is shared depends on the angle between the hydrogens as you look down the connecting C-C bond . <p> for ( n+1 ) coupling , the rotational angle about the C-C bond connecting the two protons ( or ' dihedral angle ' between the coupled hydrogens ) must be unrestricted . The bond must be able to rotate freely . <p> if the bond can rotate freely , any proton on the neighbouring carbon can assume any dihedral angle with the proton being observed . That means coupling information from one neighbouring proton is indistinguishable from another , and so all the neighbouring protons affect the observed proton equally . <p> Figure NMR22 . A sawhorse projection ( top ) and Newman projection of ethanol ( bottom ) , showing the angular relationship between hydrogens on neighbouring carbons . The angle between two groups on neighbouring carbons is called the dihedral angle . Because of free rotation about the C-C bond , all three hydrogens on the methyl have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group . <p> Sometimes coupling information is depicted as an arrow . This arrow stands for the coupling constant between two protons . The coupling constant is related to the spin of a hydrogen atom . The spin ( related to magnetic moment ) can be aligned with the external magnetic field ( we will show it pointing up ) or else against it ; no other possibilities are allowed . <p> If there are two neighbouring hydrogens , both spins could be aligned with the external field , both could be aligned against it , or one could be aligned each way . That means there are three different magnetic combinations that will each have a different effect on the observed proton : increased magnetic field , decreased magnetic field , and no net effect ( canceling out ) . <p> These three combinations result in the observed proton absorbing at three different frequencies , because the frequency it absorbs is sensitive to the magnetic field it experiences . Note that there are two ways to arrive at the middle possibility , with one neighbour spin up and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely as either both spins up or both spins down . It is thus twice as likely that the observed proton experiences that effect , and so the middle line in a triplet is twice as high as the other two lines . <p> Figure NMR23 . Effects of neighbouring protons on an observed peak . This case assumes all the neighbouring protons have an equivalent effect ( they have the same coupling constant with the observed proton ) . <p> However , the size of that arrow , the coupling constant , is only the same for two neighbouring hydrogens if they have the same spatial relationship with the observed hydrogen . That is n't always true . <p> if the dihedral angle is limited , complex coupling occurs . <p> complex coupling occurs because one neighbouring hydrogen can only adopt a limited range of dihedral angles . Another neighbouring proton can adopt a limited range of dihedral angles as well , but these two ranges do not overlap . <p> As a result , the two coupling constants are different . We can depict that situation using arrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each spin can be either up or down , but now two opposing spins do not cancel out . The result is four spin combinations of equal probability , not just three . <p> The doublet of doublets is four lines of about equal heights . The distance between the two pairs of lines on each edge <p> there is a double bond . Double bonds can not rotate because that would require breaking the pi bond . In a pi bond , p orbitals on the two carbons must remain coplanar in order to overlap and form a bond . <p> there is a ring . In a ring , there ca n't be complete rotation about a bond because the ring would twist into a pretzel . <p> in some cases , there can be such large groups of atoms on either end of a bond that it is difficult to rotate the bond without having these groups crash into each other . 74907 @qwx694907

Thus , if the ion distribution is know , the membrane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge distribution ? The membrane is permeable to both potassium and sodium ( recall that ions move through membranes slowly ) . These ions diffuse through protein channels in the membrane . There are separate " leakage channels " for both potassium and sodium and they are always " open " , thereby permitting the diffusion of sodium and potassium down their concentration gradient . Thus , potassium diffuses from inside to outside and sodium diffuses from outside to inside . <p> The membrane is much more permeable to potassium so there is a net flux ( leakage ) of potassium , and hence positively-charged particles , out of the cell . This is the result of more potassium leakage channels and a steeper concentration gradient in potassium between inside and outside of the cell . Since the cell is permeable to both sodium and potassium , over time , you would expect an equilibrium state would be reached at which point the concentration of sodium and potassium would be approximately equal inside and outside of the cell , and hence no membrane potential . <p> So , what maintains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump is another integral protein complex that requires ATP and actively transports sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell . For every three sodium that are moved out , two potassium are moved in . Thus , the sodium-potassium pump maintains the ion gradient across the membrane . It is an active ( energy-requiring process ) because it is moving the ions against their concentration gradient . <p> III . Excitability . Some cells are excitable , that is , they can change their membrane potential . This occurs when the membrane depolarizes ( switches polarity - the inside becomes positive relative to the outside ) or hyperpolarizes ( becomes more negative inside relative to outside ) . A nerve impulse is simply a reapid change ( reversal ) neuronal membrane permeability . <p> A. Special Ion Channels ( Voltage-Gated Ion Channels ; Voltage-Activated Ion Channels ) In the membrane there are proteins that respond to changes in membrane potential/voltage . In response , these gates permit the passage of sodium or potassium in/out of the cell . Let 's examine the voltage-activated gates of sodium and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffusion of sodium . It has two gates : <p> Repolarization phase . Sodium gate 2 now closed , prevents entry of additional sodium . Potassium gate now fully open , and allows loss of potassium . The net result is a loss of positive charge from inside the cell which causes the repolarization . <p> Undershoot . Excess potassium may leak out of the cell causing a hyperpolarization of the membrane . <p> B. Refractory period . Time period following an action potential during which the cell gates are returning to their original positions . The cell can not respond to another nerve impulse during this period . <p> C. Nerve impulse . Wave of action potential spreads along the neuron . It doesn ? t turn back on itself because of the refractory period . <p> D. Rate of conduction . In unmyelinated nerves , speed is directly related to the diameter of the axon . Rates vary from about 1 ? 10 m s-1 . Saltatory conduction occurs when action potentials jump between nodes of Ranvier . These occur much faster . Voltage channels just in node @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few neurons are hard-wired ( i.e. , are directly connected to one another , as in gap junctions ) . These are called electrical synapses and important for really fast responses . However , most neurons are not in contact with one another , rather there is a gap ( ca. 25 nm ) , called the synapse or synaptic cleft , between the adjacent cells . So , how does the nerve impulse get across the gap in these chemical synapses ? Chemical signals = neurotransmitters . <p> A. Various neurotransmitters have been identified . Many known . Acetylcholine is a common one involved in muscle contractions and other responses . Norepinephrine , serotonin , and dopamine are involved in mood , mental state , ADD , schizophrenia . Gamma-amino butyric acid ( GABA ) is in the spinal cord and brain . The opiate types , endorphins and enkephalins are involved in pain perception . <p> B. Too much neurotransmitters is a bad thing . In other words , the neurotransmitters must be removed after they do their job . Many are broken down by enzymes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serotonin are reabsorbed by the axon . Some drugs work by the inhibition of the reuptake of the neurotransmitter . For example , cocaine prevents the reuptake of serotonin . <p> VI . Excitatory &amp; Inhibitory Impulses Some neurons cause depolarization of membrane ( i.e , motor neuron and skeletal muscle ) . These are called excitatory . Other neurons cause hyperpolarization ( inhibitory ) . GABA and glycine act in this manner . Ultimately , the final response of a nerve is a sum of the excitatory and inhibitory responses received - typically at the axon hillock ( at base of axon , not insulated by glial cells , many voltage gated channels ) <p> VII . Chemicals and Nerves These can exert their effect in a variety of places . For example , DDT interferes with the sodium/potassium pump ; the anesthetics cocaine , lidocaine and procaine block sodium ion channels . Some poisons mimic the effect of the naturally-occurring neurotransmitter ( i.e. , hallucinogenic drugs , muscarine ) 
@@71697737 @397737/ <h> 7 . Precession of the Equinoxes . <p> The motion of the equinoxes which causes the difference between the solar and sidereal year is going on all the time . It is called the Precession of the Equinoxes . <p> The nature of precession is now to be explained . The equinox is the point where the sun crosses the celestial equator . The position of the celestial equator on the celestial sphere is determined by the direction of the earth ? s axis , because the celestial equator is 90 from either celestial pole . <p> The precession of the equinoxes arises from the fact that the direction of the earth ? s axis in space is slowly changing . <p> Next , let us see how the change goes on . Imagine a line passing through the sun perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic . The point in which this line , when continued to the stars , meets the celestial sphere , is called the Pole of the Ecliptic . It lies in the constellation Draco , the Dragon , but there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the angular distance between the pole of the ecliptic and the celestial pole , corresponding to the direction of the earth ? s axis , is equal to the obliquity of the ecliptic , 23+ . <p> Now , the law of precession is that the celestial pole is in motion , and makes a complete revolution round the pole of the ecliptic in about 25,700 years . This motion is very slow to ordinary vision ; it would take a century for the naked eye to notice it , even by careful observation . But the exact observations made by astronomers with the meridian circle make it evident month after month and year after year . <p> Fig. 23. -- Showing how the equinoxes are gradually shifting in consequence of the motion of the celestial equator among the stars . One of the brightest stars in the figure , which was south of the equator two thousand years ago , is now north of it . <p> Owing to this motion of the celestial pole the celestial equator moves also , continually sliding along the ecliptic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 . This is why the equinox moves among the stars . The rate of motion is a little more than 50 " in a year , or nearly 14 in 1000 years . <p> Motion of the Ecliptic. -- If the plane of the ecliptic were absolutely fixed , the obliquity of the ecliptic would be always the same , and the motion of precession would go on forever at the same rate that it now does . But the attraction of the other planets on the earth produces a very slow change in the ecliptic itself , about 1/50 the change of precession . In consequence of this change , the revolution of the celestial pole round the pole of the ecliptic does not take place at an exactly uniform rate , nor will it always be completed in exactly the same time . For the same reason the obliquity of the ecliptic slowly changes . It is at the present time diminishing at the rate of about 46 " in a century . <p> Results of Precession. -- One result of precession is that the celestial pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is now . In ancient times it was so far away from that star that the latter could not be considered as a polestar at all . It has been continually coming nearer , and is still approaching it . About the year 2110 it will pass by the polestar at a distance of only 24 ' . Continuing its course , the celestial pole will pass some 5 from the star Alpha Lyre , about 11,000 years from now , and will continue its circuit until it gets back to where it now is in about 25,700 years . <p> The two equinoxes will make a revolution round the equator in the same period of time , being carried along by the earth 's equator , which is always at right angles to the earth 's axis .

@@71697752 @397752/ <p> Oxygen is vital to life . Very small organisms can get enough oxygen passively from their surroundings , but larger , more complicated organisms need to have better mechanisms for getting oxygen to the cells . Medium-sized organisms such as insects can manage to pump air to their tissues via a system of tubes leading in from pores along their bodies . Organisms bigger than that need a more complicated circulation system involving arteries and veins . Oxygen dissolves pretty well in water , but we can get even more oxygen into our system by binding it to carrier molecules . <p> The most common carrier molecule for oxygen , used by vertebrates like us , is hemoglobin . Hemoglobin contains a five-coordinate Fe(II) centre in a heme or porphyrin ligand . In the picture , only the coordination complex is shown , stripped of the surrounding protein . Also , there are other groups attached to the porphyrin ( the nitrogen-containing ring ) but they are left out of the picture for simplicity . <p> Oxygen binds to the iron in the heme , forming an octahedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form without the bound oxygen is called deoxyhemoglobin . Lots of interesting things happen as a result of oxygen binding , structurally speaking . First of all , the heme changes shape . In order to accommodate the change from a pseudo-square planar geometry to an octahedral one , the shape of the heme changes from a distorted bowl to a plane . <p> Sometimes , keeping track of oxidation states in coordination complexes is easier if using dative bond formalisms . In particular , if a donor arom is neutral , the bond to the metal is shown using a dative bond symbol . That 's a short , straight arrow from the donor electron pair to the metal . Bonds between anionic donor atoms and the metal are shown as regular short lines , as we typically draw other bonds . <p> Looking at the complex that way , it is easier to see that the iron atom is depicted as Fe(II) ; it has two anionic nitrogen donors from the heme ring . We 'll look into the situation more closely later . <p> Problem OR2.1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre in deoxyhemoglobin and in oxyhemoglobin . <p> Hemoglobin is exceptionally good at transporting oxygen to the tissues not only because it can bind iron tightly under the right conditions , but because it can also let go under the right conditions , releasing oxygen to the tissues . Because hemoglobin is such a complex protein , it has been very difficult to study , although researchers have made impressive strides in undertsanding proteins in recent years . <p> Instead , bioinorganic chemists have developed model compounds to gain insight into hemoglobin and other important biological compounds . Model compounds are relatively simple compounds that possess a number of characteristics of their more complicated cousins . For example , simple porphyrins are relatively easy to make ; if you wanted to study oxygen binding with a simple example , an iron-porphyrin complex would be a great model complex . <p> The trouble is , that does n't work very well . Such a complex binds oxygen irreversibly ; it never let 's go . Part of the problem is that the oxygen " bridges " to other iron-porphyrin complexes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heme is buried and protected within the protein . <p> Problem OR2.2 . <p> Show the complex that would result if an oxygen molecule bridged between two iron porphyrin complexes . <p> The laboratory of James Collman at Stanford University has been involved in modelling hemoglobin for decades . They succeeded in demonstrating reversible oxygen binding to the " picket fence " porphyrin complex shown below . The bulky tert-butyl groups serve to keep the bound oxygen from bridging to another complex . <p> That alone is an interesting result . It demonstrates that one of the many roles for the protein in this system is to sterically protect the iron heme complex , modifying its reactivity . <p> There is just one small problem . It 's called the M value . The M value is an index of the discrimination between oxygen binding and carbon monoxide binding . It 's actually the ratio of the partial pressures of the two gases needed to half-saturate the hemoglobin ( i.e. so that 50% of iron atoms have bound O2 or CO ) . <p> M = P1/2CO / P1/2O2 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for O2 binding compared to CO binding . In hemoglobin , this value is about 100 , although it will vary from one organism to another . That means hemoglobin binds CO about 100 times better than it binds O2 . However , the picket fence heme has an M value over 25,000 . That means it is much poorer at binding O2 , relatively , than hemoglobin . <p> Why worry about CO binding in these studies ? Of course , carbon monoxide poisoning is a serious and potentially fatal condition . There is a deeply problematic consequence of CO poisoning , however , that could be much worse if the M value in an organism was as high as in the picket fence porphyrin . CO is actually a product of the normal breakdown of heme molecules over time in the cell . If our hemoglobin had an M value like that of the picket fence porphyrin , we would all be dead , poisoned by our own metabolic processes . <p> Not content to rest on their laurels , the Collman lab went back to the drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the one shown below has an M value closer to 0.005 . <p> What does that tell us about hemoglobin ? It may be nothing , but it could be indicating another role for the surrounding protein in the hemoglobin molecule . The domed or vaulted model compound suggests a protective covering for the oxygen binding site . Is it possible that O2 can fit inside but CO can not ? <p> It is pretty well-established via other model studies , as well as direct study of oxyhemoglobin , that when oxygen binds to a metal such as iron , the Fe-O-O forms an angle of somewhere around 120 . The complex has a bent geometry . However , when CO binds to a metal , it does so in a linear fashion . It may be that in a vaulted model complex , the CO simply ca n't stand up straight , so the complex is destabilized . Presumably , the protein could contribute to a similar destabilization of CO-bound hemoglobin . <p> This idea has been somewhat controversial . Results from quantum mechanical calculations , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair amount of leeway . These results suggest that the CO can be " tipped over " and still remain strongly bound . Nevertheless , Collman 's results provided a useful starting point for further investigations . <p> The protein may play other roles in enhancing oxygen selectivity . X-ray crystallographic studies suggest a role for hydrogen bonding between the " distal histidine " site and bound oxygen . The distal site simply refers to a second nearby histidine , other than the one that is bound to the iron ( the " proximal histidine " ) , and a little further away . That histidine could be ideally situated to hydrogen bond with bound oxygen , but out of place for optimal interaction with a bound CO . <p> There is one more important event to look at in oxygen binding . Evidence indicates that oxyhemoglobin is actually an Fe(III) species , rather than Fe(II) . The iron is oxidized by the bound oxygen . <p> As always , it is useful to map out the movement of electrons , schematically , in this event . Because this event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different kind of arrow to show where the electrons go . Most of our previous mechanisms have involved electron pairs rather than single electrons . For single electrons , we show a single-headed arrow , rather than a double-headed one . <p> Here is one way we could show the oxidation of the iron ( and the reduction of the oxygen ) : <p> Or alternatively , we could show it like this : <p> Remember , in the structure on the right , the oxygen bound to iron is considered an anionic donor , shown with a regular line bond instead of a dative arrow . <p> There is something really amazing about that last event . Hemoglobin does n't form an oxygen complex at all . It forms a complex with superoxide ion , O2- , which it has manufactured itself . When it is ready for delivery to the cells , the superoxide gives back the electron to the iron , and turns back into an everyday oxygen molecule . <p> Problem OR2.4 . <p> Describe in words what the curved arrows are showing in the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oxidation of iron would lead to tighter binding of the oxygen . <p> b ) A similar copper complex prepared with the following ligand also binds O2 , but with a much lower equilibrium binding constant . Draw the copper complex and the O2 adduct and explain the difference in O2 binding constants . <p> c ) DBM ( dopamine -monooxygenase ) and a similar copper monooxygenase , PHM ( peptidylglycine a-hydroxylating monooxygenase ) , both contain copper atoms bound to two histidines , a cysteine and a water . Explain the researchers ' choice of model compounds above in this context . <p> d ) Explain how the cysteine in these active sites might help to control OH radical levels in the cell . <p> We 'll see other examples of the reduction of oxygen in the next section . As it turns out , other iron porphyrins play important roles in converting oxygen into other species which are then used to modify substrates . 74907 @qwx694907

@@71697769 @397769/ <p> In the case of ethane , conformational changes are very subtle , but in others they are more obvious . Butane ( CH <p> 3CH2CH2CH3 ) has four tetrahedral carbons and three carbon-carbon bonds connecting them together . Let 's number the carbons along the chain C1 , C2 , C3 and C4 . Rotating around the C-C bonds connected to the terminal carbons -- C1-C2 and C3-C4 -- only subtle changes in shape would be apparent . However , rotating about C2-C3 produces some pretty obvious shape changes . <p> Pay attention to where the two methyl groups are with respect to each other . If we call C1-C2-C3-C4 the dihedral angle , then at 0 degrees the molecule is in an eclipsed conformation , apparent when looking at the Newman projection . Looked at from other vantage points , the molecule is curled up into the shape of a letter C. <p> Figure CA3.1.Ball-and-stick model <p> of butane . The C-shape that it adopts here is called the " least-stable eclipsed " conformation . <p> The " least stable eclipsed " conformation is described that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the other one soon . Of the two eclipsed conformations , this one is less stable than the other one . In an eclipsed conformation , bonds coming from two neighbouring atoms are lined up with each other . The dihedral angle between these bonds -- the C1-C2 bond and the C3-C4 bond in the case of butane 's least stable eclipsed conformation -- is 0 . That situation introduces torsional strain . As a result , neither one of these eclipsed conformations is very stable . <p> At 60 degrees , the molecule is no longer eclipsed , and just as in ethane the energy is a little bit lower , but the overall shape when viewed from the side is still a sort of twisted C. This shape is one of two possible staggered conformations , in which there is no torsional strain . <p> Figure CA3.3 . Ball-and-stick model of butane . This shape is called the " gauche conformation " . <p> Figure CA3.4 . Newman projection of butane in the " gauche " conformation . <p> At 120 degrees the molecule is eclipsed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a shape like the letter Z. It is clearly different from the other eclipsed conformation . This one is a little more stable than the other eclipsed conformation , for reasons that we will look into shortly . It is called the " more stable eclipsed conformation " . <p> Figure CA3.5 . Ball-and-stick model of butane . This shape is called the " more stable eclipsed conformation " . <p> At 180 degrees , the molecule is staggered again and has settled into a regular , zig-zag , letter Z shape . There is no torsional strain , so this is one of the more stable shapes that the molecule can adopt . However , it is not the same shape as the other staggered conformer ( the one we called " gauche " ) . This one is called the " anti " conformer . <p> Figure CA3.7 . Ball-and-stick model of butane . This shape is called the " anti " conformation . <p> These conformations of butane are really pretty different . Which shape would the molecule prefer ? From what we learned about ethane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each of those would have 3 kcal/mol of torsional strain . <p> However , there is another factor that destabilizes the initial conformation at 0 degrees , in favour of the Z-shaped one with the methyl groups 180 degrees apart from each other . This factor is called " sterics " and it refers to the idea that molecules , or parts of molecules , take up space , and so two parts of the butane ca n't occupy the same place at the same time . Put more simply , sterics refers to crowdedness . When the two methyl groups in butane are too close together , they are too crowded , and they are at higher energy . When they get farther apart , crowding subsides and the energy in the molecule goes down . <p> Torsional strain forces bonds on neighbouring carbons to be staggered . <p> Steric strain forces groups away from each other to relieve crowding . <p> Torsion and sterics both contribute to strain energy . <p> Strain can be released by getting the molecule in a lower energy conformation . <p> For butane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other and keeping the bonds staggered . <p> There is some additional jargon that is used to describe these butane conformations : <p> In an anti conformer , the largest groups are 1800 from each other . <p> In a gauche conformer , the bonds are staggered but the largest groups are 600 from each other . <p> Because of different steric interactions , the most stable conformer is the anti conformer . The second-most stable conformer is the gauche conformer . The other shapes we have looked at , the two eclipsed conformations , are not very stable at all . At room temperature , a bottle of butane gas has enough energy that the individual molecules can allow their bonds to spin around , sampling different shapes . However , at any given time , most of the molecules will be found in the anti conformer , because each of those molecules will spend most of its time in the most stable conformation . Some of the molecules will be found in the gauche conformer , because that is the second-most stable conformation . None of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those are points of maximum energy . The molecules have enough energy to rock back and forth a little bit , and sometimes they will not rotate all the way through an eclipsed conformation , but they wo n't stop there . Instead , they will keep rotating until they get to another staggered conformer . <p> A butane molecule spends most of its time in the anti confrmer . <p> A butane molecule spends some of its time in the gauche conformer . <p> A butane molecule spends almost noe of its time in eclipsed conformations . <p> Note that we have two very similar words : conformation and conformer . They are related , but not the same thing . <p> A conformation is any shape that a molecule can adopt . <p> A conformer is a conformation that is stable enough so that a molecule can adopt for significant amount of time . <p> Problem CA3.1 .

The husband was Tai Yen , and the wife was Yu Do . They were nice to other people and had kind hearts . The old couple lived happily , but what bothered them the most was that they had n't had any children . They continuously went to temples to ask Gods for a child . They even worked twice as hard as others despite of their ages as they wanted Gods to see that they should be compensated for their diligence . The more they got old , the more desperate they were to get their wish fulfilled . Considering the couple 's dedication and sympathizing for their desperation , God told his 10th son to reincarnate as the Tai family 's only son . Shortly later , Yu Do gave birth to a boy , and the couple named him Tai Sen. <p> 1 . Tai Sen as a baby <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly after the born of Tai Sen because of tiredness and blood loss . Tai Yen had to raise his son by himself . During his very first years of life , Tai Sen was taught how to farm and how to survive . With his intelligence and super strength , Tai Sen in no time was able to take care of himself and even of his father . By the year that Tai Sen was 10 years old , Tai Yen died . Tai Sen lived alone in the straw house that his parents left to him . <p> One day , a dumpling seller named Ty Zon was resting in front of Tai Sen 's house . Ty Zon was cunning and he acknowledged that Tai Sen was strong and smart . Noticing that Tai Sen was living alone , Ty Zon offered him to get to Ty Zon 's house in another village to help selling dumpling : <p> My dear , I see that you live here all by yourself . It must be painful to anyone who lives lonely without someone who cares about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also live alone , so I can understand you well and we can become best friends . <p> Tai Sen , all alone , moved by the fact that someone finally cared about his existence , agreed . <p> 2 . Tai Sen and Ty Zon became best friends <p> Tai Sen and Ty Zon got closer and closer together as they lived in the same home . Tai Sen helped Ty Zon sell dumplings and Ty Zon just had to stay home and make dumplings . They made each other brother . Ty Zon was older so he was agreed to be the older brother , Tai Sen was the younger brother . <p> At that time , in Ty Zon 's village existed a Great monster Serpent who lived more than a hundred years and mastered many kinds of magic . It lived in a temple and had killed many people . The Emperor had been trying to kill it many times with his military but only failed . Then he had to negotiate with the Serpent and it demanded one person 's life for meal every month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serpent , he promised to have his daughter married to anyone who can kill it . <p> That year was Ty Zon 's turn to give his life to the Serpent . He panicked . He planned to trick Tai Sen to replace himself . Tai Sen , obviously , was ignorant of the fact that there existed such danger because he was from another village . <p> That day , when Tai Sen came back from selling dumplings , Ty Zon offered him a cup of wine and began : <p> Tonight it 's my turn to guard at the Temple , but I have to make a lot more dumplings to meet our customers ' orders . Would you like to come to the Temple to guard so I can make more dumplings and we do n't lose our customers ? <p> Tai Sen accepted without a second thought and left as soon as the sun set . <p> At midnight , the Great Serpent appeared , along with its long sharp fangs and poisonous breath . Tai Sen , widely awake as he was not comfortable with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of the Serpent . <p> 3 . Tai Sen versus Great monster Serpent <p> At first he freaked out and screamed for help but the villagers who heard his voice were too frightened to give him a hand . Then Tai Sen regained his calmness and grasped a sword on the statue of God 's hand to fight against the Serpent . The Serpent breathed out poisonous air from its mouth , but Tai Sen quickly blew it away with his super powerful breath . The Serpent then spitted out fire which burned the whole temple . Tai Sen was fast , he dodged the fire and quickly approached the Serpent 's side . In the light of the fire , the Great monster Serpent realized its former master 's face . The Serpent was formerly a pet which belonged to the 10th son of God . One day it managed to flee away and now it met its old master . The flashbacks and memories made the Serpent freeze for a second , but that was enough time for Tai Sen to chop off its head . Tai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the body melted , the golden archery appeared in the place of the serpent 's melted skin . It was the God 's golden archery that the Serpent swallowed in order to manage magical powers . <p> 4 . The temple was totally burned by the Serpent 's fire <p> Tai Sen was happy that he survived , running home cheerfully and showed the Serpents ' head and the golden archery . He told the story to Ty Zon and he was amazed . Tai Sen was also amazed as the archery was so heavy that no one but him could lift it . <p> Ty Zon quickly came up with a new plan to trick Tai Sen again . He told Tai Sen : <p> Oh my , what have you done , my dear brother ? The Serpent and the temple that were burned were the Emperor 's treasures . The destruction of them would cause a disaster to our family and the village . The Emperor will not let us go with this . <p> Tai Sen changed his mood immediately from cheerfulness to fearfulness : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what should we do ? <p> Now you have to get away from here , I 'll take the responsibility with the Emperor so you can live . That 's the least that an older brother can do to save a younger brother . <p> No , I 'll take the responsibilities myself , you do n't need to die for me . <p> It is insulting to me that I can not fulfill the role of an older brother , you have to understand this . <p> Tai Sen reluctantly left Ty Zon 's house and got back to his parents ' home , along with the golden archery . <p> Ty Zon then took the Serpent 's head to the Emperor . The Emperor was amazed , happily assigned Ty Zon to be the General and gave him a lot of money and power . And as promised , the Emperor had his prettiest daughter , princess Xu Ka , to marry Ty Zon . <p> 5 . Wealth of Ty Zon exceeded his wildest imagination <p> Everything was going in the right way for Ty Zon until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the horse-ride wedding carriage , a monstrously huge Hawk grabbed her and fled away . <p> Tai Sen was then having a break after reaping fruits in his garden . He saw a Hawk with a person seized in its feet , decided to rescue the person . He got his archery and shot at the Hawk . The Hawk immediately noticed the arrow and dodged it . It flew higher into the clouds to get out of Tai Sen 's shooting range . Tai Sen tried again but he failed to aim straight to the Hawk as it had got so far away . No other choices , Tai Sen took out his golden archery and aimed straight to the Hawk . Once the arrow was released , it rocketed with an incredible speed and was directed by the magic of the archery straight to the left wing of the Hawk . The monster bird took a wound , quickly got to its cave . Tai Sen followed the Hawk 's blood to track for the person , who happened to be princess Xu Ka . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archery <p> At the same time , the Emperor rushed to look for his dear princess . He ordered the General , Ty Zon , to take a military squad to rescue the princess . Ty Zon took his squad and went ask everyone on the way if they had seen the big Hawk . They met Tai Sen on the way , who is also tracking through the blood . Tai Sen cried out happily when he saw Ty Zon still alive : <p> Brother Ty Zon , you 're alive . You 're not punished ? I 'm so happy and relieved to see you again . <p> Ty Zon was in a rush , but he was still calm enough to deceive Tai Sen : <p> I was kept in prison to wait for the day of execution . But when the day came , the princess was abducted by a big hawk . The Emperor ordered me to look for the princess as he thought I had some experiences in handling mysterious creatures . If I could find the princess , I can be forgiven for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> What a coincident ! If that is the case , then it would not be any easier , since I 'm also tracking the hawk . We just have to follow where this blood leads and save the princess . <p> You never ceased to amaze me , my dear little brother . Please lead the way then . <p> Tai Sen led the way . At the same time , Ty Zon was creating a new plan in his head to trick Tai Sen again . <p> As soon as they approached the cave where the hawk hid itself , Tai Sen got in when others stayed out as they were afraid of the darkness and the anticipated danger . Tai Sen found princess Xu Ka on the ground . They immediately fell for each other . Tai Sen was stunned by the princess 's beauty , and the princess was struck by Tai Sen 's manliness and courage . Xu Ka then promised to herself that she would only marry Tai Sen. <p> Tai Sen took Xu Ka to the entrance of the cave . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot to take his golden archery with him . When the princess was safe , Tai Sen realized that he left the archery in the cave and came back to get it . The chance has come for Ty Zon , he let his squad go ahead and take the princess back to the palace , whilst he came back to the cave with Tai Sen. He ordered them : <p> You guys take the princess to the Emperor , I am going to escort my dear brother to get his treasure back . <p> Once Tai Sen and Ty Zon were at the cave 's entrance , Tai Sen told Ty Zon to wait for him outside and he is going to get in the cave alone . Ty Zon understood his brother so much that he could anticipate Tai Sen would offer so , so he agreed . When Tai Sen got in the cave , Ty Zon blew the cave entrance up with explosives . <p> Tai Sen , after getting his golden archery , was stuck in the cave and he tried to find a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawk 's doing that he was stuck there . He wandered around and examined every corner of the cave . After a while , Tai Sen found a room where many people were tied to the wall . He untied them . These people happened to be the princes and princesses of the five neighbor countries . They were captured by the Hawk to be its meal , because the Hawk believed that eating the Emperor 's children once a year would make it immortal . <p> 8 . Tied up princesses <p> The princes and princesses showed Tai Sen to where the Hawk lived in the cave . The Hawk was found badly wounded , its left wing was completely burned , and blood poured out everywhere . Tai Sen was urged by the princes and princesses to kill the Hawk . But as he had a kind heart , he could n't go ahead and kill a defenseless creature which was waiting to die . He treated the Hawk with the help of the princes and princesses . The Hawk was healed quickly . It thanked Tai Sen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the favor , the Hawk turned into a golden arrow which can pierce and destroy any targets , and the arrow would return to its master when it had destroyed the target . <p> 9 . Golden Archery and golden arrow <p> Tai Sen used his golden archery and golden arrow to destroy the rocks that sealed the cave 's entrance . Tai Sen , the princes and princesses escaped . They headed to the Emperor 's palace as the princes and princesses offered . <p> At the same time , Ty Zon was going to get married to princess Xu Ka . Princess Xu Ka , who promised to herself that she would only marry Tai Sen , was so angry when Ty Zon took all Tai Sen 's merits that she turned mute . She could not reveal to her father that Ty Zon was n't the one that deserved all these glory . <p> On the day of Ty Zon and princess Xu Ka 's marriage , the five neighbor countries declared war to the Emperor . The reason was that all 5 countries ' oldest princes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all denied . The moment princess Xu Ka was done with her makeups was when the 5 countries ' armies approached the city 's wall . <p> 10 . Armies of 5 neighbor countries approached the Emperor 's palace <p> The Emperor did not have any other choices than letting his General take the army and handle the enemies . Ty Zon freaked out as he had no idea how to deal with the situation . But with the pride of a General , he was forced to lead the army and was killed immediately . His body could not keep its shape after he died as countless horses had treaded on it . <p> The Emperor was so confused and frightened that he could do nothing but praying for luck from God . <p> And God replied . When the enemies approached the palace , Tai Sen appeared in the middle of chaos , he screamed out loud : <p> People , please stop . Let me deal with this ! <p> The fighting paused for a second . The voice of Tai Sen frightened everyone as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war . Tai Sen showed to the crowd the abducted princes and princesses from the five countries that he just saved from the monster Hawk . The armies quickly lifted off their weapons , and bowed to the princes and princesses on their knees . The princes and princesses ordered the armies to stop and retreat right away . They said thank to Tai Sen and headed back to their countries with their armies . <p> Princess Xu Ka realized her lover , utter " Tai Sen " , after a while being mute . The Emperor said thank you to Tai Sen , but he wondered why his daughter knew this hero 's name . Tai Sen and princess Xu Ka told the Emperor the whole story , from when Tai Sen killed the Great monster Serpent . <p> 11 . Tai Sen and princess Xu Ka got married and lived happily together <p> The Emperor delightfully accepted Tai Sen as his new son-in law and shortly later , he also gave him his crown and the country . Emperor Tai Sen and his wife Xu Ka then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrow were to serve for the purpose of keeping peace for the land . 
@@71697777 @397777/ <p> Macromolecules are very large molecules . Their molecular weights can range from the thousands to the millions . Typically they are constructed from small , repeating units linked together in some way . <p> Describing the molecular weight of a polymer is not as straightforward as it is in a small molecule . The fact that each macromolecule is built by joining together a large number of monomers complicates things . Exactly how many monomers are there in one polymer molecule ? Twenty ? Twenty-five ? Thirty ? Each of those possibilities would have a very different molecular weight . <p> This is generally the case in macromolecules , whether we are dealing with commercial or biological samples . Polymers are grown , often through the action of some " initiator " that picks up a monomer and starts knitting together a chain . What if one of the initiators starts a little later than the others ? What if one of the chains grows a little faster than the others ? What if something goes wrong and one chain stops growing ? <p> As a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of molecular weights representing a distribution of chain lengths . There is no exact molecular weight . Instead , an average must be determined . <p> Problem MM7.1 . <p> Explain the general relationship between degree of polymerization and molecular weight of the chain . <p> Problem MM7.2 . <p> Calculate the molecular weight of each of the following polymer chains . For simplicity , assume the end groups are just hydrogen atoms in each case . <p> a ) polystyrene ( PS ) with DP = 1,000 <p> b ) polylactide ( PLA ) with DP = 200 <p> c ) poly ( ethylene oxide ) ( PEO ) with DP = 50 <p> d ) polypropylene ( PP ) with DP = 100,000 <p> There are many different ways of estimating the average molecular weight of a polymer . These methods fall into two categories , giving rise to two different estimates of the average molecular weight . <p> In some techniques , the total weight of a sample is measured followed by a determination of the number of molecules present . The molecular weight is just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity is called the number average molecular weight , or Mn . <p> A classic example of this type of measurement is a freezing point depression . A pure liquid freezes at a specific temperature , but impurities in the liquid tend to interfere with crystal formation , lowering the freezing point . The change in freezing point depends on the number of molecules present in the impurity . In this approach , a measured amount of polymer would be dissolved in a specific quantity of toluene and the freezing point would be measured very carefully . The polymer in this context is acting as an impurity . The change in freezing point would indicate the number of molecules ( or moles ) of the impurity . The average molecular weight could then be calculated . <p> Other techniques rely on measurements that depend on the relative size of the macromolecules , rather than the number of them . The quantity determined this way is called the weight average molecular weight , or Mw . <p> A classic example of this type of measurement is a light-scatterring experiment . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polymer . Some of the light is scattered when it encounters polymer molecules , and the interference patterns in the scattered light can be decoded to give information about the particle size . <p> Typically , techniques that depend on particle size are more heavily influenced by the larger particles , and so Mw &gt; Mn . The closer these numbers are to each other , the more uniform the partciles must be . The more different they are , the broader the distribution present . Consequently , the ratio Mw/Mn , historically called the polydispersity index ( PDI ) , is an important indicator of how uniform the molecules are in size . " Polydisperse " as an adjective means that there is a wide distribution of sizes , as opposed to " monodisperse " , meaning everything is the same size . <p> IUPAC has recently decided that the term " polydispersity index " should be abandoned in favour of the more concise term , dispersity ( - ) . <p> Problem MM7.4 . <p> Determine the polydispersity in each of the following cases . <p> a ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mn = 102,365 ; Mw = 124,710 <p> c ) Mn = 56,300 ; Mw = 87,530 <p> d ) Mn = 8,105 ; Mw = 14,220 <p> e ) Mn = 1,170,000 ; Mw = 1,899,000 <p> These days , two of the most common techniques for estimating molecular weight are 1H NMR spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography ( although other techniques such as light scattering are still used ) . We 'll take a closer look at NMR analysis in a minute . First we 'll start with a simplified view of size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) or , as it is sometimes called , gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) . <p> In SEC , a sample is sent through a column containing a porous gel . Generally , smaller molecules that wander into the pores within the gel take longer to get through the column . Larger molecules that ca n't fit into the pores emerge sooner . The effluent from the column is monitored by a technique such as UV-Vis spectroscopy or refractive index . The response from this detector changes over time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they come out of the column . The output from the instrument shows a distribution , not unlike a bell curve , indicating the distribution of molecular weights by comparison with a standard sample . <p> The drawing above shows you what a chromatogram or trace would look like for two different samples , one of higher molecular weight and one of lower molecular weight . The retention time in a GPC trace does not directly indicate the molecular weight of the polymer . A calibration has to be run . In a calibration , polymers of known molecular weight are run through the GPC and their chromatograms are obtained . The GPC trace of an unknown polymer , run on the same instrument under the same conditions , is then compared to the standard ones . Software is used to estimate the molecular weight and the polydispersity . <p> Problem MM7.5 . <p> Suppose the following drawing shows calibration traces for the chromatogram shown above ( D stands for Daltons , another name for the units " g/mol " ) . Estimate the molecular weight of <p> a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high molecular weight unknown . <p> Problem MM7.6 . <p> SEC , which is based on the size of a coiled polymer molecule , can sometimes give misleading estimates of the molecular weight . Explain why with the help of the following diagram . <p> NMR spectroscopy is a method that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to detect different kinds of atoms in a sample . 1H NMR detects the hydrogen atoms in a sample . It is conceptually very similar to MRI used in hospitals and clinics . In the experiment , the sample is placed in a very strong magnetic field ( somewhere on the order of a hundred thousand times greater than the earth 's magnetic field on the planet 's surface ) . Radio waves are sent through the sample . Most of them pass straight through , but some of them are absorbed by the hydrogen atoms . <p> The result of the NMR experiment is an NMR spectrum . A spectrum is really just a graph . On the x axis , it shows all the possible frequencies of the radio waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axis , it shows the absorption level : in other words , how much of the radio waves at each frequency that were absorbed by the sample . Did a particular frequency of radio waves just pass right through the sample ? The absorbance at that frequency would be zero . If a particular frequency is absorbed , there will be a " peak " on the graph ( a high point ) at that frequency . <p> Each peak in the NMR spectrum corresponds to a hydrogen in a different environment . Maybe the hydrogen is attached to an oxygen atom , or a carbon atom , and so on . In the drawing shown above , the spectrum indicates three different locations for hydrogen atoms in the molecule . Note that " frequency " in NMR is called " chemical shift " , for historical reasons . The units of chemical shift are parts per million , or ppm , for reasons that have to do with the mechanics of the experiment . <p> But how does that help us with molecular weight ? We 're getting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many hydrogens we have of each type , at least in a relative sense . It could tell us we have equal amounts of hydrogens in these three locations , or maybe twice as many in one location as there are in the other two . The relationship is pretty simple : the more hydrogens there are in a particular location , the bigger the peak associated with them . That 's because if one hydrogen atom absorbs one radio frequency photon , two hydrogen atoms would absorb two radio frequency photons . That 's twice as much . The peak should be twice as big for two hydrogens as it would be for one hydrogen . <p> What do we mean by " bigger " , though ? It turns out that the height of the peak does n't really tell us anything . What matters is the area of the peak . That 's because even for two seemingly identical protons in a sample , there are lots of factors that mess with the radio frequency absorbed , ever so slightly . So , if a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ppm , a hydrogen in the exact same position in a second molecule might absorb at 1.7007 ppm . There are lots of complicated reasons for that . The result , however , is that NMR peaks get smeared out a little bit , so that it is n't the height that matters , but the area , which is the sum of a whole lot of very similar radio frequencies absorbed by those identical hydrogens in different molecules . <p> So we need to measure the areas of those peaks . Fortunately , NMR spectrometers are equipped with software that can do this . Classically , the instrument would print a red line across the spectrum . The red line would hop up every time it passed over a peak . The amount of each hop corresponded to the relative area of the peak . <p> Notice that we do n't even bother to label the y axis anymore . It does n't tell us anything , anyway . <p> The drawing below emphasizes what we are measuring with the integral line . It is the vertical distance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That distance is called the " integral " . In this case , the integrals of the three peaks are all about equal . <p> Now it 's time to see how 1H NMR spectroscopy can reveal molecular weight through a measurement called " end group analysis " . <p> Consider the polymer poly ( ethylene glycol ) , or PEG . PEG is commonly used in medicine . By itself it can be used as a laxative , depending on its molecular weight . It can also be mixed with pharmaceuticals ; it helps control side effects and spreads the medicinal effect over a longer time , so you do n't have to take the medicine as often . <p> Frequently , there is an OH group at both ends of the chain . In the middle , the polymer is made of CH2CH2O repeating units . <p> PEG can be thought of as a polymer of ethylene glycol ( or ethane-1,2-diol ) . The structure of ethylene glycol is provided below . The structure of ethylene glycol shows two different kinds of hydrogens . There are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are hydrogens at the ends of the chain , attached to oxygens . The 1H NMR spectrum of ethylene would show a different peak for each of those types of hydrogens . There would be two peaks . <p> The spectrum also shows an integration line . We have measured the integral for each peak . It looks like a 2:1 ratio , because the vertical distance in one case is 24 mm and in the other case it is only 12 mm . Even if you do n't know anything else about NMR spectroscopy , you can see that the peak around 4 ppm must correspond to the hydrogens on the carbons , whereas the peak around 1 ppm must correspond to the hydrogens on the oxygens . That 's because there are four hydrogens on the carbons and only two on the oxygens . The ratio is 2:1 . <p> The structure of PEG is pretty similar to that of ethylene glycol , except that it has a bunch of units strung in a row . The NMR spectrum of PEG is pretty similar to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we compare the integral of a hydrogen found at the end of the chain to the integral of one found along the chain , in the repeating unit . In PEG , the end group is the OH group at either end . The repeat unit corresponds to the hydrogens on the carbons . <p> In the case above , there are two hydrogen in the end groups ( one at each end ) . The four repeat units have four hydrogens each , for a total of sixteen . The integration ratio should be 16:2 , or 8:1 . The measured ratio is 48:6 , or 8:1 . <p> Contrast that result with the case of ethylene glycol , in which there isbasically just one repeat unit . The ratio in the oligomer ( short polymer ) is four times greater than the ratio in the monomer . That 's because there are four times as many repeat units in the oligomer . We sometimes call the number of repeat units in the chain the " degree of polymerization " . <p> Problem MM7.7 . <p> Expand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole chain , rather than just the repeat unit in parentheses . <p> Problem MM7.8 . <p> What would be the integration ratio in the following oligomer ? <p> To estimate chain length in NMR , a peak must be found from one of the repeating units along the chain as well as a peak from an end group , found only at the end of the chain . The integration of the repeating unit to the end group indicates the average number of repeating units per polymer . This technique essentially provides Mn . <p> Problem MM7.9 . <p> What is the molecular weight of the 4-unit PEG oligomer , the NMR spectrum of which was shown above ? <p> In the next example , you are going to see a peculiar fact of life . The truth is , OH groups often do n't show up well in 1H NMR spectroscopy ( for complicated reasons ) . That can complicate things . To get around that problem , people often make polymers in such a way that there is a different end group , other than an OH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily . <p> Problem MM7.10 . <p> Use the integration ratio in the following spectrum to estimate the degree of polymerization. 74907 @qwx694907

These monkeys could also talk and they decided to name the boy " Barth " . Over the years Barth grew big and strong , his survival skills were great because he had to learn to protect himself against the dangers deep into the jungle . His arsenal of defensive moves included powerful kicks , head butts , and even the ability to fling his own feces at predators before running away . <p> Barth became very popular among his fellow monkeys because of both his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said that he was strong enough to bench press weight equal to that of a full-grown elephant As Barth aged through his adolescent years the monkeys began to praise Barth and looked up to him as a leader . By the time that Barth was 20 years old , the elderly monkeys called for a council , after a brief discussion they decided to crown him as King Barth . They also decided to offer up their most beautiful female monkey to marry him , her name was Karyn . Karyn was the most gorgeous ape in all of the jungle . She was a model for Banana Republic . All of the male monkey 's jaws would instantly drop at the way she dragged her knuckles when she walked by . King Barth grew deeply in love with Karyn and he would spoil her with hundreds of bananas everyday . While Barth continued to grow fonder of his lovely wife everyday , Karyn unfortunately did n't do the same . She appreciated how nice he was and was extremely attracted to his strong body , but she just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit next to him and had to sleep on a different branch at night . <p> One day Karyn came up with a brilliant idea of setting out on a quest to find a bunch of magical red and blue roses that could be grinded up to make the most powerful deodorant in the world . She figured that if she found these flowers and made the deodorant for Barth then she would fall in love with him because he would n't smell so horribly nasty and then they could live happily ever after . <p> She woke up early the next morning and set out for " Hawaiian Falls " which was the only place in the jungle to find these magical flowers because they could only grow in the fertile soil at the bottom of the waterfall . She had only been journeying for a couple hours when she came to a complete halt . She heard a massive splash a little way down the river and saw ripples in the water coming in her direction . She was horrified but knew she must keep following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falls " . She continued on her way and started to forget about the splashes when all of a sudden something massive jumped out of the water and grabbed her in its mouth . It was a giant black tortoise . She had heard tales about such a creature before , it was said that these giant monsters are so vicious that if you ever see one it is impossible to survive in one piece . Karyn screamed as loud as she could but there was nobody in sight to help her . The tortoise held Karyn in its jaws and walked slowly back to its lair to prepare his meal for the night ; luckily a little red parrot was hanging out in the trees above the river and heard Karyn yelling . This parrot recognized her as the wife of King Barth and immediately flew back to the Monkey Kingdom to tell the king the horrific news . <p> The parrot flew swiftly and arrived at the Monkey Kingdom in less than an hour . It flew straight up to the throne but maintained a safe distance because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ape , King Ape , Squawk , I carry horrible news , your beautiful monkey wife was captured by a giant black tortoise . I saw it with my own eyes , Squawk . " <p> King Barth responded , " How can this be ? I would never let her venture outside of my kingdom because it is far too dangerous " . <p> The parrot quickly fired back " Master Ape , it appeared she was traveling to Hawaiian Falls to obtain the magical roses as a gift to you , Squawk " . <p> King Barth was puzzled by this and thought to himself , " Do I really smell that bad ? " <p> King Barth immediately set out to travel towards the layer of the giant black tortoise . He flew through the air at a graceful pace as he swung from branch to branch . King Barth was like a modern day Michael Jordan as he put on an aerial performance while flying gracefully through the air . Barth could n't stop thinking about his lovely wife and how badly he would hurt if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He prayed to the God 's of the jungle saying , " Please save my beautiful wife and I will be the most loyal and generous King in the history of our monkey kingdom . Do not let the giant black tortoise kill her or I will be broken-hearted and my life will be meaningless " . <p> A few moments later King Barth heard a crack of thunder and then came a loud powerful voice , it said , " Do not worry Barth , your wife is still alive , but you must hurry . I will let you prove your worth as the king of the apes if you can defeat the giant black tortoise in it 's lair " . <p> Barth then yelled as loudly as he could in response to the Gods , " I am ever grateful of your power and mercy , I also have one more wish .... Would it be possible for you to get rid of my nasty body odor ? " <p> A loud rumbling voice replied chuckling , " Nobody is perfect " . <p> Barth sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lair . When he arrived he noticed the size of the footprints leading inside the cavern and thoughts of instant terror shot down his spine . He started to tiptoe into the dark abyss on the hillside when a swarm of bats flew past his ears . He jumped backwards in horror and let out a brief squeal . <p> A booming voice came from the darkness saying , " Who dares to enter my lair uninvited ? " <p> Barth was so horrified that he could n't control his bodily functions and his stomach started gargling . Just then a loud roar came from the darkness and Barth immediately lost control . His feces shot straight to the floor at the speed of light and without thinking Barth started to fling it in the direction of the monster . This startled the tortoise and it jumped out of the darkness and it ran to the light side of the cavern . <p> The tortoise yelled , " What kind of evil magic is this ? Fight like the man you are , not a monkey " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he responded , " Do you know who I am ? You are messing with the wrong guy . I am King Barth of the monkey kingdom and you better give me my wife back or I will crush you " . <p> Barth ran in towards the giant black tortoise and gave it an array of kicks and a punishing head butt . The Tortoise swung a heavy claw towards his head but just barely missed . It then stretched its neck out an incredible distance and snapped its jaws shut just short of Barth 's face . Barth then realized that desperate times call for desperate measures and he reached for the ground to grab a jagged stone and flung it straight for the tortoise 's eye . It was a direct hit and the tortoise howled in pain . The sound was so loud that it shattered the stone roof of the cavern and it slowly came crumbling down . Luckily Barth was extremely agile and dodged the falling rock pieces while sprinting to the other side of the cavern . The tortoise was n't so lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the roof . Barth walked through a short tunnel and saw his beautiful wife lying there . Karyn was badly wounded in both legs from the bites of the tortoise but could n't have been more excited to see her husband . She was so overwhelmed with joy that she did n't even care how horribly awful his stench was . She fell right into his arms and gave him a big juicy monkey smooch . The truly remarkable thing about this was that she did n't pass out or regurgitate from the vomit-inducing smell that seeped up into her nostrils . <p> " Barth , thank you so much for coming to save me , you are the most loyal and courageous husband that I could have ever asked for " , Karyn told him . <p> " You are the most beautiful ape that I have ever laid my eyes on and I am a lucky man . I do n't know how to put this but ... That thing is nice " . <p> " Oh ... thanks Barth . You have such a way with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hey Barth , before we head back to our kingdom , do you think we could travel further to the ' Hawaiian Falls ' to find some of the magical red and blue roses ? " <p> " I mean if we must really go to those extremes for you to love me , then yes . Let 's fix this smell for once and for all " , Barth embarrassingly muttered . <p> King Barth used his massive pectoral muscles to carry his beautiful wife out of the tortoise 's lair and venture on to the " Hawaiian Falls " . Once they were within a couple of miles it was easy to tell the flowers were near because of the wonderful smells that were in the air . When they finally arrived to the falls Barth was in awe for he had never seen a place with such natural beauty . He had never been this far to the north of the jungle in his life ; the florescent smells throughout the air seemed to neutralize his toxic odor . <p> " Barth , I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " proclaimed Karyn . The two locked eyes and smiled in amusement . <p> " Let 's get out of here " , Barth said with utter resilience . The two journeyed back to Monkey Kingdom as King Barth flexed his enormous pectorals with confidence while holding his lovely ape lady . The rest of the monkeys were filled with joy at the sight of their King and Queen returning . Little did they know that the parrot had told the rest of the kingdom about their lady being captured and had prepared a banana and beer festival in anticipation of their return . <p> " Let 's get a little crazy ! " Shouted King Barth as he threw his fists into the air . " This is a time for celebration and respect for the Gods . Without their blessings , I never would have been able to save Karyn and for that we should all say a prayer " . <p> Then Karyn chimed in , " And without your courage Barth I would n't have been able to fall in love with you and I also would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Banana Republic " ( Multiple monkey 's jaws dropped instantly at the thought of her in a skimpy monkey bikini ) . <p> The entire nation of monkeys then proceeded to hold hands to pray together and rejoiced , " Us apes are ever so grateful for all of the blessings we have . May our bananas be ever plentiful , may our trees stay strong with many branches , and may our nation forever flourish . OOOH OOOH AH AH AH " They screamed together ! King Barth and Queen Karyn lived on happily ever after and the flowers in the deodorant that Karyn made for Barth worked wonders . He no longer smelled horribly and Karyn even decided to sleep on the same branch as him at night . 
@@71697781 @397781/ <p> Most rings found in nature are part of a larger structure , so understanding the shape of the ring is just the beginning of the question of conformation . How will substituents that are attached to the ring affect the shape ? Let 's look at substituted cyclohexanes , because they are very common and because their flexibility allows them to adopt very different shapes in order to accommodate attached groups . <p> Remember that in the chair form of cyclohexane , which has already been established as the most stable conformation by several kcal/mol , there are hydrogens in two distinct positions : <p> axial positions <p> equatorial positions . <p> Replacing one of these hydrogens with a methyl group would result in the methyl group sitting in either an axial or equatorial position . Let 's assume it 's in an axial position , which is above or below the ring rather than out to the sides . <p> We know that there is no torsional strain in the chair , and we 'll assume that the methyl group can be oriented such that it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for steric strains . You will find that the methyl hydrogens are close to the two axial hydrogens on the same face of the ring . This is a six atom interaction in each case . <p> We will assume that the methyl group is rotating freely such that only one of its hydrogens is close enough to these axial neighbours to cause steric strain , but there will be strain with both of those axial hydrogens . <p> Sighting along the CH2--C(H)Me bond on the edge of the ring , you can see that the interaction between the axial methyl and an axial hydrogen resembles the gauche interaction in butane . These two steric interactions will cause an increase in strain energy of about 2 kcal/mol . <p> This chair conformation is undoubtedly somewhat stable ; there is much less strain in this compound , for instance , than there was in the boat conformation of cyclohexane . However , it 's possible that there is an even more stable conformation , and if so we should be able to find that conformation by twisting around some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are usually two different chair conformations that can be accessed via a " ring flip " . To see this , grasp a model of methylcyclohexane and identify two corners at opposite ends of the hexagon ( the first and fourth carbons in the ring ) . One of these corners will be pointing down ; push it up . The other corner will be pointing up ; push it down . In doing so , all the other corners of the ring will change positions from down to up and from up to down as well , so that you end up with a new chair . <p> If you carry out a ring flip on methylcyclohexane , you will find that the methyl group moves between an axial position and an equatorial one depending on which form of the chair conformation it begins in . The actual compound can do this pretty easily at room temperature ; although these two chairs occupy energy minima , the energy barrier between them is pretty low . It 's possible that one of these conformations is a global minimum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of methylcyclohexane , with the methyl group in an equatorial position . <p> There need be no torsional strains . <p> The methyl group is not very close to any neighbouring hydrogens . It is 5 atoms away from a couple of the other equatorial hydrogens , but 5 atom interactions are not large enough to worry about . <p> As a result , there is no significant strain energy in this conformation . This is the most stable conformer of methylcyclohexane . <p> It is usually the case that when substituents are in equatorial positions , the conformation is more stable , for the same reasons that we saw with methylcyclohexane : it is pointing outward , away from the rest of the ring , rather than sharing the space above the ring with other atoms .

@@71697782 @397782/ <p> There is additional information obtained from 1H NMR spectroscopy that is not typically available from 13C NMR spectroscopy . Chemical shift can show how many different types of hydrogens are found in a molecule ; integration reveals the number of hydrogens of each type . <p> Looking at the spectrum of ethanol , you can see that there are three different kinds of hydrogens in the molecule . You can also see by integration that there are three hydrogens of one type , two of the second type , and one of the third type -- corresponding to the CH3 or methyl group , the CH2 or methylene group and the OH or hydroxyl group . That information helps narrow down the number of possible structures of the sample , and so it makes structure elucidation of an unknown sample much easier . <p> integration reveals the ratio of one type of hydrogen to another within a molecule . <p> Integral data can be given in different forms . You should be aware of all of them . In raw form , an integral is a horizontal line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line crosses the frequency of a peak , the area of the peak is measured . This measurement is shown as a jump or step upward in the integral line ; the vertical distance that the line rises is proportional to the area of the peak . The area is related to the amount of radio waves absorbed at that frequency , and the amount of radio waves absorbed is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms absorbing the radio waves . <p> The following spectrum was recorded with a sample of ethanol in deuterochloroform ( CDCl3 ) . Ethanol has the condensed formula CH3CH2OH . Its 1H NMR spectrum should reflect a 3:2:1 ratio of hydrogens . <p> Those ratios are shown by the height that the blue integral line " hops " or " steps " as it passes each peak . There are three peaks in ethanol : a sharp peak near 4 ppm , a little blob near 1.5 ppm and another sharp peak near 1 ppm . The first step in the integral line , near 4 ppm , is pretty big . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half as big as the first one . The third step , near 1 ppm , looks a little bigger than the first . Without getting out a ruler , it 's hard to judge exactly how big , but maybe it 's 1.5 times bigger than the first . <p> Figure NMR16.1H NMR spectrum of ethanol with solid integral line . <p> Source : Spectrum taken in CDCl3 on a Varian Gemini 2000 Spectrometer with 300 MHz Oxford magnet . <p> That means the ratio of these peaks is 1:0.5:1.5 . That 's the same thing as a 2:1:3 ratio . We are probably looking at , from left to right , the CH2 , the OH and the CH3 in the ethanol . <p> We 'll get back to looking at that ratio within ethanol in a moment . Meanwhile , it 's worth noting that there is an additional , small peak in the spectrum near 7.25 ppm . That 's a little bit of regular chloroform , CHCl3 , in the CDCl3 solvent used for the NMR spectrum . You might imagine that it 's pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by the presence or absence of one neutron . Consequently , there is always a tiny amount of CHCl3 in a bottle of CDCl3 . But why is that peak so tiny ? nd why does the integral line barely budge upwards as it passes over the peak ? If there is one H in CHCl3 , should its integral match the 1H in ethanol ? <p> Let 's get back to the ethanol spectrum and look at some different ways in which we can view the integration . Sometimes , the integral line is cut into separate integrals for each peak so that they can be compared to each other more easily . <p> Figure NMR17.1H NMR spectrum of ethanol with broken integral line . <p> Source : Spectrum taken in CDCl3 on a Varian Gemini 2000 Spectrometer with 300 MHz Oxford magnet . <p> In the picture above , it 's easier to see the 2:1:3 ratio between the peaks . <p> Often , instead of displaying raw data , the integrals are measured and their heights are displayed on the spectrum . <p> Figure NMR18.1H NMR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spectrum taken in CDCl3 on a Varian Gemini 2000 Spectrometer with 300 MHz Oxford magnet . <p> The numbers under the spectrum read , from left to right , 29.76 , then 14.99 and finally 53.48 . Roughly , these numbers are 30:15:54 . That 's close to a 2:1:3 ratio , although 30:15:45 would be an even better fit . Note that the numerical printout we get does not exactly match the ratio we expect ; in fact , it seems a little worse than the ratio we roughly estimated by eye . That 's because it really is worse than the ratio we roughly measured by eye . <p> When you compared the integrals by eye , you were looking at an entire blue integral line and comparing it to another entire blue integral line .

It 's still useful , but keep in mind that it wo n't be dead on , especially if the ends of the integral line are tilted . <p> Sometimes the heights are " normalized " . They are reduced to a lowest common factor so that their ratios are easier to compare . These numbers could correspond to numbers of hydrogens , or simply to their lowest common factors . Two peaks in a ratio of 1H:2H could correspond to one and two hydrogens , or they could correspond to two and four hydrogens , etc . <p> Source : Spectrum taken in CDCl3 on a Varian Gemini 2000 Spectrometer with 300 MHz Oxford magnet . <p> Note that the ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks . If we were to just estimate the heights of the peaks , we might come up with something like 1:0.1:3 or 10:1:30 . The integrals are measuring the total area of the peak , so the width of the peak matters as well as its height . <p> Problem NMR9.1 . <p> Because the 1H NMR spectrum has relatively low resolution , the spectra of saturated , straight-chain hydrocarbons are all similar : a peak for the methyl hydrogens at 0.9 ppm and a peak for the methylene ( CH2 ) hydrogens at 1.0 ppm .

However , if you can not refrain from urinating before seeking help , urinate into a clean glass jar . If you must change your clothes before seeking help , place them ( including undergarments ) in a brown PAPER bag . Placing clothes or all other possible pieces of evidence in a plastic bag will chemically render them useless during evidence collection procedures . <p> Get medical attention .

Sexual assault can be extremely traumatic and life-changing . Its important to remember that your responses are not crazy ; they are normal reactions to a traumatic situation sexual assault . Our goal is to offer support , options and resources that encourage empowerment and healing . Below are some common questions and feelings survivors of sexual assault may experience but it is not necessarily an exhaustive list . <h> Why did this happen to me ? <p> You did n't  do anything wrong . Its not your fault . Your power was taken away by someone else . Sexual violence can happen to anyone , regardless of age , gender , race , religion , etc . One in three women and one in six men are sexually assaulted at some point in their lifetime . <h> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? When will I stop feeling so bad ? <p> It is hard to understand that someone would do this to you and that there would be so much pain . It is n't fair but you did survive . You are strong and courageous . There is no blueprint for healing . It is on your own time schedule and in your own way.There are people who can help you if you need it . <h> How do I get over this ? <p> No one was taught how to heal from a trauma , so its scary . There are no simple 10 steps to healing but healing is happening.Talking about it is a very important healing tool.Sexual assault is not something that any individual will ever " get over " in their lifetime , more , it becomes an experience that makes up the character and being of the victim/survivor that has no more or no less impact on the individual than any other life experience . <h> No one understands ! <p> You are not alone . These are common feelings of survivors . Even if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are those out there who want to help and support you through this time.Sexual assault is a very common experience for many people . 1 in 3 women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime , and 1 in 6 men will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime . <h> I feel like I am going crazy ! <p> You are not crazy ; you are dealing with a " crazy " difficult situation . Many survivors have this feeling . <h> It was n't that big of a deal . <p> What happened was a trauma and can affect you very much.Sometimes you do n't  realize the extent of how it is affecting you right away.But , just pretending it did n't  happen or ignoring it wont be helpful in the healing process . <h> I 'm just imagining this . This couldnt really have happened . <p> Its hard to believe something so awful and so painful but typically memories like this are real . Memories of painful experiences are sometimes blocked until you 're ready to process them and move on . <h> SHOCK AND NUMBNESS <p> This response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience feelings of disbelief or denial about what happened . Survivors may feel emotionally detached or drained , and at times may be unaware of what is happening around them . Other reactions to the emotional shock may include : crying uncontrollably , laughing nervously , withdrawing , or claiming to feel nothing or to be " fine " . Survivors often may feel overwhelmed to the point of not knowing how to feel or what to do . <p> If you are a victim/survivor , here are some tips that may help:Recognize that these feelings are normal reactions are experiencing trauma . Reassure yourself that these feelings will diminish over time but it takes as much time as you need to heal . If you want company , it may be helpful to surround yourself with supportive friends or family . You may also want to think about what has helped you through a previous crisis . For example , it may help to practice breathing exercises or meditation , go for a walk , listen to music , or talk with supportive friends and family .

It may be difficult for survivors to concentrate , attend class , or focus on school work . It can be very upsetting to have reminders of the assault when trying to reclaim your normal life . Survivors may have nightmares , trouble sleeping , appetite changes , general anxiety , or depression . For the first few weeks or months after the assault , survivors may feel as though their life has been upset and may be wondering if it will ever be the same . <p> If you are a victim/survivor , here are some tips that may help:It is important to be gentle with yourself and take steps to reclaim your life .

Do n't  be afraid to seek help if you are struggling academically or you need help dealing with the trauma . <h> LOSS OF CONTROL <p> Survivors may feel disoriented and overwhelmed . They may also feel anxious , scared , or nervous and have a difficult time concentrating . Often , survivors feel unsure about themselves , and may temporarily lack their usual self-confidence . Decisions that were made routinely before now may feel monumental . Survivors may feel that because of the assault they will have to change their whole lifestyle to feel safe . <p> If you are a victim/survivor , here are some tips that may help:Try to make as many of your own decisions as possible . Even making small decisions can help you regain a sense of control . You may want to make some changes in your life such as re-arranging the furniture in your room , changing your look by cutting your hair , or changing your routine by exercising in the morning instead of at night . Small changes can help you feel like you are taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through your options and support you to make a decision that is best for you , it is important to trust your instincts about what is right for you . <h> FEAR <p> It is not uncommon for victims/survivors to fear people and feel vulnerable even when going through the regular activities of life . They may be afraid to be alone , or afraid of being with lots of people . They may find themselves not knowing who to trust . Survivors may have lost their sense of safety in their own environment , which makes them feel vulnerable and may fear that they will be assaulted again . Survivors may also be more aware of sexual innuendos , stray looks , or whistles . <p> If you are a victim/survivor , here are some tips that may help:Make any changes in your life that you need in order to feel safe . If possible , you may want to change your locks , take a self-defense class , or stay with a family member or friend . Temporarily " not trusting " is a protective device that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away or lessen over time . You will be able to trust when you have had a chance to heal and are feeling less vulnerable . If it does n't  get better and fear is getting in the way of your daily life , it may be helpful to speak to a counselor . <h> GUILT , SHAME , SELF-BLAME <p> Most victims/survivors feel guilty and ashamed about the assault . Survivors often question that they somehow may have " provoked " or " asked for it " , that they should n't have trusted the assailant , or that they should have somehow prevented the assault . Some of these feelings are the result of societys myths about sexual assault and sexuality . Survivors will often start to doubt their ability to make good judgments or trust their own instincts . Sometimes blaming themselves helps survivors to feel less helpless . <p> If you are a victim/survivor , here are some tips that may help:It was not your fault . No one deserves to be sexually assaulted . Tell yourself that many times a day . Being sexually assaulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not choose to be sexually assaulted . Realize that guilt and self-blame are efforts to feel some control over the situation . Many survivors also experience blame from individuals they tell about the incident . These reactions are fueled by societys myths about sexual assault . It is important to surround yourself with supportive people . Education about the facts surrounding sexual assault may also be helpful in dispelling shame and self-blame . You may want to find some resources on health and recovery after sexual assault . <h> ANGER <p> Victims/Survivors may have different reasons to feel angry . There is often as much anger at the events following the assault , as toward the assault itself : changing lifestyle , loss of freedom , being told to " get over it " by friends and family . Anger is an appropriate , healthy response to sexual assault . It usually means that the survivor is healing and has begun to look at the assailants responsibility for the assault . Survivors vary greatly in how readily they feel and express anger . It may be especially difficult to express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never appropriate . Anger can be vented in safe and healthy ways , or can be turned in , where it may become sadness , pain , or depression . <p> If you are a victim/survivor , here are some tips that may help:Allow yourself to be angry . You have a right to feel angry . However , it is important to feel angry without hurting yourself or others . As part of your anger , you may find yourself more irritable at home , school , or work . Anger can be expressed physically without harming yourself or others . Some people find that physical activity ( such as walking , running , biking , hitting pillows , etc. ) can help release the physical tension that often accompanies anger . Writing in a journal , playing music , or singing out loud to music are also helpful and healthy ways to release anger . Reporting the sexual assault may be another way you choose to turn your anger into a positive action . Many people often find it useful to speak with other survivors . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as alcohol or drug use , cutting , or other self destructive behaviors . <h> ISOLATION <p> Some sexual assault victims/survivors feel their experience sets them apart from others . Oftentimes , they feel differently or think that others can tell that they have been sexually assaulted just by looking at them . Some survivors do not want to bother anyone with their troubles , so they do not talk about the incident or their feelings . Survivors may withdraw or distance themselves from family and friends . <p> If you are a victim/survivor , here are some tips that may help:You are not alone in what you are feeling . Many people find benefit in speaking with other survivors . Reading more about the topic can also be reassuring and validating . If you are feeling alone , call a trusted friend or family member . It can make all the difference to be with someone who cares about you . <h> ANXIETY , SHAKING , NIGHTMARES <p> Victims/Survivors may experience shaking , anxiety , flashbacks , and nightmares after an attack . This can begin shortly after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nightmares may replay the assault or include dreams of being chased , attacked , etc . Survivors often fear that they are " losing it " and may feel that they should be " over it by now " . <p> If you are a victim/survivor , here are some tips that may help:These responses , as scary as they are , are normal reactions to trauma . These physical reactions are ways your emotions respond to the fear you experience . It is important to be able to discuss your nightmares and fears , particularly how they are affecting your life . Keeping a journal to write about your feelings , dreams , and worries can be a helpful tool in the recovery process . <h> CONCERN FOR THE ASSAILANT <p> Some victims/survivors express concern about what will happen to the assailant if the attack is reported or prosecuted . Others express a concern that an assailant is sick or i 'll and needs psychiatric care more than prison . It is human to show concern for others , especially those who are troubled , destructive , and confused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survivors effort to understand what happened , particularly if there was a previous relationship . These attitudes might also be the result of the survivors blaming themselves for the assault . If survivors feel sorry for the assailant , they might find it difficult to express their anger and indignation for what they suffered . <p> If you are a victim/survivor , here are some tips that may help:The sexual assault was not your fault . Only the assailant is responsible for what happened . You have a right to feel and express anger . It is important to hold the assailant accountable . You can have mixed feelings you can love/like the assailant as a person and still hate what that person did to you . Pushing yourself to prematurely " forgive " the assailant may force you to bury your feelings of anger and rage . Reporting the sexual assault may be one way you choose to turn your anger into a positive action . Reporting may also be the only way for the assailant to get treatment . <h> SEXUAL CONCERNS <p> Victims/Survivors may experience a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want no sexual contact whatsoever ; others may use sex as a coping mechanism . Some people may experience some confusion about separating sex from sexual abuse . Particular sexual acts may provoke flashbacks and thus , be very difficult for the survivor to engage in . <p> If you are a victim/survivor , here are some tips that may help:Sexual healing takes time . Go at your own pace . Be very clear with your partner about your needs and limits when it comes to any type of sexual touching or sexual contact . You have a right to refuse to be sexual until you feel ready . Tell your partner what kinds of physical or sexual intimacy feels comfortable to you . Sexual assault is not sex . Intimate consensual lovemaking should be pleasurable for both partners . A patient , gentle , intimate partner is helpful in your healing process . A therapist with experience in sexual trauma recovery can be very helpful to your healing process . <h> POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER <p> Post-traumatic Stress Disorder , also known as PTSD , involves a pattern of symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PTSD include repeated thoughts of the assault ; memories and nightmares ; avoidance of thoughts , feelings , and situations related to the assault ; and increased stimulation ( e.g. , difficulty sleeping and concentrating , jumpiness , irritability ) . One study that examined PTSD symptoms among women who were raped , found that 94% of women experienced these symptoms during the two weeks immediately following the rape . Nine months later , about 30% of the women were still reporting this pattern of symptoms . The National womens Study reported that almost 1/3 of all rape survivors develop PTSD sometime during their lives and 11% of rape survivors currently suffer from the disorder . <p> If you are a victim/survivor , here are some tips that may help:Treatment for PTSD typically begins with a detailed evaluation and the development of a treatment plan that meets the unique needs of the survivor . PTSD-specific treatment is usually begun only after people have been safely removed from a crisis situation . <h> Getting Back on Track <p> It is important for you to know that any of the above reactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fear and confusion will lessen with time , but the trauma may disrupt your life for awhile . Some reactions may be triggered by people , places or things connected to the assault , while other reactions may seem to come from " out of the blue " . <p> Remember that no matter how much difficulty you 're having dealing with the assault , it does not mean you 're " going crazy " or becoming " mentally i 'll . " The recovery process may actually help you develop strengths , insights , and abilities that you never had ( or never knew you had ) before . <p> Talking about the assault will help you feel better , but may also be really hard to do . In fact , its common to want to avoid conversations and situations that may remind you of the assault . You may have a sense of wanting to " get on with life " and " let the past be the past . " This is a normal part of the recovery process and may last for weeks or months . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to heal and regain a sense of control over your life . Talking with someone who can listen in understanding and affirming ways whether its a friend , family member , sexual assault center staff member , or counselor is a key part of this process . <h> Special Concerns as a Student <p> Are you in the same class as the person that assaulted you ? <p> It can be very scary and distracting for many survivors to attend class with the person who assaulted them . Your academic career is important and you should feel safe attending class so that you may be successful both academically and in your healing process . If you need to make alternate arrangements in your class schedule , talk to the dean at either CSB ( 5601 ) or SJU ( 3512 ) or if you are seeing a psychologist at CSB/SJU Counseling , you can talk to them about what you need and how to do it . <p> If the person who assaulted you is a student at the College of St. Benedict or St. Johns University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office on either campus . Sexual assault is a violation of the joint sexual misconduct policy . This is separate from the criminal process , but can result in suspension or expulsion . If you are interested in pursuing this option , please contact the Deans Office directly . ( CSB 5601 , SJU 3512 ) or click on reporting sexual misconduct . <p> Are you worried about seeing the person that assaulted you on campus ? <p> It can be very distressing and traumatic to see the person who assaulted you on campus . If you feel unsafe , talk to the dean of students on your campus about your options . <p> Are your grades suffering because of the assault ? <p> It will take some time to adjust after the assault and it is very common to have difficulties concentrating on studying or focusing on coursework.You are encouraged to communicate directly with your instructor in order to limit any possible misunderstanding about expectations and requirements . If you decide to take an incomplete or arrange for alternate requirements with your instructors , you are encouraged to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect yourself in case of confusion at a later time . <p> You may need to talk with someone to help you consider the options that will allow you to successfully continue your academic career . Sometimes survivors decide that they need to reduce their course load or withdraw in order to be successful in the future . This is a big decision and we encourage you to talk with Academic Advising if you are considering these choices . <p> Do you live in the same residence hall as the person who assaulted you ? <p> You have the right to feel safe in your home . If the person who sexually assaulted you lives in the same residence hall as you or you feel unsafe in your room , contact CSB or SJU Residential Life to discuss your options . If you live off-campus and feel unsafe in your home , contact the local law enforcement agency . <p> Do you have concerns about the incident because you were drinking at the time ? <p> No one deserves to be assaulted , no matter what the situation . Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a greater crime involved , such as sexual assault . For many reasons , survivors may hesitate to come forward if they were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the assault . Many worry about reporting because they may not remember everything or may blame themselves for being intoxicated . Do n't  let this get in the way of reporting a sexual assault . The focus should be on the behavior of the one who assaulted , not the survivor . An individual who is physically incapacitated can not legally consent to sexual contact . It is also important to make sure that you receive appropriate medical attention . No matter what you decide to do , remember that is was not your fault . <p> Are you worried about making a police report ? <p> Making a police report after a sexual assault can be a very difficult decision for survivors . Uncertainty about reporting the assault is common , especially if you know the person who assaulted you . Filing a police report is the first step in beginning the criminal justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened ? <p> If you tell your parents will it be more or less helpful to you ? This is a very difficult question for survivors . Many people find it hard to disclose to their parents , but ultimately find parents love and support helpful to their healing process . Some survivors may be concerned about hurting their parents or fear that their family may blame them for the assault . Only you can decide if and when to tell your family . <p> What if you have mutual friends or belong to the same groups as the person who assaulted you ? <p> This is a common situation since most assaults occur between acquaintances . People will likely take sides and you may find yourself distrusting friends and colleagues . Surround yourself with people who support , respect , and believe you . Trust your instincts , and take steps to ensure your personal safety and well-being . If you are experiencing harassment or feel unsafe , contact CSB Security , SJU Life Safety or the deans office on one of the campuses . <p> Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves having your control taken away from you , and it may be difficult to regain trust . Go at your own pace . It may be helpful to start in larger social situations or go on double dates . At first , you may want to avoid situations where you feel isolated or lacking control . When you are ready to date , do n't  hesitate to be clear about your sexual limits . <h> Self Care for Survivors <p> When learning to survive a traumatic experience , taking care of yourself is very important . Preventing undue stress and emotional over-load must be your priority . Here is a list of things that might be helpful for you : <p> Get support from friends and family try to identify people you trust to validate your feelings and affirm your strengths , and avoid those who you think will deter your healing process . <p> Talk about the assault and express feelings choose when , where , and with whom to talk about the assault , and set limits by only disclosing information that feels safe for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as possible and avoid overusing stimulants like caffeine , sugar , and nicotine . <p> Discover your playful and creative " self " . Playing and creativity are important for healing from hurt . Find time for noncompetitive play start or resume a creative activity like piano , painting , gardening , handicrafts , etc . <p> Take " time outs . " Give yourself permission to take quiet moments to reflect , relax and rejuvenate especially during times you feel stressed or unsafe . <p> Try reading . Reading can be a relaxing , healing activity . Try to find short periods of uninterrupted leisure reading time . <p> Consider writing or keeping a journal as a way of expressing thoughts and feelings . <p> Release some of the hurt and anger in a healthy way : Write a letter to your attacker about how you feel about what happened to you . Be as specific as you can . You can choose to send the letter or not . You also can draw pictures about the anger you feel towards your attacker as a way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hugging releases the bodys natural pain-killers . <p> Remember you are safe , even if you do n't  feel it . The sexual assault is over . It may take longer than you think , but you will feel better . <h> How to Help a Friend or Family Member who has been Sexually Assaulted <p> When someone you know is sexually assaulted , it can be a frightening and confusing time for them and for you . Remember that the person who has been sexually assaulted needs to obtain medical assistance , feel safe , be believed , know she or he was not at fault , take control of his or her life . <p> There are some things you can do to help . Here are a few suggestions . Keep in mind that there is not one " right " way to deal with sexual violence ; each person has to make his or her own decisions . <p> Believe them.The most common reason many people choose not to tell anyone about sexual assault is the fear that the listener wont believe them . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , survivors of sexual assault are much more likely to downplay the violence against them . If someone tells you , its because they trust you and need to talk to someone . <p> Do n't  blame them.Another common fear in telling someone about a sexual assault is that the person will think it was somehow their fault . NO ONE deserves to be sexually assaulted , no matter what . Sexual assault is always the fault of the assaulter , not the survivor . <p> Offer shelter.If possible , stay with the person at a comfortable , reassuring place . <p> Be there and give comfort.The survivor may need to talk a lot or at odd hours at the beginning . Be there as much as you can and encourage the survivor to talk to others . Thank the survivor for feeling like he/she could talk to you.Its not easy to tell someone about a sexual assault and you , as a listener should feel grateful that the survivor feels you are a safe person to talk to about the incident . <p> Be patient.Dont try to rush the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not heal at the same pace . <p> Validate the survivors feelings : their anger , pain and fear.These are natural , healthy responses . They need to feel them , express them , and be heard . <p> Express your compassion.If you have feelings of outrage , compassion , pain for their pain , do share them . There is probably nothing more comforting than a genuine human response . Just make sure your feelings do n't  overwhelm theirs . <p> Resist seeing the survivor as a victim.Continue to see them as a strong , courageous person who is reclaiming their own life . <p> Accept the persons choice of what to do about the assault.Dont be overly protective . Ask what is needed , help the survivor list some options , then encourage independent decision-making , even if you disagree . It is very important that the survivor make decisions and have them respected , as it can go a long way in helping them regain a sense of control in their lives . <p> Stay friends.Dont pull away from the friendship because its too hard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like there is something wrong with them . You can always help them find other support people do n't  try to do it alone . <p> LISTEN.Try to be supportive without giving advice . You really cant know what is best for someone else . In sexual assault , a survivors power over body and feelings has been temporarily taken away ; the person needs support to take that power back , beginning with make his or her own decisions . <p> Get help.Sometimes a person needs medical attention or other emergency help or support from other people besides friends . You can help your friend find the resources that are needed . <p> Help yourself.When someone you care about is sexually assaulted , it affects you in a very deep way . You have your own needs and feelings which are probably somewhat different than your friends . Find someone you can go to without violating your friends confidence . <p> Educate yourself about sexual assault and the healing process.If you have a basic idea of what the survivor is going through , it will help you to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet and there are also resources at CSB/SJU Counseling located on the ground floor of Mary Hall on the SJU campus or the Health Center in lower level Lottie on the CSB campus . CSB Health Services , located in the same CSB location , is another good resource . Talk with other survivors and supporters of survivors . Many are willing to share what has helped them , or can give you ideas on how to deal with a certain situation . <p> People can and do survive sexual assault . It is much better if they have support from people they trust . You may be able to be that person for someone close to you . If you need information , resources , or support , contact the CSB/SJU Counseling or CSB Health Services ( CSB- 5605 , SJU-3236 ) or the Deans Offices on either campus ( CSB-5601 , SJU-3512 ) <h> Acquaintance Sexual Assault <p> Most sexual assaults occur between two people who know one another . This does n't  make the assault any less traumatic but it can be a source of confusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to misunderstanding and under-reporting . Regardless of who commits the sexual assault , it is still a crime that leaves the survivor injured and traumatized . Survivors of sexual assault , especially when committed by an acquaintance , often feel a sense of responsibility for the attack and do n't report the crime to the Police . <p> If you are interested in any type of sexual contact with another person you should ask.Since sexual assault is any type of sexual activity that is not agreed to by both people involved , it would be in the best interest of both parties to discuss sexual wants , boundaries , and values . Consensual sexual activity involves the presence of the word " yes without incapacitation of alcohol or other drugs , pressure , force , threat or intimidation . <p> You should respect the response of the other person . Sexual activity is a choice.A person has the right to say yes or no each and every time a sexual activity is considered . <p> When considering whether you have consent for sexual contact , consider : <p> Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> What is my relationship with this person ? <p> Am I pressuring ? <p> Am I manipulating ? <p> Am I using any kind of force ? <p> Is there any reason for the other person to be afraid of me ? <p> Is the other person of legal age to consent ? <p> Is the other person asleep or passed out or not participating ? <p> Is the other person indicating they do not want sexual contact by pushing away , moving away , or saying no ? <p> Consent is NOT PRESENT when the other person is incapacitated by the use of alcohol or drugs , fears the consequences of not consenting , says no either verbally or physically , is not an active participant in the activity , or is below the legal age of consent . <p> You have the right to say " NO " to any unwanted sexual contact.If you are unsure about what you want , make that uncertainty clear.Communication between both of you is essential.Listen carefully . Take time to hear what the other person is saying . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is giving you a " mixed message " , ask for clarification . <p> If you do n't know your date well , consider driving your own carand asking to meet your date in a public place . If you do accept a ride from a date , always carry some " mad money " so that you can call a cab if you need to cut the date short . You also could make sure a friend knows where you are at all times and is available to call , if needed . <p> Communicate your limits.If you say " NO , " that 's ok.If you say " YES , " that 's ok.As long as you and your partner are comfortable with the decision of whether or not to engage in sexual activity . <p> Listen to your gut feelings.If you feel uncomfortable or think you may be at risk , leave the situation or call someone who can help . <p> Use common sense.Realize that you do not have the right to force anyone to have sex just because you paid for dinner or drinks . <p> Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that someone wants to have sex just because they are drinking , dress provocatively ( in your view ) , or agree to go to your room . Do n't assume that just because someone had sex with you previously that they are willing to have sex with you again . Also do n't assume that just because someone consents to kissing or other sexual intimacies that they are willing to have intercourse . <p> Attend large parties with friends you can trust . Agree to look out for one another . Try to leave with a group , rather than alone or with someone you do n't know very well . <p> " Get involved " if you believe someone is at risk . If you see someone in trouble at a party , do n't be afraid to intervene . You may save someone the trauma of a sexual assault . <p> STAY SOBER ON A DATE.Alcohol impairs judgment and memory . <p> Remember that sexual assault is A CRIME . It is never acceptable to use force in sexual situations , no matter what the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a friend , family member , RA , RD , counselor , Campus Security Officer , Life Safety Officer , or the Police . It is very important that you get medical and emotional support to help you cope with the crisis . <h> PLEDGE FOR ACTION <p> I , ( insert your name here ) , pledge to do my best to help my family , friends , and peers in potentially dangerous situations in which drugs , alcohol , a violent person , or other threats to their safety and well-being are present . I will do this by having the focus and self-control necessary to remain aware of my surroundings , the wisdom to identify dangerous situations , and the courage to take action in confronting my friends when their judgment is impaired . I recognize that these dangerous situations may arise at times when people feel safe and comfortable , such as at bars , parties ( especially when alcohol is influencing the situation and a person is trying to " hook up " with another individual ) , or in the context of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy to help people from harm in these situations , but by remaining watchful and showing care and concern , I may help to prevent a sexual assault from occurring . I understand that the ONLY person responsible for a sexual assault is the person who engages in sexual contact without the consent of the other person . Through my own positive words , actions , and beliefs , I am taking the responsibility of helping to end sexual assault . I will share with people the importance of consent and the need to obtain consent with your partner by Asking First . I will treat all survivors of sexual assault with my respect and admiration . I will inform all of my family , friends , and peers that " If anyone ever has or ever does sexually touch you without your consent , I will fully support you . I will always be here for you . Always ( from simply listening to helping you seek the proper support from professionals ) ! " During the next24 hours , I will start putting this pledge into action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a horrific and traumatic crime . My active commitment to this project will help reduce the violence in my community and create a safer atmosphere for everyone . <h> Resources <h> Emergency Contacts <p> 911 <p> Central Minnesota Sexual Assault Center ( CMSAC ) at ( 320 ) 251-4357 <p> CMSAC is a 24-hour crisis intervention center for victims of all forms of sexual violence . The Centers purpose is to provide non-judgmental direct services to victims of sexual assault , their families and friends , to provide professional training and prevention education regarding sexual assault ; and to improve the coordination of services of various agencies that deal with sexual assault and its victims . 
@@71697791 @397791/ <p> Consider stearic acid , a type of lipid known as a fatty acid . It has an 18 C atom chain with a carboxylic acid group ( RCO2H ) at one end . <p> The carboxyl end ( shown in red ) containing the two oxygens is polar , but the rest of the molecule is completely nonpolar . We can draw a " cartoon " model of this molecule as a circle representing the carboxyl polar end or " head group " with a single connecting line representing the long , nonpolar " tail " . <p> A molecule that contains a distinct polar region and a distinct single chai nonpolar region is called a single chain amphiphile . <p> How would this fatty acid interact with water ? A small number of these molecules might be soluble in water ( remember even insoluble salts dissociate to a small degree to form some ions ) . The nonpolar tail is not stable in water , but the polar head is . Some of the molecules migrate to the surface of the water , with the nonpolar tails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monolayer on the surface . Others will self-aggregate , through IMFs to form a spherical structure in which the nonpolar tails are sequestered from water and the polar head are facing the water . This structure is called a micelle . In the figure below , the polar head groups are shown in blue . <p> What IMFs are involved ? First consider attractive IMFs . The buried nonpolar chains can interact and be stabilized through London forces . Buried inside of the micelle , the nonpolar chains are sequestered from water . This view fits our simple axiom of " like-dissolves like " . The polar head groups can be stabilized by ion-dipole interactions between charged head groups and water . Likewise H-bonds between water and the head group stabilizes the exposed head groups in water . Repulsive forces are also involved . Head groups can repel each other through steric factors , or ion-ion repulsion from like-charged head groups . The attractive forces must be greater than the repulsive forces , leading to micelle formation . <p> Detergents are molecules , like fatty acids , that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ micelles in water . Grease from clothes or foods , normally not soluble in water , can " dive " into the middle of the micelle and be carried off by this structure . This effectively " solubilizes " the nonpolar molecule . Notice that there is no water inside the micelle as you can see in the figure and Jmol computer model above . <p> Phospholipids : Double Chain Amphipiles <p> Now consider another lipid , a phospholipid , an example of which is shown below . X represents a polar group containing a charged phosphate . <p> Note that it has a polar end ( shown in red ) , but in contrast to stearic acid , it has two long nonpolar tails shown in blue . We can draw a " cartoon " model of this as a circle representing the polar end or " head group " with two connecting lines representing the two long nonpolar " tails " . It is a double chain amphiphile . Phospholipids are the major component of biological membranes . Again , in the figure below , the polar head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phospholipid interact with water ? Again , as with single chain detergents , there are several possible ways . A small number of these molecules might be soluble in water . Again , the nonpolar tails are unstable in water , while the polar head are . As in the case of single chain detergents , some of the molecules migrate to the surface of the water , with the nonpolar tails sticking out into air , away from water , to form a monolayer on the top of the water . Others will self- aggregate , through IMFs to form a bilayer or membrane instead of a micelle which contains single chain amphiphiles . The polar head groups in a double chain amphiphile can get closer together than in a micelle since there are extra stabilizing interactions among the side chains . The result is the formation of a membrane bilayer which affords less space for each head group than in a micelle . Imagine the bilayer membrane curving around and eventually meeting itself . A structure like this would look like a small biological cell . In contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregate , called a liposome or vesicle , is filled with water which can interact through IMFs with the head groups of the inner leaflet of this membrane . The head groups of the outer leaflet of the membrane interact through IMFs with the bulk water . <p> Liposomes are useful since they are simple models of actual biological membranes . In addition , they can be used therapeutically . Toxic drugs , like those used in chemotherapy , can be incorporated into the aqueous volume inside a liposome where they can be targeted to specific tumor cells . <p> Liposomes and micelles seem to be complicated structures . However their formation and structure can be predicted from the simple solubility properties of these molecules and an understanding of IMFs <p> Ever wonder why a solution sodium hydroxide ( a base ) feels slippery on your skin ? The hydroxide base cleaves the bond between fatty acids connected to more complex skin phospholipids . The free fatty acids then aggregate spontaneously to form micelles which act like detergents which as you know feel slippery as well . <p> Triacylglycerides <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of a phospholipid which contains two fatty acids linked to glycerol . Another very abundant lipid contains three fatty acids connected to glycerol to form a triacylglyeride , as shown below . <p> This molecule overall is so nonpolar that it self associates to form lipid drops which are stored predominantly in fat or adipose tissue in the body . Its main function is not structural , but as a source of energy . <p> Problem IB1.1 . <p> We 've discussed how lipids can form aggregates in aqueous solution . Now let 's reverse the scenario . Draw a diagram showing what might happen if lots of stearic acid molecules were added to the solvent hexane , C6H14 . <p> Problem IB1.2 . <p> An important property of a micelle is the surface area/head group ( AS/HG ) . This is equal to the total surface area of the micelle divided by the number of single chain amphiphiles in the micelle , Atot/#amphiphiles . <p> What kind of repulsive forces exist between head groups ? What happens to AS/HG if the total charge on the head group increases ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ micelle stability ? <p> Problem IB1.3 . <p> Imagine now that you squish the spherical micelle into a bilayer . Think of this as flattening a tennis ball . What would happen to the ( AS/HG ) ? ( Hint : Think of pencils sticking out radially from the tennis ball , with the erasers representing head groups . What happens to the eraser spacing as it the tennis ball distorts to a bilayer ? . How does this explain why charge single chain amphiphile do n't form bilayers ? <p> Problem IB1.4 . <p> Now try a different thought experiment .

@@71697797 @397797/ <h> Structure &amp; Reactivity <h> ME1 . Introduction to Metals <p> Most of the elements found on earth are metals . A look at the periodic table shows that these elements occupy the entire left-hand stretch of the table , from the main group , through the transition metals , lanthanides , actinides , alkali and alkaline earth elements . <p> Figure ME1.1 . The periodic table , showing metals in full colour and non-metals in white boxes . <p> One element included here , hydrogen , is rarely classified as a metal . On earth , hydrogen is a gas , and it is usually classified as a non-metal , like oxygen and nitrogen . However , at very low temperatures and very high pressures , hydrogen is a solid , and under the right conditions it is expected to behave more like a metal . It is thought that gas giants , such as Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system , may have metallic hydrogen cores . <p> Metallic elements are not generally found as single atoms . Instead , the atoms in an element such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The materials formed in this way have some similar properties . Metals are shiny . Metals are malleable ; they can be bent and formed into different shapes ( at least when heated ) . Metals are good conductors of electricity . <p> In metals , large groups of atoms cluster together . <p> Metal atoms form large , extended arrays , with the atoms repeating in specific patterns throughout the solid . <p> The properties of metals are really important . The fact that metals are malleable allows them to be formed into sheets that can be used to make cars , airplanes , railway lines , cargo containers and ships , as well as more delicate items such as jewelry and surgical tools . A related property , ductility , allows metals to be stretched into long , thin wires . Together with the conductivity of metals , this property allows transmission lines to carry electricity from generating stations to people like you . Sometimes , the source of electricity is hundreds of miles away ; electricity used to power a laptop in New York may come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northwestern Quebec . <p> Some of these properties can be understood by thinking about the structure of metallic elements . A great deal of our structural understanding of metals and other materials comes from x-ray diffraction studies . A very focused beam of x-rays can be sent into a material , where they will bounce off the atoms and scatter in different directions . The outcome sounds chaotic , but if the solid is highly organized , the x-rays behave in very predictable ways . The result is an x-ray diffraction pattern . A diffraction pattern is a little like the pattern of ripples on a pond when a stone is thrown into calm water . The pattern can be studied and decoded mathematically to find the locations of the atoms within the material . <p> X-ray diffraction can reveal the atomic-level structures of highly ordered materials such as metals . <p> What does x-ray diffraction tell us ? Evidently , a chunk of metal is not just a mass of atoms stuck together randomly . Instead , the atoms arrange themselves in neat layers in very specific ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form a three-dimensional solid . <p> Figure ME1.2 . A pile of atoms versus an ordered array of atoms . <p> One of the properties that results from this organized arrangement of atoms is the malleability of metals . If you take a nice , soft metal such as copper , after annealing it in a fire or oven , it can be bent and shaped easily . With copper , this can be done even after the metal has cooled to room temperature . When you bend the copper , you are actually causing layers of atoms to slide over each other , until you stop bending and they come to rest in a new location . <p> Figure ME1.3 . A force ( bold arrow ) pushes a layer of atoms past another layer of atoms , making a new shape . <p> If you have ever done this , you 'll know that the more you work with the copper , the harder it is to bend . That 's because while you are sliding layers of atoms back and forth , occasionally an atom ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . It is no longer part of a smooth layer , and so other atoms ca n't slide past it as easily . This situation is called a defect . Once there are enough defects in the metal , it is impossible to bend the material anymore . <p> Figure ME1.4 . A defect can be caused by forces pushing atoms out of alignment . This displaced atom or layer in an ordered array of atoms lowers the malleability of the metal . <p> Metal atoms are found in organized layers . <p> Because these layers can roll over each other , metals can be worked into different shapes . <p> Problem ME1.1 . <p> An alloy is a mixture of two metals . Steel is an alloy of iron with any of a number of other elements , such as chromium or vanadium . Alloys are often harder than metals composed of a pure element . Show how alloying introduces a defect into the metal , and how that makes the metal stronger . <p> What is it that holds these metal atoms together ? To answer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found in the periodic table . The bottom left part of the periodic table is where the least electronegative elements are found . In fact , all of these elements lose electrons easily , and they are frequently found as cations in naturally-occurring compounds . For example , hematite is a common iron ore , containing iron cations ( Fe3+ ) and oxygen anions ( O2- ) . The formula of this compound is Fe2O3 , meaning there is always a ratio of three oxygen anions for every two iron cations in hematite . <p> Problem ME1.2 . <p> Show how the ratio of elements in hematite leads to a charge-balanced ( overall neutral ) compound . <p> Many of the atoms in a metallic material are present as cations . But where did their lost electrons go ? Well , those electrons are still in the material , moving between the iron atoms and cations . In a piece of iron , the attraction between the iron cations and the freely moving electrons helps hold the metal together . This way of thinking about metals is sometimes called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure ME1.5 . Metal cations in an electron sea . <p> Bonding in metals is often described through the " electron sea model " . <p> Metal ions are surrounded by delocalized electrons . <p> Delocalized electrons are not restricted to one atom or another ; they are distributed across several atoms in the solid . <p> Why do metals conduct electricity ? Electricity is the movement of electrons through a material . But the conduction of current through a metal probably takes place through a series of events . If an electron is introduced at one end of the material , it will probably be attracted by a metal cation . It may even be captured by that metal . Sometimes , we describe this electron as moving into a " hole " ; a hole , in conductivity terms , is just a positive charge that captures an electron . But remember that metals are still pretty electropositive ( the opposite of electronegative ) , and that metal atom is likely to lose another electron . This may not be the same electron as the one you put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may in turn be captured by another hole on another metal . That metal may lose another electron , and so on . Electrons will hop and skip from one metal to another throughout the material . An electric current results because these hopping electrons in the metal move away from the electrons that are being supplied at one end . They move towards the other end , instead . <p> Figure ME1.6 . Electrical conductance in a metal . <p> The shininess of metals is also attributed to the electron-sea aspect of metallic bonding . Collisions between incoming photons and the " free " electrons at the surface of a metal cause the photons to bounce off the surface . The reddish colour of copper results from a limit on the wavelengths of visible light that bounce off the metal . <p> The electron sea model is used to explain several unique properties of metals . <p> So far , we have looked at the electron sea model purely in terms of electrostatics : the negatively charged electron is attracted to the positively charged nucleus . However , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atom that kinetic energy and the wavelength of the electron is also an important factor in chemistry . <p> Figure ME1.7 . Symbolic drawing of the longest possible wavelength of an electron that is confined to one atom ( left ) compared to an electron that is delocalized over a group of atoms ( right ) . <p> Problem ME1.3 . <p> Suppose the following boxes are half-filled with water . Show the longest wavelength possible in each of the boxes . <p> In the electron sea model of metallic bonding , the electrons can be delocalized . They are no longer confined to a single atom , but can be spread out over multiple atoms . As a result , the wavelength of the electron increases . Because wavelength is inversely proportional to energy , as an electron 's wavelength increases , its energy goes down . As a result , spreading electrons out over a group of metals results in a decrease in energy because of the wave properties of electrons . <p> Delocalization is an important concept in chemistry . <p> Delocalization is related to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer the possible wavelength . <p> By spreading out over a larger group of atoms , an electron can adopt a longer wavelength . <p> An electron with a longer wavelength has a lower energy . <p> Some of the properties of metals can be understood , given a basic outline of the structure of a metal .

The fact that their use continues to persist despite legitimate environmental concerns is a testament to how useful these materials have become over the years . <p> Polyethylene and polypropylene can be thought of as polymers of the very simple alkenes , ethene and propene .

" This process is named after a German and an Italian chemist who are independently credited with its development in the 1950 's . <p> In Ziegler-Natta polymerisation , monomers are treated with a catalyst , such as a mixture of titanium chloride ( or related compounds , like oxovanadium chloride ) with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , such as magnesium chloride , to modify the catalyst and improve performance . The mixture described here produces a heterogeneous catalyst ; it is an insoluble solid . <p> Now , the catalyst is n't really titanium chloride , because all of these components react together to make something new . Exactly what they make may be hard to determine . It 's a complicated gmish . <p> Despite the complicated catalyst mixture , we do know a little bit about the mechanism of reaction . Partly this information comes from studies of model compounds . Model compounds are simpler than the industrial catalysts , but they still have some structural features in common with their hard-working cousins . They have enough in common to be able to carry out polymerization catalysis , although maybe not as well as the industrial heavyweights . <p> So , what do we think happens ? It seems pretty clear that one of the things that the trialkylaluminum does is provide an alkyl group to titanium . That should n't be too surprising . The triethylaluminum , like ethyllithium or ethylmagnesium bromide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The titanium tetrachloride ought to be a pretty good electrophile , complete with halide leaving groups .

We should be thinking about organometallic reaction mechanisms . For example , a 1,2-insertion of the alkene into the metal-carbon bond would provide a new metal alkyl . <p> From there , and using these same elementary steps in succession , it is easy to imagine how polymerization of propene might occur . Bnding of an additional alkene , followed by the 1,2-insertion of the propene into the metal-carbon bond , results in formation of the propene dimer ( with a methyl end group ) . <p> The mechanism of Ziegler-Natta polymerization involves alkene binding and insertion into metal-carbon bonds <p> Let 's pause for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aluminum compound . This topic is peripheral to electrophilic addition although important to the subject of catalysis . <p> In catalysis , " promoters " and " supports " are sometimes added to improve catalyst function . They might do so in a number of ways . They may take part directly in the reaction , providing additional Lewis acidic or Lewis basic sites , in much the same way that amino acid residues surrounding the active site of an enzyme may help catalyse a reaction . They may play a more subtle role , affecting physical properties of the catalyst ( such as its solubility ) or even tuning up the chemical properties of the catalyst . For example , maybe the promoter adds a little more electron density to the catalyst , making it a little less electrophilic . That might make the catalyst more stable ; maybe it becomes more selective , reacting more carefully instead of with wild abandon . Maybe it makes the catalyst last longer . <p> Although classic Ziegler-Natta polymerization involves heterogeneous catalysis , lots of variations have been developed , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as other , working homogeneous catalysts . One very successful variation , developed by Walter Kaminsky at University of Hamburg , uses Cp2ZrCl2 as catalyst and methylalumoxane ( MAO ) as a promoter . This zirconium species , in which the zirconium atom is wedged between two cyclopentadienly ligands , is commonly called a " zirconocene " . <p> MAO is another poorly-defined species . It is obtained by treating trimethylaluminum with a trace of moisture . If you remember anything about Grignard reagents or alkyllithiums , you might think that is n't such a good idea . In truth , it is an even worse idea with trimethylaluminum with either of those other two metal alkyls . The trimethylaluminum is quickly decomposed into something else , a poorly-defined species called " methylalumoxane " . <p> What we know about the structure of MAO may be a little bit fuzzy . Once again , some light can be shed on the subject via model studies . In some beautiful work done in Andrew Barron 's lab at Rice University , alkyl aluminum oxide clusters were obtained via the careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , containing two , three , four or six aluminum atoms , depending on the reaction conditions . A drawing of one example , a hexamer , is shown below . <p> Some of the alkyl groups have been replaced by oxide ligands . We can imagine something similar would happen with trimethylaluminum . The aluminum forms bonds with oxygen , which bridges between different aluminum atoms . The structure is probably oligomeric itself , forming large clusters of aluminum oxide , although it must retain some methyl groups as well . <p> Problem EA13.3 . <p> Provide a mechanism for the formation of an oxy-bridged aluminum dimer via treatement of trimethylaluminum with water . <p> Problem EA13.4 . <p> Why does tri(tbutyl)aluminum with water produce well-defined structures , whereas trimethylaluminum with water leads to a mess ? <p> Just as in the original Ziegler-Natta catalyst , the " extra stuff " plays an important role . The MAO may tune up the qualities of the zirconium catalyst , in addition to providing an alkyl group . <p> Kaminsky 's " zirconocene " catalysts are used commercially to produce polypropylene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the stereochemistry of the reaction . <p> Consider a polypropylene chain . Each methyl group that hangs from the zig-zagging backbone of the polymer could have two possible orientations . It could be coming forward , shown with a wedge . It could be going backward , shown with a dash . <p> The stereochemical relationship between those wedges and dashes is called " tacticity " . Tacticity basically comes in three flavours : random , alternating and same . A random stereochemical arrangment is described as an " atactic " polymer . If all the methyl groups are on the same side in a regular zig-zag projection of the backbone ( either all wedges or all dashes ) the arrangement is described as " isotactic " . If instead the methyl groups alternate ( wedge-dash-wedge-dash ) , the arranement is called " syndiotactic " . <p> In a collaboration with Hans-Herbert Brintzinger at Konstanz University , Kaminsky developed zirconocene catalysts that could control the tacticity of the polymer chain . Use of the original zirconocene , Cp2ZrCl2 , resulted in an atactic polymer . However , modified zirconocene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will look at two examples . The first one is sometimes described as a C2 catalyst and leads to formation of isotactic polypropylene . The second is sometimes described as a Cs catalyst and leads to formation of syndiotactic polypropylene . ( The labels , Cs and C2 , are symmetry point groups that describe the shape of the catalyst , but we wo n't go into that idea any further . ) <p> Problem EA13.5 . <p> One of these catalysts ( C2 vs . Cs ) is chiral ; the other one is n't . Which is which ? <p> Let 's look at the C2 catalyst . We 'll strip it down to just the zirconocene part , leaving off the chlorides . The chlorides are likely replaced by methyl groups or else lost via dissociation ( presumably leaving Cp ' 2ZrCl+ ion ) . <p> We will rotate the catalyst fragment to look at it from the " front " : the more open part of the zirconocene " wedge " , which is the direction from which a newly coordinating propene would approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wedge . This is the surface that the propene will interact with as it approaches . <p> In our discussion , we will use " quadrant analysis " , a standard tool for trying to analyse stereocontrol in transition metal catalysis . In quadrant analysis , we try to imagine differences in steric barriers in each of four quadrants around the metal centre . How will the arrangement of bulky groups influence the approach of a substrate ? <p> In the C2 catalyst we are using , it looks like there will be more room in the upper right and lower left quadrants . The upper left and lower right are blocked by those rings . When the propene is approaching , the polymer chain will present the largest obstacle , because it is extending a significant distance away from the zirconium atom . To minimize steric interactions , the chain may extend into the relatively empty upper right quadrant . <p> Alternatively , the polymer change could extend into the relatively open lower left quadrant , but that would really give us the same drawing , just rotated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drawing of the complex with the polymer in the lower left quadrant . <p> As we think about bringing the propene into the empty coordination site next to the polymer chain , there are two questions we need to consider about orientation . The first is about which end of the alkene to bring into the wedge . The propene has two different ends : one end sports two hydrogen atoms , whereas the other end has a hydrogen and a methyl . It seems likely that the propene will fit best if the narrow end , the one with the two hydrogen atoms , extends into that narrow wedge . <p> Now we need to think about which of the propene 's two faces will coordinate to the zirconium . To think about the faces of propene , hold your hand out flat , with the thumb forming a right angle with the rest of your hand . The back of your hand represents one face of the propene ; the palm of your hand represents the other . The propene will enter in such a way as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easiest way is as shown below . The methyl group is placed in the lower left quadrant . You can think of it as keeping the methyl group away from the upper ring or keeping it away from the polymer chain , which is also in an upper quadrant . <p> If your left hand is propene , we have coordinated the back of your hand to the zirconium , with the thumb pointing down . If we had coordinated your palm , the thumb would be pointed up . <p> Once again , if we started with the polymer in the lower left quadrant , the entire drawing just rotates 180 degrees . It is still the same face that coordinates ( the back of your left hand ) . <p> Problem EA13.7 . <p> Make a drawing of the complex with the polymer in the lower left quadrant and the propene coordinating to the right . <p> The next event is 1,2-insertion of the alkene into the metal-alkyl bond . That leaves us with the following structure . Notice that we have formed a new stereocentre . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the hydrogen adjacent to it was therefore up , then in the new stereocenter the methyl is still in the lower of two possible positions and the hydrogen is in the upper of two possible positions . Furthermore , the methyl is pushed back and to the left because the alkyl came from the right . <p> In order to help keep track of that insertion step , here is a drawing with colour labels . The narrow end of the propene is now attached to the zirconium via a sigma bond . The wider end of the proene has formed the new chiral center . The carbon that used to form a sigma bond to zirconium is now just another carbon along the growing polymer chain . The youngest part of the polymer is found at the growing end . <p> When another propene approaches to occupy the empty position , it will coordinate using the same face as the previous propene . <p> The 1,2-insertion produces a new chiral centre . The C2 catalyst is producing an isotactic polymer chain . The is an example of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has influenced the stereochemistry of the growing chain . <p> Problem EA13.8 . <p> Assign configuration ( R or S ) to each of the chiral centres along the polymer chain in the above drawing to confirm isotacticity . Keep in mind that " polymer " stands for a long chain of carbons . <p> Now let 's look at the Cs catalyst . We 'll strip it down like we did before . <p> Where will a growing polymer chain go ? Obviously it should go into one of the upper quadrants . <p> It is n't obvious whether it should be upper right or upper left . This time , it makes a difference , because the picture would not be the same . <p> Problem EA13.9 . <p> Draw the catalyst site with the polymer chain in the upper left quadrant . <p> However , once the propene approaches , a clear preference occurs . The chiral centre on the polymer chain is shown with the hydrogen up towards the Cp ring , since it is small and wo n't cause too much steric interaction . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open space of the wedge . The leaves the methyl pointing to one side of the wedge . <p> Which way will the propene approach ? Will it come in on the same side as the methyl , or the opposite side ? Probably the opposite side , as shown below . <p> Researchers suspect the methyl group points " down " in the above drawing , rather than " up " , because the polymer chain is a bigger steric obstacle than the lower aromatic ring , and the polymer chain is in an upper quadrant . Once again , the approach of the propene is sterochemically controlled , although this time the stereochemistry of an existing chiral centre in the growing polymer chain influenced how things proceeded . <p> Once again , upon 1,2-insertion , a new chiral centre is formed . The Cs catalyst is forming a syndiotactic polymer chain . <p> Because of the influence of an existing choral centre on the stereochemical outcome of the reaction , this catalyst is considered to work through " chain-end control " . The catalyst site simply amplifies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms next . It does so by bringing the reactants together into a small space where the steric differences of two subtly different pathways become more important . <p> Problem EA13.10 . <p> Label the configurations ( R or S ) of the chiral centres in the above drawing to confirm syndiotacticity. 74907 @qwx694907 
@@71697803 @397803/ <p> So far , we have come across one big rule of photon absorbance . In order to be absorbed , a photon 's energy has to match an energy difference within the compound that is absorbing it . <p> In the case of visible or ultraviolet light , the energy of a photon is roughly in the region that would be appropriate to promote an electron to a higher energy level . Different wavelengths would be able to promote different electrons , depending on the energy difference between an occupied electronic energy level and an unoccupied one . <p> Other types of electromagnetic radiation would not be able to promote an electron , but they would be coupled to other events . For example , absorption of infrared light is tied to vibrational energy levels . Microwave radiation is tied to rotational energy levels in molecules . <p> Thus , one reason a photon may or may not be absorbed has to do with whether its energy corresponds to the available energy differences within the molecule or ion that it encounters . <p> Franck-Condon : Electronic and Vibrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a moderate variation on our main rule . It is called the Frank Condon Principle . According to this idea , when an electron is excited from its normal position , the ground state , to a higher energy level , the optimal positions of atoms in the molecule may need to shift . Because electronic motion is much faster than nuclear motion , however , any shifting of atoms needed to optimize positions as they should be in the excited state will have to wait until after the electron gets excited . In that case , when the electron lands and the atoms are n't yet in their lowest energy positions for the excited state , the molecule will find itself in an excited vibrational state as well as an excited electronic state . <p> That means the required energy for excitation does n't just correspond to the difference in electronic energy levels ; it is fine-tuned to reach a vibrational energy level , which is quantized as well . <p> The Franck Condon Principle states that electronic transitions are vertical . <p> A vertical transition is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journeys from one state to another . <p> A vertical transition may begin in a vibrational ground state of an electronic ground state and end in a vibrational excited state of an electronic excited state . <p> LaPorte : Orbital Symmetry <p> There are other restrictions on electronic excitation . Symmetry selection rules , for instance , state that the donor orbital ( from which the electron comes ) and the acceptor orbital ( to which the electron is promoted ) must have different symmetry . The reasons for this rule are based in the mathematics of quantum mechanics . <p> What constitutes the same symmetry vs. different symmetry is a little more complicated than we will get into here . Briefly , let 's just look at one " symmetry element " and compare how two orbitals might differ with respect to that element . <p> If an orbital is centrosymmetric , one can imagine each point on the orbital reflecting through the very centre of the orbital to a point on the other side . At the end of the operation , the orbital appears unchanged . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inversion .. <p> If we do the same thing with a sigma antibonding orbital , things turn out differently . <p> In the drawing , the locations of the atoms are labelled A and B , but the symmetry of the orbital itself does n't depend on that . If we imagine sending each point on this orbital through the very centre to the other side , we arrive at a picture that looks exactly the opposite of what we started with . <p> These two orbitals have different symmetry . A transition from one to the other is allowed by symmetry . <p> Decide whether each of the following transitions would be allowed by symmetry . <p> a ) p ? p* b ) p ? p* c ) p ? s* d ) d ? d <p> Symmetry selection rules are in reality more like " strong suggestions " . They depend on the symmetry of the molecule remaining strictly static , but all kinds of distortions occur through molecular vibrations . Nevertheless , these rules influence the likelihood of a given transition . The likelihood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinction coefficient , e . <p> transition <p> e , extinction coefficient <p> p ? p* <p> 3,000 - 25,000 M-1 cm-1 <p> p ? p* <p> 20 - 150 M-1 cm-1 <p> p ? s* <p> 100 - 7,000 <p> d ? p* ( MLCT ) <p> 10,000 - 50,000 M-1 cm-1 <p> d ? d <p> 5 - 400 M-1 cm-1 <p> Problem PC2.3 . <p> Suggest the type of transition that is probably occurring in each case . <p> a ) A Ti(III) complex absorbs at 377 nm with e = 95 M-1 cm-1 . <p> b ) A terpenoid ketone absorbs at 538 nm with e = 11,500 M-1 cm-1 . <p> c ) A Ru(II) compound absorbs at 444 nm with e = 36,000 M-1 cm-1 . <p> Spin State <p> Let 's take a quick look at one last rule about electronic emissions . This rule concerns the spin of the excited electron , or more correctly , the " spin state " of the excited species . The spin state describes the number of unpaired electrons in the molecule or ion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singlet <p> 1 <p> doublet <p> 2 <p> triplet <p> 3 <p> quartet <p> The rule says that in an electronic transition , the spin state of the molecule must be preserved . That means if there are no unpaired electrons before the transition , then the excited species must also have no unpaired electrons . If there are two unpaired electrons before the transition , the excited state must also have two unpaired electrons . <p> That allowed diagram should looks strange to you . We are used to filling in electrons with spin paired for a good reason : we are following Hund 's rule , that says the lowest energy state has any unpaired spins parallel , not opposite . In fact , the state on the left really is lower in energy than the state on the right ; it 's just that the electrons ca n't get from the middle state ( the ground state ) to the left state easily via absorption of a photon . However , they can get from the ground state to the state on the right pretty easily via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a triplet state ( the " multipicity " of the state is the number of parallel spins plus one ) . The state on the right is called the singlet state . The ground state is also a singlet state . Overall , we have a ground singlet state , an excited singlet state and an excited triplet state . <p> As it happens , because the excited triplet state is a little lower in energy than the excited singlet state , the electron can eventually relax into the excited triplet state . It can flip , without absorbing or releasing a photon . This even is called intersystem crossing . It is related to fluorescence and phosphorescence phenomena that we will look at next . <p> Problem PC2.4 . <p> Cis-trans isomerism of C=N bonds provides a path for rapid vibrational relaxation from excited states . Compounds containing this bond do not fluoresce because they are able to relax back to the ground state by transferring energy into rotational and vibrational states . <p> Electron transfer between metal ions is a crucial event in a number of biochemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thought that amino acid residues may help conduct electrons over the long distances between metals . <p> Harry Gray and co-workers have conducted studies of electron transfer in blue copper ( azurin ) proteins ( J.

@@71697807 @397807/ <p> Frank Rioux Department of Chemistry St. John 's University College of St. Benedict St. Joseph , MN 56374 <p> Abstract <p> Slater 's method of analyzing the covalent bond using the virial theorem is presented for the hydrogen molecule . The overall conclusion reached is the same as that reached with Ruedenberg 's well-known abinitio quantum mechanical study - electron kinetic energy plays an important role in chemical bond formation . <p> Introduction <p> In the second edition of his classic monograph , Molecular Quantum Mechanics , Peter Atkins begins the chapter on molecular structure with the following sentences ( 1 ) , <p> Now we come to the heart of chemistry . If we can understand what holds atoms together as molecules we may also start to understand why , under certain conditions , old arrangements change in favor of new ones . We shall understand structure , and through structure , the mechanism of change . <p> Few will argue with Atkins ' eloquent assertion that the chemical bond is at the heart of chemistry , however finding a satisfactory discussion of chemistry 's central concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted general chemistry texts showed the following errors in the description of the covalent bond to be prevalent . Surprisingly the origin of some of these errors can be traced to two authoritative monographs on chemical bonding of enormous influence ( 2 ) . <p> The covalent bond is presented as a purely electrostatic phenomenon . Electron kinetic energy is never mentioned , even though the total energy of a molecule is a sum of kinetic and potential energy contributions , and atomic and molecular stability can not be understood solely in terms of potential energy . <p> Closely related to this is that what is actually an energy curve is called a potential energy curve . What is shown in introductory texts is the total molecular energy as a function of internuclear separation under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation . In other words , nuclear kinetic energy is frozen , but electron kinetic energy contributes to the total molecular energy . <p> It is claimed that the electron density in the inter-nuclear ( bond ) region has a lower potential energy because it is attracted to two nuclei . Actually using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electron-nuclear potential energy is higher in the internuclear region than it is closer to the nuclei . On the basis of potential energy alone the electrons would prefer to be in the nucleus . <p> An energy minimum , or molecular ground state , is achieved because of increases in nuclear-nuclear and electron-electron repulsions as the internuclear separation decreases . As will be shown later , the immediate cause of the molecular ground state is a sharp increase in electron kinetic energy . <p> The amount of electron density transferred to the bonding region is greatly overstated , sometimes implying that a pair of electrons is shared between two nuclei rather than by two nuclei . <p> Unfortunately , to find accurate analyses of the physical origin of the covalent bond one must go to the research or pedagogical literature ; chemistry textbooks will not , in general , provide enlightenment . In the 1960s and 70s Ruedenberg and his collaborators carried out a detailed quantum mechanical study of the covalent bond in H2+ ( 4 - 6 ) . The most important conclusion of this thorough and insightful study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formation of a chemical bond . Ruedenberg 's contributions to the understanding of the chemical bond have been summarized in the pedagogical literature ( 7 - 12 ) and in review articles ( 13 - 15 ) . There are also at least two encyclopedia entries which give accurate and clear interpretations of covalent bond formation ( 16 , 17 ) . <p> It is surprising that none of these efforts to make Ruedenberg 's work accessible to the non-specialist have had any noticeable impact on the way chemical bonding is presented by the authors of chemistry textbooks currently used in the undergraduate curriculum . While physical chemistry texts avoid the errors cited above , they generally do not attempt to provide an " explanation " of the chemical bond . For example , after outlining the mathematical techniques required to solve Schrdinger 's equation for H2+ and H2 , physical chemistry texts do not interpret the calculations other than to say something to the effect that the stability of the chemical bond is a quantum mechanical effect that has no classical analog or explanation . Atkins ' physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he alerts the reader to the subtleties of the chemical bond and briefly outlines the interplay between kinetic and potential energy during the formation of the covalent bond in H2+ ( 3 ) . <p> It is not widely appreciated that John C. Slater used the virial theorem to come to a similar conclusion about the importance of electron kinetic energy in chemical bond formation in the early days of quantum mechanics . In a paper published in the inaugural volume of the Journal of Chemical Physics Slater pioneered the use of the virial theorem in interpreting the chemical bond . With regard to the virial theorem he said ( 18 ) , <p> " ... this theorem gives a means of finding kinetic and potential energy separately for all configurations of the nuclei , as soon as the total energy is known , from experiment or theory . " ( emphasis added ) <p> The purpose of this paper is to outline Slater 's method of analysis for the hydrogen molecule , the simplest example of the traditional two-electron chemical bond . <p> Background Theory <p> The Hamiltonian energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of the following ten contributions , <p> Equation 1 <p> wherea and b label the nuclei , 1 and 2 label the electrons , and R = Rab , the internuclear separation . Under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation the nuclear kinetic energy operators drop out , and the molecular electronic energy as a function of internuclear separation , E(R) , can be obtained by solving Schrdinger 's equation variationally for the resulting eight-term electronic Hamiltonian , Hel , which in this analysis includes nuclear-nuclear repulsion . <p> Equation 2 <p> Now one can return to equation ( 1 ) with the calculated E(R) and treat it as the molecular " potential " field in which the nuclei move . The nuclear kinetic energy operators are re-written in terms of the nuclear center-of-mass coordinate and the internal coordinate R. After discarding the term involving the motion of the center of mass , the Hamiltonian energy operator becomes <p> Equation 3 <p> Following Slater , a more empirical approach is taken here and the abinitio E(R) is replaced by an analytical surrogate such as the Morse function ( 19 ) which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In other words the Morse function represents the total energy of a diatomic molecule assuming the Born-Oppenheimer approximation . <p> Substitution of equation ( 4 ) into ( 3 ) yields an energy Hamiltonian for which Schrdinger 's equation has an exact solution with the following quantized nuclear vibrational states ( 2 ) , <p> At this point the virial theorem is used to obtain a total energy profile for covalent bond formation in H2 . The first step in this approach is to acknowledge that the energy of a molecule is a sum of kinetic and potential energy contributions . <p> Equation 7 <p> The virial theorem for a diatomic molecule as a function of internuclear separation , R , is ( 14 ) <p> Equation 8 <p> Equations ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) can now be used to obtain expressions for the kinetic and potential energy in terms of the total energy and its first derivative . <p> Equation 9 <p> Equation 10 <p> Quoting Slater again ( 18 ) <p> These important equations determine the mean kinetic and potential energies as a function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the curves of E as a function of r which can be found from band spectra . The theory is so simple and direct that one can accept the results without question , remembering only the limitation of accuracy mentioned above . ( Here Slater is refering to the neglect of zero point vibration in his analysis . ) <p> Thus , when equation ( 4 ) , parameterized as indicated above , is used in equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) the energy profile for covalent bond formation in H2 shown in Figure 1 is obtained . <p> Analysis <p> This energy profile shows that as the inter-nuclear separation decreases , the potential energy rises , falls , and then rises again . The kinetic energy first decreases and then increases at about the same value of R that the potential energy begins to decrease . <p> The quantum mechanical interpretation of the energy profile is as follows ( 4 , 18 ) . As the molecular orbital is formed at large R constructive interference between the two overlapping atomic orbitals on the hydrogen atoms draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . The potential energy rises as electron density is removed from the region around the nuclei , but the total energy decreases because of a larger decrease in kinetic energy due to charge delocalization - the electrons now belong to the molecule and not the individual atoms . Thus , a decrease in kinetic energy funds the initial build-up of charge between the nuclei that is traditionally associated with chemical bond formation . <p> Following this initial phase , at an inter-nuclear separation of about 150 pm , the potential energy begins to decrease and the kinetic energy increases , both sharply eventually , while the total energy continues to decrease gradually . This is an atomic affect , not a molecular one , as Ruedenberg clearly showed . The initial transfer of charge away from the nuclei and into the bond region allows the atomic orbitals to contract causing a large decrease in potential energy because the electron density is moved , on average , closer to the nuclei . The kinetic energy increases because the atomic orbitals are smaller and kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atomic affect because the orbital contraction actually causes some electron density to be withdrawn from the bonding region and returned to the nuclei . <p> An energy minimum is reached while the potential energy is still in a significant decline , indicating that kinetic energy , which is increasing rapidly , is the immediate cause of a stable bond and the molecular ground state in H2 . The final increase in potential energy which is mainly due to nuclear-nuclear repulsion does n't begin until the inter-nuclear separation is less than 50 pm , while the equilibrium bond length is 74 pm . Thus the common explanation that an energy minimum is reached because of nuclear-nuclear and electron-electron repulsion does not have merit . As Ruedenberg ( 4 ) has noted " there are no ground states in classical mechanics or electrostatics . " <p> Conclusion <p> In conclusion a review of some basic principles and some additional observations are offered . Under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation the quantum mechanical energy operator for H2 consists of the final eight terms in equation ( 1 ) , which fall into four types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and electron-nuclear potential energy . Electron-nuclear potential energy is the only negative contribution to the total energy and is essential in understanding the stability of the chemical bond . H2 is a stable molecule because it has a lower total energy than its constituent atoms , not simply because there is a build-up of charge in the inter-nuclear region . As shown above , by itself this charge build-up actually increases the energy rather than decreasing it as is popularly , but incorrectly , believed . <p> We all recognize that electron kinetic energy is important at the computational level through its presence in the energy operator given in equation ( 1 ) . In other words ground states are calculated by minimizing the total energy , the sum of the kinetic and potential energy contributions . However , many ignore kientic energy when it comes to interpretation because they believe it is irrelevant . The origin of this error is a common misapplication of the virial theorem . <p> For example , it is common to argue from the virial theorem in the form , <p> Equation 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it decreases with bond formation and kinetic energy actually increases by twice as much . However , this form of the virial theorem is valid only for R = R and R = Re , the initial and final states . It tells us nothing about what is occuring when the bond is actually being formed - for that you need equations ( 7 - 10 ) . As has been shown above , what is actually occuring during bond formation is a rather subtle role reversal between kinetic and potential energy . It is ironic that Slater correctly used the virial theorem to show that electron kinetic energy is essential to understanding the chemical bond in the 1930s , while today many use it incorrectly to show that electron kinetic energy is irrelevant . <p> It has been known since the early years of the 20th century that no dynamic or static array of charged particles is stable on the basis of classical electrostatic principles alone . Therefore , the quantum mechanical picture of a wave-particle duality for the electron and the peculiar quantum mechanical nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and structure . The importance of kinetic energy runs counter to conventional opinion regarding the covalent bond in two seemingly paradoxical ways . First , a decrease in kinetic energy due to incipient molecular orbital formation funds the transfer of charge density into the internuclear region , lowering the total energy . Second , a large increase in kinetic energy associated with the subsequent atomic orbital contraction prevents the collapse of the molecule and causes an energy minimum and a stable molecular ground state . <p> In a previous publication ( 10b ) the formation of the covalent bond in H2 was analyzed in terms of a two-step mechanism involving : a ) orbital contraction ( " hybridization " ) followed by b ) orbital overlap ( charge delocalization and redistribution ) . It was shown that step a ) is an atomic and endothermic process , while b ) is a molecular and exothermic effect . The present study is consistent with this prior analysis , but reverses the order of the contributing effects ; atomic orbital overlap precedes atomic orbital contraction . Both mechanisms clearly reveal the important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In summary I concur with Kutzelnigg 's observation ( 22 ) , " The chemical bond is a highly complex phenomenon which eludes all attempts at simple description . " This means we must be careful how we teach the chemical bond to our students . It is not acceptable to present incorrect models of bonding to undergraduates because they are easier to understand and therefore easier to teach .

@@71697812 @397812/ <p> A secondary theme in carbonyl chemistry centers on the role played by the oxygen lone pairs . A compound with lone pairs can act as a Lewis base . Can carbonyl compounds also act as Lewis bases ? The answer is yes , although it is most important to think about carbonyls primarily as Lewis acids . <p> One of the reasons the basicity of the lone pair matters is because of carbonyl activation . If a carbonyl donates a lone pair to a Lewis acid , forming a bond , the carbonyl gets a formal positive charge . If the carbonyl has a formal positive charge , it attracts electrons more strongly . In that case , nucleophiles react more easily with the carbonyl . The carbonyl is said to be activated . <p> Figure CO13.1 .

@@71697813 @397813/ <p> Why do reactions take place at different rates ? Why do some happen quickly , and others proceed very slowly ? Why might the same reaction proceed at different rates under different conditions ? There are a number of factors that influence reaction rates , but the first one that we will look at is the activation barrier . <p> An activation barrier is a sort of energetic hurdle that a reaction must get over . Some reactions have higher hurdles and some have lower hurdles . It 's much easier to get over lower hurdles , so reactions with low activation barriers can proceed more quickly than ones with higher activation barriers . <p> A low activation barrier allows a reaction to happen quickly . <p> A high activation barrier makes a reaction go more slowly . <p> A reaction can be exergonic overall ( it can give off energy ) , but it will generally still have an activation barrier at the beginning . Even if the compounds go down in energy by the end of the reaction , they will generally go up in energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off energy overall , some energy must be put in at first to get the reaction started . <p> This situation is a little like investing in a business . A business generally requires some sort of financial investment to get started . If the business is successful , it will eventually make products and pay money back to the investors . If the business is unable to make back its initial investment , it may fail . <p> Reactions require some initial investment of energy . This energy may come from surrounding molecules or the environment in general . If the reaction is successful , it will proceed to make products and it will give energy back to its surroundings . <p> It always " costs " a molecule energy to enter into a reaction ; it " borrows " that energy from its environment . <p> That initial investment of energy may be " paid back " as the reaction proceeds . <p> All reactions must overcome activation barriers in order to occur . The activation barrier is the sum of the energy that must be expended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of , cartoonishly , as a hill the molecule has to climb over during the reaction . Once , there , it can just slide down the other side of the hill to become products . At the top of the hill , the molecule exists in what is called the " transition state " . At the transition state , the structure is somewhere between its original form and the structure of the products . <p> The type of diagram shown above is sometimes called a " reaction progress diagram " . It shows energy changes in the system as a reaction proceeds . One or more activation barriers may occur along the reaction pathways , as various elementary steps occur in the reaction . <p> In order to see more concretely what terms like " reaction progress " and " transition state " mean , let 's look at a real reaction . Suppose a nucleophile , such as an acetylide ion , donates its electrons to an electrophilic carbonyl . The p bond breaks and an alkoxide ion is formed . <p> The reaction progess simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just starting out , is it almost finished , is it just halfway there ? The transition state refers specifically to the highest energy point on the pathway from reactants to products .

The structure in the square brackets is the transition state , coresponding to the highest point on the curve . The " double dagger " symbol ( a little bit like a Patriarchal or Russian Orthodox cross , with two crosspieces on a vertical post ) is the symbol that tells you that you are looking at a transition state structure . <p> The transition state does n't refer to a regular chemical structure . It does n't necessarily obey the rules of Lewis structures , because some new bonds have started to form and some old bonds have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds in a Lewis structure . <p> Physically , the transition state structure is not something that can be isolated and stored in a bottle . Because it sits at the top of an energy curve , the transition state is motivated to turn into something else . No matter what direction it goes to change its structure , it will go to lower energy . Remember , things always proceed to lowest energy if possible . As soon as the transition state forms , it will either slide back into the original starting materials or slip forward into the final products . <p> The transition state is inherently a high-energy , unstable structure , with a very short lifetime . As soon as it comes into existence , it disappears again . <p> Problem RK3.1 . <p> Draw what you think the transition state might look like for the following elementary reactions . <p> More commonly , reaction progress diagrams are n't drawn like the one above . Instead , structures of reactants , transition states and products are simply shown along the potential energy curve , as shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . Sometimes there is an intermediate , or more than one . An intermediate differs from a transition state in that it has finite lifetime . Although it is not as stable as the reactants or the products , it is stable enough that it does not immediately decay . Going either forward to products or back to reactants is energetically uphill . <p> Problem RK3.2 . <p> Draw reaction progress diagrams for the following reactions . Note that the reactions may be composed of more than one elementary step . <p> Rate Constant <p> There is a measurable parameter that can be used to get an idea about the activation barrier of a reaction . It is called the rate constant . The rate constant for a reaction is related to how quickly the reaction proceeds . A large rate constant corresponds to a very fast reaction . A very small rate constant corresponds to a slow one . <p> The rate constant is an index of the speed of the reaction . <p> Rate constants have different units depending on how the reaction proceeds , but just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reaction with a " first order " rate constant of 0.001 s-1 ( or 10-3 s-1 ; you 'll learn what " first order " means later ) would be over in about an hour .

Based on that information , we get some ideas of what is happening on the way to the transition state . <p> The rate constant can be broken down into pieces . Mathematically , it is often expressed as <p> The ideal gas constant , Planck 's constant and Avogadro 's number are all typical constants used in modeling the behaviour of molecules or large groups of molecules .

The more energy available compared to the energy needed , the lower this ratio becomes . As a result , the exponential part of the function becomes larger ( since the power has a minus sign ) . That makes the rate constant bigger , and the reaction becomes faster . <p> Large groups of molecules behave like populations of anything else .

Notice that , at low temperature , not that many molecules have enough energy to get over the barrier at any one time . The reaction will proceed very slowly . Nevertheless , more energy is probably available from the surroundings , and so after some time most of the molecules will have obtained enough energy so that they can eventually hop over the barrier . <p> The yellow curve represents molecules at a higher temperature , and the red curve is a population at a higher temperature still .

The activation free energy is constant for a given reaction at a given temperature . But at different temperatures , ? G changes . Just as in thermodynamics , it can be broken down in turn to : <p> ? G = ? H - T ? S <p> in which ? H = activation enthalpy and ? S = activation entropy . <p> The activation enthalpy is the part that corresponds most closely with the energy required for the reaction , the way we have been describing the activation barrier so far . <p> The activation entropy deals with how the energy within the molecule must be redistributed for the reaction to occur .

Often , atoms need to be lined up in the proper place where they will be forming a new bond . <p> When molecules are restricted to only certain orientations or geometries , they have fewer degrees of freedom . With fewer degrees of freedom , energy can be stored in fewer ways . As a result , there is often an entropy cost in initiating a reaction . <p> On the other hand , a reaction might start in a very different way , with one molecule breaking a bond and dividing into two pieces .

@@71697818 @397818/ <h> Biochemistry Online : An Approach Based on Chemical Logic <p> All proteins are ultimately regulated , if only by modulating the rates of their synthesis and degradation . However , some enzymes positioned at key points in metabolic pathways are ideal candidates for regulation , as their activity can affect the output of entire pathways . These enzymes typically have two common characteristics , they catalyze reactions far from equilibrium and they catalyze early committed steps in pathways . <p> A. Regulation of enzymes for reactions not at equilibrium : <p> The optimal enzymes for regulation are those at the beginning of pathways and that carry out thermodynamically favored reactions . Why is the latter so important ? These enzymes control the flux of metabolites through pathway , so to understand their regulation we can use the analogy of flow ( or flux ) of water from one container to another . Let 's say you wish to fill a swimming pool at any desired height you wish and you have two ways to do so ( see figure below ) . You could open a valve that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool . In this the reaction ( flow of water ) is energetically ( thermodynamically ) favored given the difference in height of the water levels and the potential energy difference between the two . Even though flow ( or flux ) is cleared flavored , you can regulate it , from no flow , to maximal flow , by opening and closing the valve ( analogous to activating and inhibiting an enzyme ) . Your choices in the other scenario , filling the pool from a lake , are not so great . It would be hard to fill the water to the desired level ( especially if it was an above ground pool ) . It would be hard to regulate the flow . <p> By analogy , the best candidates for regulation are those enzymes whose reactions are thermodynamically favored ( not at equilibrium ) but which can be controlled by the mechanisms discussed in the previous section . <p> Which reactions are commonly not at equilibrium ( i.e. DG&lt;0 and usually also DG0 &lt;0 if the ratio of products to reactants is not too high ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermodynamically unstable compared to their reaction products . There are several types of reactions that often fit these criteria : <p> Hydrolysis ( or similar reactions ) of anhydride or analogous motifs : The figure below shows molecules with similar " anhydride " motifs and the DG0 for hydrolysis of the molecules . Those with more negative DG0 values can transfer their phosphate group to ADP to make ATP , which is necessary to drive unfavorable biological reactions . Metabolic reactions that involve hydrolysis ( or other type of transfer reaction of these groups ) usually proceed with a negative DG0 and DG , making them prime candidates for pathway regulation . Many textbooks label these types of molecules as having " high energy " bonds . This is confusing to many student as bonds between atoms lower the energy compare to when the atoms are not bonded . It takes energy to break the " high " energy phosphoanhydride covalent bond . What make hydrolysis of the molecules below so exergonic is that more energy is released on bond formation within the new products than was required to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects such as preferential hydration of the products , lower charge density in the products , and less competing resonances in the products all contribute to the thermodynamically favorable hydrolysis of the reactants . <p> Thioesters ( such as Acetyl-SCoA ) are also included since that have the same negative DG0 of hydrolysis as ATP , even though the lack an " anhydride " motif . Thioesters are destabilized compared to their hydrolysis products and in comparison to esters made with alcohol since the C-S bond is weaker . Why ? <p> Redox reactions : Everyone knows that redox reactions are thermodynamically favored if the oxidizing agent deployed is strong enough . The oxidation reactions of hydrocarbons , sugars , and fats by dioxygen are clearly exergonic ( we do call these combustion reactions after all ) . What about redox reactions with less powerful oxidants ? NAD+ is used frequently as a biological oxidizing agent . Are all these reactions as favored as combustion ? Hardly so . Remember that in every redox reaction , an oxidizing and reducing agent react to form another oxidizing and reducing agent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lactate + NAD+ . <p> This reaction can go either way and is reversible . In the above form , it is written in the favored direction in aeroboic metabolism when both Pyr and NADH level are high . Although the DG0 actually favors the oxidation of lactate , given the high concentration of Pyr and NADH , the reaction is driven in the opposite direction and proceeds as shown . To determine if a redox reaction is favored and likely to occur , and possibly be regulated , the DG0 for a redox reaction should be calculated from standard reduction potentials , using the formula DG0 = -nFE0 . <p> B. Regulation of enzymes catalyzing committed steps in pathways : <p> The best enzymes to regulate are those that catalyze the first committed step in the reaction pathway . The committed step proceeds with a DG &lt; 0 and is essentially irreversible . These reactions often occur from key metabolic intermediates that are immediately before or proximal to branches in reaction pathways . Two examples are shown below .

@@71697837 @397837/ <h> Wonder , Delight , Celebration : The Uses of Liberal Learning <h> by Sister Kristin Malloy , September 5 , 1990 <p> Fifty-one years ago this week I was a freshman in this college . No one was less prepared than I to meet the ideas in John Henry Newman 's definition of a liberal education in Sister Mariella Gable 's creative writing class . We read parts of his Idea of a University , the classic definitions of liberal education . I learned that " knowledge is its own end , " worth acquiring even if I never used it . My teacher drew a pie on the board ( we called it Newman 's pie ) ; she divided it into 8 or so pieces , each representing a division of subject matter . I would learn in order to know , and gradually I would discover that all knowledge is one ; all parts of that circle throw new light on every other part . ( If I ignored theology and philosophy , for instance , I would be just a victim of bad theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we suddenly see a new connection between what we 've known before and what we 've just learned . Such AHA moments of illumination , of vision , of seeing afresh , emblazen themselves in our minds . That is liberal learning . That is a tradition here . <p> Breaking the term liberal education into its Latin root meanings helps us see what it offers . Liber , of course , means to be free and gives us also the verb liberate . The prefix e- in educate means out , and the duc means to lead . To educate , then , is to draw out certain capacities , the very capacities that make us human , the ability to know and the freedom o choose . All of us pursue this learning all our lives , no one achieves it . No , you will not have completed a liberal arts education when you earn a diploma . <p> We learned at once what some of the rewards would be : Liberal education liberates . It would free us from superficiality , from prejudice , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from boredom -from the risk of passively settling for opinion . It would make us intellectually competent , able to think , to ask questions , to examine assumptions , to see errors in our reasoning . <p> I learned that liberal learning springs from wonder ; we 're startled to it , surprised . Sister Mariella got a biology teacher to take us for walks to learn the precise characteristics of the many kinds of evergreen needles to guarantee would be concrete in our writing , that we say " southern pine " or " jack pine " and never again write " evergreen tree . " After the next rain , look at a drop of water nestled among the needles of almost any pine you pass . The wonder of what you 'll see will be vivid all your life . Last week I kept seeing monarch butterflies as they fluttered in a group as if they knew where they 're going . ( They 're called a rebel when they travel together , as geese are called a gaggle ) ; so are news reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cluster on a tree in our cemetery so heavily that the tree becomes rust colored . As if at a signal , they take off for Mexico . Flying 12 miles an hour , they will land there in November , only to set out again next February to retrace their path to our campus . If I live to be a hundred , I can never see the monarchs without being dazed by a sense of wonder at creatures so fragile , so durable , and so full of a sense of goal and direction . <p> We began to learn how to learn , how to crack open and penetrate any subject matter . The biologist 's techniques and procedures differ totally from those of the philosopher and the historian ; neither of these can look at lab specimens under a microscope . Each of them is different from the way I get at a poem or a story . Twenty percent of what we learn as facts in any one year is proven untrue within five years . The faculty regrets that they do n't know which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us forever . We always knew we could be whatever we wanted to be ! <p> Liberal arts education helps us integrate what we know , much as catching on to what we have been blind to always expands and corrects our view of what 's out there . Get yourself to the top of the IDS center ( the tallest building ) in Minneapolis on a clear day or night . ( Is it 51 stories ? ) The view will leave you breathless as you see for the first time where each of the Twin Cities lies in relation to the other , where familiar landmarks , even suburbs , actually are . Last week I saw on a map that Fargo , North Dakota lies north of St. Joe and hardly west at all : I grew up in North Daokta ! All my life I 've known : you get to Fargo by going straight west of here .

( divinity ) , 3 . What is a person ? What does it mean to be human ? and 4 . What relationship can or should obtain between humanity , nature and God ? The whole liberal arts curriculum would yield the answers . <p> The illumination of mind that is a synonym for liberal learning requires hours , days , months , even years of intense study . That moment when we can say I see : comes when we discover the connections between and among the apparently but not really separate parts of the world we 've been looking at . Those moments of sudden flaring out of truth , those epiphanies , keep wonder alive in us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions you will find here ? The hunger to know , the ability to sit still until we see clearly what we 're examining , the patience to put into words what we think we begin to see . Liberal education drives or pulls all of us in a search for what Newman calls " enlargement of mind , for that " perfection of the intellect .... which is the clear , calm , accurate vision and comprehension of all things , as far as the human mind can embrace them .... " <p> Living the meaning of liberal education in the freshman year has been a tradition at this college for a long time . This leading the mind to do what it does best -to know ; this effort to perfect the intellect and the senses -occurs in every good liberal arts college . It also includes a development of one 's sensibilities and feelings for form , tone , shape and color so that we know that some things we see and hear are inexpressible except as images and tones . These are exemplified in our liturgies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Benedicta Arts Center all year -and in spectacular sunsets . <p> On this campus we find our liberal learning supported by traditions and values that can indeed educate our hearts . Let us look at several traditions and values that are special to this campus . Each of those habits and values is a consequence of our being not only on this Benedictine campus but of our being intimately related to this resident community of monastic women vowed to a communal life that is fifteen centuries old . Many of you looked at those values when your Symposium class considered The Rule of Benedict , this tiny document . You also learn Benedictine values by observation and osmosis . You 're surrounded by Benedictine women here . Benedict asks us to " Listen carefully ... with the ear of your heart " to " this advice from a father who loves you . " His advice can indeed educate and " mend " our hearts . <p> These Benedictine traditions nurture and promote our deepest hopes for ourselves . What do we long for , what do we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become ? We need to know that we are loveable , that we are with persons who will in fact love us , each one , and reach out to us no matter what our infirmities may be , that we can belong to others and need never be isolated again , that we know how to work with them and no longer need to compete , that we can reach out to those around us in their need and build them up , that we can be counted on not to stand idly by but to spend our selves for others , that we can make a commitment and be constant in living it , that we can celebrate the vision , the success , the growth of others , whoever they are . <p> Looking back to my student days and to all my days as a teacher here , I have identified the four Benedictine values likely to be the most vital in your lives : prayer , hospitality , community , and moderation . Though prayer is the highest value in our lives , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced or will experience them . <p> Hospitality is probably the first Benedictine value you experienced when you arrived .

The day you arrived here , you became a part of our extended community . We belong to one another . All your life we 'll care for you and support you with our friendship and our prayers . A good number of you , including students , are Benedictine oblates , lay persons who want to live the Gospel as fully as you can and see that the Rule of Benedict and our community cab can help . <p> The tradition you will find alive in the classroom is moderation . St. Benedict also calls this common sense .

Treat one another gently , tenderly , lest the one a fault become discouraged . <p> Community is next . Ours is an intentional community . Each of us came here seeking God . What do we commune about ? About the goodness and graciousness of God , about the mystery of our redemption and our " confident expectation of future glory " ( that 's the definition of hope ) . We commune about the weather and each other . Though the structure of our lives in this community has changed somewhat , we still do almost everything together : live , pray , eat and work . My sisters rarely tell me that my habits and mannerisms drive them crazy . That 's because Benedict urges us to " support with the greatest patience on another 's weakness of body or behavior , never to pursue what I judge better for myself but instead , what I judge better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forgive , to acknowledge our faults and make peace . We try never to diminish another but instead to build one another up . Our vow of stability means that we live together in this community all our lives . You 'll notice that we laugh a lot and enjoy one another . We celebrate one another at every chance . That 's community : that is what you now share . <p> Here 's a charming little story : when geese are flying south or north , if one goose is weak or sick and another goose notices , all the geese fly back to encourage it until all can leave together . If a young goose rebels and refuses to fly further , the whole flock or gaggle has been heard gabbing , persuading the rebel to stay with the group . Those natural analogies of religious community fill me with wonder . <p> These days , perhaps , Benedictine tradition of opening and ending the day with prayer touches your lives only later .

Some students and faculty do so often . By tradition Benedictines are contemplatives . We regularly free ourselves to do what seems wasteful , useless : we sit quietly , alone , centering ourselves , giving God quality time , renewing our deepest selves , just appreciating God . <p> These Benedictine traditions and others have marked this liberal arts college from its beginnings . These habits let us encounter ourselves on a deep plane than the one that so easily fragments our lives each day . They help us build an inner space to be at home in .

@@71697846 @397846/ <h> Good Stewardship of Paradox : The Identity of a Catholic College <p> I have chosen for this occasion a topic that , surprisingly , is not easy to talk about . I have chosen to talk about the identity of a Catholic college . That topic is embedded in bigger themes--the place of Catholic colleges and universities within the larger Church , the conditions necessary for graduate study of theology in a Catholic context , the significance of scholarly resources like the Hill Monastic Manuscript Library for Catholic higher education , the contribution of nonCatholics , nonChristians and nonbelievers to the mission of a Catholic college . It may seem that I am dodging these themes so central to the life 's work of many in our academic community . But I am not . I intend to raise questions which are relevant to those themes . But I can only do that if I confine myself today within a smaller compass . <p> So why is it hard to talk about the identity of a Catholic college ? Certainly not because of the presence today of colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are joined by representatives of colleges and universities whose missions are not articulated in religious terms . All of you have foundational values which it is difficult to talk about , which it is easier to acknowledge than to describe . All of you know what a challenge it is to ensure vitality in a mission grown old , what a challenge it is to keep such a mission in focus while nostalgia and bereavement for what once was keep distorting the lens . <p> So why is it hard to talk about the identity of a Catholic college in this obviously Catholic place ? Well you might not have noticed it among the Saint John 's and Saint Benedict 's faculty and administrators as we processed in , nor among the Saint John 's and Saint Benedict 's alumni of today and tomorrow who are sitting everywhere in this church . But there are Inquisitors in our midst , waiting for the tiniest slip of the tongue , longing to silence ideas which do not have a full and impeccable pedigree . There also are Ideologues , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with slogans , fired up with sentiment that to all the world looks selfserving . Inquisitors , Ideologues . . . that 's not all . If any hardwrought statement of faith or value comes out of this mouth , there are Scoffers here likely to taunt , knowing how upbringing or warped socialization has impaired my mental powers and those of my ilk . And sitting here quietly are Cynics , bemused , knowing that nothing much is gained by dwelling overmuch on the imponderable--after all , all of this has been said before and where has it gotten us ? <p> Inquisitors and Ideologues , Scoffers and Cynics . . . notice I have mentioned no names . You know who you are ! Indeed , in every member of a Catholic college each of these four demons makes his or her home--nibbling away at the mind , clogging up the heart , depleting energy which could be spent in service . Inquisitor and Ideologue , Scoffer and Cynic stalk every dialogue about the identity of a Catholic college . The Inquisitor in us tries to silence disagreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scoffer within finds it easy to ridicule those who speak out of the center of their lives , the internal Cynic dismisses the whole enterprise of talking about values . <p> Inquisitor and Ideologue , Scoffer and Cynic are all a royal pain . Surely it would be sensible , much more practical , simply to avoid dealing with them . We could divide the identity of a Catholic college into discrete parts , each tended by people with the appropriate training and interest . For example , theologians could take care of exploring the relationship of the divine and the human in expected parts of the curriculum . The ordained and " liturgy types " could make sure that the right kind of worship occurs . " Peace and justice types " could take the Gospel into places where most of us simply can not go . Certainly Roman Catholics could each have an opinion about whether or not theology , worship and service occupy their proper spheres here . And nonCatholics could be welcome indeed to appreciate all of this , as long as they stay respectful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity would allow things to work pretty smoothly . Inquisitors and Ideologues , Scoffers and Cynics would rarely break into the open . When they did it would be an offense against politeness --something we have spent much of our lives learning how to deal with . <p> Dividing a college 's Catholic identity into discrete parts looks prudent , it looks safe . But in reality it is more dangerous than any demon . When broken apart into pieces of turf , each occupied by a specialist or at least a special interest group , when Catholic identity is thus fragmented , it ceases to matter . Sure the curriculum , worship and service long characteristic of the college live on . But they languish since they are unconnected to anything beyond themselves . If as the president of this Catholic college , I call on us all to come to a sharper , more explicit awareness of the college 's Catholic identity , we will have to engage in dialogue suspicious of all boundaries , a dialogue in which no one has hegemony as a specialist and none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ est resides elsewhere . This is dangerous stuff . We will have to come to sharper awareness of disagreement , let go of control , resolve no matter what to affirm persons , and bear with ideas which seem halfbaked long enough to tease some thing worthwhile out of them . This will be a messy enterprise . We will become vulnerable . There will likely be namecalling . Differences , seemingly unbridgeable , will emerge . And , odds are , the larger world will consistently misinterpret what we are doing . <p> But despite the risks , I use this occasion to call Saint John 's University to come to a sharper sense of its identity as a Catholic college . In rejecting other , seemingly safer courses--those which promise immunity from Inquisitor and Ideologue , Scoffer and Cynic--in rejecting those seemingly safer courses , we will have no other choice but to renew our commitment to wideranging and inclusive intellectual inquiry . <p> In the balance of this talk I want to suggest ( 1 ) that Christian experience must be the foundation for inquiry into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry has to be mindful of the dynamics of Christian history , and ( 3 ) that such inquiry will only be successful if curriculum and worship are anchored in service . <h> Christian Experience <p> There is no way to talk about Christian experience without embracing **25;991;TOOLONG which tug against each other and , as they do so , open up a reality more spacious than the sum of the parts . The Judaic tradition from which Christianity originated was built on the massive solidity of law and temple , yet it honored unexpected bursts of prophecy . In the fullness of that tradition was born a Godman , who spoke as the prophet Elijah , yet claimed that rather than destroying the law he came to fulfill it . This Jesus suffered a horrible death , but thereby broke the bonds of death for all time . The early communities who acknowledged this Jesus as Lord set up rules to govern their most basic interactions , yet discovered time and again that they were transformed " in newness of life .

Yet no one has ever quite been able to distill their full meaning in a tidy set of propositions .

It must teach the tradition , yet ensure that prophetic critique tugs against it--so that the tradition can open up a reality more spacious than the sum of the parts . Along with Jesus Christ , a Catholic college must enter with full heart into the abysmal alienation of humankind , yet--sharing Christ 's own story--it must open up to utter transformation . A Catholic college must be unashamed to focus its best attention on ordering the mundane , yet cultivate a lively expectation that what is predictable is passing away . The foundations of belief must he clear in a Catholic college , but there ought to be a palpable sense of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At times we would all like a simple description of a Catholic college--one which would allow us to name names and establish some standards of measurement . There is something insidious in human nature , something which whittles paradox down to scale . Within a Catholic college there must be something which resists that drive . <h> Christian History <p> We can get a sense of what good stewardship of paradox is by considering the dynamics of Christian history . From the earliest Christian times , believers have struggled to understand their relationship to God , tabernacled as it is betwixt the paradoxes of law and prophecy , death and resurrection , order and utter trans formation . Left to themselves , earthen vessels can not hold these paradoxes for long . Therefore , in each age the Christian community has had to take care that the tensions within these paradoxes do not get out of kilter . Definitions and norms have been needed : definitions of the nature of Christ , the requirements for salvation , the nature of the church ; norms for right living , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers . The list goes on and on . . . Each of these definitions and norms has been forged in debate and--once established--has set up parameters which rule out other possibilities , some because they squeeze out the most vital parts of paradox , others because they fail to hold those elements together in a proper tension . <p> In each age , then , the Christian community has decided what it has had to , what definitions and norms it needs . Christians believe that the Holy Spirit is in those decisions , but not confined to them . The age in which a definition or norm has been cast always gives way to another age , always gives way to an age animated by different dynamics , contending with challenges anticipated by some but experienced by most as absolutely unprecedented . This inevitable passage from one age to the next is hard on definitions and norms ; their certainty starts to wobble and their power to fade . Ultimately the essential characteristic of definitions and norms--their ability to hold Christian paradox in its vital tension--is lost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles to regain what it has lost , to recast definitions and norms so that they once again succeed in opening up a reality more spacious than the sum of the parts . <p> As the Christian community struggles to do this , it makes a great difference how its members have adhered to the treasured definitions and norms inherited from the past . If the Christian community has held to its definitions and norms by annihilating diversity and debate , then when a new age breaks in , its members have--more times than not--missed the signs of that change . They have been overwhelmed by its challenges , sometimes even shipwrecked . On the other hand , if the Christian community has been confident enough of its definitions and norms to cherish the vitality of debate and value the persons of those who disagree , its members have had the wherewithal to bring their lives into dialogue with a new age and , under the Spirit 's guidance , to break good ground within it . In the high noon then of each age 's definitions and norms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contend and recontend , because such a dialogue helps the Christian community stay awake as time 's shackles give way , one by one . <p> At times we would all like a Catholic college to put its feet down and establish what ideas belong and what ones do not . There is something insidious in human nature , something which would like to pickle and preserve what is most precious . The dynamics of Christian history suggest that a Catholic college dare not enter into the business of pickling and preserving . A Catholic college ought to be confident enough about its way of embodying Christian tradition to cherish the vitality of debate about that tradition and value the persons of those who disagree . If a Catholic college is a place where the tug of contradictions can thus be sharply etched in public life , then its members become resilient , attentive to the challenges of a new age and--most importantly--able to respond to those challenges with creativity and vision . <h> The Requirements of a Catholic Education <p> A Catholic college then must , first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of Christian experience , to ground itself in the paradoxes of law vs. prophecy , death vs. life , order vs. utter transformation , contradictions which tug against each other and , as they do so , open up a reality more spacious than the sum of the parts . A Catholic college must be a place whose values and commitments are clear , but which resonates with a spaciousness greater than any formulations can provide . A Catholic college must also be courageous enough to embody Christian paradox in a particular time and place--to build a community which embodies the best understanding of the present , yet prizes personal integrity more than the herd and listens to all voices , especially the un expected and the dissonant . Out of these commitments a Catholic college creates an atmosphere for studying the curriculum , for assembling in worship and for extending itself in service to others . I would like to suggest that good stewardship of Christian paradox from one age to the next requires that a Catholic college 's curriculum , worship and service be drawn into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic college is extremely important . Theology courses must occupy pride of place as a staple within graduation requirements , introducing students to central aspects of Christian revelation--the essentials . But not only the essentials ! All students need to develop a sixth sense of the inner paradoxes of Christian revelation and how it unfolds . They need to develop a hunger , however protean , for more understanding . Beyond that basic graduation requirement , a Catholic college must also provide a strong major in theology , so as to ensure that some undergraduates can inquire deeply into the tradition and , through study and conversation with professors and fellow students , become adept at understanding how the paradoxes of the tradition are rearticulated in the face of great historical challenges . Whether on the level of graduation requirements or the major , students studying in a Catholic col lege must encounter theology in the context of alternative systems of meaning , so that their thinking becomes caught up in the debate which anchors Christianity 's paradoxical tradition and sets the trajectory for its development from age to age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theology courses are conceived and taught . But perhaps of greater significance is the commitment of professors and students in every other discipline within a Catholic college to make explicit , time and again , how their own discipline reckons with Christian tradition--ways in which at different times that reckoning has been appreciative , or antagonistic , or simply nonexistent ; reflecting with insight on why those encounters with Christian tradition have proceeded as they have . Only by this broad curricular dialogue can the seeds planted in the study of theology receive the richest possible nurture . Only then can a Catholic college really be said to be a good and faithful steward of Christian paradox . <p> Too often worship on a Catholic campus is regarded as a way to compensate for the necessary limit to the number of theology courses which the general student can be required to take . On the other hand , it is sometimes expected to be an arena for emotion , since the intellect supposedly gets so much attention in a college 's curriculum . In actuality , worship is something quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emotion inter sect in word and sacrament , but the purpose of that intersection transcends both . Christian worship is all about the Word breaking into lives to create a space for wrestling with questions and for resting for a time with answers not easily grasped . Christian worship holds up a mirror to the restless human heart and mind , and then goes one step further to provide the experience of purest Gift . Christian worship draws individuals of many different dispositions together into community and then sends them on with a transformed sense of the challenges they face . As it quickens a lively sense of community , worship also sharpens awareness of the stark and lonely requirements of personal integrity . A Catholic col lege must put great energy into worship . It must make sure that preaching and prayers , music , art and gesture are familiar to the individual , redolent of the communal memory of ages past . Yet at the same time , each of these facets must be so crafted that they scrape away at the commonplace , weaken adherence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The relationship of curriculum and worship in a Catholic college is strong , though not at all simple or straightforward . The curriculum is not a form of worship with a syllabus , nor is worship a way to learn something without tests . It is in the common commitment to service that both curriculum and worship find ground to share and work--in their own ways--to shape the identity of a Catholic college . On one level that commitment to service is focused upon the members of the college . Each year the boundaries of a Catholic college are redefined as new people become members . Each new member has precious talents which the college must help them to develop and to share . Each new member has personal dilemmas which the college will need to focus on quite explicitly at times , but most often with a light touch , simply creating a free space in which human growth can occur .

It is through providing service to one another , and extending service to a world in need--redefining and extending its boundaries--that a Catholic college 's curriculum and its worship are renewed in paradox . A valueladen curriculum like that offered by a Catholic college has the needed edge only if it is taught and studied by persons attentive to their own strengths and dilemmas , engaged in one way or another with the tangible travails of the larger human community . And the worship which calls the members of a Catholic college together into community is saved from smugness and narcissism only when the individuals who make up that community risk linking their life stories and making room within them for the brokenness of the world . <p> It is at this point that my remarks begin to wind to a conclusion . The identity of a Catholic college is found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradoxes of Christian **26;1018;TOOLONG ever in need of careful tending so that Christian experience can , from one age to the next , open up to a reality more spacious than the sum of the parts . There is joy in such an identity ; also a sense of being poured out in some larger scheme of things . <p> Perhaps Frederick Buechner expresses it most succinctly : " The place God calls you to is the place where your deep gladness and the world 's deep hunger meet . " 1 There is gladness in inquiry wellconceived and debate wellconducted--such gladness meets a gnawing hunger in the human family for new knowledge and dependable arenas in which it can be discovered . There is gladness in belonging to a community whose identity in time is secure precisely because it provides space for individual integrity--such gladness speaks to a world where the ballast provided by traditional values in all cultures is dangerously diminished and respect for persons is merely one desideratum among a bewildering array of others . There is gladness in having a mission which succeeds only if head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service of others--such gladness is a re sounding affirmation of the good in human life and all that struggles against the odds to enhance its quality . <p> A Catholic college must be very clear about the paradoxes which make for its " great gladness " and never cease to sharpen the vitality and significance of its members ' insight into those paradoxes . In doing so it meets " the world 's deep hunger , " empowering all its members to be light in the midst of darkness , precious and wellloved , providing the world fresh reason for hope .

In other words , they require food ( organic compound-rich materials ) from the environment.Heterotrophs can not synthesize their own organic compounds ( carbohydrates , proteins , fats ) from simple , inorganic materials .

Obviously herbivores have nice flat teeth for grinding up tough plants . The gut length of herbivores is typically much longer than that of carnivores because of the increased time needed for digestion of plant materials . <p> Animals are motile largely because of the need to find concentrated , pre-fabricated , localized food in the environment.Thus , the shape of the animal must be adapted for movement ( minimal S/V ratio ) ; <p> Because plants are autotrophic and their raw materials are essentially everywhere , there was no evolutionary pressure for motility in plants.However , the big problem that plants face is how to absorb the dilute , omnipotent nutrients ; hence their large S/V ratio , i.e. , dendritic growth ; <p> Animals needed a gut/digestive tract to process and remove foods/wastes.Because animals are non-selective , like a child at the supper table whose eyes are too big for his/her stomach , there is lot of waste.However , this would be a drag to carry around , so viola , the evolution of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marine " - they only absorb what they use so there is little waste - plants dispose wastes in the central vacuoles ( this is too bulky for animals ) .

@@71697879 @397879/ <p> SEVERUS to his dearest brother Desiderius sendeth greeting . I had determined , my like-minded brother , to keep private , and confine within the walls of my own house , the little treatise which I had written concerning the life of St. Martin . I did so , as I am not gifted with much talent , and shrank from the criticisms of the world , lest ( as I think will be the case ) my somewhat unpolished style should displease my readers , and I should be deemed highly worthy of general reprehension for having too boldly laid hold of a subject which ought to have been reserved for truly eloquent writers . But I have not been able to refuse your request again and again presented . For what could there be which I would not grant in deference to your love , even at the expense of my own modesty ? However , I have submitted the work to you on the sure understanding that you will reveal it to no other , having received your promise to that effect . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its publication to the world ; and I well know that , once issued , it can never1 be recalled . If this shall happen , and you come to know that it is read by some others , you will , I trust , kindly ask the readers to attend to the facts related , rather than the language in which they are set forth . You will beg them not to be offended if the style chances unpleasantly to affect their ears , because the kingdom of God consists not of eloquence , but faith . Let them also bear in mind that salvation was preached to the world , not by orators , but by fishermen , although God could certainly have adopted the other course , had it been advantageous . For my part , indeed , when I first applied my mind to writing what follows , because I thought it disgraceful that the excellences of so great a man should remain concealed , I resolved with myself not to feel ashamed on account of solecisms of language . This I did because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or , if I had formerly some taste of studies of the kind , I had lost the whole of that , through having neglected these matters for so long a course of time . But , after all , that I may not have in future to adopt such an irksome mode of self-defense , the best way will be that the book should be published , if you think right , with the author 's name suppressed . In order that this may be done , kindly erase the title which the book bears on its front , so that the page may be silent ; and ( what is quite enough ) let the book proclaim its subject-matter , while it tells nothing of the author . <h> Reasons for writing the Life of St. Martin . <p> MOST men being vainly devoted to the pursuit of worldly glory , have , as they imagined , acquired a memorial of their own names from this source ; viz. devoting their pens to the embellishment of the lives of famous men . This course , although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has undoubtedly brought them some fulfilment of the hope they cherished . It has done so , both by preserving their own memory , though to no purpose , and because , through their having presented to the world the examples of great men , no small emulation has been excited in the bosoms of their readers . Yet , notwithstanding these things , their labors have in no degree borne upon the blessed and never-ending life to which we look forward . For what has a glory , destined to perish with the world , profited those men themselves who have written on mere secular matters ? Or what benefit has posterity derived from reading of Hector as a warrior , or Socrates as an expounder of philosophy ? There can be no profit in such things , since it is not only folly to imitate the persons referred to , but absolute madness not to assail them with the utmost severity . For , in truth , those persons who estimate human life only by present actions , have consigned their hopes to fables , and their souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to be perpetuated simply in the memory of mortals , whereas it is the duty of man rather to seek after eternal life than an eternal memorial and that , not by writing , or fighting , or philosophizing , but by living a pious , holy , and religious life . This erroneous conduct of mankind , being enshrined in literature , has prevailed to such an extent that it has found many who have been emulous either of the vain philosophy or the foolish excellence which has been celebrated . For this reason , I think I will accomplish something well worth the necessary pains , if I write the life of a most holy man , which shall serve in future as an example to others ; by which , indeed , the readers shall be roused to the pursuit of true knowledge , and heavenly warfare , and divine virtue . In so doing , we have regard also to our own advantage , so that we may look for , not a vain remembrance among men , but an eternal reward from God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner that we can serve for an example to others , nevertheless , we have made it our endeavor that he should not remain unknown who was a man worthy of imitation . I shall therefore set about writing the life of St. Martin , and shall narrate both what he did previous to his episcopate , and what he performed as a bishop . At the same time , I can not hope to set forth all that he was or did . Those excellences of which he alone was conscious are completely unknown , because , as he did not seek for honor from men , he desired , as much as he could accomplish it , that his virtues should be concealed . And even of those which had become known to us , we have omitted a great number , because we have judged it enough if only the more striking and eminent should be recorded . At the same time , I had in the interests of readers to see to it that , no undue amount of instances being set before them should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are to read what follows to give full faith to the things narrated , and to believe that I have written nothing of which I had not certain knowledge and evidence . I should , in fact , have preferred to be silent rather than to narrate things which are false. 2 <h> Military Service of St. Martin . <p> MARTIN , then , was born at Sabaria3 in Pannonia , but was brought up at Ticinum , 4 which is situated in Italy . His parents were , according to the judgment of the world , of no mean rank , but were heathens . His father was at first simply a soldier , but afterwards a military tribune . He himself in his youth following military pursuits was enrolled in the imperial guard , first under king Constantine , and then under Julian Csar . This , however , was not done of his own free will , for , almost from his earliest years , the holy infancy of the illustrious boy aspired rather to the service of God. 5 For , when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against the wish of his parents , to the Church , and begged that he might become a catechumen . Soon afterwards , becoming in a wonderful manner completely devoted to the service of God , when he was twelve years old , he desired to enter on the life of a hermit ; and he would have followed up that desire with the necessary vows , had not his as yet too youthful age prevented . His mind , however , being always engaged on matters pertaining to the monasteries or the Church , already meditated in his boyish years what he afterwards , as a professed servant of Christ , fulfilled . But when an edict was issued by the ruling powers6 in the state , that the sons of veterans should be enrolled for military service , and he , on the information furnished by his father , ( who looked with an evil eye on his blessed actions ) having been seized and put in chains , when he was fifteen years old , was compelled to take the military oath , then showed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to him , changing places as it were , he often acted as though , while really master , he had been inferior ; to such a degree that , for the most part , he drew off his servant 's boots and cleaned them with his own hand ; while they took their meals together , the real master , however , generally acting the part of servant . During nearly three years before his baptism , he was engaged in the profession of arms , but he kept completely free from those vices in which that class of men become too frequently involved . He showed exceeding kindness towards his fellow-soldiers , and held them in wonderful affection ; while his patience and humility surpassed what seemed possible to human nature . There is no need to praise the self-denial which he displayed : it was so great that , even at that date , he was regarded not so much as being a soldier as a monk . By all these qualities he had so endeared himself to the whole body of his comrades , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet made a new creature7 in Christ , he , by his good works , acted the part of a candidate for baptism . This he did , for instance , by aiding those who were in trouble , by furnishing assistance to the wretched , by supporting the needy , by clothing the naked , while he reserved nothing for himself from his military pay except what was necessary for his daily sustenance . Even then , far from being a senseless hearer of the Gospel , he so far complied with its precepts as to take no thought about the morrow . <h> Christ appears to St. Martin . <p> ACCORDINGLY , at a certain period , when he had nothing except his arms and his simple military dress , in the middle of winter , a winter which had shown itself more severe than ordinary , so that the extreme cold was proving fatal to many , he happened to meet at the gate of the city of Amiens8 a poor man destitute of clothing . He was entreating those that passed by to have compassion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice , when Martin , that man full of God , recognized that a being to whom others showed no pity , was , in that respect , left to him . Yet , what should he do ? He had nothing except the cloak in which he was clad , for he had already parted with the rest of his garments for similar purposes . Taking , therefore , his sword with which he was girt , he divided his cloak into two equal parts , and gave one part to the poor man , while he again clothed himself with the remainder . Upon this , some of the by-standers laughed , because he was now an unsightly object , and stood out as but partly dressed . Many , however , who were of sounder understanding , groaned deeply because they themselves had done nothing similar . They especially felt this , because , being possessed of more than Martin , they could have clothed the poor man without reducing themselves to nakedness . In the following night , when Martin had resigned himself to sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his cloak with which he had clothed the poor man . He contemplated the Lord with the greatest attention , and was told to own as his the robe which he had given . Ere long , he heard Jesus saying with a clear voice to the multitude of angels standing round -- " Martin , who is still but a catechumen , clothed9 me with this robe . " The Lord , truly mindful of his own words ( who had said when on earth -- " Inasmuch10 as ye have done these things to one of the least of these , ye have done them unto me " ) , declared that he himself had been clothed in that poor man ; and to confirm the testimony he bore to so good a deed , he condescended to show him himself in that very dress which the poor man had received . After this vision the sainted man was not puffed up with human glory , but , acknowledging the goodness of God in what had been done , and being now of the age of twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , however , all at once , retire from military service , yielding to the entreaties of his tribune , whom he admitted to be his familiar tent-companion. 11 For the tribune promised that , after the period of his office had expired , he too would retire from the world . Martin , kept back by the expectation of this event , continued , although but in name , to act the part of a soldier , for nearly two years after he had received baptism . <h> Martin retires from Military Service . <p> IN the meantime , as the barbarians were rushing within the two divisions of Gaul , Julian Csar , 12 bringing an army together at the city13 of the Vaugiones , began to distribute a donative to the soldiers . As was the custom in such a case , they were called forward , one by one , until it came to the turn of Martin . Then , indeed , judging it a suitable opportunity for seeking his discharge--for he did not think it would be proper for him , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a donative--he said to Csar , " Hitherto I have served you as a soldier : allow me now to become a soldier to God : let the man who is to serve thee receive thy donative : I am the soldier of Christ : it is not lawful for me to fight . " Then truly the tyrant stormed on hearing such words , declaring that , from fear of the battle , which was to take place on the morrow , and not from any religious feeling , Martin withdrew from the service . But Martin , full of courage , yea all the more resolute from the danger that had been set before him , exclaims , " If this conduct of mine is ascribed to cowardice , and not to faith , I will take my stand unarmed before the line of battle tomorrow , and in the name of the Lord Jesus , protected by the sign of the cross , and not by shield or helmet , I will safely penetrate the ranks of the enemy . " He is ordered , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words true by exposing himself unarmed to the barbarians . But , on the following day , the enemy sent ambassadors to treat about peace and surrendered both themselves and all their possessions . In these circumstances who can doubt that this victory was due to the saintly man ? It was granted him that he should not be sent unarmed to the fight . And although the good Lord could have preserved his own soldier , even amid the swords and darts of the enemy , yet that his blessed eyes might not be pained by witnessing the death of others , he removed all necessity for fighting . For Christ did not require to secure any other victory in behalf of his own soldier , than that , the enemy being subdued without bloodshed , no one should suffer death . <h> Martin converts a Robber to the Faith . <p> FROM that time quitting military service , Martin earnestly sought after the society of Hilarius , bishop of the city Pictava , 14 whose faith in the things of God was then regarded as of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin made his abode with him . Now , this same Hilarius , having instituted him in the office of the diaconate , endeavored still more closely to attach him to himself , and to bind him by leading him to take part in Divine service . But when he constantly refused , crying out that he was unworthy , Hilarius , as being a man of deep penetration , perceived that he could only be constrained in this way , if he should lay that sort of office upon him , in discharging which there should seem to be a kind of injury done him . He therefore appointed him to be an exorcist . Martin did not refuse this appointment , from the fear that he might seem to have looked down upon it as somewhat humble . Not long after this , he was warned in a dream that he should visit his native land , and more particularly his parents , who were still involved in heathenism , with a regard for their religious interests . He set forth in accordance with the expressed wish of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with many prayers and tears , that he would in due time return . According to report Martin entered on that journey in a melancholy frame of mind , after calling the brethren to witness that many sufferings lay before him . The result fully justified this prediction . For , first of all , having followed some devious paths among the Alps , he fell into the hands of robbers . And when one of them lifted up his axe and poised it above Martin 's head , another of them met with his right hand the blow as it fell ; nevertheless , having had his hands bound behind his back , he was handed over to one of them to be guarded and stripped . The robber , having led him to a private place apart from the rest , began to enquire of him who he was . Upon this , Martin replied that he was a Christian . The robber next asked him whether he was afraid . Then indeed Martin most courageously replied that he never before had felt so safe , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially present with him in the midst of trials . He added that he grieved rather for the man in whose hands he was , because , by living a life of robbery , he was showing himself unworthy of the mercy of Christ . And then entering on a discourse concerning Evangelical truth , he preached the word of God to the robber . Why should I delay stating the result ? The robber believed ; and , after expressing his respect for Martin , he restored him to the way , entreating him to pray the Lord for him . That same robber was afterwards seen leading a religious life ; so that , in fact , the narrative I have given above is based upon an account furnished by himself . <h> The Devil throws himself in the Way of Martin . <p> MARTIN , then , having gone on from thence , after he had passed Milan , the devil met him in the way , having assumed the form of a man . The devil first asked him to what place he was going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minded to go whithersoever the Lord called him , the devil said to him , " Wherever you go , or whatever you attempt , the devil will resist you . " Then Martin , replying to him in the prophetical word , said , " The Lord is my helper ; I will not fear what man can do unto me. " 15 Upon this , his enemy immediately vanished out of his sight ; and thus , as he had intended in his heart and mind , he set free his mother from the errors of heathenism , though his father continued to cleave to its evils . However , he saved many by his example . <p> After this , when the Arian heresy had spread through the whole world , and was especially powerful in Illyria , and when he , almost single-handed , was fighting most strenuously against the treachery of the priests , and had been subjected to many punishments ( for he was publicly scourged , and at last was compelled to leave the city ) , again betaking himself to Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaul in a distracted condition through the departure also of the holy Hilarius , whom the violence of the heretics had driven into exile , he established a monastery for himself at Milan . There , too , Auxentius , the originator and leader of the Arians , bitterly persecuted him ; and , after he had assailed him with many injuries , violently expelled him from the city . Thinking , therefore , that it was necessary to yield to circumstances , he withdrew to the island Gallinaria , 16 with a certain presbyter as his companion , a man of distinguished excellences . Here he subsisted for some time on the roots of plants ; and , while doing so , he took for food hellebore , which is , as people say , a poisonous kind of grass . But when he perceived the strength of the poison increasing within him , and death now nearly at hand , he warded off the imminent danger by means of prayer , and immediately all his pains were put to flight . And not long after having discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission to return had been granted to holy Hilarius , he made an effort to meet him at Rome , and , with this view , set out for that city . <h> Martin restores a Catechumen to Life . <p> AS Hilarius had already gone away , so Martin followed in his footsteps ; and having been most joyously welcomed by him , he established for himself a monastery not far from the town . At this time a certain catechumen joined him , being desirous of becoming instructed in the doctrines17 and habits of the most holy man . But , after the lapse only of a few days , the catechumen , seized with a languor , began to suffer from a violent fever . It so happened that Martin had then left home , and having remained away three days , he found on his return that life had departed from the catechumen ; and so suddenly had death occurred , that he had left this world without receiving baptism . The body being laid out in public was being honored by the last sad offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurries up to them with tears and lamentations . But then laying hold ; as it were , of the Holy Spirit , with the whole powers of his mind , he orders the others to quit the cell in which the body was lying ; and bolting the door , he stretches himself at full length on the dead limbs of the departed brother . Having given himself for some time to earnest prayer , and perceiving by means of the Spirit of God that power was present , 18 he then rose up for a little , and gazing on the countenance of the deceased , he waited without misgiving for the result of his prayer and of the mercy of the Lord . And scarcely had the space of two hours elapsed , when he saw the dead man begin to move a little in all his members , and to tremble with his eyes opened for the practice of sight . Then indeed , turning to the Lord with a loud voice and giving thanks , he filled the cell with his ejaculations . Hearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately rush inside . And truly a marvelous spectacle met them , for they beheld the man alive whom they had formerly left dead . Thus being restored to life , and having immediately obtained baptism , he lived for many years afterwards ; and he was the first who offered himself to us both as a subject that had experienced the virtues19 of Martin , and as a witness to their existence . The same man was wont to relate that , when he left the body , he was brought before the tribunal of the Judge , and being assigned to gloomy regions and vulgar crowds , he received a severe20 sentence . Then , however , he added , it was suggested by two angels of the Judge that he was the man for whom Martin was praying ; and that , on this account , he was ordered to be led back by the same angels , and given up to Martin , and restored to his former life . From this time forward , the name of the sainted man became illustrious , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also deemed powerful and truly apostolical . <h> Martin restores one that had been strangled . <p> NOT long after these events , while Martin was passing by the estate of a certain man named Lupicinus , who was held in high esteem according to the judgment of the world , he was received with shouting and the lamentations of a wailing crowd . Having , in an anxious state of mind gone up to that multitude , and enquired what such weeping meant , he was told that one of the slaves of the family had put an end to his life by hanging . Hearing this , Martin entered the cell in which the body was lying , and , excluding all the multitude , he stretched himself upon the body , and spent some little time in prayer . Ere long , the deceased , with life beaming in his countenance , and with his drooping eyes fixed on Martin 's face , is aroused ; and with a gentle effort attempting to rise , he laid hold of the right hand of the saintly man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this manner , while the whole multitude looked on , he walked along with Martin to the porch of the house . <h> High Esteem in which Martin was held . <p> NEARLY about the same time , Martin was called upon to undertake the episcopate of the church at Tours ; 21 but when he could not easily be drawn forth from his monastery , a certain Ruricius , one of the citizens , pretending that his wife was i 'll , and casting himself down at his knees , prevailed on him to go forth . Multitudes of the citizens having previously been posted by the road on which he traveled , he is thus under a kind of guard escorted to the city . An incredible number of people not only from that town , but also from the neighboring cities , had , in a wonderful manner , assembled to give their votes. 22 There was but one wish among all , there were the same prayers , and there was the same fixed opinion to the effect that Martin was most worthy of the episcopate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest . A few persons , however , and among these some of the bishops , who had been summoned to appoint a chief priest , were impiously offering resistance , asserting forsooth that Martin 's person was contemptible , that he was unworthy of the episcopate , that he was a man despicable in countenance , that his clothing was mean , and his hair disgusting . This madness of theirs was ridiculed by the people of sounder judgment , inasmuch as such objectors only proclaimed the illustrious character of the man , while they sought to slander him . Nor truly was it allowed them to do anything else , than what the people , following the Divine will , desired23 to be accomplished . Among the bishops , however , who had been present , a certain one of the name Defensor is said to have specially offered opposition ; and on this account it was observed that he was at the time severely censured in the reading from the prophets . For when it so happened that the reader , whose duty it was to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , failed to appear , the officials falling into confusion , while they waited for him who never came , one of those standing by , laying hold of the Psalter , seized upon the first verse which presented itself to him . Now , the Psalm ran thus : " Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise because of thine enemies , that thou mightest destroy the enemy and the avenger. " 24 On these words being read , a shout was raised by the people , and the opposite party were confounded . It was believed that this Psalm had been chosen by Divine ordination , that Defensor25 might hear a testimony to his own work , because the praise of the Lord was perfected out of the mouth of babes and sucklings in the case of Martin , while the enemy was at the same time both pointed out and destroyed . <h> Martin as Bishop of Tours . <p> AND now having entered on the episcopal office , it is beyond my power fully to set forth how Martin distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained with the utmost constancy , the same as he had been before . There was the same humility in his heart , and the same homeliness in his garments . Full alike of dignity and courtesy , he kept up the position of a bishop properly , yet in such a way as not to lay aside the objects and virtues of a monk . Accordingly he made use , for some time , of the cell connected with the church but afterwards , when he felt it impossible to tolerate the disturbance caused by the numbers of those visiting it , he established a monastery for himself about two miles outside the city . This spot was so secret and retired that he enjoyed in it the solitude of a hermit . For , on one side , it was surrounded by a precipitous rock of a lofty mountain , while the river Loire had shut in the rest of the plain by a bay extending back for a little distance ; and the place could be approached only by one , and that a very narrow passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood . Many also of the brethren had , in the same manner , fashioned retreats for themselves , but most of them had formed these out of the rock of the overhanging mountain , hollowed into caves . There were altogether eighty disciples , who were being disciplined after the example of the saintly master . No one there had anything which was called his own ; all things were possessed in common . It was not allowed either to buy or to sell anything , as is the custom among most monks . No art was practiced there , except that of transcribers , and even this was assigned to the brethren of younger years , while the elders spent their time in prayer . Rarely did any one of them go beyond the cell , unless when they assembled at the place of prayer . They all took their food together , after the hour of fasting was past . No one used wine , except when illness compelled them to do so . Most of them were clothed in garments of camels ' hair. 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this must be thought the more remarkable , because many among them were such as are deemed of noble rank . These , though far differently brought up , had forced themselves down to this degree of humility and patient endurance , and we have seen numbers of these afterwards made bishops . For what city or church would there be that would not desire to have its priests from among those in the monastery of Martin ? <h> Martin demolishes an Altar consecrated to a Robber . <p> BUT let me proceed to a description of other excellences which Martin displayed as a bishop . There was , not far from the town , a place very close to the monastery , which a false human opinion had consecrated , on the supposition that some martyrs had been buried together there . For it was also believed that an altar had been placed there by former bishops . But Martin , not inclined to give a hasty belief to things uncertain , often asked from those who were his elders , whether among the presbyters or clerics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he suffered , should be made known to him . He did so , he said , because he had great scruples on these points , inasmuch as no steady tradition respecting them had come down from antiquity . Having , therefore , for a time kept away from the place , by no means wishing to lessen the religious veneration with which it was regarded , because he was as yet uncertain , but , at the same time not lending his authority to the opinion of the multitude , lest a mere superstition should obtain a firmer footing , he one day went out to the place , taking a few brethren with him as companions . There standing above the very sepulchre , Martin prayed to the Lord that he would reveal , who the man in question was , and what was his character or desert . Next turning to the left-hand side , he sees standing very near a shade of a mean and cruel appearance . Martin commands him to tell his name and character . Upon this , he declares his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a robber , and that he was beheaded on account of his crimes ; that he had been honored simply by an error of the multitude ; that he had nothing in common with the martyrs , since glory was their portion , while punishment exacted its penalties from him . Those who stood by heard , in a wonderful way , the voice of the speaker , but they beheld no person . Then Martin made known what he had seen , and ordered the altar which had been there to be removed , and thus he delivered the people from the error of that superstition . <h> Martin causes the Bearers of a Dead Body to stop . <p> NOW , it came to pass some time after the above , that while Martin was going a journey , he met the body of a certain heathen , which was being carried to the tomb with superstitious funeral rites . Perceiving from a distance the crowd that was approaching , and being ignorant as to what was going on , he stood still for a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile between him and the crowd , so that it was difficult to discover what the spectacle he beheld really was . Nevertheless , because he saw it was a rustic gathering , and when the linen clothes spread over the body were blown about by the action of the wind , he believed that some profane rites of sacrifice were being performed . This thought occurred to him , because it was the custom of the Gallic rustics in their wretched folly to carry about through the fields the images of demons veiled with a white covering . Lifting up , therefore , the sign of the cross opposite to them , he commanded the crowd not to move from the place in which they were , and to set down the burden . Upon this , the miserable creatures might have been seen at first to become stiff like rocks . Next , as they endeavored , with every possible effort , to move forward , but were not able to take a step farther , they began to whirl themselves about in the most ridiculous fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight , they set down the dead body . Thunderstruck , and gazing in bewilderment at each other as not knowing what had happened to them , they remained sunk in silent thought . But when the saintly man discovered that they were simply a band of peasants celebrating funeral rites , and not sacrifices to the gods , again raising his hand , he gave them the power of going away , and of lifting up the body . Thus he both compelled them to stand when he pleased , and permitted them to depart when he thought good . <h> Martin escapes from a Falling Pine-tree . <p> AGAIN , when in a certain village he had demolished a very ancient temple , and had set about cutting down a pine-tree , which stood close to the temple , the chief priest of that place , and a crowd of other heathens began to oppose him . And these people , though , under the influence of the Lord , they had been quiet while the temple was being overthrown , could not patiently allow the tree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing sacred in the trunk of a tree , and urged them rather to honor God whom he himself served . He added that there was a moral necessity why that tree should be cut down , because it had been dedicated to a demon . Then one of them who was bolder than the others says , " If you have any trust in thy God , whom you say you worship , we ourselves will cut down this tree , and be it your part to receive it when falling ; for if , as you declare , your Lord is with you , you will escape all injury . " Then Martin , courageously trusting in the Lord , promises that he would do what had been asked . Upon this , all that crowd of heathen agreed to the condition named ; for they held the loss of their tree a small matter , if only they got the enemy of their religion buried beneath its fall . Accordingly , since that pine-tree was hanging over in one direction , so that there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Martin , having been bound , is , in accordance with the decision of these pagans , placed in that spot where , as no one doubted , the tree was about to fall . They began , therefore , to cut down their own tree , with great glee and joyfulness , while there was at some distance a great multitude of wondering spectators . And now the pine-tree began to totter , and to threaten its28 own ruin by falling . The monks at a distance grew pale , and , terrified by the danger ever coming nearer , had lost all hope and confidence , expecting only the death of Martin . But he , trusting in the Lord , and waiting courageously , when now the falling pine had uttered its expiring crash , while it was now falling , while it was just rushing upon him , simply holding up his hand against it , he put in its way the sign of salvation . Then , indeed , after the manner of a spinning-top ( one might have thought it driven29 back ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a degree that it almost crushed the rustics , who had taken their places there in what was deemed a safe spot . Then truly , a shout being raised to heaven , the heathen were amazed by the miracle , while the monks wept for joy ; and the name of Christ was in common extolled by all . The well-known result was that on that day salvation came to that region . For there was hardly one of that immense multitude of heathens who did not express a desire for the imposition of hands , and abandoning his impious errors , made a profession of faith in the Lord Jesus . Certainly , before the times of Martin , very few , nay , almost none , in those regions had received the name of Christ ; but through his virtues and example that name has prevailed to such an extent , that now there is no place thereabouts which is not filled either with very crowded churches or monasteries . For wherever he destroyed heathen temples , there he used immediately to build either churches or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> NOR did he show less eminence , much about the same time , in other transactions of a like kind . For , having in a certain village set fire to a very ancient and celebrated temple , the circle of flames was carried by the action of the wind upon a house which was very close to , yea , connected with , the temple . When Martin perceived this , he climbed by rapid ascent to the roof of the house , presenting himself in front of the advancing flames . Then indeed might the fire have been seen thrust back in a wonderful manner against the force of the wind , so that there appeared a sort of conflict of the two elements fighting together . Thus , by the influence of Martin , the fire only acted in the place where it was ordered to do so . But in a village which was named Leprosum , when he too wished to overthrow a temple which had acquired great wealth through the superstitious ideas entertained of its sanctity , a multitude of the heathen resisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not without bodily injury . He , therefore , withdrew to a place in the vicinity , and there for three days , clothed in sackcloth30 and ashes fasting and praying the whole time , he besought the Lord , that , as he had not been able to overthrow that temple by human effort , Divine power might be exerted to destroy it . Then two angels , with spears and shields after the manner of heavenly warriors , suddenly presented themselves to him , saying that they were sent by the Lord to put to flight the rustic multitude , and to furnish protection to Martin , lest , while the temple was being destroyed , any one should offer resistance . They told him therefore to return , and complete the blessed work which he had begun . Accordingly Martin returned to the village ; and while the crowds of heathen looked on in perfect quiet as he razed the pagan temple even to the foundations , he also reduced all the altars and images to dust . At this sight the rustics , when they perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention of the Divine will , that they might not be found fighting against the bishop , almost all believed in the Lord Jesus . They then began to cry out openly and to confess that the God of Martin ought to be worshiped , and that the idols should be despised , which were not able to help them . <h> Martin offers his Neck to an Assassin . <p> I SHALL also relate what took place in the village of the dui . When Martin was there overthrowing a temple , a multitude of rustic heathen rushed upon him in a frenzy of rage . And when one of them , bolder than the rest , made an attack upon him with a drawn sword , Martin , throwing back his cloak , offered his bare neck to the assassin . Nor did the heathen delay to strike , but in the very act of lifting up his right arm , he fell to the ground on his back , and being overwhelmed by the fear of God , he entreated for pardon . Not unlike this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain man had resolved to wound him with a knife as he was destroying some idols , at the very moment of fetching the blow , the weapon was struck out of his hands and disappeared . Very frequently , too , when the pagans were addressing him to the effect that he would not overthrow their temples , he so soothed and conciliated the minds of the heathen by his holy discourse that , the light of truth having been revealed to them , they themselves overthrew their own temples . <h> Cures effected by St. Martin . <p> MOREOVER , the gift31 of accomplishing cures was so largely possessed by Martin , that scarcely any sick person came to him for assistance without being at once restored to health . This will clearly appear from the following example . A certain girl at Treves32 was so completely prostrated by a terrible paralysis that for a long time she had been quite unable to make use of her body for any purpose , and being , as it were , already dead , only the smallest breath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives were standing by , expecting nothing but her death , when it was suddenly announced that Martin had come to that city . When the father of the girl found that such was the case , he ran to make a request in behalf of his all but lifeless child . It happened that Martin had already entered the church . There , while the people were looking on , and in the presence of many other bishops , the old man , uttering a cry of grief , embraced the saint 's knees and said : " My daughter is dying of a miserable kind of infirmity ; and , what is more dreadful than death itself , she is now alive only in the spirit , her flesh being already dead before the time . I beseech thee to go to her , and give her thy blessing ; for I believe that through you she will be restored to health . " Martin , troubled by such an address , was bewildered , and shrank back , saying that this was a matter not in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judgment he had formed ; and that he was not worthy to be the instrument through whom the Lord should make a display of his power . The father , in tears , persevered in still more earnestly pressing the case , and entreated Martin to visit the dying girl . At last , constrained by the bishops standing by to go as requested , he went down to the home of the girl . An immense crowd was waiting at the doors , to see what the servant of the Lord would do . And first , betaking himself to his familiar arms in affairs of that kind , he cast himself down on the ground and prayed . Then gazing earnestly upon the ailing girl , he requests that oil should be given him . After he had received and blessed this , he poured the powerful sacred liquid into the mouth of the girl , and immediately her voice returned to her . Then gradually , through contact with him , her limbs began , one by one , to recover life , till , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose with firm steps . <h> Martin casts out Several Devils . <p> AT the same time the servant of one Tetradius , a man of proconsular rank , having been laid hold of by a demon , was tormented with the most miserable results . Martin , therefore , having been asked to lay his hands on him , ordered the servant to be brought to him ; but the evil spirit could , in no way , be brought forth from the cell in which he was : he showed himself so fearful , with ferocious teeth , to those who attempted to draw near . Then Tetradius throws himself at the feet of the saintly man , imploring that he himself would go down to the house in which the possessed of the devil was kept . But Martin then declared that he could not visit the house of an unconverted heathen . For Tetradius , at that time , was still involved in the errors of heathenism . He , therefore , pledges his word that if the demon were driven out of the boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laying his hand upon the boy , cast the evil spirit out of him . On seeing this , Tetradius believed in the Lord Jesus , and immediately became a catechumen , while , not long after , he was baptized ; and he always regarded Martin with extraordinary affection , as having been the author of his salvation . <p> About the same time , having entered the dwelling of a certain householder in the same town , he stopped short at the very threshold , and said , that he perceived a horrible demon in the courtyard of the house . When Martin ordered it to depart , it laid hold of a certain member of the family , who was staying in the inner part of the house ; and the poor wretch began at once to rage with his teeth , and to lacerate whomsoever he met . The house was thrown into disorder ; the family was in confusion ; and the people present took to flight . Martin threw himself in the way of the frenzied creature , and first of all commanded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his teeth , and , with gaping mouth , was threatening to bite , Martin inserted his fingers into his mouth , and said , " If you possess any power , devour these . " But then , as if red-hot iron had entered his jaws , drawing his teeth far away he took care not to touch the fingers of the saintly man ; and when he was compelled by punishments and tortures , to flee out of the possessed body , while he had no power of escaping by the mouth , he was cast out by means of a defluxion of the belly , leaving disgusting traces behind him . <h> Martin performs Various Miracles . <p> IN the meanwhile , as a sudden report had troubled the city as to the movement and inroad of the barbarians , Martin orders a possessed person to be set before him , and commanded him to declare whether this message was true or not . Then he confessed that there were sixteen demons who had spread this report among the people , in order that by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , but that , in fact , nothing was less in the minds of the barbarians than to make any inroad . When the unclean spirit thus acknowledged these things in the midst of the church , the city was set free from the fear and tumult which had at the time been felt . <p> At Paris , again , when Martin was entering the gate of the city , with large crowds attending him , he gave a kiss to a leper , of miserable appearance , while all shuddered at seeing him do so ; and Martin blessed him , with the result that he was instantly cleansed from all his misery . On the following day , the man appearing in the church with a healthy skin , gave thanks for the soundness of body which he had recovered . This fact , too , ought not to be passed over in silence , that threads from Martin 's garment , or such as had been plucked from the sackcloth which he wore , wrought frequent miracles upon those who were sick . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the neck , they very often drove away diseases from the afflicted . <h> A Letter of Martin effects a Cure , with Other Miracles . <p> FURTHER , Arborius , an ex-prefect , and a man of a very holy and faithful character , while his daughter was in agony from the burning fever of a quartan ague , inserted in the bosom of the girl , at the very paroxysm of the heat , a letter of Martin which happened to have been brought to him , and immediately the fever was dispelled . This event had such an influence upon Arborius , that he at once consecrated the girl to God , and devoted her to perpetual virginity . Then , proceeding to Martin , he presented the girl to him , as an obvious living example of his power of working miracles , inasmuch as she had been cured by him though absent ; and he would not suffer her to be consecrated by any other than Martin , through his placing upon her the dress characteristic of virginity . <p> Paulinus , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the age , having begun to suffer grievously in one of his eyes , and when a pretty thick skin33 having grown over it had already covered up its pupil , Martin touched his eye with a painter 's brush , and , all pain being removed , thus restored it to its former soundness . He himself also , when , by a certain accident , he had fallen out of an upper room , and tumbling down a broken , uneven stair , had received many wounds , as he lay in his cell at the point of death , and was tortured with grievous sufferings , saw in the night an angel appear to him , who washed his wounds , and applied healing ointment to the bruised members of his body . As the effect of this , he found himself on the morrow restored to soundness of health , so that he was not thought to have suffered any harm . But because it would be tedious to go through everything of this kind , let these examples suffice , as a few out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not in striking cases of miraculous interposition detract from the truth , while , having so many to choose from , we avoid exciting weariness in the reader . <h> How Martin acted towards the Emperor Maximus . <p> AND here to insert some smaller matters among things so great ( although such is the nature of our times in which all things have fallen into decay and corruption , it is almost a pre-eminent virtue for priestly firmness not to have yielded to royal flattery ) , when a number of bishops from various parts had assembled to the Emperor Maximus , a man of fierce character , and at that time elated with the victory he had won in the civil wars , and when the disgraceful flattery of all around the emperor was generally remarked , while the priestly dignity had , with degenerate submissiveness , taken a second place to the royal retinue , in Martin alone , apostolic authority continued to assert itself . For even if he had to make suit to the sovereign for some things , he commanded rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from his entertainments , saying that he could not take a place at the table of one who , out of two emperors , had deprived one of his kingdom , and the other of his life . At last , when Maximus maintained that he had not of his own accord assumed the sovereignty , but that he had simply defended by arms the necessary requirements34 of the empire , regard to which had been imposed upon him by the soldiers , according to the Divine appointment , and that the favor of God did not seem wanting to him who , by an event seemingly so incredible , had secured the victory , adding to that the statement that none of his adversaries had been slain except in the open field of battle , at length , Martin , overcome either by his reasoning or his entreaties , came to the royal banquet . The king was wonderfully pleased because he had gained this point . Moreover , there were guests present who had been invited as if to a festival ; men of the highest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consul , named Evodius , one of the most righteous men that ever lived ; two courtiers possessed of the greatest power , the brother and uncle of the king , while between these two , the presbyter of Martin had taken his place ; but he himself occupied a seat which was set quite close to the king . About the middle of the banquet , according to custom , one of the servants presented a goblet to the king . He orders it rather to be given to the very holy bishop , expecting and hoping that he should then receive the cup from his right hand . But Martin , when he had drunk , handed the goblet to his own presbyter , as thinking no one worthier to drink next to himself , and holding that it would , not be right for him to prefer either the king himself , or those who were next the king , to the presbyter . And the emperor , as well as all those who were then present , admired this conduct so much , that this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them pleasure . The report then ran through the whole palace that Martin had done , at the king 's dinner , what no bishop had dared to do at the banquets of the lowest judges . And Martin predicted to the same Maximus long before , that if he went into Italy to which he then desired to go , waging war , against the Emperor Valentinianus , it would come to pass that he should know he would35 indeed be victorious in the first attack , but would perish a short time afterwards . And we have seen that this did in fact take place . For , on his first arrival Valentinianus had to betake himself to flight but recovering his strength about a year afterwards , Maximus was taken and slain by him within the walls of Aquileia . <h> Martin has to do both with Angels and Devils . <p> IT is also well known that angels were very often seen by him , so that they spoke in turns with him in set speech . As to the devil , Martin held him so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that whether he kept himself in his proper form , or changed himself into different shapes of spiritual wickedness , he was perceived by Martin , under whatever guise he appeared . The devil knew well that he could not escape discovery , and therefore frequently heaped insults upon Martin , being unable to beguile him by trickery . On one occasion the devil , holding in his hand the bloody horn of an ox , rushed into Martin 's cell with great noise , and holding out to him his bloody right hand , while at the same time he exulted in the crime he had committed , said : " Where , O Martin , is thy power ? I have just slain one of your people . " Then Martin assembled the brethren , and related to them what the devil had disclosed , while he ordered them carefully to search the several cells in order to discover who had been visited with this calamity . They report that no one of the monks was missing , but that one peasant , hired by them , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon . Upon hearing this , Martin instructs some of them to go and meet him . On their doing so , the man was found almost dead at no great distance from the monastery . Nevertheless , although just drawing his last breath , he made known to the brethren the cause of his wound and death . He said that , while he was drawing tighter the thongs which had got loose on the oxen yoked together , one of the oxen , throwing his head free , had wounded him with his horn in the groin . And not long after the man expired . You36 see with what judgment of the Lord this power was given to the devil . This was a marvelous feature in Martin that not only on this occasion to which I have specially referred , but on many occasions of the same kind , in fact as often as such things occurred , he perceived them long beforehand , and37 disclosed the things which had been revealed to him to the brethren . <h> Martin preaches Repentance even to the Devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impose upon the holy man by a thousand injurious arts , often thrust himself upon him in a visible form , but in very various shapes . For sometimes he presented himself to his view changed into the person of Jupiter , often into that of Mercury and Minerva . Often , too , were heard words of reproach , in which the crowd of demons assailed Martin with scurrilous expressions . But knowing that all were false and groundless , he was not affected by the charges brought against him . Moreover , some of the brethren bore witness that they had heard a demon reproaching Martin in abusive terms , and asking why he had taken back , on their subsequent repentance , certain of the brethren who had , some time previously , lost their baptism by falling into various errors . The demon set forth the crimes of each of them ; but they added that Martin , resisting the devil firmly , answered him , that by-past sins are cleansed away by the leading of a better life , and that through the mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins who have given up their evil ways . The devil saying in opposition to this that such guilty men as those referred to did not come within the pale of pardon , and that no mercy was extended by the Lord to those who had once fallen away , Martin is said to have cried out in words to the following effect : " If thou , thyself , wretched being , wouldst but desist from attacking mankind , and even , at this period , when the day of judgment is at hand , wouldst only repent of your deeds , I , with a true confidence in the Lord , would promise you the mercy of Christ . " 38 O what a holy boldness with respect to the loving-kindness of the Lord , in which , although he could not assert authority , he nevertheless showed the feelings dwelling within him ! And since our discourse has here sprung up concerning the devil and his devices , it does not seem away from the point , although the matter does not bear immediately upon Martin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Martin do , to some extent , appear in the transaction , and the incident , which was worthy of a miracle , will properly be put on record , with the view of furnishing a caution , should anything of a similar character subsequently occur . <h> A Case of Diabolic Deception . <p> THERE was a certain man , Clarus by name , a most noble youth , who afterwards became a presbyter , and who is now , through his happy departure from this world , numbered among the saints . He , leaving all others , betook himself to Martin , and in a short time became distinguished for the most exalted faith , and for all sorts of excellence . Now , it came to pass that , when he had erected an abode for himself not far from the monastery of the bishop , and many brethren were staying with him , a certain youth , Anatolius by name , having , under the profession of a monk , falsely assumed every appearance of humility and innocence , came to him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest . Then , as time went on , he began to affirm that angels were in the habit of talking with him . As no one gave any credit to his words , he urged a number of the brethren to believe by certain signs . At length he went to such a length as to declare that angels passed between him and God ; and now he wished that he should be regarded as one of the prophets . Clarus , however , could by no means be induced to believe . He then began to threaten Clarus with the anger of God and present afflictions , because he did not believe one of the saints . At the last , he is related to have burst forth with the following declaration : " Behold , the Lord will this night give me a white robe out of heaven , clothed in which , I will dwell in the midst of you ; and that will be to you a sign that I am the Power of God , inasmuch as I have been presented with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all was highly raised by this profession . Accordingly , about the middle of the night , it was seen , by the noise of people moving eagerly about , that the whole monastery in the place was excited . It might be seen , too , that the cell in which the young man referred to lived was glittering with numerous lights ; and the whisperings of those moving about in it , as well as a kind of murmur of many . voices , could be heard . Then , on silence being secured , the youth coming forth calls one of the brethren , Sabatius by name , to himself , and shows him the robe in which he had been clothed . He again , filled with amazement , gathers the rest together , and Clarus himself also runs up ; and a light being obtained , they all carefully inspect the garment . Now , it was of the utmost softness , of marvelous brightness , and of glittering purple , and yet no one could discover what was its nature , or of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was more minutely examined by the eyes or fingers , it seemed nothing else than a garment . In the meantime , Clarus urges upon the brethren to be earnest in prayer , that the Lord would show them more clearly what it really was . Accordingly , the rest of the night was spent in singing hymns and psalms . But when day broke , Clarus wished to take the young man by the hand , and bring him to Martin , being well aware that he could not be deceived by any arts of the devil . Then , indeed , the miserable man began to resist and refuse , and affirmed that he had been forbidden to show himself to Martin . And when they compelled him to go against his will , the garment vanished from among the hands of those who were conducting him . Wherefore , who can doubt that this , too , was an illustration of the power of Martin , so that the devil could no longer dissemble or conceal his own deception , when it was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted by the Wiles of the Devil . <p> IT was found , again , that about the same time there was a young man in Spain , who , having by many signs obtained for himself authority among the people , was puffed up to such a pitch that he gave himself out as being Elias . And when multitudes had too readily believed this , he went on to say that he was actually Christ ; and he succeeded so well even in this delusion that a certain bishop named Rufus worshiped him as being the Lord . For so doing , we have seen this bishop at a later date deprived of his office . Many of the brethren have also informed me that at the same time one arose in the East , who boasted that he was John . We may infer from this , since false prophets of such a kind have appeared , that the coming of Antichrist is at hand ; for he is already practicing in these persons the mystery of iniquity . And truly I think this point should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this very time tempted Martin . For , on a certain day , prayer39 having been previously offered , and the fiend himself being surrounded by a purple light , in order that he might the more easily deceive people by the brilliance of the splendor assumed , clothed also in a royal robe , and with a crown of precious stones and gold encircling his head , his shoes too being inlaid with gold , while he presented a tranquil countenance , and a generally rejoicing aspect , so that no such thought as that he was the devil might be entertained--he stood by the side of Martin as he was praying in his cell . The saint being dazzled by his first appearance , both preserved a long and deep silence . This was first broken by the devil , who said : " Acknowledge , Martin , who it is that you behold . I am Christ ; and being just about to descend to earth , I wished first to manifest myself to thee . " When Martin kept silence on hearing these words , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his audacious declaration : " Martin , why do you hesitate to believe , when you see ? I am Christ . " Then Martin , the Spirit revealing the truth to him , that he might understand it was the devil , and not God , replied as follows : " The Lord Jesus did not predict that he would come clothed in purple , and with a glittering crown upon his head . I will not believe that Christ has come , unless he appears with that appearance and form in which he suffered , and openly displaying the marks of his wounds upon the cross . " On hearing these words , the devil vanished like smoke , and filled the cell with such a disgusting smell , that he left unmistakable evidences of his real character . This event , as I have just related , took place in the way which I have stated , and my information regarding it was derived from the lips of Martin himself ; therefore let no one regard it as fabulous. 40 <h> Intercourse of Sulpitius with Martin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his faith , life and virtues , burned with a desire of knowing him , I undertook what was to me a pleasant journey for the purpose of seeing him . At the same time , because already my mind was inflamed with the desire of writing his life , I obtained my information partly from himself , in so far as I could venture to question him , and partly from those who had lived with him , or well knew the facts of the case . And at this time it is scarcely credible with what humility and with what kindness he received me ; while he cordially wished me joy , and rejoiced in the Lord that he had been held in such high estimation by me that I had undertaken a journey owing to my desire of seeing him . Unworthy me ! ( in fact , I hardly dare acknowledge it ) , that he should have deigned to admit me to fellowship with him ! He went so far as in person to present me with water to wash my hands , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient courage to resist or oppose his doing so . In fact , I felt so overcome by the authority he unconsciously exerted , that I deemed it unlawful to do anything but acquiesce in his arrangements . His conversation with me was all directed to such points as the following : that the allurements of this world and secular burdens were to be abandoned in order that we might be free and unencumbered in following the Lord Jesus ; and he pressed upon me as an admirable example in present circumstances the conduct of that distinguished man Paulinus , of whom I have made mention above . Martin declared of him that , by parting with his great possessions and following Christ , as he did , he showed himself almost the only one who in these times had fully obeyed the precepts of the Gospel . He insisted strongly that that was the man who should be made the object of our imitation , adding that the present age was fortunate in possessing such a model of faith and virtue . For Paulinus , being rich and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the poor according to the expressed will of the Lord , had , he said , made possible by actual proof what appeared impossible of accomplishment . What power and dignity there were in Martin 's words and conversation ! How active he was , how practical , and how prompt and ready in solving questions connected with Scripture ! And because I know that many are incredulous on this point , --for indeed I have met with persons who did not believe me when I related such things , --I call to witness Jesus , and our common hope as Christians , that I never heard from any other lips than those of Martin such exhibitions of knowledge and genius , or such specimens of good and pure speech . But yet , how insignificant is all such praise when compared with the virtues which he possessed ! Still , it is remarkable that in a man who had no claim to be called learned , even this attribute of high intelligence was not wanting . <h> Words can not describe the Excellences of Martin . <p> BUT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my discourse finished . This is not because all that was worthy of being said concerning Martin is now exhausted , but because I , just as sluggish poets grow less careful towards the end of their work , give over , being baffled by the immensity of the matter . For , although his outward deeds could in some sort of way be set forth in words , no language , I truly own , can ever be capable of describing his inner life and daily conduct , and his mind always bent upon the things of heaven . No one can adequately make known his perseverance and self-mastery in abstinence and fastings , or his power in watchings and prayers , along with the nights , as well as days , which were spent by him , while not a moment was separated from the service of God , either for indulging in ease , or engaging in business . But , in fact , he did not indulge either in food or sleep , except in so far as the necessities of nature required . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Homer himself were to ascend from the shades below , he could not do justice to this subject in words ; to such an extent did all excellences surpass in Martin the possibility of being embodied in language . Never did a single hour or moment pass in which he was not either actually engaged in prayer ; or , if it happened that he was occupied with something else , still he never let his mind loose from prayer . In truth , just as it is the custom of blacksmiths , in the midst of their work to beat their own anvil as a sort of relief to the laborer , so Martin even when he appeared to be doing something else , was still engaged in prayer . O truly blessed man in whom there was no guile--judging no man , condemning no man , returning evil for evil to no man !

Never was there any word on his lips but Christ , and never was there a feeling in his heart except piety , peace , and tender mercy . Frequently , too , he used to weep for the sins of those who showed themselves his revilers--those who , as he led his retired and tranquil life , slandered him with poisoned tongue and a viper 's mouth . And truly we have had experience of some who were envious of his virtues and his life--who really hated in him what they did not see in themselves , and what they had not power to imitate . And--O wickedness worthy of deepest grief and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of his maligners , I say , were reported to be no others than bishops ! Here , however , it is not necessary to name any one , although a good many of these people are still venting42 their spleen against myself . I shall deem it sufficient that , if any one of them reads this account , and perceives that he is himself pointed at , he may have the grace to blush . But if , on the other hand , he shows anger , he will , by that very fact , own that he is among those spoken of , though all the time perhaps I have been thinking of some other person . I shall , however , by no means feel ashamed if any people of that sort include myself in their hatred along with such a man as Martin . I am quite persuaded of this , that the present little work will give pleasure to all truly good men .

Coupling is useful because it reveals how many hydrogens are on the next carbon in the structure .

The peak at 1 ppm is the methyl group with an integral of 3H . <p> The peak is split into three smaller ones , evenly spaced , with a taller one in the middle and shorter ones on the outside . <p> This pattern is called a triplet .

@@71697900 @397900/ <h> Program Goal I : Subject Matter <p> According to Zumwalt ( 1989 ) , Passe ( 1999 ) and others , subject-matter , or curricular knowledge , has often been given a role of lesser importance in the knowledge base for beginning teachers than that assigned to pedagogical knowledge . Perhaps a major reason for the traditionally low status of subject knowledge is the fact that teachers have often taught a prescribed curriculum over which they had little control . This changed to some extent in the 1990s as the trend toward decentralization of educational decision-making gave teachers expanded roles in curricular planning ( Passe , 1999 ) . Currently , however , with the " standards " movement of the Twenty-First Century , content is again more centrally controlled and prescribed . Growing emphasis on preparing students to passing state-mandated tests to assure school and district " annual yearly progress " further limits teachers ' opportunities to determine how and what they might teach . Still , even in situations where the overall curriculum is based on specific sets of standards , it is often the teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet those standards ( Scherer , 2001 , p. 17 ) . Therefore , it remains vitally important for teachers to have in-depth knowledge of the disciplines they teach , including not only factual knowledge , but also organizing principles , central concepts , and the " ways in which new knowledge is brought into the field " ( Grossman , Wilson , and Shulman , 1989 , p. 29 ) . <p> Our summary of subject-matter ( curricular knowledge ) begins by describing approaches that seek to structure ( or organize ) knowledge . Summaries of subject-matter based on the Minnesota Academic Standards and selected national standards are then presented , followed by information about approaches to interdisciplinary instruction . Though this chapter of the knowledge base focuses only on instructional content , it is important to note that content and pedagogy are strongly connected . As Passe ( 1999 ) wrote , what is taught ( content or subject matter ) has an important influence on decisions regarding instruction . However , since approaches to instruction are described elsewhere within the knowledge base , that information will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to effectively communicate subject matter , teachers must understand how knowledge is structured or organized in the disciplines they teach . A simple but useful approach to structuring knowledge described by Kindsvatter , Wilen , and Ishler ( 1997 ) places knowledge into a pyramid consisting of facts ( verifiable , specific information about people , events , or objects ) at the lowest level , followed by concepts ( ideas or abstractions based on grouping or categorizing facts ) at the next level , and generalizations ( broad statements or organizing principles that integrate multiple concepts ) at the top . A similar , though more elaborate , approach is described by Gagne ( 1965 ) . This approach divides knowledge into five categories based on the intellectual skills necessary for learning that knowledge . These levels include simple types of learning ( signal learning and responses learned through conditioning ) , discriminations ( differentiations between similar stimuli ) , concepts ( categories or ideas that reflect the commonalities of related objects or events ) , rules ( combining concepts into predictable patterns ) , and higher order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A third approach to the structure of knowledge , though developed by Benjamin Bloom ( 1956 ) more than 50 years ago , is still widely used in instructional planning . Commonly referred to as Bloom 's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives , this system divides the cognitive domain into the following six levels : knowledge ( factual information ) , comprehension ( understanding or attributing meaning to factual information ) , application ( using that which is known and comprehended ) , analysis ( breaking down a task or information into its component parts ) , synthesis ( combining separate elements to form a whole and achieve understanding ) , and evaluation ( using criteria to judge the quality or value of objects , events , or ideas ) . Taxonomies for the affective and psychophysical domains , though available , are not as widely accepted and , therefore , are not included in this brief summary.Anderson and Krathwohl ( 2001 ) offer modified versions of taxonomies for all three domains . Their taxonomy of the cognitive domain changes nouns to verbs ( for instance analysis to analyzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comprehension , places creating , their term for synthesizing , at the highest level of the taxonomy , and moves evaluating down to the second-highest level . <p> Minnesota and National Academic Standards : As noted in the first paragraph of this document , teachers do have choices regarding the content they teach . However , these choices are often limited by local , state , and national standards . The Minnesota Academic Standards define a core of five academic content area standards : language arts , mathematics , science , social studies and the arts . Standards for Mathematics , Language Arts , and Arts were adopted in a 2003 while the Minnesota Legislature stipulated science and social studies standards in 2004 . Recently revised social studies standards were approval by the state 's Commissioner of Education in the summer of 2011 . Each set of state academic standards will be supplemented by grade-level benchmarks specifying the academic knowledge and skills that students must achieve to affirm attainment of a standard . <p> In addition to the core academic standards areas , there are several elective subject areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer elective courses covering health and physical education , vocational and technical education , and world languages . The law requires students to complete a specified number of course credits covering both core and elective subject areas in order to receive a high school diploma ( Minnesota Legislative Reference Library , 2003 ) . The Minnesota Academic Standards as well as selected national standards , organized by subject , are summarized below . <p> Arts : The Minnesota Academic Standards in the Arts were revised in 2008 and " set the expectations for achievement in the arts for K-12 students in Minnesota " ( Minnesota Academic Standards in the Arts , 2011 ) . They are organized into four strands : Artistic Foundations ; Artistic Processes : Create or Make ; Artistic Processes : Perform and Present ; and Artistic Processes : Respond and Critique . " Each strand has one or more standards that can be implemented in the arts areas of dance , media arts , music , theater and/or visual arts " ( Minnesota Academic Standards in the Arts ( 2011 ) . <p> The National Standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 ) provide integrated standards for dance , music , theater , and the visual arts . The standards emphasize the importance of the arts to life and learning ; incorporate cultural diversity ; and stress a comprehensive , hands-on , interdisciplinary orientation . Though specific standards are provided for each discipline at the primary , middle , and high school levels , the standards all emphasize the following knowledge and skills : basic communication in the four arts disciplines , proficient communication in at least one art form , the ability to develop and present basic analyses of works of art , acquaintance with exemplary works of art from a variety of cultures and historical periods , and the ability to relate various types of arts knowledge and skills within and across the arts disciplines . The overall goal of the standards is to develop capabilities that allow students to " arrive at their own knowledge , beliefs , and values for making personal artistic decisions " ( Music Educators National Conference , 1994 ) . <p> English Language Arts : English Language Arts : The Department 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English Language Arts ( NCTE/IRA , 1996 ) , a joint project of the National Council of Teachers of English ( NCTE ) , and the International Reading Association ( IRA ) . Extending and adding specificity to these broad standards , candidates are guided by the Minnesota requirements for teacher licensure , the 2010 Minnesota K-12 Academic Standards - English Language Arts , and the Minnesota adoption of the Common Core State Standards in the English language arts . Minnesota 's adoption of the Common Core National Standards in 2011 , modified to include greater emphasis on media arts , provides a third guiding document to shape the preparation of those seeking to be licensed as teachers of language arts and literature ( http : //www.corestandards.org/ ) . <p> Collectively , these documents outline the knowledge , skills , and abilities pre-service teachers must possess to effectively teach English Language Arts and the knowledge , skills , and abilities that K-12 students must demonstrate prior to graduation .

In this context the English Language Arts encourage teachers to support the college and career readiness of their students . As noted in the Minnesota standards document , the K-12 English Language Arts Standards suggest that readiness will be found in students who demonstrate independence , possess strong content knowledge , understand how to reach various audiences , comprehend and critique , use technology , and understand multiple perspectives . <p> We have integrated the aforementioned standards documents to focus our candidates ' preparation in the following areas of special emphasis . <p> Reading : Text complexity and the growth of comprehension . The reading standards place equal emphasis on the sophistication of what students read and the skill with which they read . Included is a grade-by-grade " staircase " of increasing text complexity that rises from beginning reading to the college and career readiness level . The standards require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary texts and informational non-fiction texts . Whatever they are reading , students must also show a steadily growing ability to discern more from and make fuller use of text , including making connections among ideas and between texts , considering a wider range of textual evidence , and becoming more sensitive to inconsistencies and ambiguities in texts . As such , future teachers in all grade levels and in all subject disciplines should have extensive coursework and practical experience in the teaching of reading . This includes instruction for all teaching candidates in the foundations of reading , including phonemic awareness , phonics , fluency , vocabulary , and scaffolded comprehension . Additionally , candidates in elementary and secondary English Language Arts ( ELA ) should participate in clinical experiences that are focused on assessing , diagnosing , and planning instruction to meet the literacy development needs of all students . <p> Writing : Text types , responding to reading , and research . The standards acknowledge the fact that whereas some writing skills , such as the ability to plan , revise , edit , and publish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more properly defined in terms of specific writing types : arguments , informative/explanatory texts , and narratives . The writing strand stresses the importance of the writing-reading connection by requiring students to draw upon and write about evidence from literary and informational texts . Because of the centrality of writing to most forms of inquiry , research standards are prominently included in this strand , though skills important to research are infused throughout the document . As such , teaching candidates in ELA should have a working knowledge of the writing process , workshop approaches to writing instruction , as well as teaching strategies which are specific to the variety of writing genres . Candidates in ELA must be prepared for the demands of differentiated writing assessment , as well as the varying philosophical approaches regarding response to student writing including writer 's workshop and Six Traits approaches . <p> Speaking and Listening : Flexible communication and collaboration . Including but not limited to skills necessary for formal presentations , the Speaking and Listening standards require students to develop a range of broadly useful oral communication and interpersonal skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen carefully to ideas , integrate information from oral , visual , quantitative , and media sources , evaluate what they hear , use media and visual displays strategically to help achieve communicative purposes , and adapt speech to context and task . Candidates must have knowledge of the methods for supporting students ' development in these key areas , including the steps needed for creating effective formal and informal speeches , as well as skills needed for diverse types of listening tasks . In Minnesota , this strand is known as " Speaking , Viewing , Listening , and Media Literacy . " <p> Media Literacy : Critical analysis and media production . Students in the twenty-first century must become competent consumers and producers of media . Thus , the standards in media literacy articulate two primary outcomes . First , students must have the skills to critically analyze information found in electronic , print , and mass media for the sake of using these types of sources . Second , students must be able to communicate using traditional or digital multimedia formats , digital writing and publishing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to teach media literacy including the multiple purposes of media communication , and the effects of various types of media on the communication process . <p> Language : Conventions , effective use , and vocabulary . The language standards include the essential " rules " of standard written and spoken English , but they also approach language as a matter of craft and informed choice among alternatives . The vocabulary standards focus on understanding words and phrases , their relationships , and their nuances and on acquiring new vocabulary , particularly general academic and domain-specific words and phrases . Candidates must have a clear knowledge regarding the functions of language , how language conventions influence the perception of effective written and oral communication , and how to support students ' development of such linguistic awareness . <p> Social Studies : The social studies comprise a broad curriculum formed from eight disciplines including anthropology , archaeology , economics , geography , history , political science , psychology , and sociology . In 2010 , the National Council for the Social Studies ( NCSS ) identified the following ten themes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Teaching , Learning , and Assessment . <p> These standards are organized to incorporate learning experiences from many disciplines because , by their very nature , the social studies require multidisciplinary education . Teachers of history and social studies receive additional content-area guidance from voluntary national standards in economics ( Council for Economic Education , 2010 ) , geography ( Geography Education Standards Project , 1994 ) , civics ( Center for Civic Education , 1994 ) , history ( National Center for History in the Schools , 1996 ) , and psychology ( American Psychological Association , 2005 ) . <p> Math : The Minnesota K-12 Academic Standardsin Mathematics set the expectations for achievement in mathematics for K-12 students . The standards are grounded in the belief that all students can and should be mathematically proficient , and all students should learn and understand important mathematical concepts , skills , and relationships .

The new standards " describe a connected body of knowledge of mathematical understandings and competencies - a comprehensive foundation for all students , rather than a menu from which to make curricular choices " ( NCTM , 2000 , p. 29 ) . Following the Principles , the Standards for school mathematics describe a set of goals for mathematics instruction . The first five Standards present goals in the mathematical content areas of number and operations , algebra , geometry , measurement , and data analysis and probability .

Every Minnesota school district is required to adopt the National Standards for Physical Education , and students need to satisfactorily complete these new standards beginning in the 2012-13 school year . " Additionally , every school district must have locally developed standards in health education . The requirement for locally developed health education standards has been in place since the 2005-06 school year . There are National Health Education Standards , which are not an official state model , to use as a resource to do this " ( Minnesota Department of Education , 2011 ) . <p> Reading : As noted , Minnesota 's standards for reading are currently included within the 2010 English Language Arts Standards ( Minnesota Department of Education , 2011 ) .

They are divided into three levels ( K-4 , 5-8 , and 9-12 ) and eight categories : Unifying Concepts and Processes , Science as Inquiry , Physical Science , Life Science , Earth and Space Science , Science and Technology , Science in Social and Personal Perspectives , and History and Nature of Science ( National Academy of Sciences , 1996 ) . As Passe ( 1999 ) noted , these standards attempt to change the emphasis in science education from knowing scientific facts to understanding scientific concepts . Other emphases include integrating science content ; learning fewer , fundamental science concepts ; teaching through inquiry ; and analyzing science questions . <p> According to theMinnesota Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , its structures and its processes .

Scientifically literate young people can understand phenomena , solve problems and produce new technologies for the world today . " <p> The K-12 Academic Standards for Science were updated in 2009 and approved for adoption in 2010 . As in the document published before it in 2003 , the Minnesota Academic Standards in Science are organized by grade level into four content strands : 1 ) The Nature of Science and Engineering , 2 ) Physical Science , 3 ) Earth and Space Science , and 4 ) Life Science . The first content strand is intended to run throughout the other three strands . In addition , the new version addressed legislated issues including college and work readiness , technology and information literacy , contributions made to academics by the Minnesota American Indian tribes and communities , and environmental literacy LONG ... <p> As noted above , the Minnesota Department of Education also addressed literacy for science in Minnesota 's newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards , which set K-12 requirements not only for ELA but also for literacy in history/social studies , science and technical subjects . <p> The Common Core Officers ( CCSSO ) . The standards were developed in collaboration with teachers , school administrators , and experts to provide a clear and consistent framework to prepare our children for college and the workforce " ( Common Core State Standards Initiative , 2011 ) . As of August 8 , 2011 , 46 states had adopted the Common Core State Standards for English/language arts and mathematics . Although Minnesota is not among the states listed on the initiative 's web site , Minnesota has adopted the Common Core Standards for the English language arts . However , at this time , Minnesota is not adopting the Common Core State Standards for mathematics . The Minnesota Commissioner of Education revises the academic standards according to a timetable specified in state law ( Minn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards were revised in 2007 and are not scheduled to be revised again until 2015 . Since the commissioner does not have authority to revise mathematics standards until that time , legislative action would be needed for the state to adopt the Common Core State Standards for mathematics . The Minnesota Department of Education will continue to analyze the Common Core State Standards and Minnesota Mathematics Standards in order to provide information to the state legislature <p> The Integrated Curriculum : As noted above , the national standards in some academic areas ( particularly the arts and social studies ) are purposefully interdisciplinary . This current emphasis on interdisciplinary instruction is consistent with our departmental preference for integrated learning and reflects the belief of subject-area leaders " that no subject is sufficient by itself ; ( rather ) each is a part of the whole " ( Passe , 1999 , p. 222 ) . Often called thematic teaching or integrated curriculum , Richard Kellough ( 1997 ) defines this approach as " both a way of teaching and a way of planning and organizing the instructional program so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a design that ( 1 ) matches the developmental needs of the learners , and ( 2 ) helps to connect their learning in ways that are meaningful to their current and past experiences " ( p. 251 ) . Passe ( 1999 ) listed benefits of the integrated curriculum including providing an opportunity to expand instruction for " de-emphasized " subjects such as art and physical education , diminishing the overemphasis on textbooks , and increasing opportunities for the integration of problem solving and the application of subjects to everyday life . Drawbacks of thematic teaching listed by Passe include a lack of appropriate teacher preparation for using this approach , incompatible classroom organization , and the possibility of resistance from those who favor a more traditional curriculum . <p> <p> As we conclude this section on subject-matter knowledge , the findings of Grossman , Wilson , and Schulman ( 1989 ) seem quite pertinent . Recounting their explorations into the practice of novice secondary teachers , these writers found that beginning teachers experience the subject matter they share with their students in at least three ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a body of knowledge might be brought to light by facts and concepts that form the " content " of introductory study . Further work at an intermediate level could suggest explanatory frameworks used to organize their growing collection of facts and concepts into a " substantive " family of related principles or generalizations . Those prospective teachers who persist in their study of a discipline through completion of advanced coursework may acquire " syntactic " knowledge of a discipline 's epistemology revealing how its content and explanatory frameworks are discovered and validated . <p> In addition to these three levels of knowledge about what they would teach , Grossman and her colleagues found that prospective teachers ' " beliefs " about subject matter can influence how they share that knowledge with their students ( p. 31 ) . They urged teacher educators to work with their disciplinary colleagues to " provide opportunities for prospective teachers to identify and examine the beliefs they have about the content they teach " ( p.32 ) . Those who prepare teachers might thereby counter unintended perspectives on a body of knowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their students . Such beliefs appear more salient in the absence of opportunities to explore the " substantive " and " syntactic " knowledge forming a discipline . Those who teach outside of their discipline or college major appear to be at greater risk of drawing upon their own inaccurate representations of a field of study as they share it with their students . <p> References : <p> American Psychological Association .

@@71697902 @397902/ <p> Background Information : Osmotic potential ( ? s ) represents the effect of solutes on the energy state of water . Osmotic potential is related to other properties of the solution such as vapor pressure , boiling point , and freezing point . These properties , which are interrelated , are termed colligative properties , and are dependent on the mole fraction of solute . Since these properties are inter-related , one can be measured and used to calculate the others . <p> The freezing point of pure water is 0 C but the freezing point of aqueous solutions containing non-volatile dissolved solutes is less than zero . Thus , the addition of solutes depresses the freezing point of water . The extent to which the freezing point is depressed below O C is proportional to the concentration of dissolved solute particles ; a 1 molal solution of an ideal non-ionized solute has an osmotic potential of -2.27 MPa and freezes at -1.86 C. Based on this relationship the osmotic potential of any unknown solution can be calculated : <p> -2.27 MPa / -1.86 C = ? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MPa deg-1 ) ? f <p> where <p> ? f is the freezing point of the solution in oC . <p> Since this equation is for solutions at zero oC ( 273 K ) we must correct the equation to yield our answer at room temperature by multiplying the equation by the ratio of the absolute temperatures ( room temperature in K/273 K ) . Thus : <p> eqn . 1 : ? s = ( 1.22 MPa deg-1 ) ? f x ( room temp in K/273 K ) <p> Freezing point depression is generally determined on tissue sap . Sap samples are prepared by freezing the tissue to rupture cells and then squeezing the frozen material by hand through cheesecloth or with a hydraulic press . Alternately , the tissue can be homogenized ( without water ) in a blender or with a mortar and pestle . <p> In practice , the temperature of a sap sample is monitored with a thermocouple or sensitive thermometer as it is cooled . Data from a typical freezing point depression experiment is given below ( Figure 1 ) . Point A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line from A to B represents a very rapid freezing of the water in the solution after super-cooling . The increase is due to the release of the heat of fusion . Therefore , Point B is an estimate of the freezing point depression and is called the apparent freezing point ( ? f ' ) . The true freezing point ( ? f ) is obtained after correcting for super-cooling according to the following equation ( Reiss , 1996 ) : <p> One disadvantage of this method is that the solute composition of the sap influences the accuracy of the measurement . The equation above is given for ideal solutions of glucose or mannitol . Sucrose , on the other hand has a freezing point depression of 2.06oC , not 1.86oC . Nevertheless , the method still provides an estimate in reasonable agreement with those obtained by other methods . <p> Hypothesis : Bland and Tanner ( 1985 ) report that the osmotic potential for a potato tube is in the range of -0.58 to -1.53 MPa . Our tubers should fall within that range . <p> Protocol : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> First , we will calibrate the thermometer by placing 3 mL of water in the sample test tube . <p> Immerse this unit in a beaker ( 600 mL ) containing salt and ice . The ice bath should be between -5 and -10 oC . <p> Suspend a thermometer in the sample making sure that it does n't touch the bottom or sides of the tube . <p> Stir the sample continuously and watch the decrease in temperature . When the temperature reaches 0oC , record the temperature every 10 seconds ( Table 1 ) . <p> Continue readings as the sap cools . Note the temperature closely . Periodically tap the thermometer gently to induce freezing . When freezing occurs there will be a rapid increase in temperature . Note this temperature which is the apparent freezing point ( ? f ' ) and continue to record temperatures until they become fairly constant . In some cases , the sample may freeze without releasing a detectable heat of fusion . If this occurs , discard the sample and begin again . You can often determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cooling rate of the sap . The freezing point of the water should be zero . If the ? f ' of the water is not 0oC , then correct the ? f ' of the sap sample accordingly . <p> Repeat the experiment with a potato sap sample . To prepare the potato sap , obtain frozen potato sections and carefully remove the peel . Homogenize the thawed potato in a blender . Transfer the homogenate to a centrifuge tube and spin at the highest setting for five minutes to recover the supernatant. 
@@71697903 @397903/ <h> Program Goal X : Collaboration , Ethics , and Relationships <p> The Education Department recognizes that collaboration with others , both inside and outside of school , is essential for success in the teaching profession . Since children often come to school with such complex social , educational , and medical problems , no single person or agency can possibly meet all of their needs ( Welch and Sheridan 1995 ) . This necessitates cooperation and collaboration not only with other teachers , but also with parents and other professionals in the community . Areas in which teachers collaborate include establishing goals for learners , developing school curricula , coordinating instruction , interpreting state and local mandates , and implementing student services ( Wiseman , Cooner and Knight 1999 ) . <p> Collaborating with Other Professionals : Johnson , Pugach , and Devlin ( 1990 ) found collaboration between educators to be absolutely essential . The increasing ethnic and linguistic diversity as well as the large number of students with special needs make it necessary for educators to work together in order to meet the needs of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs often spill over to other students in the classroom , and the whole learning community benefits from the knowledge and expertise being shared . Collaboration among professionals also provides good role-modeling for the students who , when they enter the world of work , will be expected to work in teams and collaborate with others . <p> As noted by Stones ( 1994 ) , collaboration is of critical importance for fostering professional growth . When teachers actively share experiences and use professional colleagues as support for reflection and problem-solving , they are more likely to make good decisions . Not only does reflection through interactions with others lead to stronger decision-making , but Brookfield ( 1995 ) contends that it also leads to stronger communication skills as teachers become better able to justify and explain their actions in a confident and informed manner . <p> Collaborating with the Community : Clandinin and associates ( 1993 ) noted that collaboration between school professionals and those from their surrounding community assists community-building efforts , both inside and outside of school . The community as a whole has a strong impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward education . The ethnic , religious , cultural , and socio-economic diversity found in the community are important factors that are strongly linked to students ' success in school . Family background , health , and socio-economic status all impact students ' interest in and motivation for learning ( Hindle , 1993 ) . Since it is essential that educators understand their school 's community and their students ' backgrounds , parents are an invaluable resource because they know their child best Littky , et al ( 2004 ) . Activities and events in the community can serve as examples or starting points for discussions and classroom activities . Community events and issues that are important to students can be used to build curriculum and increase the relevance of instruction . An added benefit of collaboration with the community is that it encourages good public relations between education professionals and those outside the educational setting . Such collaboration also increases community understanding of and support for school . <p> One approach to achieving community collaboration is through the development of full-service community schools . As described by Joy Dryfoos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public school building and is open to all community members " before , during , and after school , seven days a week , all year long . It is jointly operated and financed through a partnership between the school system and one or more community agencies " ( p. 394 ) . In order to be successful , all members of the community , including young people , teachers , administrators , parents , community agencies , and business people must work together in making important decisions regarding the school and its programs . According to Dryfoos , these schools encourage students to provide community service and often employ a full-time community-school coordinator who works in conjunction with local agencies to provide a range of services needed within the community . This model is often effective , not only in improving collaboration , but also in such important areas as academic achievement , attendance , student behavior , and parental involvement ( Dryfoos , 2002 ) . <p> Promoting the Development of a Learning Community : As Richard DuFour ( 2004 ) noted , the concept of promoting school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , due to our department 's emphasis on the Benedictine values of concern for community and respect for all persons ( Klassen , Renner , and Reuter , 2001 ) , we have always emphasized the importance of developing a community of learning . We share Martin Haberman 's ( 2004 ) view that for a school to become a learning community , its members must " share a common vision that learning is the primary purpose for their association and the ultimate value to preserve in their workplace . . . " ( p. 52 ) . We are also in agreement with Haberman that modeling a love of learning is the surest way to promote enthusiasm for learning among students . <p> In describing the successful learning community at the Met High School in Rhode Island , Littky , et al ( 2004 ) stated that school staff must view themselves as participants in all aspects of the learning process and model good learning habits throughout their daily interactions . Other important attributes of learning communities include the continual sharing of ideas ; collaboration , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and research ; valuing a sense of community or camaraderie ; and egalitarianism ( Haberman , 2004 ) . Students and parents are important partners in the vision of a learning community described by Littky , et al ( 2004 ) . At the Met High School , students collaborate and support one another 's learning and view their peers as resources in their learning and success . Parents are asked to provide at least 10 hours of service to the school each year and are welcome to be in the school building at any time . Additionally , both students and parents participate in school decisions for creating policies , solving problems , and even in hiring . In other words , for a school to truly be a learning community there must be a culture of collaboration , not only among school staff , but among students and parents as well . <p> Collaboration and Federal Laws : Federal laws promote and in some cases require collaborative efforts in meeting the needs of students . The Individuals with Disability Education Act ( IDEA ) emphasizes the necessity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and implementing appropriate Individualized Education Plans ( IEPs ) for students with disabilities ( Villa , Thousand , Nevin and Malgeri , 1996 ) , and the No Child Left Behind act of 2002 requires every school district to develop processes for ensuring meaningful ways to engage and collaborate with parents ( Hoang , 2010 ) . <p> Legal Issues : Increasingly , the courts have become involved in and have an impact on what takes place in schools ( Farris , 1999 ) . This situation requires that teachers become aware of legal issues ranging from teaching contracts and tenure to issues involving students and their rights . McCarthy ( 1989 ) recommends that educators have knowledge about the following issues : Educational employment and termination , including conditions of employment and teacher termination ; teachers ' rights outside the classroom , including freedom of speech , political activities , and lifestyle choices ; academic freedom , including curriculum censorship , academic assessment , and grouping practices ; student discipline , including punishment , regulation of student expression , search and seizure ; teacher liability , including student injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being involved in litigation , McCarthy advises educators to always engage in actions that are fair , reasonable , and based on educational objectives . Educators should regularly review their actions , policies , and practices to verify that they are based on the educational mission of their school . Educators should also always keep in mind that in all of their actions inside and outside of school they are role-models for students and are held to higher standards than the general public .

Chemistry of action Although a variety of molecular structures have auxin activity ( i.e. , derivatives of indole , benzene and naphthalene ) , these molecules seem to share a few features that appear to be required for activity . Auxin activity seems to be correlated with a flat , hydrophobic ring system that separates negatively-charged ( acidic , carboxyl group ) side chain and positively charged region . There is a charge separation of about 0.5 nm . Note that the indole unit is n't required for activity , but a planar ring system is . <p> D. Conjugated forms Auxins , as do other hormones , occur in a free or conjugated ( bound to sugars , alcohols or other molecules ) form . In fact , up to 98% of the auxin may be bound . Auxins may be conjugated with inositol , coenzyme A or glucosides ( sugars ) . <p> E. Anti-auxins PCIB ( **25;1226;TOOLONG acid ) is a compound that competes with auxin for binding sites . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III . Biosynthesis <p> A. Site Auxin is made in actively growing tissue which includes young leaves , fruits , and especially the shoot apex . Made in cytosol of cells <p> B. Routes There are two major routes to the production of IAA . <p> Tryptophan-dependent Pathways . The similarity of chemical structure of IAA and tryptophan suggested a connection between these . Considerable research has shown that tryptophan , one of the protein amino acids , is a precursor of auxin biosynthesis . Overall , the conversion of tryptophan to IAA can occur by : ( 1 ) a transamination followed by a decarboxylation ; ( 2 ) a decarboxylation followed by a transamination ; or ( 3 ) formation of IAA via an oxime ( C=NOH ) and nitrile ( CN ) . <p> Tryptophan-independent Pathway - this route does n't involve tryptophan directly as an intermediate to the formation of auxin . <p> IV . Transport <p> A. Basipetal ( or Polar ) Transport Auxin is transported in a basipetal ( towards the base , base-seeking ) direction . In other words , auxin moves from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip towards the shoot . <p> Evidence - ( 1 ) Seedling vs. auxin ; and ( 2 ) 14C labeled IAA applied to the top of a stem section is recovered only from the bottom of the stem section . When auxin is applied to the end of stem segments , it is only transported from the " top " of the section to the " bottom " as demonstrated in these data : <p> Upright <p> Upside down <p> 14C-IAA in donor block ( dpm ) C-IAA in donor block ( dpm ) <p> 10,000 <p> 10,000 <p> 14C-IAA in receiver block ( dpm ) C-IAA in receiver block ( dpm ) <p> 7,500 <p> 300 <p> B. Mechanism of polar transport <p> Transport Rate ? IAA is not transported through the transpiration stream or phloem because the rate of movement is too slow . The rate of transport is consistent with diffusion . <p> Tissue of transport - appears to occur in parenchyma cells associated with the vascular tissue . <p> Model for polar transport : ( a ) Protons are moved out of the cell by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IAA is protonated at low pH ; ( c ) IAA-H passes through the lipid membrane . It can enter or leave anywhere ; ( d ) once inside the cell , the IAA-H ionizes in response to the higher pH ; ( e ) IAA- requires a permease to pass through the membrane ; ( f ) histochemical studies have shown that a permease is only located at the bottom of the cell - resulting in a net movement of auxin out of the bottom of the cells . <p> Evidence for polar transport model : ( a ) transport is blocked by respiratory poisons ( i.e. , demonstrates the need for ATP and a proton pump ) ; ( b ) unlabeled IAA competes with C14 labeled IAA for uptake in to the cells - this suggests that a carrier of some sort is required ; ( c ) fluorescein-labeled antibodies show that the permease is localized at bottom of cells ; and ( d ) the transport of auxin is blocked by NPA ( napthylthalamic acid ) , TIBA ( tri-iodobenzoic acid ) and flavanoids . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mechanism - In addition to the passive pH-dependent mechanism described , there a membrane transport protein seems involved that cotransports protons and IAA into the cell . This tranport protein is localized in the upper side of the cells . <p> V. Bioassays <p> There are four classic bioassays for auxin . These tests , which are all based on the ability of auxin to stimulate shoot growth ( or inhibit root growth ) are : <p> A. Avena coleoptile curvature test Pioneered by F. Went . The angle of curvature of a decapitated oat coleoptile is measured after placing an agar block containing auxin on one side . Then , angle of curvature vs . IAA is plotted . <p> B. Avena coleoptile elongation The ratio of final length/original length for oat coleoptiles or pea stem sections is measured after the tissues are floated in solutions containing different concentrations of IAA . Elongation vs . IAA is plotted . <p> C. Split pea curvature test A section of pea hypocotyl is obtained and split halfway down the middle . After incubating the sections in solutions of known IAA concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the epidermal cells are responding to the treatment . <p> D. Cress root inhibition This bioassay is based on the ability of auxin to stop root growth . A ratio of treatment/control growth is plotted vs. log IAA . <p> VI . Auxin responses IAA is involved in the following responses : <p> A. Cell elongation and wall relaxation Discussed earlier in the semester . Basis of several bioassays and the discovery of auxin . NOTE : Normally exogenous application of IAA has little effect on plants . <p> F. Flowering Although most plants don ? t initiate the production of flowers after auxin treatment , pineapple and its relatives ( Bromeliaceae ) do . Once flowers are initiated , in many species , IAA promotes the formation of female flowers , especially in cucurbits ( gourd family ) . <p> H. Apical dominance The apical meristem ( apex ) controls or dominates the development of the lateral buds . ( PS - a bud is an embryonic shoot with immature leaves and stem ) . Apical dominance also occurs in roots . It is responsible for the Xmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming too top-heavy . <p> Thimann &amp; Skoog ( 1934 ) - first suggested a correlation between IAA and apical dominance . This idea was further developed by Cholodny-Went who proposed that plant tissues responded to different concentrations of IAA ( see figure ) . For example , hi IAA stimulates shoot growth but inhibits bud and roots . Thus , IAA is produced at the tip of the plant and is transported downward . The high concentrations near the apex inhibit lateral buds . As the concentration decreases it frees the buds from the inhibition and they develop . <p> Evidence : <p> every gardener knows that removing the apical meristem results in bushier plants . This is consistent with the Cholodny-Went hypothesis . If IAA is applied to a de-tipped plant it prevents lateral bud development <p> IAA stimulates the formation of ethylene which is known to inhibit lateral bud formation . <p> branching mutants of tomato do n't export 14C-IAA <p> But : <p> IAA in buds after the tip is removed should decrease , and they do n't <p> IAA that act to replace the tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 <p> C-IAA doesn ? t enter the lateral buds when applied at tip <p> Some plants don ? t respond to exogenous IAA <p> Nutrient diversion hypothesis There is little development of vascular tissue to the lateral buds . This has lead some to propose that the lateral buds fail to develop because they get no nutrients because the nutritional traffic is being diverted to the apex . <p> Evidence : ( a ) application of cytokinins stimulates lateral bud development ; cytokinins known to direct nutritional traffic , especially during senescence ; ( b ) tomato mutants that exhibit strong apical dominance have lower levels of cytokinin ; ( c ) there is a good correlation between cytokinin level and bud development . <p> Bud Inhibition Another possible reason why buds fail to develop is because they have an inhibitor . It has been shown that ABA inhibits bud and seed development in many species . The buds of decapitated plants have a lower ABA than intact plants . High ABA in the bud are maintained by applying IAA to decapitated apex . <p> I. Tropic responses - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abscission layer is correlated with the IAA in leaf . As long as the IAA in the leaf is high relative to the stem , then the abscission layer doesn ? t form . When the IAA in the leaf drops , which occurs normally during the growing season , it stimulates the formation of the abscission layer forms and the leaf falls . The IAA presumably works by decreasing the sensitivity of the cells to ethylene which is the primary hormone involved in initiating leaf drop . <p> VII . Regulating Endogenous Levels All of the general methods ( i.e. , degradation , conjugates , regulate rate of synthesis , sequestering in different regions ) of regulation are probably operative . In particular , IAA is probably shuffled back and forth between the two main areas , or pools , where it is stored ? the cytosol and chloroplast . IAA oxidase , a type of peroxidase , converts IAA to inactive metabolites . There are several degradative pathways.

@@71697913 @397913/ <h> History of the Athlete Sculpture in front of the Warner Palaestra <p> The following information was originally compiled using documents located in the SJU Archives ( 0622:9 ) , October , 2007 . <p> In a letter sent from president Michael Blecker , OSB , to five sculptors , dated Sept. 15 , 1972 : <p> " Through the generosity of friends of Saint Johns University we are presently seeking an artist who is willing to do a piece of sculpture , a single figure or a group , which will be located near the entrance of the new physical education building here at Saint Johns University . " <p> " The new building will be called a " palaestra " which is the Greek word originally meaning a physical contest or wrestling and later an oratorical contest . We believe the name " palaestra " will help relate the physical discipling sic of the body with discipline of mind , which is the purpose of an institution of higher education . <p> " We are therefore seeking a sculptural figure or group which will introduce those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " palaestra " to the University . Themes which might be appropriate for sculptural treatment might be : the discipling sic of mind and body ; the role or place of contest and struggle in life ; the expression of physical grace ; the excitement of winning/losing or succeeding/failing . " <p> A memo to Fr . Michael Blecker from ( then former ) Abbot Baldwin Dworschak dated Oct. 8 , 1972 listed the names of five artists who were invited to submit proposals , the three among them asked to submit models ( Paul T. Granlund , Joseph O'Connell , and Gerald Bonnette ) and of the four people who agreed to act as judges of the merits of the work submitted . Marcel Breuer was not among the five solicited for proposals . <p> " After considerable discussion of the qualities of each piece of sculpture submitted to the committee for its judgment , the committee concluded that a non-representational design would be more fitting and recommended that I explore an architectural piece of sculpture more closely integrated with the design of the building . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dated March 28 , 1973 , he states : <p> " Saint Johns is commissioning you to design the plaza area in front of the new physical education center and an architectural sculpture " <p> Fr . Michael also references " our last telephone conversation , " so the change to designating Breuer as the sculptor may have come about via phone calls rather than letters . <p> In another letter , from Breuer to Blecker , dated April 6 , 1973 , the architect states : <p> " may I take the liberty of offering the design for the sculpture as a donation to St. Johns University : The Universityspecifically Mr. McNeelywould have to provide only for a ) the execution of the sculpture ; b ) the arrangement of the grounds around the sculpture ; c ) the drafting costs in this office ( which will not amount to very much in this case . ) " <p> So , ultimately , the design was donated , the other expenses ( approx. $27,000.00 ) were apparently paid by Mr. Donald McNeely ( after whom the Palaestra addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cold Spring Granite executed Breuers design .

@@71697914 @397914/ <p> 1 . I have wandered far from the subject ; for I undertook to give reasons why the vision was no work of the imagination . For how can we , by any efforts of ours , picture to ourselves the Humanity of Christ , and imagine His great beauty ? No little time is necessary , if our conception is in any way to resemble it . Certainly , the imagination may be able to picture it , and a person may for a time contemplate that picture , --the form and the brightness of it , --and gradually make it more perfect , and so lay up that image in his memory . Who can hinder this , seeing that it could be fashioned by the understanding ? But as to the vision of which I am speaking , there are no means of bringing it about ; only we must behold it when our Lord is pleased to present it before us , as He wills and what He wills ; and there is no possibility of taking anything away from it , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of effecting it , whatever we may do , nor of seeing it when we like , nor of abstaining from seeing ; if we try to gaze upon it--part of the vision in particular--the vision of Christ is lost at once . <p> 2 . For two years and a half God granted me this grace very frequently ; but it is now more than three years since He has taken away from me its continual presence , through another of a higher nature , as I shall perhaps explain hereafter. 1 And though I saw Him speaking to me , and though I was contemplating His great beauty , and the sweetness with which those words of His came forth from His divine mouth , --they were sometimes uttered with severity , --and <p> though I was extremely desirous to behold the colour of His eyes , or the form of them , so that I might be able to describe them , yet I never attained to the sight of them , and I could do nothing for that end ; on the contrary , I lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks upon me at times with great tenderness , yet so strong is His gaze , that my soul can not endure it ; I fall into a trance so deep , that I lose the beautiful vision , in order to have a greater fruition of it all . <p> 3 . Accordingly , willing or not willing , the vision has nothing to do with it . Our Lord clearly regards nothing but humility and confusion of face , the acceptance of what He wishes to give , and the praise of Himself , the Giver . This is true of all visions without exception : we can contribute nothing towards them--we can not add to them , nor can we take from them ; our own efforts can neither make nor unmake them . Our Lord would have us see most clearly that it is no work of ours , but of His Divine Majesty ; we are therefore the less able to be proud of it : on the contrary , it makes us humble and afraid ; for we see that , as our Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would see , so also can He take from us these mercies and His grace , and we may be lost for ever . We must therefore walk in His fear while we are living in this our exile . <p> 4 . Our Lord showed Himself to me almost always as He is after His resurrection . It was the same in the Host ; only at those times when I was in trouble , and when it was His will to strengthen me , did He show His wounds . Sometimes I saw Him on the cross , in the Garden , crowned with thorns , --but that was rarely ; sometimes also carrying His cross because of my necessities , --I may say so , --or those of others ; but always in His glorified body . Many reproaches and many vexations have I borne while telling this--many suspicions and much persecution also . So <p> p. 250 <p> certain were they to whom I spoke that I had an evil spirit , that some would have me exorcised . I did not care much for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my confessors were afraid to hear me , or when I knew that they were told of anything about me . <p> 5 . Notwithstanding all this , I never could be sorry that I had had these heavenly visions ; nor would I exchange even one of them for all the wealth and all the pleasures of the world . I always regarded them as a great mercy from our Lord ; and to me they were the very greatest treasure , --of this our Lord assured me often . I used to go to Him to complain of all these hardships ; and I came away from prayer consoled , and with renewed strength . I did not dare to contradict those who were trying me ; for I saw that it made matters worse , because they looked on my doing so as a failure in humility . I spoke of it to my confessor ; he always consoled me greatly when he saw me in distress . <p> 6 . As my visions grew in frequency , one of those who used to help me before--it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear me--began to say that I was certainly under the influence of Satan . He bade me , now that I had no power of resisting , always to make the sign of the cross when I had a vision , to point my finger at it by way of scorn , 3 and be firmly persuaded of its diabolic nature . If I did this , the vision would not recur . I was to be without fear on the point ; God would watch over me , and take the vision away. 4 This was a great hardship for me ; for , as I could not believe that the vision did not <p> 2 .

Dominic Baes , one of her confessors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 . <p> p. 251 <p> come from God , it was a fearful thing for me to do ; and I could not wish , as I said before , that the visions should be withheld . However , I did at last as I was bidden . I prayed much to our Lord , that He would deliver me from delusions . I was always praying to that effect , and with many tears . I had recourse also to St. Peter and St. Paul ; for our Lord had said to me--it was on their feast that He had appeared to me the first time5--that they would preserve me from delusion . I used to see them frequently most distinctly on my left hand ; but that vision was not imaginary . These glorious Saints were my very good lords . <p> 7 . It was to me a most painful thing to make a show of contempt whenever I saw our Lord in a vision ; for when I saw Him before me , if I were to be cut in pieces , I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , a heavy kind of penance ; and accordingly , that I might not be so continually crossing myself , I used to hold a crucifix in my hand . This I did almost always ; but I did not always make signs of contempt , because I felt that too much . It reminded me of the insults which the Jews heaped upon Him ; and so I prayed Him to forgive me , seeing that I did so in obedience to him who stood in His stead , and not to lay the blame on me , seeing that he was one of those whom He had placed as His ministers in His Church . He said to me that I was not to distress myself--that I did well to obey ; but He would make them see the truth of the matter . He seemed to me to be angry when they made me give up my prayer. 6 He told me to say to them that this was tyranny . He gave me reasons for believing that the vision was not satanic ; some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 . On one occasion , when I was holding in my hand the cross of my rosary , He took it from me into His <p> own hand . He returned it ; but it was then four large stones incomparably more precious than diamonds ; for nothing can be compared with what is supernatural . Diamonds seem counterfeits and imperfect when compared with these precious stones . The five wounds were delineated on them with most admirable art . He said to me , that for the future that cross would appear so to me always ; and so it did . I never saw the wood of which it was made , but only the precious stones . They were seen , however , by no one else , --only by myself. 7 <p> 9 . When they had begun to insist on my putting my visions to a test like this , and resisting them , the graces I received were multiplied more and more . I tried to distract myself ; I never ceased to be in prayer : even during sleep my prayer seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made piteous complaints to our Lord , and told Him I could not bear it . Neither was it in my power--though I desired , and , more than that , even strove--to give up thinking of Him . Nevertheless , I obeyed to the utmost of my power ; but my power was little or nothing in the matter ; and our Lord never released me from that obedience ; but though He bade me obey my confessor , He reassured me in another way , and taught me what I was to say . He has continued to do so until now ; and He gave me reasons so sufficient , that I felt myself perfectly safe . <p> 10 . Not long afterwards His Majesty began , according to His promise , to make it clear that it was He Himself who appeared , by the growth in me of the love of God so strong , that I knew not who could have infused it ; for it was most supernatural , and I had not attained to it by any efforts of my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , and I knew not how to <p> 7 . The cross was made of ebony ( Ribera ) . It is not known where that cross is now . The Saint gave it to her sister , Doa Juana de Ahumada , who begged it of her . Some say that the Carmelites of Madrid possess it ; and others , those of Valladolid ( De la Fuente ) . <p> p. 253 <p> seek that life otherwise than by dying . Certain great impetuosities8 of love , though not so intolerable as those of which I have spoken before , 9 nor yet of so great worth , overwhelmed me . I knew not what to do ; for nothing gave me pleasure , and I had no control over myself . It seemed as if my soul were really torn away from myself . Oh , supreme artifice of our Lord ! how tenderly didst Thou deal with Thy miserable slave ! Thou didst hide Thyself from me , and didst yet constrain me with Thy love , with a death so sweet , that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not possible for any one to understand these impetuosities if he has not experienced them himself . They are not an upheaving of the breast , nor those devotional sensations , not uncommon , which seem on the point of causing suffocation , and are beyond control . That prayer is of a much lower order ; and those agitations should be avoided by gently endeavouring to be recollected ; and the soul should be kept in quiet . This prayer is like the sobbing of little children , who seem on the point of choking , and whose disordered senses are soothed by giving them to drink . So here reason should draw in the reins , because nature itself may be contributing to it and we should consider with fear that all this may not be perfect , and that much sensuality may be involved in it . The infant soul should be soothed by the caresses of love , which shall draw forth its love in a gentle way , and not , as they say , by force of blows . This love should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fiercely boiling because too much fuel has been applied to it , and out of which everything is lost . The source of the fire must be kept under control , and the flame must be quenched in sweet tears , and not with those painful tears which come out of these emotions , and which do so much harm . <p> 12 . In the beginning , I had tears of this kind . They left me with a disordered head and a wearied spirit , and for a day or two afterwards unable to resume my prayer . Great discretion , therefore , is necessary at first , in order that everything may proceed gently , and that the operations of the spirit may be within ; all outward manifestations should be carefully avoided . <p> 13 . These other impetuosities are very different . It is not we who apply the fuel ; the fire is already kindled , and we are thrown into it in a moment to be consumed . It is by no efforts of the soul that it sorrows over the wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is far otherwise ; for an arrow is driven into the entrails to the very quick , 10 and into the heart at times , so that the soul knows not what is the matter with it , nor what it wishes for . It understands clearly enough that it wishes for God , and that the arrow seems tempered with some herb which makes the soul hate itself for the love of our Lord , and willingly lose its life for Him . It is impossible to describe or explain the way in which God wounds the soul , nor the very grievous pain inflicted , which deprives it of all self-consciousness ; yet this pain is so sweet , that there is no joy in the world which gives greater delight . As I have just said , 11 the soul would wish to be always dying of this wound . <p> 14 . This pain and bliss together carried me out of myself , and I never could understand how it was . Oh , what a sight a wounded soul is ! --a soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to say of itself that it is wounded for so good a cause ; and seeing distinctly that it never did anything whereby this love should come to it , and that it does come from that exceeding love which our Lord bears it . A spark seems to have <p> fallen suddenly upon it , that has set it all on fire . Oh , how often do I remember , when in this state , those words of David : " Quemadmodum desiderat cervus ad fontes aquarum " ! 12 They seem to me to be literally true of myself . <p> 15 . When these impetuosities are not very violent they seem to admit of a little mitigation--at least , the soul seeks some relief , because it knows not what to do--through certain penances ; the painfulness of which , and even the shedding of its blood , are no more felt than if the body were dead . The soul seeks for ways and means to do something that may be felt , for the love of God ; but the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of can take it away . As relief is not to be had here , these medicines are too mean for so high a disease . Some slight mitigation may be had , and the pain may pass away a little , by praying God to relieve its sufferings : but the soul sees no relief except in death , by which it thinks to attain completely to the fruition of its good . At other times , these impetuosities are so violent , that the soul can do neither this nor anything else ; the whole body is contracted , and neither hand nor foot can be moved : if the body be upright at the time , it falls down , as a thing that has no control over itself . It can not even breathe ; all it does is to moan--not loudly , because it can not : its moaning , however , comes from a keen sense of pain . <p> 16 . Our Lord was pleased that I should have at times a vision of this kind : I saw an angel close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . This I am not accustomed to see , unless very rarely . Though I have visions of angels frequently , yet I see them only by an intellectual vision , such as I have spoken of before. 13 It was our Lord 's will that in this vision I should see the angel in this wise . He was not large , but small of <p> 12 . Psalm xli. 2 : " As the longing of the hart for the fountains of waters , so is the longing of my soul for Thee , O my God . " <p> stature , and most beautiful--his face burning , as if he were one of the highest angels , who seem to be all of fire : they must be those whom we call cherubim. 14 Their names they never tell me ; but I see very well that there is in heaven so great a difference between one angel and another , and between these and the others , that I can not explain it . <p> 17 . I saw in his hand a long spear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be a little fire . He appeared to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart , 15 and to pierce my very entrails ; when he drew it out , he seemed to draw them out also , and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God . The pain was so great , that it made me moan ; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain , that I could not wish to be rid of it . The soul is satisfied now with nothing less than God . The pain is not bodily , but spiritual ; though the body has its share in it , even a large one . It is a caressing of love so sweet which now takes place between the soul and God , that I pray God of His goodness to make him experience it who may think that I am lying. 16 <p> 18 . During the days that this lasted , I went about as if beside myself . I wished to see , or speak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was to me a greater bliss than all created things could give me. 17 <p> 19 . I was in this state from time to time , whenever it was our Lord 's pleasure to throw me into those deep <p> 14 . In the MS. of the Saint preserved in the Escurial , the word is " cherubines ; " but all the editors before Don Vicente de la Fuente have adopted the suggestion , in the margin , of Baes , who preferred " seraphim . " F. Bouix , in his translation , corrected the mistake ; but , with his usual modesty , did not call the reader 's attention to it . <p> 16 . " The most probable opinion is , that the piercing of the heart of the Saint took place in 1559 . The hymn which she composed on that occasion was discovered in Seville in 1700 ( " En las internas entraas " ) . On the high altar of the Carmelite church in Alba de Tormes , the heart of the Saint thus pierced is to be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( De la Fuente ) . <p> trances , which I could not prevent even when I was in the company of others , and which , to my deep vexation , came to be publicly known . Since then , I do not feel that pain so much , but only that which I spoke of before , --I do not remember the chapter , 18--which is in many ways very different from it , and of greater worth . On the other hand , when this pain , of which I am now speaking , begins , our Lord seems to lay hold of the soul , and to throw it into a trance , so that there is no time for me to have any sense of pain or suffering , because fruition ensues at once . May He be blessed for ever , who hath bestowed such great graces on one who has responded so i 'll to blessings so great ! 
@@71697915 @397915/ <p> Gases , such as carbon dioxide and oxygen , are important in the overall energy metabolism of plants ; <p> Plants must exchange gases with the environment ; and <p> In order to obtain carbon dioxide plants will necessarily loose water ( transpire ) . In other words , transpiration is a necessary evil of photosynthesis . <p> III . Theoretical considerations <p> A large surface area is required for efficient gas exchange . Thus , animals have lungs or gills whereas plants have leaves with extensive spongy mesophyll ( it may be time to review your leaf anatomy ) . <p> A large surface area for exchanging gases offers a large surface area for desiccation . Animals solve this problem by placing the absorptive surface inside a humid cavity ( lung ) opened with a small exit pore(s) . Plants put the absorptive surface ( spongy mesophyll ) inside the leaf and cover it with a water impermeable layer ( cuticle ) peppered with a series of pores ( stomata ) . The cuticle is comprised of waxes , which are an assortment of long chain hydrocarbons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids ) . Note that even though these strategies minimize desiccation from the absorptive surfaces of plants and animals , they don ? t completely eliminate it . <p> Placing the absorptive surfaces inside the organism to reduce desiccation presents a problem - getting the gases to the absorptive surface . Animals use an active pumping mechanism ( e.g. , lungs/diaphragm ) to move gases inside the organism by bulk flow . The gases are circulated by another pumping system ( heart ) . The distances needed to move the gases are too great to be accounted for by simple diffusion . Plants do not have a pumping mechanism for moving gases ; they rely on diffusion ( and to a lesser degree , bulk flow ) . In either case , plants do not actively move gases . This is one reason why leaves are so thin ( recall our previous discussion ) - diffusion is not efficient over long distances ( i.e. , diffusion is inversely related to the square of distance ) . For example , it would take about 2.5 seconds for glucose to diffuse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately 32 years to go one meter ! <p> Paradox and Compromise . In order to obtain carbon dioxide for photosynthesis plants needed to evolve a large , thin absorptive surface ( leaves with spongy layer ) and then protect it from desiccation . Thus we can consider this the **28;1253;TOOLONG " paradox " . Actually , it might better be considered a " compromise " since that is what a plant needs to do - strike a compromise or balance between the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed and the amount of water lost by transpiration . <p> IV . Further complications Not only is water loss a " necessary evil " of photosynthesis , but to make matters worse , the tendency to loose water is greater than the tendency of carbon dioxide to diffuse into the plant . As evidence , let 's calculate the transpiration ratio , which is a measure of the the amount of water loss relative to the amount of carbon fixation . <p> transpiration ratio = mol water transpired / mol CO2 fixed <p> If carbon dioxide uptake ( or fixation ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In reality , experiments show that this ratio is closer to 200 ! Thus , for every 200 kg of water transpired , 1 kg of dry matter is fixed by a plant . Let ? s see why : <p> A. Diffusion and gradients Recall that during diffusion molecules move from an area of higher chemical potential ( or concentration or chemical energy ) to an area of lower chemical potential ( or concentration or free energy ) and that the driving force for diffusion is the gradient from one area to another . We can express this relationship mathematically using Fick ? s Law : Jv = ( c1 - c2 ) /r where Jv = flux density , ( mol m-2s-1 ) ; c1 - c2 = concentration gradient , and r = resistance ( a function of distance , medium viscosity , membrane permeability , etc . ) . We can simplify this equation to : <p> diffusion = gradient/resistance <p> Now let ? s compare the rates of diffusion for both water and carbon dioxide . Since resistance , or the distance that either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same , then diffusion is directly proportional to the gradient . <p> Carbon dioxide - has a very shallow , or small , gradient from inside to outside of the leaf . Ambient carbon dioxide concentrations are approximately 0.03% ( = 0.36 mmol mol-1 ) . The internal concentration can not be less than zero . Thus , the gradient is no larger than 0.36 mmol mol-1 ( 0.36 - 0 ) . <p> Water - has a very steep gradient from inside to outside . At a relative humidity of 50% and 25 C the water potential of water in air is ca. -100 MPa ( = 32 mmol mol-1 ) . The air in the substomatal cavity of a leaf is typically fully saturated , with a RH near 100% , and has a water potential near zero . Thus , the water potential gradient is 100 MPa ( or 32 mmol mol-1 ) . <p> Conclusion : based on gradient alone , the water has approximately 100x greater tendency to diffuse out of the leaf than carbon dioxide to diffuse into the leaf . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for water to diffuse out of the leaf is 1.56 times greater than the tendency for carbon dioxide to diffuse into the leaf . <p> V. The **28;1283;TOOLONG compromise revisited Although it seems as though water loss is a serious , intractable problem for a plant , it is NOT . The reason - plants continually compromise between the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed and the amount of water loss . This compromise is mediated by the stomata , whose function is to regulate gas exchange . <p> VI . Stomatal Structure <p> Anatomy of a stoma ( stomata , plural ) - guard cells , subsidiary cells , substomatal cavity , cuticle , ledge ( or lip ) , stomatal apparatus . The subsidiary cells are epidermal cells that may be specialized and different from the other epidermal cells . The function of the ledge is to prevent liquid water from seeping into the pore . Interestingly , cutin covers most of the cells in the substomatal cavity ; only regions near the actual opening are free of cuticle and most water is lost from this area . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guard cells : ( 1 ) elliptical or kidney-shaped . These are characteristic of eudicots and other non-grasses ; and ( 2 ) dumb-bell or dog-bone shaped - characteristic of grasses ( called graminaceous type ) <p> Common features - ( 1 ) thickened inner walls ; and ( 2 ) radial micellation - the cellulose microfibrils radiate out around the circumference of the pore ; ( 3 ) chloroplasts - these are the only epidermal cells with chloroplasts ; and ( 4 ) connected end-to-end . <p> VII . The beauty of stomata The evolution of a water-impermeable covering of the absorptive surface that was peppered with oodles of pores was a great idea . The stomata are ideal structures for regulating gas exchange because : <p> There are lots of them on any plant surface . In fact , there can be as many as 1000 mm-2 . Obviously , the larger the number of pores , the greater the amount of total diffusion that can occur ( see accompanying data . Plot : total diffusion ( g hr -1 ) vs. total pore number , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A large number of pores is necessary so that plants are able to absorb enough carbon dioxide for photosynthesis . <p> The pores comprise a large area of the surface of a plant . In fact , stomata occupy as much as 2-3% of the total leaf surface area . As expected , the greater the pore area the greater the rate of diffusion plot total diffusion vs. total pore area ( cm-2 ) see accompanying data which is advantageous for maximizing carbon dioxide uptake . <p> The pores are small . On average , stomata are about 14 m in diameter . Although more total diffusion occurs through large pores total diffusion ( g hr-1 ) vs. pore dia. ( m ) , small pores are more efficient than larger ones diffusion rate ( g hr-1 cm-2 ) vs. pore dia ( m ) see accompanying data . This is due to the edge effect ( related to surface-to-volume ratios ) . Smaller pores have a greater proportion of edge . As molecules reach the edge they " spill over " and in effect have a shorter diffusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pores are optimally spaced . A significant boundary layer of humid air forms around leaf surfaces . This humid area reduces the rate of further transpiration . It occurs because diffusion shells from adjacent pores fuse . If the pores were much farther separated , they would n't form a nice boundary layer . The thickness of the boundary layer is further affected by : ( 1 ) wind speed ; ( 2 ) presence of hairs ; and ( 3 ) sunken chambers . <p> The pores are optimally located . In grasses , the stomata are distributed approximately equally on both sides of the leave whereas in herbaceous eudicots there are generally more on the underside ( abaxial ) than the upper ( adaxial ) side . In woody eudicots there are usually few stomata in the upper surface , whereas aquatic plants with floating leaves have most stomata in the upper surface . These modifications are important to minimize/control water loss . Conifers and xeric plants often put the stoma in sunken chambers . <p> The degree of opening/closing of the pore is closely regulated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any factor that can impact the rate of photosynthesis or overall water status of the plant will influence the action of the guard cells ( see below ) . I like our textbook description that stomata are " multisensory hydraulic valves . " <p> VIII . Mechanics of Guard Cell Action Guard cells open because of the osmotic entry of water into the GC . In turn , this increases the turgidity ( water pressure ) in the GC and causes them to elongate . The radial orientation of cellulose microfibrils prevents increase in girth . Since GC are attached at the ends and because the inner wall is thicker , the guard cells belly out with the outer wall moving more pulling open the guard cell . Guard cell closure essential involves reversing this process . We can summarize the mechanics of GC action as follows : <p> IX . Physiology of Guard Cell Action . Part I Since water is the driving force for GC action , this means that there must be a gradient in water potential between the GC and the surrounding cells ( subsidiary cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a mechanism to generate a water potential gradient . <p> A. Hypotheses for how the water potential gradient is established include : <p> There is a rapid decrease in pressure in surrounding cells ( i.e. , subsidiary cells shrink which would result in the GC expanding and taking up water ) . Using a fine needle transducer , Mary Edwards and Hans Meidner showed that there is some decrease in surrounding cell P , but this is not a major factor . <p> There is an increase in the stretchability of the GC cell wall . This would result in an expansion of the GC with a concomitant uptake of water . Little evidence exists for this idea . <p> There is a decrease in the osmotic potential in the GC . Much evidence supports this hypothesis . For example , Humble and Raschke ( 1971 ) showed that the solute potential of turgid GC ( open stoma ) of broad bean is -3.5 MPA but when the guard cells are flaccid ( stoma closed ) , the osmotic potential is -1.9 MPa . Thus , the solute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when open . Since the GC volume increases , this must mean that there is an accumulation or synthesis of solute . <p> Carbohydrates , such as sucrose Since guard cells are the only epidermal cells with chloroplasts , plant physiologists have long hypothesized that sucrose and related carbohydrates are osmotic regulators of guard cells . For example , the starch content of guard cell chloroplasts decreases as the stomata open . This idea , the " starch-sugar hypothesis " , was the first postulated mechanism for guard cell activity . It lost popularity after the role of potassium ions was discovered , but most now agree that both sugar and potassium ions play a role in guard cell regulation . Sucrose seems to be especially important in closing guard cells . see graph in text/class <p> Where does the sucrose come from ? ( a ) hydrolysis of starch in the GC chloroplasts . In other words , an indirect product of photosynthesis ( evidence : starch grains disappear during opening ) ; or ( b ) a direct product of carbon fixation ( photosynthesis ) . <p> Malate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may already be familiar with its role in the Kreb 's cycle in the mitochondria . In plants , malate is also derived from the hydrolysis of starches . The enzyme phosophoenolpyruvate carboxylase ( PEPase ) binds carbon dioxide ( actually bicarbonate ions ) to phosphoenolpyruvate ( PEP ; 3-carbon atoms ; an intermediate in glycolysis ) to produce oxaloacetate ( C4 ) which is then reduced to malate and stored in the vacuole . <p> Chloride ions Chloride ions are transported into the cell from the apoplast via a Cl-/H+ symport in which a proton gradient is used to " drag " the chloride into the cell . <p> Potassium ions This appears to be the primary osmotic agent , especially for opening the GC in the morning . The potassium comes comes from surrounding cells . Evidence : ( a ) if you strip epidermis from a leaf , which breaks many epidermal cells but not the more resistant GC , the GC will only open if K+ is provided in the medium ; ( b ) potassium concentrations increase in the guard cells upon opening ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse process occurs . However , time course studies indicate that potassium uptake is associated with opening of the stomata in the morning , but sucrose loss is more closely associated with closure in the afternoon . Thus , the final modification to our scheme : <p> X. Environmental Control of GC Action Whatever physiological mechanism we finally postulate for the GC , it must also be compatible with the action of various environmental factors that are known to regulate stomatal activity . Since guard cells respond to their environment , especially any factors that impact the **28;1313;TOOLONG compromise . We expect any factor important in photosynthesis to exert regulatory control on GC . And , we expect water to have the " final word " on control since if a plant dries out too much it 's as good as dead ! <p> Red &amp; blue light The action spectrum for the process suggests that both red and blue light are important regulators of guard cell activity and that their action is , at least partially , mediated by photosynthesis ( recall red and blue light are used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DCMU ( an inhibitor of PS ) prevents stomatal action . <p> Blue light There is an additional effect of blue light on stomatal activity that is irrespective of its role in photosynthesis . The evidence : ( a ) blue light is 10x more effective than red light ; ( b ) in saturating levels of red light , treatment with blue light will cause additional GC opening ; ( c ) the action spectrum for blue light is similar to other " blue light responses " , a " three-finger pattern " ; ( d ) photosynthesis inhibitors block the red light effect but not the blue light effect . <p> Blue light stimulates cellular respiration ( which among other things may be required to produce ATP for the proton pump ) . <p> What is the receptor for the blue light ? <p> The action spectrum for the blue light response shows a " three finger pattern , " which is characteristic of other blue light responses ( i.e. , phototropism ) . Absorption spectra of potential receptor pigments show a good match between zeaxanthin , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thylakoid , and the action spectrum . Further ? zeaxanthin levels are directly correlated with stomatal aperture . <p> How does blue light cause stomatal closure ? <p> Photosynthetically active radiation ( red and blue light ) cause an acidification of the chloroplast lumen . This activates the synthesis of zeaxanthin , which in turn , zeaxanthin activates a calcium-ATP pump in the chloroplast membrane that decreases calcium concentrations in the cytosol . This , in turn activates the proton pump in the cell membrane . <p> 2 . H+/ATPase proton pump . The pump is required for stomatal opening ( see above ) . Protons are transferred from the cytosol into the apoplast . As protons are removed from the cytosol , the pH increases . <p> E. Water - protects against excessive water loss . This is the prevailing and overriding control mechanism . There are two mechanisms by which water loss regulates stomatal closure , one of which is active and the other passive . <p> Hydropassive Control - simply put , as the plant looses water , the turgidity of the leaf cells , including guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plant is not " intentionally " closing the stoma , it is simply a consequence of drying out . <p> Hydroactive Control - this mechanism is one in which the plant actually seems to monitor its water status . When the water potential drops below some critical level , it engages a cascade of events that close the stomata . Presumably the plant is measuring pressure ( turgor ) and then synthesizes or releases an anti-transpirant that is translocated ( moved ) to the GC to cause closure . <p> The anti-transpirant is abscisic acid ( ABA ) , one of the major plant growth regulators . It is active in very low concentration ( 10-6 M ) and appears very rapidly after water stress ( within 7 minutes ) . After 4-8 hours , the ABA increases nearly 50x . ABA comes from two sources : ( a ) root ? in response to water stress , the xylem sap pH increases which in turn stimulates the release of ABA into the xylem sap for transport to the leaves . This seems to be a root signal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( b ) leaves ? water stress stimulates a synthesis of new ABA and redistribution of existing ABA . <p> Mechanism of Action : Treatment with ABA results in decrease of potassium , chloride and malate levels in the guard cells which in turn increase the water potential resulting in water efflux . Evidence suggests that there is an ABA receptor in the cell membrane . The receptor : ( a ) activates calcium channels in the membrane causing calcium uptake from the apoplast ; ( b ) activates calcium channels in the tonoplast causing calcium release from the vacuole into the cytosol ; ( c ) activates chloride ( and malate ) efflux channels ; ( d ) inactivates potassium ion " in " channels ; ( e ) inactivates the cell membrane proton pump ; and ( f ) causes an increase in pH that activates potassium efflux channels . Thus , in short , ABA treatment causes an increase in cellular calcium levels which in turn results in decreases potassium and chloride levels and turns off the proton pump . <p> F. Temperature Increased temperatures usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooling . If the temperature becomes too high the stomata close due to water stress and increased CO2 that results from respiration . <p> G. Wind Often causes closure because it : ( a ) brings CO2 enriched air ; and ( b ) increases the rate of transpiration that causes water stress which causes the stomata to close . In some cases , wind causing stomatal opening to increase transpiration for cooling . <p> XI . Physiology of Guard Cell Action - Part II Now , let 's pull everything we 've learned together to hypothesize a mechanism of action . First , there are a couple of other observations that we also need to reconcile with our mechanism : 
@@71697920 @397920/ <p> I. A Water Balloon in a Box This is a good model for a plant cell . Thus , there are two major components to a plant cell : <p> A. The Box This part of the cell is analogous to the cell wall . Like a cardboard box , the cell wall is relatively rigid , it is non-living and highly structured . Its more obvious functions are to support and protect the cell . It is produced by the protoplast ( see below ) . <p> If you stack up a bunch of boxes you generally can ? t make a very large tower before it comes crashing down . Since a plant is essentially constructed of numerous small boxes , why don ? t they fall apart , too ? The answer is glue ! Plants glue their cells together with pectic polysaccharides . These carbohydrates , which make up the outermost layer of the plant cell wall ( called the middle lamella ) , bind adjacent cells together . Cooks use pectins extracted from the middle lamella to solidify jams and jellies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between adjacent cells because of the difficulty of packing of cells with rigid walls . Try and squeeze a bunch of irregularly boxes into a room without leaving any space between them ! The intercellular spaces are important for gas exchange and water transport , some movements ( i.e. , sensitive plants - water moves into/out of theses spaces ; nyctinastic movements - sleep movements ) and freezing protection ( i.e. , water moves out of cells into the spaces to minimize cellular damage on freezing . Trivia note : prized ginseng roots have a translucent appearance - apparently obtained by freezing ) . <p> Putting a cell in a box presents one major problem - how do cells talk to one another since they are now effectively isolated in their own small compartment ? Plants solved this problem by putting windows in the box ! Or in other words , there are lots of specialized pores through the wall called plasmodesmata that provide a cytoplasmic connection ( " cytoplasmic bridges " ) between adjacent plant cells . Thus , the cytoplasm of a plant is essentially contiguous throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like in the films Fantastic Voyage or Innerspace . You can essentially travel from cell-to-cell throughout the plant without ever leaving the cytoplasm nor crossing any cell membranes . Cool ! <p> The plasmodesmata are 40-50 nm in diameter . The maximum sized object that can pass through as a molecular mass of 700-1000 daltons , which is equivalent to a molecule 1.5 - 2.0 nm . The plasmodesmata have a unique structure . The plasma membranes from adjacent cells are continuous through the pore . In addition , the ER ( see below ) is also continuous between adjacent cells . The narrow tubule of ER is called the desmotubule and in the center there may be dark staining rod ( called then " central rod " ) . The cytoplasmic channel between desmotubule and membrane is called the " cytoplasmic sleeve . " Protein fibers radiate from the desmotubule to the membrane like spokes on a bicycle . These fibers may act like a sieve or screen . Plasmodesmata are aggregated in pits and there are 1-15 per mm2 . They can make up as much as 1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division ( see cell notes ) or secondarily after division . They may or may not be branched , too . <p> B. The water balloon - this is analogous to the protoplast . The protoplast is everything inside the cell wall . It is the " living " part of the cell and includes : <p> II . Separating the balloon from the box . Just as you can remove a balloon from a box , so too can a plant physiologist liberate the protoplast from the cell wall . This is accomplished by slicing up a leaf ( or other tissue ) and then floating it in a solution containing wall-digesting enzymes like pectinase , cellulase , and hemicellulase suspended in an inert osmotic agent ( 0.7 M mannitol or sorbitol ) in a buffered solution . The enzymes degrade the components of the cell wall releasing the protoplasts . This will be the focus of at least one or our lab sessions . <p> III . Organelles in Both Plant and Animal Cells First , we will study the components of the protoplast , but will especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next lecture we ? ll tackle the cell wall . <p> A. Plasma or Cell membrane Cell boundary ; selectively permeable ; bilayer of phospholipids with inserted protein . Phospholipids are unique molecules - they are amphipathic , meaning that they have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions . They have a glycerol backbone ; one of the hydroxyls is bonded to a phosphate and another charged group , the other two hydroxyls are esterified to fatty acids . The fatty acids range in length from C14 - C24 . One fatty acid is usually unsaturated and the other is saturated . The unsaturated fatty acid is kinked which helps to keep plant cell membranes fluid at cool temperatures . As a result plant phospholipids usually have a higher degree of unsaturation than animals . Hydrophobic interactions between the tail regions of the phospholipids hold the membrane together . Some proteins are found : ( 1 ) just on the outside or inside surfaces of the membrane ( peripheral proteins - non-covalent interactions and anchored proteins - covalently bound to lipids , etc ) ; or ( 2 ) embedded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ span the membrane ( trans-membrane proteins ) . Hydrophilic regions of the integral proteins are oriented to the outside of the membrane whereas hydrophobic regions are embedded within the phospholipid bilayer . Lipid soluble materials can readily pass through but charged or ionized substances ( hydrophilic ) pass through very slowly , if at all . The function of the membrane is to : ( 1 ) regulate traffic ; ( 2 ) separate the internal from external environment ; ( 3 ) serve as a platform on which some reactions can occur ; ( 4 ) participate in some reactions ( i.e. , the membrane components are important intermediates or enzymes ) ; and ( 5 ) provide some structural integrity for the cell . <p> B. Nucleus The cell " brain " . Surrounded by a double membrane ( two phospholipid bilayers ) - the nuclear membrane . Has pores . The structure of the pores is complex comprised of more than 100 proteins . The pore opening is surrounding by a series of proteins and these are attached to a series radial spokes . Nucleoplasm - matrix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nucleus , may be condensed into chromosomes or not ( chromatin ) . There may be one or more nucleolus ( site of ribosome production ) . The nucleus is 5-20 mm in diameter . There is a layer of intermediate filaments ( see below ) just inside the nuclear envelope ; called the nuclear lamina . <p> C. Cytoplasm/cytosol The cytosol is the gel-like matrix within the cell in which the other structures are embedded . The cytoplasm refers to the cell contents inside the membrane . <p> D. Mitochondria These organelles , like the nucleus and plastids , are double-membrane bound . They vary in shape from tubular ( like sausages ) to spherical . They reproduce by fission , have their own ribosomes and DNA ( a circular loop like prokaryotic cells ) . The inner membrane has a larger surface area so it must be folded into finger-like projections ( called cristae ) to fit inside the outer membrane . Mitochondria are found in all eukaryotic cells . They are the sites of cellular respiration - process by which energy is released from fuels such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell . They are small ( 1-5 mm ) and generally numerous ( 500-2000 per cell ) . A popular misconception is that " plants have chloroplasts , animals have mitochondria . " Plant cells , at least green plant cells ( i.e. , leaf cells ) , have both . Root cells only have mitochondria . Mitochondrial DNA which comprises about 200 kbases , codes for some of the genes required for cellular respiration including the 70S ribosomes and components of the electron transport system . The inner membrane differs from the plasma membrane in that it has a higher protein content ( 70% ) and unique phospholipids ( i.e. , cardiolipin ) . <p> E. Ribosome Sites of protein synthesis ( translation ) . Two subunits ; one large and the other small . Made in the nucleus from rRNA and protein . Ribosomes are tiny ( 0.25 mm ) and numerous ( 5 - 50 X 1010 per cell ) . Since ribosomes are not surrounded by a membrane , they are not considered to be " true " organelles . Some ribosomes are ' free ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others are attached to the ER ( produce proteins for export ) . To export a protein , the mRNA and subunits of the ribosome bind together . A signal recognition particle ( SRP ) binds to specific amino acids in the newly forming protein . The SRP , which is bound to the protein/mRNA/ribosome , then binds to a receptor in the ER membrane . As the protein is made it is released into the lumen of the ER and the SRP sequence of the protein is snipped off . <p> F. Endoplasmic reticulum A series of membranous tubes and sacs ( cisternae ) that run throughout the cell . Rough ER has ribosomes associated with it and is laminar while smooth ER lacks ribosomes and is tubular . Totally man . The ER has several functions including : ( 1 ) synthesis of lipids and membranes ( smooth ER ) ; ( 2 ) serving as a site for the synthesis of proteins by the ribosomes ( rough ER ) ; ( 3 ) transport ( a type of cell ' highway ' system ) ; and ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enzymes for metabolizing waste products from photosynthesis , fats and amino acids . Hydrogen peroxide is a product of metabolism in peroxisomes . Catalase , which breaks down the peroxide is also present and serves as a marker enzyme for these organelles . <p> I. Golgi apparatus Pancake- or pita bread-like stack of membranes . Particularly important in cells that produce materials for export ( secretion ) . They have a polarity ( cis - imports vesicles from ER ; trans - exports vesicles ) . The Golgi is the site of processing and packaging cellular components . Vesicles containing proteins , lipids and other materials , fuse with the Golgi ( cis side ) , release contents , which then get processed , sorted , packaged and re-released from the other side ( trans face ) . The Golgi also is active in synthesizing many cell components , especially carbohydrates and is involved in tagging proteins with carbohydrates and other side chains for sorting them to their final destination . There are two models for the movement of materials thru the Golgi : ( 1 ) Vesicle Migration Model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , then ultimately a new vesicle pinch off this stack and fuses with teh next one , and so on , until the vesicle reaches the trans side ; and ( 2 ) Escalator Model - a vesicle fuses with the cis side and never leaves this stack . Rather , the stack on the trans side releases vesicles and then disintegrates while a new stack forms on the cis side . The original vesicle is now in the " second " stack , and so on until it reaches the trans side . Vesicles are tagged with various proteins to direct them to the appropriate locations . <p> J. Microtubules Hollow tubes made of a mix of alpha and beta tubulin , which are globular proteins . There are essentially 13 columns of proteins . The tubes are about 25 mm in diameter . Microtubules are involved in the cell cytoskeleton ( for support ) , cell movements ( cilia , flagella ) and cell division ( spindle ) . Assembly of microtubules is prevented by colchicine , an inhibitor derived from Crocus bulbs . Low calcium concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Solid . Made from G-actin . Involved with the cell cytoskeleton . Main function is support . They are about 7 nm in diameter . <p> L. Intermediate filaments These are similar to microfilaments . They are also made of protein in the keratin family ; about 10 nm diameter . <p> M. Cilia/flagella For cellular movements . Cilia = many , short ; flagella = few , long . Have a 9+2 arrangement of microtubules . Prongs on the tubules are ATPases ( dynein ) to hydrolyze ATP to provide energy for movement . These are not particularly common in plants . <p> Microbodies - a general term for any single membrane bound organelle typically derived from the ER that contain catalase and/or hydrogen peroxide producing enzymes . This includes the peroxisomes and glyoxisomes ; <p> Microsomes - a " biochemical " term for the fraction that is obtained from high speed centrifugation of cell homogenates . It includes membrane fragments and ribosomes . <p> Oleosome ( spherosomes ) - these are lipid bodies . The coolest thing about them is that they are encased by one-half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single phospholipid layer . <p> IV . Organelles Unique to Plants - Plastids Plastids are double membrane-bound organelles in plants . They contain their own DNA ( in nucleoid region ) and ribosomes . They are semi-autonomous and reproduce by fission similar to the division process in prokaryotes . If plastids only arise from other plastids and can ? t be built " from scratch " , then where do they come from ? The egg . Plastids are inherited cytoplasmically , primarily through the female - however , there are examples of paternal inheritance of plastids . The plastid DNA carries several genes including the large subunit of rubisco and those for resistance to some herbicides . The chemistry of the membranes differs from the plasma membrane - plastid membranes are comprised of glycosylglycerides rather than phospholipids ( the phosphate in the polar head group in glycosylglycerides is replaced with galactose or a related sugar ) . <p> There are several types of plastids including : <p> Proplastids - small , precursors to the other plastid types , found in young cells , actively growing tissues ; <p> Chloroplasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain photosynthetic pigments including chlorophyll , carotenes and xanthophylls . The chloroplast is packed with membranes , called thylakoids . The thylakoids may be stacked into pancake- like piles called grana ( granum , singular ) . The " liquidy " material in the chloroplast is the stroma . A chloroplast is from 5-20 m in diameter and there are usually 50-200 per cell . The chloroplast genome has about 145 Kbase pairs , it is smaller than that of the mitochondria ( 200 kbases ) . About 1/3 of the total cell DNA is extranuclear ( in the chloroplasts and mitochondria ) ; <p> Etioplast - plastid whose development into a chloroplast has been arrested ( stopped ) . These contain a dark crystalline body , prolamellar body , which is essentially a cluster of thylakoids in a somewhat tubular form . <p> Plastids can dedifferentiate and convert from one form into another . For example , think about the ripening processing in tomato . Initially , green tomatoes have oodles of chloroplasts which then begin to accumulate lycopene ( red ) and become chromoplasts . Usually you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . <p> V. Organelles Unique to Plants - Vacuoles This is the large , central cavity containing fluid , called cell sap , found in plant cells . The vacuole is surrounded by a membrane ( tonoplast ) . Back to the water balloon in the box model - imagine the vacuole to be analogous to another water balloon inside our protoplast balloon . This water balloon is a separate entity that can be physically removed from the cell . The vacuole is penetrated by strands of cytoplasm - transvacuolar strands . <p> The tonoplast and plasma membrane have different properties such as thickness ( tonoplast thicker ) . <p> Virtually every plant cell has a large , well-developed vacuole that makes up to 90% or more of the cell volume . Wow ! Meristematic and embryonic cells are exceptions . Young tissues have many small vacuoles . As the cell grows the vacuoles expand and eventually coalesce . These small vacuoles appear to be derived from the Golgi . <p> The central vacuole contains water , ions , organic acids , sugars , enzymes , and a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( digest protein ) , ribonucleases ( digest RNA ) and glycosidases ( break links between monosaccharides ) . These enzymes are typically not used for recycling cellular components but rather leak out on cell senescence . There are smaller lytic vacuoles , which contain digestive enzymes , that are used for this purpose . Another type of vacuole , protein bodies , are vacuoles that store proteins . <p> Why do plants cells have a large central vacuole ? Important roles of the vacuoles are : <p> A. Energetically efficient means to increase surface to volume ratio in the dendritic growth form Since 90% of the cell volume is vacuole , therefore 90% of the cell is water , which is relatively cheap in metabolic terms . Thus , it allows plants to get big with a minimal energy investment . Plants are particularly ' smart , ' since , the cell wall , which comprises much of the remaining 10% or so of the cell is a polymer of glucose . Cellulose is a great bargain ! It is stronger and cheaper than comparable polymers .

Water storage Probably a minor role ; mostly in succulents <p> C. Waste disposal The vacuole can be considered the cell cesspool . It contains many secondary metabolites including a variety of hydrolytic enzymes like the " marker enzyme " alpha mannosidase . In this regard , the vacuole is analogous to the lysosome . <p> Let ? s consider differences between plants and animals in terms of wastes . Plants have little waste . Their nutrients are in dilute form , they use them efficiently and hence , there is little left over . Plants remind me of my Dad who was a Marine during WWII . He said that the Marine philosophy at dinner was to " eat all you want , but all that you take . " Plants do just that - most everything they " ingest " they use . The minimal wastes plants produce can be stored in the cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - released as a gas into the air , leached out of roots or leaves ) . <p> In contrast , animals rely on nutrients in a concentrated form . They are rarely selective about what they eat ; much un-usable material is ingested along with the " good stuff " . Thus , they have a large quantity of waste and needed to evolve specialized digestive/excretory systems to get rid of it . Further , animals don ? t have the luxury of having bulky vacuoles and internally storing wastes because these adaptations would limit motility . <p> Some related ideas : <p> Heterotrophic plants ( like carnivorous plants ) have excessive wastes . The plant strategy is usually to discard the structure with the wastes ( i.e. , insect remains ) and produce a new one . For example , pitcher plant leaves fill up with insect parts and the plant produces a new batch of leaves the next season . Plants are able to do this because of their architectural design ; <p> Humans start out life very much like a plant . Newborns are non-motile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is highly digestible leaving relatively few leftovers . Hence , newborn diapers are relatively innocuous . However , as babies become more animal-like and begin solid food , diapers are best left to the strong of stomach ; <p> Cell walls - have been suggested that the cell wall first evolved as a site for waste disposal for excess carbon . Whatdayathink ? <p> D. pH regulation The vacuole is a pool to dump excess protons . There is an active proton pump in the tonoplast . The cell sap has a pH of 2-5.7 , whereas the cytosol is ca. 7.0 . <p> E. Storage of essential ions Ions are pumped into the vacuole for water balance . Potassium and calcium . in particular , are stored in the vacuole . <p> F. Cell enlargement Cell growth requires some force to allow for the cell to increase in size . Water pressure provides the force and it moves into the vacuole . For example , root hair enlargement is due entirely to vacuolar enlargement . <p> G. Facilitates diffusion The cytosol essentially forms a thin coating around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio of the cytoplasm . It provides easier access and shorter diffusion distances between any part of the cytoplasm and the external environment of the cell . This can be particularly important for chloroplasts . <p> H. Structural support The vacuole helps to maintain turgor pressure in plant cells due to the opposing forces of tensile strength of the wall vs. compression strength of water .

@@71697926 @397926/ <p> The release of energy from glucose rolling downhill is coupled to ATP production ( ca. 40% of the energy is trapped in ATP but more than half of the energy is lost as heat ) . <p> II . Rolling metabolic rocks downhill - A look at Glucose Catabolism Glucose catabolism occurs in a series of small , sequential , highly controlled and regulated steps ( reactions ) . The processes involved are glycolysis , which is the first step of glucose breakdown , and it is followed by either fermentation or cellular respiration ( depending on the availability of oxygen ) . <p> Why so many steps ? Back to our hill model for an answer . There are two kinds of hills - those with a gradual , step-wise slope and those with a steep precipice or overhang . In each case the rock will roll down the hill and release the same total amount of energy , which is equal to the energy difference between the top and bottom of the hill ( 686 kcal/mol ) . However , the energy is released so quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trap very much of it in a usable form ( ATP ) . However , if the energy release occurs in a slow and orderly way , then it is possible to trap a greater percentage of energy as ATP . <p> Organic acids , like pyruvic acid , are usually ionized at cellular pH values . We name the ionized form " ate " . Thus , " pyruvic acid " and " pyruvate " refer to the same compound but in a slightly different form ( ionized vs. not ) . Essentially these terms can be used synonymously . <p> Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of virtually all cells . This suggests that glycolysis is an evolutionary ancient pathway . In fact , glycolysis likely evolved more than 3 billion years ago . Wow , it 's even older than me ! <p> Oxygen is not required . Glycolysis functions with ( aerobic conditions ) or without ( anaerobic conditions ) oxygen present . <p> Two ATP are required to get the " rock " rolling ( hmmm , sounds like a beer brand ) . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ react . Remember how people who " misbehaved " were " drawn and quartered " ? - this is the molecular version . <p> A total of four ATP are produced during the process at two different reactions . Thus , there is a net yield of 2 ATP . <p> ? ATP + pyruvate . ( Note that the PEP is an organic phosphate ) . Kinase enzymes are those involved in reactions that deal with ATP . <p> There is one redox reaction during glycolysis . The oxidation of glucose begins during glycolysis . NAD+ accepts the electrons during the oxidation , and as a result it gets reduced . A total of 2 NADH are produced . Recall that NAD+ is a coenzyme ( organic compound required by an enzyme for activity ) that is used in redox reactions . Enzymes that catalyze redox reactions with the help of coenzymes such as NAD+ are called dehydrogenases . <p> Pyruvic acid is a branch point . It still has much energy and can be further degraded . If oxygen is present ( aerobic conditions ) pyruvate is metabolized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ETC . Without oxygen , anaerobic conditions , pyruvate is metabolized via fermentation . <p> IV . Fermentation - stepping in an anaerobic environment <p> Occurs only in the absence of oxygen ( anaerobic conditions ) <p> Occurs in the cytoplasm <p> Occurs in most organisms <p> There are different types of fermentations depending upon the end products . The two common ones are : <p> Lactic acid fermentations - bacteria , humans . Commercially important in cultured dairy industry ( yogurt , cheese ) , silage , pickles . In humans , excessive exercise results in periods of fermentation during which lactate builds up and contributes to muscle fatigue and soreness . What if humans had evolved alcohol fermentations instead of lactate ones ? - every time you ran around the block you 'd get drunk ! <p> The ultimate function of fermentation is to regenerate oxidized coenzymes , like NAD+ . Why is this necessary ? - because glycolysis is the only source of ATP under anaerobic conditions . Recall that during the redox reaction in glycolysis , one of the key enzymes require OXIDIZED NAD+ as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coenzyme will be in the reduced form ( NADH ) and the reaction will stop because the enzyme wo n't have anywhere to dump off electrons . An analogy - imagine trying to bail out a boat full of water with a glass . The glass is like a coenzyme . It can be oxidized ( empty ) or full ( reduced ) . You can continue to bail out the boat as long as the glass is empty . When full , it ca n't accept any more water . Thus , you 're finished bailing , at least until you get another glass , or empty the one you have . <p> Fermentation vs. anaerobic respiration . There is a difference ! In a fermentation , electrons from coenzymes are donated back to part of the original substrate molecule . In a respiration , the electrons are donated to a substance , other than part of the original substrate . Thus , in an aerobic respiration , the electron acceptor is oxygen . In an anaerobic respiration , the acceptor is something else - like sulfur . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mitochondrion .

Simply put , there is a liquid matrix where " biochemical reactions " occur , an inner membrane where electron transfer reactions occur and an area where low pH wonn++t do any harm ( the " space " ) <p> B. Pyruvate Oxidation Pyruvate from glycolysis is shuttled into the mitochondrion . As it enters , both of the pyruvate are oxidized ( another redox reaction involving NAD+ ) and a carbon dioxide is lost from each . Note , that two carbons ( one from each of the pyruvate molecules that originated from glucose ) have been lost . The leftover two carbon piece is hooked onto a carrier ( Acetyl coenzyme A ) . <p> C. Welcome to the Citric Acid Cycle or Krebn++s cycle or Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle It is named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicycle shop in Kent , England . Just kidding - he was a British biochemist who worked out the details of many of the reactions . It is also called " Citric Acid Cycle " because citric acid is one of the important intermediate molecules or called the " Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle " ( TCA ) because citric acid has three carboxyl groups . Take your pick of names . <p> Occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion ( thus the reactants are water soluble ) <p> There are several different reactions in the Citric Acid cycle , each catalyzed by a different enzyme . <p> There is one substrate level phosphorylation reaction that produces ATP . Actually , the first product of the cycle is GTP ( which is a nucleotide phosphate carrier like ATP ) . The GTP then donates a phosphate to ADP to make ATP . <p> Carbon dioxide is released during two reactions ( alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase ) ( or three total reactions if you include the reaction during which pyruvate was shuttled into the mitochondrion ) . Thus , during the Citric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is completed . <p> There are four redox reactions , three of which yield reduced NADH and one FADH2 . Thus , the oxidation of glucose is completed in the Kreb 's cycle . If you count the redox reaction that occurred when shuttling pyruvate into the mitochondrion there is a total of 5 redox reactions in the mitochondrion . <p> D. Regenerating coenzymes in aerobic conditions Recall that one problem of glycolysis was regenerating oxidized coenzymes . Under anaerobic conditions , this problem was solved by a variety of fermentation reactions or anaerobic respiration . Well , the solution is much more elegant in cells in an aerobic environment . Not only are oxidized coenzymes recovered , but the process is coupled to the production of ATP . Thus , the evolution of an oxygenated atmosphere allowed cells the added bonus of producing additional cellular energy while regenerating oxidized coenzymes . The electron transport chain ( ETC ) provided the means for this process . <p> E. Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain <p> Occurs in the inner membrane ( cristae ) . Thus , the components are more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under aerobic conditions <p> The mitochondrial ETC consists of a series of electron carriers that alternately accept and pass along an electron - like a hot potato or to use our glass analog - like a glass that is alternately filled ( given an electron ) and emptied ( pass it off to the next carrier ) . In the process the carriers become reduced ( glass full ) and then oxidized again ( glass empty ) . <p> There are four major groups ( I , II , III , IV ) , called complexes , of electron carriers in the membrane . This is the reason why the text shows several blobs in the membrane . Each complex has a unique set of carriers . In addition , there are molecules that shuttle electrons from one complex to another . Among the carriers in the complexes ( do n't memorize these ) : Complex I - flavoproteins ( FMN ) and Fe-S proteins ; Complex II - more flavoproteins , Fe-S proteins ; Complex III - an assortment of proteins including cytochromes ( c1 and b ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence of electron flow occurs from complex I to complex IV as depicted : I <p> ? III ? IV <p> Since the complexes are physically separate in the membrane , carriers must shuttle electrons from one complex to another . Ubiquinone ( coenzyme Q , or simply , Q ) shuttles electrons from complex I to complex III ( and also between II and III ) . Cytochrome c shuttles electrons from complex III to complex IV . Thus : I ? Q ? III ? cyt c ? IV <p> NADH from the Kreb 's cycle donates its electrons at the end of the chain ( to complex I ) . After donating its electrons , NADH gets oxidized to NAD+ . Thus , we can modify the reaction chain : NADH ? I ? Q ? III ? cyt c ? IV <p> The final acceptor of the electrons in the ETC is oxygen . Oxygen becomes reduced to water . Thus : NADH ? I ? Q ?

The pH of the matrix ( or stoma ) is alkaline ( about pH 8 ) relative to the space ( pH 5 ) ; ( d ) this gradient provides the driving force for ATP production ; ( e ) ATP is made at an ATP synthase - which are liked stalked " lollipops " , protein channels that span the membrane .

Which do you choose ? <p> V. Function of Aerobic Respiration/Glucose Catabolism <p> Energy production ( 30+ ATP/glucose ) <p> Produce intermediates for many other metabolic reactions . Thus , various molecules can be siphoned off and used for other purposes . <p> Heat production . Glucose catabolism yields a TOTAL of approx. 38 ATP or 262 kcal ( 38 ATP x 7.3 kcal/mol ATP ) . Glucose has 686 kcal/mol . Thus , the efficiency of glucose metabolism is 262/686 x 100 = 38% . Or in other words , about 62% of the energy is lost as heat . This keeps us , shrews , and elephants warm .

The interplay between knowledge and love shapes the content ( tradita ) and mode of transmission ( traditio ) of the Catholic intellectual tradition . As thinkers within faith communities through the generations , the Church 's magisterium , theologians , and faithful have reflected upon this mystery of Christ among them and have produced authoritative ideas , images , statements , and narratives vital for the Church 's self-understanding . If Catholic believers 's way of seeing themselves , the world , and God becomes unmindful of their primary goal of understanding the mystery of Christ among them , then their outlook becomes rigid , lifeless , and idolatrous : one ideology in competition with other ideologies . The focus on Christ is most clear in prayer in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct encounter with Christ in reflection upon the created world is essential to creating and maintaining the Catholic mindset and Catholic culture , for the Catholic understanding of faith demands the engagement of the mind as well as the emotions . The love of Christ , like gravity , is an attractive force in the cosmos that can not be reduced to a human emotion , for this love of Christ , analogous to love in human experience , draws together and vivifies the entire cosmos . The Catholic thinker can not afford to divorce reflection upon creation from attention to the Creator , for it is the ongoing attention of the Creator that draws all people and things together into right relationship . The a priori of the Catholic intellectual tradition is the belief that Jesus Christ is the alpha and the omega , the same yesterday , today , and tomorrow ( Rev 1:8 ) , the beginning and the end of all striving . <p> I will address the issue of thinking within the Catholic tradition : ( 1 ) by sketching out the relational context within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ( 2 ) by examining the tension between love and skepticism as forces driving the search for truth ; ( 3 ) by examining aspects of the relationship between the Catholic tradition and the tradition of the academy ; and ( 4 ) by tracing out significant developments within the Catholic tradition of thinking through the Church 's encounter , with classical , medieval , and modern cultures . <h> The Embodied Thinker <p> A thinker is a finite , embodied person whose horizons are influenced by the circumstances of the time and place in which he or she lives . This environment which shapes the constitution of a person can be referred to as a culture where human agents collectively interact with one another , nature , and God to create an inhabitable world.

( 4 ) <p> If we are social beings called by God to shape the world of which we are a part and to be transformed by God 's grace , then any thought experiment which brackets out God and the givenness of the social dimension of our being will only remove us from the truth and wonder of life and contribute to the disintegration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mindset sees the thinking person as an embodied being already in relationship to the world and to God .

A traditional metaphor for describing this dynamic wholeness of creation is the human body . The body is distinctively shaped through head , torso , arms , hands , legs , and feet and is equipped with five senses to bring it into touch with its environment . The integration within this body as an organism and its communion with what lies outside it are marvelous , mysterious processes that are in motion and less than perfect .

The struggle between the forces of life and death is a stage for a more profound spiritual transformation that integrates the body , mind , and spirit of the person through the person 's coming into communion and right relationship with the Creator. ( 7 ) <p> Jesus Christ continues through the ages to become incarnate in his body , the Church . In this body , integration and wholeness are brought about through Christ 's acting in the members of the body , particularly through the sacraments. ( 8 ) In the first three centuries A.D. , Gnostics tried to find ways that the spirit could be released from the prison of the body and proposed that secret knowledge acquired by an elite could effect this liberation. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is an important aspect of Catholic doctrine that tries to hold together the spiritual and material , supernatural and natural. ( 10 ) The Chalcedonian doctrine of the inseparable but distinct divine and human natures in the person of Christ also applies to the Church. ( 11 ) <p> Through signs , symbols , and actions , individuals become members of the Body of Christ and are sustained in this Body by freely accept the saving action of Christ in the depth of their being . This action of Christ is fundamental to the maintenance of boundaries , the creation of health and balance in the individual members and in the community , and the growth toward genuine life . The physical body of the individual Christian and the metaphorical body of the Church are organic entities that bring to light the challenges , the resistance , and the limitations of the physical body in relation to the mental and spiritual dimensions of these entities. ( 12 ) The Catholic tradition acknowledges the challenges posed by human finitude and yet affirms the goodness of creation , insisting that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing intervention and care of the Creator. ( 13 ) <p> God 's creating and continuing to turn toward creation manifests the divine love. ( 14 ) God reveals a profound dimension of the divine character through this love . This other-directed , going outside of oneself reaches its most exalted form in laying down one 's life for another . In Jesus 's dying and rising , we see God extending the divine love in such total self-giving . So this agape that is fundamental to the divine economy calls for imitation by humans . In the Catholic imagination of life under God 's care , such love is possible because of the indwelling of God 's Spirit within us so that God 's love is poured out in our hearts ( Rom 5:5 ) . God 's love is ubiquitous and so is also present and active in those upright , compassionate ones who do not explicitly confess that salvation comes through Jesus Christ ( Rom 2:14-16 ) . ( 15 ) <p> With agape as a foundation , two other types of love , eros ( desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant in human relationships due to their strong concern for life . Eros is a motive force that draws a person toward another or toward an object or activity . Both Augustine and Freud see eros , rather than agape , as the starting point for love in human experience . Augustine understands eros as a type of love that needs to be sublimated into charity ; by contrast , Freud sees eros as a life force that needs to be freed from many idealistic inhibitions , even though some forms of repression are necessary for civilized life. ( 16 ) In friendship ( philia ) , those who are equals share interests and activities and care for one another . But it seems that a substantial , enduring relationship of friends depends on agape : the outpouring of God 's love that enables a person to be other-directed without the expectation of reward beyond that of the activity of love itself. ( 17 ) Timothy Jackson claims that erotic love and friendship falter unless agape is the origin and foundation of the relationship. ( 18 ) <p> The transcendence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom. ( 19 ) God freely chooses to disclose God 's Self through creation . God does not need the <p> world in order to come to fuller realization of divine reality . In this free divine disclosure , humans have implanted within them the natural drive to search for God , and so they can choose to carry out this search that moves them toward realizing their true nature of being made in the divine image . This image of God in humans was tarnished but not lost in the Fall ; it stands in need of restoration . Such restoration begins with a natural response to revelation of the divine reality implanted there by the Creator , but then is sustained by God 's ongoing care for creation. ( 20 ) <p> The visibility of the Church through its structures is an integral part of the incarnate Christ among us. ( 21 ) The Christocentric understanding of the Church indicates that the divine and human aspects are inseparable within the Church . The dynamic of the Church involves a necessary tension between the divine and human aspects as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply divine ; it is also human . Attempts to divinize the Church result in distortions just as the claim that a Christian is divinized through baptism leads to distortions if the human person and human nature of the baptized are not acknowledged as the realities within which the baptismal grace is working. ( 22 ) Within the Body of Christ on earth , the magisterium plays an essential role in pointing out the impact that individual ideas or teachings have on the well-being of the whole. ( 23 ) If such individual teachings depart from central elements of the tradition or introduce rapid and potentially convulsive change , then the magisterium is obliged to resist these teachings or changes. ( 24 ) <h> Love and Skepticism in the Search for Understanding <p> Reason , as a capacity for discerning order within creation , begins with experience and proceeds by demonstration , whereas faith begins with revelation and deals with truths that exceed the grasp of reason. ( 25 ) The challenge of finding reality that can be counted upon or is verifiable has always plagued thinking humans . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outer reality has been contextualized within the recognition of the place of love within the human person . The one who loves to observe nature or who loves social gatherings or who loves to work - all of these examples of love indicate a dynamic engagement between the subject with an objective world . Where the reality of love is stronger than that of alienation , then the basis upon which engagement with the world can proceed is laid within the Catholic tradition. ( 26 ) Saint Anselm 's statement of " faith seeking understanding " could be rephrased as " love seeking understanding . " ( 27 ) <p> Methodical doubt as a universal practice is not practical and could not be carried out even by the most rigorous of skeptics . Even though questioning and seeking is integral to human life and to the Christian life , there is a difference between a questioner who regards himself as absolutely autonomous and a questioner who seeks truth. ( 28 ) As important as autonomy is for reducing or eliminating distorting influences in an investigation , autonomy is relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human and is not absolute where the questioner pretends to ascend to the mountaintop and look down on the river of time as if he were the creator of all that is. ( 29 ) <p> The sense that order and structure in nature is malleable and can be reshaped by humans is part of the approach of experimental science . Within its own sphere , such engagement with and reshaping of nature seems to be a legitimate human activity . But if there is no corresponding effort to discern the order and beauty of the world as it is , then humans have taken over the role of creators who will try to reshape reality in their own image . The sense of wonder and awe at reality outside of them is ignored . In a world governed by technological values , instrumental reason is more important than reason that helps humans to find their place within a larger order given to them . Integration is shortchanged in favor of manipulation . The form of knowing that comes from contemplation is dismissed in favor of the kind of knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world where the primary motivating and guiding force for seeking reality is skepticism rather than love . <p> The Catholic thinker is an embodied human being . This person has been baptized into Christ and so is part of the Body of Christ : i.e. , the transcendent glorified Christ and the visible Body of Christ in the Church. ( 31 ) The divine and human elements of this body form a force field upon which the drama of salvation is enacted. ( 32 ) The human subject - the Catholic thinker - tries to navigate these conflicting forces of self-centered and Christ-centered existence as the way to come to live in the truth ( Rom 8:3-11 ) . The life of the Catholic and the Catholic 's search for truth disintegrates if self-centered existence is given full sway . The mystery of the human person , the mystery of the universe , and the mystery of God are focused for the Catholic Christian in the dynamic interplay of the divine and human natures in the person of Christ . Christ becoming incarnate is the center of reality for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic life provides the context for reason to function creatively in response to the world given to us . The challenge of the Incarnation requires the cooperation of faith and reason . <p> Thinking is indispensable to the full development of the Catholic Christian. ( 33 ) The engagement of the thinking subject with the objects of creation brings a greater measure of fulfillment to each . Even the tiniest gnat contains within it the inexhaustible mystery of being. ( 34 ) The object reveals dimensions of its being , but the object offers no full disclosure of its being to the thinking subject . The subject is not sovereign in this engagement . The subject who is drawn in wonder and love to an object will allow that object to reveal aspects of its being in a way different than a subject that wishes to exploit the object and wring its secrets from it. ( 35 ) The embodied subject knows that even his or her own body is not completely at his or her own disposal and contains mysteries that elude analysis . The Catholic tradition , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying attention to the body and for directing it. ( 36 ) The challenge of integration and balance of conflicting forces or elements is most immediate in one 's own body . By analogy , this same challenge of balance and integration of diverse members presents itself to the Catholic Church which is understood as a body through the incorporation of its members into the transcendent , yet immanent body of Christ . <h> The Relationship of the Tradition of the Academy to the Catholic Tradition <p> The Catholic tradition shapes the vision of the church . This tradition includes both the content of what is handed on and the actual process of handing it on . Since the twelfth century universities in the Western world have come to play an important role in the unfolding of this tradition . To seize on what is partial or to freeze an aspect of what has been handed on and absolutize it as if it captured the entire mystery of God is what von Balthasar refers to as a " scandal " where the finite claims the place of the infinite. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the parts cohere and interrelate can not afford to devolve into a wooden ideology in which the system becomes an end in itself . The Incarnation points to the manifestation of Christ throughout history into the present . The engagement with the living Christ lies at the heart of Catholic theology such that the poetry of this encounter challenges the logic of any dogmatic system. ( 38 ) Doxology or wonder before the mysteries in creation helps Catholic thinking remain true to its calling . <p> The first universities in Europe in the twelfth century were shaped in fundamental ways by the union of professors. ( 39 ) The teachers at the law school of Bologna organized as a guild that had criteria and a process for admitting teachers to their ranks . The professors were at the beck and call of the students , but gained a measure of stability in their occupation by their connection with the city government that tried to keep the professors from moving to other locations. ( 40 ) The university of Paris grew out of the cathedral school of Notre Dame. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local bishop , but was not part of the guild of professors . When the chancellor made attempts to gain control over the guild of professors , the Holy See intervened and prevented him from doing so . From their inception , universities were independent corporate bodies that needed to communicate and cooperate with the ecclesiastical and political authorities of their time. ( 42 ) <p> Academic fields develop methodologies to search for the knowledge needed to understand a particular aspect of nature or society . As each field advances , the growth in data and in the steps of the method result in greater specialization . Such growth has brought great benefits to society , but the shadow side of these positive developments is the fragmentation of knowledge. ( 43 ) In many areas , the need to work across disciplines has been identified as an important way to advance knowledge and solve problems. ( 44 ) <p> The larger view of the connection between various disciplines admits of no easy solutions in the modern university . The slogans of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end " indicate that theology and metaphysics have been discredited in the academy as disciplines that offer a rational approach to the integration of knowledge . The scientific approach to history , when taken to its logical extreme , results in fragmentation of the type celebrated by postmodernism. ( 45 ) The articulation of a metaphysics that will engage diverse , wide-ranging contemporary audiences often appears to be almost impossible . Yet it is this effort to understand the level beyond the particular which is reason 's contribution to integrating the rich , diverse world given to us . From the Catholic perspective , faith and love provide an important groundwork within which tradition and reason can operate so as to articulate a dynamic worldview that communicates the truth about the order within nature. ( 46 ) <p> Augustine and Aquinas both identified evil as a lack of due good. ( 47 ) Where evil appears , it should not be addressed as a force to be obliterated but rather as something to be ignored ( cf. Matt 5:39-42 ) . ( 48 ) Von Balthasar speaks of sin as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation. ( 49 ) The metaphysical understanding of evil as a lack of due good stands in tension with the more existential understanding of Saint Paul who speaks of a battle raging within the heart of the Christian ( Rom 8:3-11 ) . But if one transfers an existential understanding of evil as an independent force to a metaphysical level , then one has moved into a dualistic view of the world which compromises the Christian belief that Christ has conquered evil through his death and resurrection . The Catholic disavowal of a metaphysical battle between good and evil has profound consequences on the shaping of one 's imagination and self-understanding in the world . A dualistic worldview leads to distortions in the use of time and energy on both an individual and a collective level . The demythologization of evil aims to limit the amount of energy and attention to be devoted to combating evil . <p> On the other hand , the intensity and pervasiveness of evil lends credence to the existential understanding of evil as a demonic force or forces. ( 50 ) This use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been part of Jesus 's way of understanding the dynamics of sin and brokenness . The ascetical struggles of early monks used the language about demons to describe the forces of disintegration within themselves and their communities. ( 51 ) Evil has a more sinister face when imagined as demons that try to undermine the good . A person needs to be more vigilant in a world where one can be attacked by demons in the form of temptations , diseases , and calamities . <p> Fragmentation and ideological battles may be lamented as unfortunate dimensions of communal life and , in serious cases , as sinful . Von Balthasar claims that " Love vanquishes its opponent less through acuteness than through fullness . " ( 52 ) The Catholic approach which aims for unity and universality counsels the cultivation of love for nature , for others , and especially for God . It is such love or other-directedness that will allow the subject to respect one 's own experience and the unique experiences of others but at the same time will not see this individuality as disruptive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems in the Catholic tradition , for Christ has united heaven and earth through his dying and rising and all creatures are called to recognize Jesus as " the way , the truth , and the life " ( John 14:6 ) . ( 53 ) <p> The place of disagreement , debate , and dissent in the Catholic community is best assessed within this larger commitment to the primacy of love . The concern for others and the readiness to stay with intractable problems over the long-run are fundamental to the Catholic tradition . Withdrawal and fission are not tactics that find legitimacy in the Catholic tradition -- except as part of specific , tactical maneuvers . The schisms that have split the universal church are a source of scandal and can not be viewed as legitimate expressions of the particularity of peoples and circumstances. ( 54 ) The tightrope walk involved in expressing one 's convictions about the truth over controversial issues should not be re-imagined as a level playing field in which withdrawal or secession is a legitimate or honorable option -- except in extreme circumstances when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one follow the data and the argument of the issue at hand and reach conclusions in accord with the evidence . Any positions in conflict with the data should be reexamined . This freedom to follow the argument in a disciplinary area may come into conflict with the Catholic tradition . From the perspective of the magisterium , the dissenting investigator is out of step with the more inclusive , fundamental truth of the Catholic tradition. ( 55 ) Sometimes the conflict between the magisterium and the investigator is one that can be resolved only through the passage of time and a shift in the complex circumstances that influence the discernment of the parties to the dispute . The Galileo affair is a well-known example. ( 56 ) The magisterium has a duty to assess the impact of theories and hypotheses on the well-being of the Catholic community and can not simply allow innovative teachings to be broadcast throughout the Church and thereafter to deal with the negative , disruptive consequences . <p> Cardinal Ratzinger counsels that published findings should be understandable by the typical member of the congregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightly understood , is not esoteric but readily comprehensible. ( 57 ) Such a claim has more to do with the truths of the Catholic faith than with the hypotheses of specialized studies . So the question of how scholars and researchers can freely pursue their investigations within a Catholic institution of higher learning remains an important concern. ( 58 ) <p> Catholic institutions need scholars and researchers in all fields , including theology , to pursue their investigations so that they are attentive to the data and allow reason to guide them. ( 59 ) The attention to the needs of the church in order to promote the well-being of the body of believers sets limits to these investigations. ( 60 ) How are these limits articulated ? Who is the voice of these limits ? These points provoke much controversy , so much so that some will regard a Catholic university as an oxymoron . However , no institution gives a completely free slate to any individual to do as he or she wishes . Critical to this debate over the freedom within an academic institution is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is safeguarded. ( 61 ) For in the Catholic tradition , the human person is not understood as an isolated will guided by intelligence but rather as a social being related to all of reality. ( 62 ) Catholic institutions need to encourage debate , even on the most controversial issues . Such debate will lead opposing sides to become more informed about one another 's views and , in the long run , can promote a greater appreciation of the complexity of the created world . The mystery of Christ as revealed in creation and to creatures is a superabundant , all-encompassing reality that is continually unfolding . Careful research and free debate is essential for advance of knowledge . On some issues which have an immediate pastoral impact , the magisterium will intervene to direct the discussion. ( 63 ) <p> Reason is integral to the human person and has played an honorable role in the Catholic intellectual tradition . In our times , radical skeptics discount the possibility of reason 's capacity to attain truth. ( 64 ) The Catholic tradition , grounded in love and faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about objective reality that many philosophers and theoreticians are reluctant to make . The Catholic tradition , with strong voices such as that of Augustine , honors subjectivity as an arena for the disclosure of important truths , but the objective world is also an area in which truth can be made manifest and known . The methodical doubt or systematic skepticism of epistemologists and theorists who have severed the connection between the knower and the known are , from the vantage point of the Catholic tradition , alienated seekers of truth who are driven more by abstract questioning rather than drawn by wondering love in their search for truth . <h> Development Within the Catholic Intellectual Tradition <p> The fundamental reality of the incarnate Christ who is both Creator and Redeemer is grasped by the Christian community as a mystery alive in its experience . The depth and richness of this mystery unfolds within the Catholic tradition . This mystery will never be completely disclosed to humans for Christ engages humans in the dynamics of love and thinking that involve both disclosure and retreat. ( 65 ) The mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mastered , just as personal relationships between friends are not realities to be controlled . <p> In the early Christian centuries , the challenge of understanding Christ as both God and man demanded the use of Greek terms , such as that of homoousios , to maintain that Jesus did not forfeit his divinity by becoming human . The view that God the Father was unchanging was axiomatic throughout the formative early Christian centuries. ( 66 ) Such an ontological claim originated in the Greek tradition and became an important means in the Christian tradition for expressing the transcendence of God . By contrast , the Hebrew tradition emphasized the constancy and fidelity of God 's relationship with the Israelites and so readily referred to God as one who might change his stance in a given particular set of circumstances for the sake of the covenantal relationship . The practice of the Christian community 's borrowing from classical culture illustrates that the Christian and Catholic tradition grows up and lives within the cultures of the world . These cultures express important truths about nature and socio-political life that help Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its stance within the mystery of the incarnate Christ , the Catholic tradition values the truths of other cultures but recontextualizes them within the more fundamental mystery of Christ . <p> In the eleventh and twelfth centuries , the works of Aristotle were reintroduced into the European and western world from the Islamic schools where they had been preserved and studied since they were taken over from the Syriac schools of the eastern Roman Empire of the early Christian centuries. ( 68 ) The Catholic tradition in Europe until the eleventh century was shaped largely by the reflection upon the scriptures and supplemented in the early centuries by Neoplatonic and Stoic philosophies. ( 69 ) The bulk of Aristotle 's works had not been not available to the cathedral and monastic schools of Europe . In 1277 , the Church placed a ban on Aristotle 's works , which only served to increase the study of them for it was necessary to know what one was condemning. ( 70 ) <p> As Aristotle 's works gained attention , more credence was given to his theory of knowledge that humans must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 71 ) The data of the senses became much more important . Through the senses , the human knower can perceive the form of the object . The form of the object is constitutive of knowledge ; it is the form that individuals talk about , and it is this which takes shape in the imagination and memory of the individual and is true insofar as it corresponds to the form of the object in creation. ( 72 ) By contrast for Plato , the true reality was the form which existed in the transcendent , invisible realm and the material object was a mere shadow of that true reality of forms . For Aquinas ( 1226-74 ) , the true form is in the material object and needs to be perceived by the knower . Furthermore , Aquinas claimed that the matter of an object individualized the object and so gave material reality an important place in his worldview , even though matter itself is unknowable. ( 73 ) Aquinas ' epistemology promotes a more empirical approach to gaining knowledge. ( 74 ) <p> The claim that the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an image of that form in his/her mind locates the act of knowing in the exchange between the observer and the external world . The truth about the object is found in the correspondence between the image in the mind and the object external to the observer . Aquinas claims that the observer reaches some reality external to his imagination and can say that he knows something beyond than what he makes in his imagination . The imagination plays a key role in the act of knowing but the knowledge gained is not simply a fabrication of the imagination . Commonsense knowledge affirms such a principle . Scientific investigation demands that an experiment can be duplicated by other scientists in order to achieve similar results . There is an objective world there even though our capacity to know it is incomplete . As Aquinas makes the claim that the form of an object is given and is to be discovered , he is saying that creation is not simply moist clay to be shaped at will by a human knower . When the object of investigation is a human being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and is not simply shaped by the forces of history . This claim is in accord with his conviction that nature has an order inherent in it and aspects of this order can be perceived by a reasonable person without the assistance of faith. ( 75 ) <p> The recovery of Aristotle could not have taken place without the Islamic culture . Likewise , the capacity of Catholic scholars to carry out text criticism was greatly enhanced by the assistance of Jewish scholars who had worked closely with scriptural and talmudic texts and their transmission . The history of the high middle ages attests to substantial exchange between Catholic , Jewish , and Islamic scholars. ( 76 ) In the Islamic world , the religious establishment did not draw upon Aristotelian philosophy to complement the knowledge revealed in the Koran . The Islamic scholars devoted to Aristotelian works came from other professions such as medicine and law. ( 77 ) The textual and linguistic expertise of the Jewish scholars was a distinctive scholarly enterprise ; ( 78 ) to an extent it was complemented by philosophical efforts of thinkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Christian cultures are traditional : their basic values and vision have been shaped in the past and continuity is a higher value than change . Even though these cultures recognize the need to adapt and develop , their bias has been towards continuity rather than toward innovation . So the communication between thinkers of these cultures tends to be aimed at conserving their distinctive heritages and at times clarifying their positions or doctrines by contrasting them with those of other cultures ( i.e. , apologetics ) . ( 80 ) <p> The rise of universities in Italy , France , and England in the high middle ages marks the new value placed upon learning in the humanities and sciences . In monastic orders , the danger of classical rhetoric and learning to the monk in his search for God was frequently expressed. ( 81 ) With the formation of the universities , theology was still the queen of the sciences , but the other areas of inquiry grew in significance . Aquinas ' efforts to demonstrate the existence of God from observation of order in nature exemplify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain truth. ( 82 ) Reason , as exercised by those outside of the Catholic tradition , could reach significant truths about nature and the world that would be valuable to the Catholic community. ( 83 ) Such truths could complement the truths of scripture and tradition whose validity was demonstrated by the grace-filled life of Christian communities . <p> Dialectic was an important art operative in medieval universities since the time of Peter Abelard ( 1079-1142 ) . ( 84 ) The scholastic method of posing a question and then disputing the pros and cons on it became a standard pedagogical tool. ( 85 ) This same method is evident in Aquinas ' work . Debate and argument is prized in this setting . Aquinas is celebrated as the highly intelligent synthesizer who was able to bring the thought of Aristotle into harmony with the scripture and tradition of Christianity . As a knowing subject , Aquinas not only had to be attentive to the data of nature and Aristotle 's thinking about this , he also had to recognize that he was thinking out of and on behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its values and vision. ( 86 ) Debate and conflict played an important role in Aquinas ' search for truth but were not ends-in-themselves . As with Augustine , it was important for the knower to gain at least a portion of the truth in order to guide and sustain the search. ( 87 ) Aquinas saw skepticism in the service of the love which drew the knower to want to find the truth . Aquinas seems to have had an intuitive vision of how the world fit together , for Brian Davies claims that Aquinas articulates all the major conclusions of his worldview in his first work. ( 88 ) It is as if the bulk of his work was devoted to unfolding the richness of that vision . <p> The Catholic tradition had from the very beginning drawn upon and distinguished itself from classical culture and Judaism . Integral to a tradition is a foundational event . To keep the memory of this event alive , the event must be re-presenced in each generation and sustained in an ongoing way . Anthropologists claim that such a memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eigentlich gewesen . Rather humans tend to remember previous tellings of events , even if they were present for the actual event . To remember and re-articulate a re-telling points out that the original event contains a richness that no observer could fully articulate in one telling . So in subsequent re-tellings individuals elaborate on aspects of the event that they have gained from subsequent reflection . All of these reflections and elaborations are legitimate dimensions of the rich , polyvalence of the original event. ( 89 ) <p> The Reformers initiated an important process of purification within the church . The fruits of their criticisms are still unfolding within the church . But the scandal of schism weighs heavily on the Body of Christ. ( 90 ) How can serious debates and disagreements within the church be sustained without fission or fragmentation ? The Catholic tradition envisions the church as the Body of Christ in which the bishop of Rome exercises primacy among the bishops . The teaching , governing , and priestly authority of the bishops reaches back to the apostles . This apostolic tradition and the scriptures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's legitimate appeal to the primacy of the scriptures could not simply erase the developments of the intervening centuries. ( 91 ) The debates resulted in fission ; the balance of competing forces within the Body of Christ is difficult to maintain . How to receive the divine grace which alone can sustain unity is an important question facing a divided Christianity . <p> The Council of Trent ( 1545-63 ) set the agenda for the Catholic Church for the succeeding centuries . On doctrinal points it responded to the following issues : ( 1 ) justification by grace and the place for human works within such a claim , ( 2 ) the institution of the seven sacraments rather than three or less acknowledged by various reforming groups , ( 3 ) the authority of Scripture and Tradition. ( 92 ) Trent also called for the reform of the Catholic clergy by stating the need for seminaries for the training of those to be ordained . It took about one hundred years for such seminaries to finally take shape ( i.e. , in the mid-seventeenth century ) . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of the Catholic church since that time . Theological education has been shaped by the faculties of these seminaries who have pursued their theological research from the perspective of how their findings would be communicated to pastoral situations. ( 94 ) <p> When more scientific , skeptical approaches to scripture and traditional documents began to influence the research of seminary professors in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , tensions between the Catholic tradition and scientific research in theology began to intensify and reached crisis proportions in the events leading to the modernist crisis of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. ( 95 ) Professors in Catholic seminaries as well as pastoral leaders were required to take the anti-modernist oath . The concerns fueling such strong measures had substantial arguments in their favor ( e.g. , defense against anticlericalism and efforts aimed at undermining the doctrinal basis of Catholicism ) , ( 96 ) even though in retrospect many of the prohibited methods of research were subsequently approved . <p> For communities shaped by tradition in the way Catholic communities are , it is important that the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the community proceed at a measured pace . The vision articulated in documents is subsidiary to the living reality of Christ within the Church ; too much change may take attention away from this reality and so harm the community . Authoritative teachings within the Catholic tradition are those that have proved themselves useful and beneficial in building up the community . Time sifts through those teachings which are superficial , distracting , and harmful to the life of the Catholic community . <p> The modernist crisis still looms large with the imaginations of Catholic scholars . Biblical scholars will recall how Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch was defended in the early twentieth century , in spite of substantial evidence of multiple authorship of these books over a number of generations . The battles in Catholic circles subsequent to Pius XII 's encyclical Divino Afflante Spiritu , generally regarded as the magna charta of Catholic biblical studies , showed that scientific , historical study of sacred texts was a complex task. ( 97 ) This issue of the appropriate methodological treatment of scriptural texts still plagues biblical scholars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sacred texts by an overly positivistic use of the historical method. ( 98 ) The teaching of the Council of Trent that both scripture and tradition are necessary , rather than sola scriptura , has found new life at the beginning of the twenty-first century . <p> In any monarchy , whether of Church or State , the people have a right to ask whether the exercise of authority increases the well-being of the community or diminishes it by oppression , failing to use the gifts of the community for the common good , or any other tyrannical measures . In any case , the people 's reception of authoritative decisions will have an impact on the implementation of authoritative decisions and so on the measure of vitality or power in the Church. ( 99 ) The way in which discernment occurs in a monarchy differs from that in a democracy , for the participants in the process are not all considered equal in the monarchical arena . Even though Americans grow up in families and work in corporations where many aspects of monarchical rule are operative , Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion seems to play a minor role in decision-making . <h> Conclusion <p> The Catholic intellectual tradition is a way of thinking about God , humans , and the world in which love rather than methodical questioning is the primary motive force in drawing the thinker to discover the truth that makes all things work together for good . Just as the individual thinker has both a mind and a body in a fruitful , yet tensive interplay , so also Catholic community is a body with diverse members that complement and challenge one another . The bias in the Catholic intellectual tradition is toward wholistic thinking where unity does not equal uniformity . Questioning and debate has been part of the Catholic tradition from the beginning and is an integral part of its dynamic of " love seeking understanding . " The truths discovered by other cultures and by science , art , and other disciplines of the academy are prized by the Catholic tradition . Yet those within the Catholic intellectual tradition are convinced that faith , hope , and love in the mystery of Christ enhance our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a deeper truth , which some would claim can only be discovered by agnostic critical methods . The history of the Church and of Western civilization amply testifies to the fruitful interchange between Catholic culture and those of other faith traditions . <p> The Catholic university has an important role to play in the modern world by its capacity to promote the pursuit of knowledge directed by love rather than by power . To pursue knowledge for the sake of power leads to fragmentation of society and exploitation of nature . The freedom to learn , to research , and to teach in an environment confident of God 's care for humanity and the cosmos is a treasure perhaps undervalued by many Catholic institutions of higher education in America . The freedom of individual researchers to pay attention to the data and to allow the argument to lead them to conclusions based on the data rather than on a priori constraints is vital to the integrity of the intellectual enterprise .

@@71697931 @397931/ <p> One indication that a movement or philosophy has come of age is that its adherents no longer feel compelled to justify their existence , to ask for permission to be who they are and think as they do , to beg for acceptance on their opponents ' terms . Another sign of maturity is to move from a concentration on limited special cases to a systemic analysis , along with a willingness for serious engagement with opponents . The first of these shifts can be seen , for example , in the gay and lesbian rights movement . At one time , gay rights demonstrators chanted , " Two , four , six , eight , gay is just as good as straight . " Now , with the advent of groups like Queer Nation and ACT-UP , gay/lesbian pride activists are more likely to be heard saying , " We 're here . We 're queer . Get over it . " Feminist theology , and feminism in general , also show these marks of growth and self-assurance . The widening of scope does not mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of theory and symbol is needed if we are to have more than a Band-Aid approach to promoting justice and human wholeness . And so , as Luke Timothy Johnson points out , " the feminist theological agenda . . . has extended beyond the moral denunciation of sexist patterns in church and society to encompass an ever more explicit engagement with the central symbols of the Christian tradition " ( Rev. of She Who Is , by Elizabeth A. Johnson , Commonweal 29 Jan. 1993 : 17 ) . <p> Elizabeth Johnson 's She Who Is is evidence of this confident Christian feminism . She does not try to prove that feminism is intellectually respectable ; she assumes that her feminism needs no apology . Neither does she think it an inherent contradiction to be a Christian feminist . ( One disappointing exception is her description of conversion , pp. 62-65 . Her notion of conversion sounds much like 1970s consciousness-raising groups : women must realize they are oppressed , accept that it is okay to be female , and learn that sexism is wrong . I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the finest features of this book is that while Johnson criticizes the tradition from a feminist perspective , she also mines that tradition for its positive aspects , ideas that may actually support feminist principles . <p> One of the most striking things about this book is Johnson 's tone . She does not posture as a detached , objective observer . She is not an outsider . On the other hand , neither does she have an axe to grind . Rather , this is the view from the inside , from one who is deeply , passionately committed to faith and to feminism . Her style is " poetic and even prayerful " ( Luke Johnson 22 ) . I was moved by her description of God as " the focus of absolute trust , one to whom you can give yourself without fear of betrayal , the holy mystery " ( p. 4 ) . <p> This book is indeed wrestling with the " central symbols of the Christian tradition , " or , as Elizabeth Johnson says , " mighty concerns . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it is " talk/reasoning about God . " The author first asks whether we should talk about God at all . Has not the idea of God often been used to bless oppression ? Is not talk about God merely an opiate which allows us to engage in pointless abstract speculation and ignore pressing matters in the real world ? Johnson contends that we must talk about God because what we say of God reveals and shapes our view of all reality , and especially our highest values . Furthermore , " right speech about God is inseparable from solicitude for all creatures , and in particular for human beings " ( p. 14 ) . What we say about God is directly related to how we view--and achieve--full humanity . <p> Given , then , that we must talk about God , what is the proper way in which to do so ? It is this question which is the burden of the book . God is mystery , and can not be encapsulated in our conceptions . As Johnson points out , it is well within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and other than our analogies . In particular , we can not admit that what she calls " classical theism " has adequately described God . The picture of God as an absolute ( male ) monarch , infinitely removed from the everyday material world , omnipotent , unchanging , rational , and transcendent , bears more than a passing resemblance to the historical ideals of ruling class males , which ought to make us suspicious . Johnson does not argue for " feminine " traits in an otherwise masculine God , a female member of the Trinity , an earth goddess , or an impersonal God . She believes that we need equivalent imagery for God in male and female terms . <p> As a feminist , Johnson wishes to examine women 's experience for hints of God . This might strike some as an alarming procedure . But the God of the Bible is a God who acts in human history . God 's presence and revelation are ongoing . " It therefore seems logical to suggest that women 's experience ' also might legitimately be thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreted " ( Luke Johnson 20 ) . Elizabeth Johnson writes that " women 's awakening to their own human worth can be interpreted at the same time as a new experience of God " ( p. 62 ) . She takes a very Rahnerian approach in claiming that to know one 's deepest self is to know God . <p> Johnson 's sixth chapter , " Classical Theology , " is an especially fine exposition on the incomprehensibility and hiddenness of God . Parts of this section could have been lifted directly from The Cloud of Unknowing . Consider the following , about the God who is mystery : " The God who is utterly distinct from all creatures and hence better known intellectually by negating all symbols is nonetheless deeply known in human love , as love itself " ( p. 108 ) . <p> I have said that this book is about God . More specifically , it is about God as Trinitarian , " a treatise De Deo Trino " ( Luke Johnson 20 ) . To say that the Christian God is a Trinity seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides . However , the doctrine of the Trinity arose out of the lived experience of early Christians . Johnson attempts to find in women 's experience today some clues that would point to God as Trinity . She discusses the Biblical figure of divine Sophia as , in turn , Spirit , Jesus , and Mother . So rather than beginning with the unity of God or the first Person of the Trinity , she begins with Spirit . Two other reviewers , Luke Johnson ( 22 ) and Mary Ann Donovan ( Rev. of She Who Is , by Elizabeth A. Johnson , America 9 Jan. 1993 : 18 ) , think this is a brilliant stroke . Elizabeth Johnson believes this approach " allows a starting point more closely allied to the human experience of salvation , without which there would be no speech about the triune God at all " ( p. 122 ) . I give the author credit for daring , and it may be that the Spirit is attended by the least " baggage , " but I wonder if this is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . In theory it may be so that we could never know God without the Spirit at work in the world and in our hearts . But is our first inkling of God really purely spiritual ? Is this the way we really first experience God ? We are bodily creatures and Christianity is the incarnational religion par excellence . I think that we are more likely at first to see something , hear something , or feel something that offers us tantalizing hints that there is a mysterious something more . As in the life of Augustine , or of C.S. Lewis , the material world calls out to us : " I am not what you seek , " and , " What do I remind you of ? " So my inclination , if I were to depart from the traditional sequence , would be to talk first about how we encounter God in Jesus . I also thought this section on Spirit-Sophia was too naive in its optimism . Not everything spiritual is good , but Johnson does n't reckon seriously with evil until her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rahner 's influence . ) In these chapters on Sophia , at any rate , she does not seem to recognize the human capacity for self-deception , nor to acknowledge the possibility of spiritual evil beyond the self . These three chapters on Sophia are in very poetic , almost romantic , language . Some people may find this appealing , but I do not ; her language can be " mushy with affect " ( Luke Johnson 22 ) . <p> The patient reader will be rewarded with the final chapters , in which Johnson discusses God as a Trinity which is also a Unity , and the implications of that for praxis . She takes Rahner 's axiom that " the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity , and vice versa , " and runs with it . In Trinitarian theology , subordinationism is heretical . Therefore we must get beyond the false alternatives of dominating " power over " or victimization . " Self-containment and the absence of relationship are not necessarily the highest perfections but signify lack " ( p. 252 ) . To speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real is relationship marked by equality and love . Such relationality , like the bond of friendship , destroys neither unity nor distinctiveness . <p> Despite the qualms I have mentioned above , I would recommend this book , especially to those who have some background in theology and who are interested in feminism . This could also be stimulating for those who are looking for fresh ways to understand Trinitarian theology . Although those who are familiar with feminist theology may wish to skip the first few chapters , what Johnson does with the Chalcedonian definition of Christological orthodoxy is unusual ( p. 35--now that 's a brilliant stroke ! ) . As a specimen of unashamed Christian feminism , Johnson 's She Who Is may do for Trinitarian theology what Elisabeth Schnssler Fiorenza 's In Memory of Her did for early church history .

Thus , they may soften and redirect their hostility , typically by employing the mechanisms of rationalization , sublimation , and projection , all of which lend themselves in some fashion to finding plausible and socially acceptable excuses for less than admirable impulses and actions . Thus , blunt directness may be rationalized as signifying frankness and honesty , a lack of hypocrisy , and a willingness to face issues head on .

When emotionally deflated , their air of nonchalance and imperturbability quickly turns to edgy irritability and annoyance .

They view themselves as having unique and special qualities , deserving of great admiration and entitled to unusual rights and privileges . Accordingly , they often act in a pompous or grandiose manner , often in the absence of commensurate achievements . Some of these individuals may exhibit a messianic self-perception ; those failing to pay proper respect or bend to their will typically are treated with scorn and contempt .

The core diagnostic features of the unconscious regulatory ( i.e. , ego-defense ) mechanisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirable self-image is challenged or their confidence shaken , they maintain equilibrium with facile self-deceptions , devising plausible reasons to justify their self-centered and socially inconsiderate behaviors . They rationalize their difficulties , offering alibis to put themselves in a positive light despite evident shortcomings and failures . When rationalization fails , they turn to fantasy to assuage their feelings of dejection , shame , or emptiness , redeem themselves , and reassert their pride and status . ( Millon , 1996 , p. 407 ) <p> Object representations . The core diagnostic feature of the internalized object representations of Ambitious individuals is their contrived nature ; the inner imprint of significant early experiences that serves as a substrate of dispositions ( i.e. , templates ) for perceiving and reacting to current life events , consists of illusory and changing memories . Consequently , problematic experiences are refashioned to appear consonant with their high sense of self-worth , and unacceptable impulses and deprecatory evaluations are transmuted into more admirable images and percepts . ( Millon , 1996 , pp. 406407 ) <p> Morphologic organization . The core diagnostic feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior design of the personality system , so to speak , is essentially counterfeit , or bogus . Owing to the misleading nature of their early experiences characterized by the ease with which good things came to them these individuals may lack the inner skills necessary for regulating their impulses , channeling their needs , and resolving conflicts . Accordingly , commonplace demands may be viewed as annoying incursions and routine responsibilities as pedestrian or demeaning . Excuses and justifications are easily mustered and serve to perpetuate selfish behaviors and exploitative , duplicitous social conduct . ( Millon , 1996 , pp. 407408 ) <h> MIDC Scale 1B : The Dauntless Pattern <p> The Dauntless pattern , as do all personality patterns , occurs on a continuum ranging from normal to maladaptive . At the well-adjusted pole are adventurous , individualistic , venturesome personalities . Exaggerated Dauntless features occur in unconscientious , risk-taking , dissenting personalities . In its most deeply ingrained , inflexible form , the Dauntless pattern displays itself in reckless , irresponsible , self-aggrandizing behavior patterns that may be consistent with a clinical diagnosis of antisocial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 , pp. 227228 ) , the following eight traits and behaviors are reliable clues to the presence of an Adventurous style : <p> Nonconformity . Live by their own internal code of values ; not strongly influenced by the norms of society . <p> Challenge . Routinely engage in high-risk activities . <p> Mutual independence . Not overly concerned about others ; expect each individual to be responsible for him- or herself . <p> Persuasiveness . " Silver-tongued " charmers talented in the art of social influence . <p> Wanderlust . Like to keep moving ; live by their talents , skills , ingenuity , and wits . <p> Wild oats . History of childhood and adolescent mischief and hell-raising . <p> True grit . Courageous , physically bold , and tough . <p> No regrets . Live in the present ; do not feel guilty about the past or anxious about the future . <p> Millon ( 1996 ) , in examining the developmental background of so-called " socially sublimated antisocials " ( p. 462 ) , asserts that their experiential history is often characterized by secondary status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only in socially underprivileged families or underclass communities that we see the emergence of antisocial individuals . The key problem for all has been their failure to experience the feeling of being treated fairly and having been viewed as a person/child of value in the family context . Such situations occur in many middle- and upper-middle class families . Here , parents may have given special attention to another sibling who was admired and highly esteemed , at least in the eyes of the " deprived " youngster . ( p. 462 ) <p> Millons personality patterns have well-established diagnostic indicators associated with each of the eight attribute domains of expressive behavior , interpersonal conduct , cognitive style , mood/temperament , self-image , regulatory mechanisms , object-representations , and morphologic organization . The diagnostic features of the Dauntless pattern with respect to each of these attribute domains are summarized below . <p> Expressive behavior . Dauntless personalities are typically adventurous , fearless , and daring , attracted by challenge and undeterred by personal risk . They do things their own way and are willing to take the consequences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failing to plan ahead or heed consequences , making spur-of-the-moment decisions without carefully considering alternatives . This penchant for shooting from the hip can signify boldness and the courage of ones convictions as easily as it may constitute shortsighted imprudence and poor judgment . ( Millon , 1996 , pp. 444445 , 449450 ; Millon &amp; Davis , 1998 , p. 164 ) <p> Interpersonal conduct . Dauntless personalities are rugged individualists , not compromisers or conciliators . They take clear stands on the issues that matter , backed up by the self-confidence and personal skills and talents to prevail . Though generally jovial and convivial , they become confrontational and defiant when obstructed or crossed . ( Millon , 1996 , pp. 445446 , 449450 ; Millon &amp; Davis , 1998 , p. 164 ) <p> Cognitive style . Dauntless personalities are original , independent-minded , and unconventional . At their best , these personalities are enterprising , innovative , and creative . They are nonconformists first and foremost , disdainfuleven contemptuousof traditional ideals and values . Moreover , Dauntless personalities shirk orthodoxy and typically believe that too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1996 , pp. 446447 , 449450 ; Millon &amp; Davis , 1998 , p. 164 ) <p> Mood/temperament . Dauntless personalities are untroubled and easygoing , but quickly become irritable and aggressive when crossed . They are cool , calm , and collected under pressure , restless and disgruntled when restricted or confined . They are tough-minded and unsentimental . They display their feelings openly and directly . ( Millon , 1996 , pp. 448449 , 449450 ; Millon &amp; Davis , 1998 , p. 164 ) <p> Self-image . Dauntless personalities are self-confident , with a corresponding view of themselves as self-sufficient and autonomous . They pride themselves on their independence , competence , strength , and their ability to prevail without social support , and they expect the same of others ( Millon , 1996 , pp. 447 , 449450 ; Millon &amp; Davis , 1998 , p. 164 ) <p> Regulatory mechanisms . Dauntless personalities are unconstrained . They express their impulses directly , often in rash and precipitous fashion , and generally without regret or remorse . They rarely refashion their thoughts and actions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 448 ) <p> Object representations . Dauntless personalities are driven by restive impulses to discredit established cultural ideals and mores , yet are skilled in arrogating for themselves what material spoils they can garner from society . They are fundamentally driven by self-serving motives . ( Millon , 1996 , p. 447 ) <p> Morphologic organization . The inner drives and impulses of Dauntless personalities are unruly , recalcitrant , and rebellious , which gives rise to unfettered self-expression , a marked intolerance of delay or frustration , and low thresholds for emotional discharge , particularly those of a hostile nature . ( Millon , 1996 , p. 448 ) <h> MIDC Scale 9 : The Distrusting Pattern <p> The Distrusting pattern , conceptually a decompensated , structurally defective extension of primarily the Dominant , Dauntless , Ambitious , and Conscientious patterns , has no normal variant . According to Millon ( 1996 ) , <p> it is hard to conceive of normal paranoids . Although a number of these individuals restrain their markedly distorted beliefs and assumptions from public view , at no point does their fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful personality style . ( p. 705 ) <p> The Distrusting pattern occurs on a continuum ranging from maladaptive to markedly disturbed . At the relatively adaptive pole are overly defensive , sullen , quarrelsome , highly suspicious personalities . In its most deeply ingrained , markedly disturbed form , the Distrusting pattern manifests itself in provocative , irascible , inviolable , paranoid behavior patterns that may be consistent with a clinical diagnosis of paranoid personality disorder . <p> Oldham and Morris ( 1995 ) , with their Vigilant style , attempt to describe an adaptive version of this pattern : <p> Nothing escapes the notice of . . . people who have a Vigilant personality style . These individuals possess an exceptional awareness of their environment . . . . Their sensory antennae , continuously scanning the people and situations around them , alert them immediately to what is awry , out of place , dissonant , or dangerous , especially in their dealings with other people . Vigilant types have a special kind of hearing . They are immediately aware of mixed messages , the hidden motivations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that elude or delude less gifted observers . With such a focus , Vigilant individuals naturally assume the roles of social critic , watchdog , ombudsman , and crusader in their private or our public domain , ready to spring upon the improprieties especially the abuses of power that poison human affairs . ( p. 157 ) <p> This style , essentially , is equivalent to the less maladaptive , suspicious variant of the MIDCs ( Immelman , 1999 ; Immelman &amp; Steinberg , 1999 ) Distrusting pattern . In addition , the portion Oldham and Morriss ( 1995 ) description pertaining to hypervigilance ( " scanning the people and situations around them " ) overlaps with the " insecure " variant of the MIDCs Reticent pattern , whereas the reference to the crusader role in society incorporates aspects of both the Conscientious and Dominant patterns . <p> Drawing from Blaneys ( 1999 ) catalogue of traits associated with paranoid conditions , paranoid individuals particularly those who also have a strong narcissistic orientation over time are likely to become increasingly mistrustful , suspicious , and vigilant ; thin-skinned ( hypersensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; vengeful ( determined to " balance the books " with respect to what they perceive as past wrongs ) ; dichotomous ( " us versus them " social perception ) ; self-contained ( impervious to corrective action in response to advice and new information ) ; self-righteous ( arrogant and acting with a sense of entitlement ) ; and self-justifying ( viewing their own transgressions either as a defensive necessity or as " payback " for the malevolence or wrongs of others ) . <p> Expressive behavior . The core diagnostic feature of the expressive acts of Distrusting individuals is their defensiveness ; they are distrustful and overly suspicious , firmly resistant to external influence and control . Individuals with the most extreme manifestation of this pattern are extraordinarily vigilant ; they scan the environment for potential threat , perpetually alert to , anticipating , and ready to ward off expected deception , derogation , and malice . ( Millon , 1996 , p. 701 ) <p> Interpersonal conduct . The core diagnostic feature of the interpersonal conduct of Distrusting individuals is their quarrelsomeness ; they are polemical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they do not forgive insults and carry grudges . Individuals with the most extreme manifestation of this pattern are acrimonious ; they are abrasive and vexatious . Prone to harassment and provocation , they precipitate anger and hostility with their persistent testing of loyalties and their intrusive , searching preoccupation with hidden motives in others . ( Millon , 1996 , pp. 701702 ) <p> Cognitive Style . The core diagnostic feature of the cognitive style of Distrusting individuals is suspicion ; they are highly and unreasonably mistrustful of the motives of others . Individuals who display the most pronounced variant of this pattern display an unequivocally paranoid cognitive style ; they characteristically construe innocuous events as signifying hidden or conspiratorial intent and reveal a pervasive tendency to magnify tangential or minor social difficulties into proofs of duplicity , malice , and treachery . ( Millon , 1996 , pp. 702703 ) <p> Mood/temperament . The core diagnostic feature of the characteristic mood and temperament of Distrusting individuals is their sullen demeanor ; although they may attempt to present themselves as unemotional and objective , they are fundamentally humorless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond with anger . The most extreme variants of this pattern are utterly irascible ; they are incorrigibly churlish and thin-skinned . Characteristically cold , sullen , and fractious , they seem constantly on edge , consumed by jealousy , envy , and resentment . ( Millon , 1996 , pp. 704705 ) <p> Self-image . The core diagnostic feature of the self-perception of Distrusting individuals is their formidable view of themselves ; they lack self-doubt and are pridefully independent , which makes them reluctant to confide in or accept advice from others . Highly insular , they experience an intense fear of losing their identity , status , and power of self-determination . The most extreme variants of this pattern harbor a self-perception of inviolability ; they have persistent ideas of reference and self-importance . Frequently perceiving character attacks not discernible to others , entirely innocuous actions and events frequently are considered personally derogatory and scurrilous , if not libelous . ( Millon , 1996 , p. 703 ) <p> Object representations . The core diagnostic feature of the internalized object representations of Distrusting individuals is their inalterability ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substrate of dispositions ( i.e. , templates ) for perceiving and reacting to current life events , constitute a fixed and implacable configuration of deeply held beliefs and attitudes . Unyielding convictions are aligned idiosyncratically with a fixed hierarchy of tenaciously held , but unwarranted assumptions , fears , and conjectures . ( Millon , 1996 , p. 703 ) <p> Morphologic organization . The core diagnostic feature of the morphological organization of Distrusting individuals is its inelasticity ; systematic constriction and inflexibility of undergirding morphologic structures , as well as rigidly fixed channels of defensive coping , conflict mediation , and need gratification , create an overstrung and taut frame that is so uncompromising in its accommodation to changing circumstances that unanticipated stressors are likely to precipitate either explosive outbursts or inner shatterings . ( Millon , 1996 , pp. 704 ) <p> Summary and Formulation : The Malevolent Psychopath <p> With his core sadistic personality pattern , infused with antisocial and narcissistic features and a possible overlay of incipient paranoia , Eric Harris appears to be a close match for a malignant personality composite that Millon ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1998 , pp. 168169 and Millon &amp; Davis , 2000 , pp. 112113 ) has labeled the malevolent antisocial . <p> Millon ( 1996 ) describes the malevolent antisocial as follows : <p> This subtype epitomizes the least attractive of the antisocial variants because it includes individuals who are especially vindictive and hostile . Their impulse toward retribution is discharged in a hateful and destructive defiance of conventional social life . Distrustful of others and anticipating betrayal and punishment , they have acquired a cold-blooded ruthlessness , an intense desire to gain revenge for the real or imagined mistreatment to which they were subjected in childhood . Here we see a sweeping rejection of tender emotions and a deep suspicion that the goodwill efforts expressed by others are merely ploys to deceive and undo them . They assume a chip-on-the-shoulder attitude , a readiness to lash out at those whom they distrust or those whom they can use as scapegoats for their seething impulse to destroy . Descriptively , we may summarize their traits with the following adjectives : belligerent , mordant , rancorous , vicious , malignant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are distinctively fearless and guiltless , inclined to anticipate and search out betrayal and punitiveness on the part of others . The primary antisocial characteristics of these individuals may be seen as features that blend with either or both the paranoid or sadistic personality , reflecting not only a deep sense of deprivation and a desire for compensatory retribution , but intermingling within them an intense suspiciousness and hostility . <p> Dreading that others may view them as weak , or may manipulate them into submission , they rigidly maintain an image of hard-boiled strength , carrying themselves truculently and acting tough , callous , and fearless . To prove their courage , they may even court danger and punishment . But punishment will only verify their anticipation of unjust treatment . Rather than being a deterrent , it may reinforce their rebelliousness and their desire for retribution . In positions of power , they often brutalize others to confirm their self-image of strength . If faced with persistent failure , beaten down in efforts to dominate and control others , or finding aspirations far outdistancing their luck , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount to a moderate level , rarely to a point where their controls give way to a raw brutality and vengeful hostility , as is seen in the tyrannical sadist . Spurred by repeated rejection and driven by an increasing need for power and retribution , their aggressive impulses will , however , surge into the open . At these times , their behaviors may become outrageously and flagrantly antisocial . Not only will they show minimal guilt or remorse for what they have done , but they are likely to display an arrogant contempt for the rights of the others . <p> What distinguishes the malevolent antisocial from the tyrannical sadist is the formers capacity to understand guilt and remorse , if not necessarily to experience it . They are capable of giving a perfectly rational explanation of ethical concepts , that is , they know what is right and what is wrong , but they seem incapable of feeling it . We can not ascertain whether this experiential deficit is constitutionally built in or consequential to deficiencies in early learning . Nevertheless , there appears to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongness of their actions . As with the tyrannical sadist , these antisocials may come to relish menacing others , to make them cower and withdraw . They are combative and seek to bring more pressure on their opponents than their opponents are willing to tolerate or to bring against them . Most make few concessions , are inclined to escalate as far as necessary , never letting go until others succumb . In contrast to the tyrannical sadist , however , malevolent antisocials recognize the limits of what can be done in their own self-interests . They do not lose self-conscious awareness of their actions and will press forward only if their goals of self-aggrandizement are likely to be achieved . Their adversarial stance is often contrived , a bluffing mechanism to ensure that others will back off . Infrequently are actions taken that may lead to a misjudgment and counterreaction in these matters . ( pp. 453454 ) <p> Millon and Davis ( 2000 ) describe the malevolent antisocial as follows : <p> As a blend of the antisocial and paranoid or sadistic personalities , malevolents are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malignant , brutal , callous , vengeful , and vindictive , they perform actions charged with a hateful and destructive defiance of conventional social life . Like the paranoid , they anticipate betrayal and punishment . Rather than merely issue verbal threats , however , they seek to secure their boundaries with a cold-blooded ruthlessness that avenges every mistreatment they believe others have inflicted on them in the past . For them , tender emotions are a sign of weakness . The goodwill of others is never genuine , but instead hides a deceptive ploy for which they must always be on their guard . Where sadistic traits are prominent , they may display a chip-on-the-shoulder attitude and a willingness to confirm their strong self-image by victimizing those too weak to retaliate or those whose terror might prove particularly entertaining . When confronted with displays of strength , malevolents are experts at the art of posturing and enjoy pressuring their opponents until they cower and withdraw . Most make few concessions , and instead escalate confrontations as far as necessary , backing down only when clearly outgunned . ( pp. 112113 )

Recent classification systems suggest that these organisms , in addition to the red algae and green algae , should be classified in the Plant Kingdom ( Plantae ) . <p> II . What is the single most important characteristic that distinguishes plants from other organisms ? Autotrophic nutrition ! That 's my guess , too . We should recognize that a systematist ( scientists who study classification systems ) familiar with the most recent notions of classification might disagree since members of a " new " kingdom , Chromista , are also photosynthetic autotrophs .

This event set in motion the evolutionary events that culminated in modern plants . Therefore , plant characteristics can be explained as a direct or indirect consequence of the autotrophic mode of nutrition . <p> A. Problem : Photosynthesis is a complicated biochemical process . In order for photosynthesis to function properly and efficiently , it was necessary to separate these reactions from the countless others that occur in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this process - chloroplasts . Even within the chloroplast , specialization was required . Recall that there are three major regions within the chloroplast - the stroma , inner membrane , and inter-membrane space . Each of these three regions are important for the functioning of photosynthesis . Electron transfer reactions require the highly ordered environment provided by the inner membrane . The Calvin cycle ( light-independent reactions ) are aqueous biochemical reactions which occur in the stroma and the inter-membrane space is needed to generate the pH gradient that is important for photophosphorylation ( ATP production ) . <p> B. Problem : Photosynthesis requires efficient light harvesting . Leaves are perfect solar collectors . These organs are broad and flat to allow for efficient light harvest . The leaves are broad to maximize surface area for light harvest and they are thin since light can not penetrate too deeply into the leaf ( the amount of light decreases exponentially with distance ) . As an aside , although the majority of light is absorbed near the leaf surface , in some situations , plant tissues can act like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant body . <p> Even within the thin leaf , most chloroplasts are found in the upper layer of cells , the palisade layer or palisade mesophyll , which is a tissue layer just beneath the upper epidermis of the leaf . This makes " sense " since these cells will be receiving the greatest amount of light of any region in the leaf . This is an example of specialization at the tissue and cellular level . <p> C. Problem : Photosynthesis requires an apparatus for gas exchange . Leaves also serve as a means to exchange photosynthetic gases ( take up carbon dioxide and get rid of oxygen ) with the environment . Leaves have pores in the surface ( stomates ) that regulate the entry/exit of gases and prevent the loss of excessive water . <p> The spongy layer ( or spongy mesophyll ) of the leaf acts like a " lung " increasing the internal surface area and provides for more rapid diffusion within the leaf . Note again that leaves are thin - this avoids the need for lungs or other type of pump to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance , simple diffusion can account for gas movements into/out of a leaf . An added advantage of having large leaves for light harvest is that they provide lots of surface area for absorption of carbon dioxide . <p> Note again the specialization of the leaf at the organ , tissue , and cellular levels for gas exchange . <p> D. Problem : Thin leaves , required for light absorption and gas exchange , need support . This problem was solved by the evolution of the cell wall which provided for the support of thin structures without the need ( or potential ) for internal support structures . <p> E. Problem : Photosynthesis requires a water supply With the exception of the algae and aquatic plants , plants obtain water through the roots from soil . Essentially the roots " mine " the soil for water . Thus , photosynthesis and the transition to a terrestrial environment stimulated the evolution of a root system to obtain water ( specialization at the organ level ) . And , it required the evolution of specialized transport tissue ( xylem ) to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Problem : Photosynthesis requires a mechanism to transport end products throughout the plant . Once carbohydrate is produced during photosynthesis there must be a mechanism to transport it to other locations throughout the plant . The evolution of vascular tissue , specifically phloem , permitted movement of photosynthate from leaves to roots , fruits and other tissues where required . <p> IV . Consequences of Autotrophic Nutrition - Motility is no longer required ; Or possible . One of the main reasons for motility is to obtain food . Since the nutrients required by plants are " omnipotent " there was never an evolutionary pressure for " motility " . Let ? s quickly compare the nutrients used by plants / animals : <p> Table 1 : Comparison of Plant &amp; Animal Nutrition <p> Nutrient <p> Plant <p> Animal <p> form of uptake <p> inorganic ( CO2 , water , ions ) <p> organic ( proteins , carbohydrates , fats ) <p> concentration <p> dilute ( i.e. , CO2 = 0.03% ) <p> concentrated <p> distribution <p> omnipotent <p> localized <p> Conclusion : plants must be adapted for harvesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for searching out and trapping widely dispersed , concentrated packets of food . <p> Supportive Evidence : If this is true , then we expect that animals with a nutrient source like a plant should have similar features to a plant . Check out corals , sea fans , and hydra . These are all non-motile animals that occur in aquatic environments which enables them to " feed like a plant " - food is essentially brought to them via water currents . Thus , they never had any pressure for motility and they have very similar lifestyles/forms as plants . <p> In addition , note that motility is really not possible for terrestrial plants . Once plants evolved roots it precluded movement . These evolutionary " choices " are closely connected . <p> However , being stationary has its own problems/consequences . <p> V. Consequences of a Stationary Lifestyle - The need to exploit a limited volume of the environment for resources.The Problem : a fixed ( stationary ) organism must be able to continually obtain nutrients without using them up . Plants face the additional problem that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be designed for collecting dilute nutrients in the environment . Plants have several solutions to this " problem " : <p> A. Plants are dendritic . In other words , the basic shape of the plant body is dendritic - which means " tree-like " or " filamentous " . The advantage of this shape is that it provides a large surface-to-volume ( s/v ) ratio which enables a plant to exploit a large area of the environment . In contrast , animals are more compact ( spherical ) to minimize their s/v ratio . Among other things , this is an advantage for motility . Surface-to-volume ratios are very important in many areas of biology . <p> B. Plants have indeterminate growth . This is the process by which a plant continues to grow and get larger throughout its life cycle . The advantage of this is that it allows the plant , especially roots , to grow into new areas . In contrast , determinate growth is where an organism or part reaches a certain size and then stops growing . This is characteristic of animals and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> C. Plants have an architectural design In other words , the plant body is constructed like a building , modular . It is built of a limited number of units , each of which is relatively independent of the others that are united into a single structure . Thus , just like a building is made of rooms , the leaves , stems and roots of a plant are analogous to a rooms in the building . Each room is somewhat independent , yet they all function together to make an integrated whole . You can seal off a room in a building , or remove a leaf or fruit , with little harm to the overall integrity of the structure . This is critical for plants to be able to add or remove parts ( leaves , stems , flowers , fruits ) as necessary . One conclusion is that plants are not limited by size , and this gives them the ability to colonize and exploit new areas for resources . <p> In contrast , an animal has a mechanical design . In other words , animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , different parts that function together . The parts are highly integrated . Parts can not be added or removed without reducing the efficiency of the operation of the whole . As a result , animals are limited by size . <p> D. Plants have a well developed ability to reproduce asexually . This can be viewed as a quick and energetically inexpensive way to expand the influence of the parent into a new location . <p> E. Plants ( may ) exhibit heterophylly - Heterophylly is the fancy way of referring to a plant with leaves of different shapes . For example , in aquatic plants the aerial leaves are entire but the submerged leaves are dissected . Leaves in the sun tend to be smaller and thicker than shade leaves . <p> F. Plants can forage . The growth patterns of plants , especially lianas and plants with stolons ( runners ) , are similar to the foraging tactics of animals . A brief overview of the anatomy of a clonal plant like Glechoma hederacea ( ground ivy ) : parent plant , stolon , ramet ( individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Ray ( 1975 ) found that Syngonium vines were of two types : ( 1 ) Long stem/small leaves - the traveling form ; and ( 2 ) short stem/large leaves - the feeding form . Under what conditions do you predict to find each of the two forms ? <p> Thus , plant growth is essentially analogous to animal behavior . One of the first to express this idea was Arber ( 1950 ; The Natural Philosophy of Plant Form . Cambridge ) who said : " Among plants , form may be held to include something corresponding to behavior in the zoological field ... for most though but not for all plants the only available forms of action are either growth , or ascending of parts , both of which involve a change in the size and form of the organism . " <p> VI . Consequences of a Stationary Lifestyle - Positioning in the environment . <p> The Problem : a non-motile organism is unable to move to a more favorable location to carry out its vital functions . Thus , it has at least three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> - or , getting started in the right spot . Obviously a motile organism can move to a favorable location , but a plant is stuck in one spot once the seed germinates . For most plants getting started in the right place is a matter of luck . They produce lots of offspring with little parental care of offspring and very few survive - think oak tree and acorns . However , there are a few " tricks " that seeds use to help increase the odds that they germinate in a favorable environment : <p> 1 . Light . Some seeds , like certain varieties of lettuce , require light for germination . This is a mechanism to insure that they germinate on the soil surface . It 's no surprise that a garden develops a healthy crop of weeds after the soil is turned - it brings light-sensitive seeds to the surface . Light sensitive seeds are usually small and without much stored food . Thus , it is important that they begin to photosynthesize soon after germination . <p> Action spectra for this response show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ germination and that treatment with far-red light ( ca. 730 nm ) inhibit/prevent germination . A typical experiment would yield the following results : <p> Note that the seeds are responding to the last " flavor " of light to which they are exposed . Essentially the response is " reversible " much like using a switch to turn on a light bulb . <p> Phytochrome is the pigment receptor for this response and other photo-reversible responses in plants . Phytochrome is a blue green pigment and it exists in two form : Red form ( Pr ; absorbs red light at about 660 nm ) and Far Red form ( Pfr ; absorbs far-red light at about 730 nm ) . Pr is converted to Pfr when exposed to red light . Pfr is converted back to Pr when exposed to far-red light . Since the plant only makes phytochrome in the red form , initially all phytochrome is in the Pr form until the plant is exposed to light . The reversibility is one of the characteristics of a phytochrome effect . The last wavelength will affect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of phytochrome that will either induce or inhibit a response . In this case , the phytochrome induces germination presumably be activating a number of processes in the seed including amylase production . <p> 2 . Ethylene . Some seeds require ethylene to germinate . This naturally occurring plant hormone is produced by plants and soil microbes . Once the ethylene concentration reaches a critical level it induces the seeds to germinate . This happens if the seed is buried . These seeds are usually larger than light sensitive ones . One advantage of being buried is that the seeds will be more likely to be in a moist , humid environment . <p> B. Axis orientation - once a seed germinates in a favorable environment it must determine which way is up/down to insure that the roots grow down and shoots up . Thus , gravitropism is a very important physiological response characteristic of all plants . <p> Gravitropism is still not completely understood , but we are learning more . Recent shuttle flights have helped expand our knowledge of this phenomenon because they provide an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are negatively gravitropic while roots are positively gravitropic . The cells on the upper side of the root elongate faster than those on the lower side . For the stem , it is just the opposite . The receptor in the root is located in the cap . It may be starch grains , that settle out to show which way is up . The movement of these heavy bodies ( called statoliths ) causes a redistribution of plant hormones , like IAA , so that there is more on the lower side of the stem and root . The increased concentration stimulates shoot elongation but inhibits root elongation . <p> C. Fine Tuning - Even non-motile organisms need to " fine-tune " their position in the environment . Thus plants have a variety of mechanisms that enable them to optimize their position in the environment including : <p> Phototropism Growth toward light , maximize light reception . The receptor for the response is the shoot tip . A yellow pigment is the specific receptor and the blue light is the stimulus . Light is absorbed by the receptor pigment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the stem toward the darker side . This stimulates elongation on the side away from the light ; <p> Skototropism Growth of vines ( e.g. , Monstera ) toward a darkened region of the environment . Mechanism by which some tropical vines find a support to grow up ( Ray , 1975 ) ; <p> Thigmomorphogenesis Response to touch in which the plant is shorter with thicker stems - prevents plants from getting too spindly and reduces risk of breaking in wind ; <p> Leaf mosaics Pattern of leaves which minimizes overlapping ( i.e. , ivy on a building ) ; and <p> Apical dominance The Christmas tree shape exhibited by some plants . In other words , the apical bud controls the development of the lateral buds resulting in a plant with a Christmas tree shape . The function is to prevent the plant from becoming too top-heavy and to maximize light exposure to all leaves . IAA is partly responsible . It is produced at the tip and moves toward the base of the plant . The concentration decreases as it proceeds from the shoot towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrations of IAA . Although there is evidence to support this theory , other data suggest that cytokinins , another group of plant hormones , are also involved . Cytokinins help direct the transport of sugars and it is suggested that the lateral buds do n't develop because cytokinins at the apex prevent nutrients from getting to the lateral buds to develop . Finally , there is some evidence that an inhibitory hormone may also be involved . <p> Etiolation The response of plants to growth in the dark or with reduce light . Etiolated plants are typically yellow , with an apical hook ( dicots ) or unopened coleoptile , have elongated internodes ( stems ) with unfolded leaves and the stems are thinner . These features can be considered ways of conserving energy until conditions improve ( i.e. , light ) . Phytochrome is also important in this response . <p> VII . Consequences of a Stationary Lifestyle - the need to predict environmental changes and activities . <p> Problem : Plants respond to changes in their environment by growth and developmental changes . Since these take time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when the environment will change and prepare for the change . Indeterminate growth is important here - it provides plants with the ability to change developmentally through the life cycle . Some examples of this phenomenon include : preparing for winter ( by forming buds in summer ) , photoperiodism ( timing flowering so the appropriate pollinator is available and that the seeds have enough time to develop before winter ) ; circadian rhythms ( various types in response to day/night ) , and nyctinasty ( sleep movements ) . <p> In contrast , animals typically respond to their environment behaviorally . Since they are motile , they can " move " to a favorable position . In fact , because they are motile they need a nervous system to respond to the environment . Plants don ? t need a nervous system since they are constrained to respond to the environment by growth and developmental changes ; hence they never had a pressure to evolve a nervous system . <p> Flowering is an excellent example of this phenomenon . Two important signals for flowering are temperature and daylength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to germinate . This process is called vernalization and is the reason why farmers plant winter wheat in the late summer/early fall . <p> Daylength or photoperiod is another excellent flowering signal and is important in most species . This is a " better " signal than temperature because it is more predictable . Some plants flower when the days are long and the nights are short ( Long Day plants ) while others prefer short days and long nights ( Short Day plants ) . Some plants are insensitive to daylength ( day neutral plants ) . There are also various combinations of long short day plants and short , long day plants . Surprisingly , experiments in which the day or night is interrupted have shown that plants are primarily responding to the length of the night . Thus , long day plants can more appropriately be called " short night " plants and short day plants should be called " long night " plants . <p> The receptor for this phenomenon is in the leaves and appears to be phytochrome . Plants appear to measure the relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ratio of Pr/Pfr is low whereas this would stimulate short day plants . Phytochrome presumably triggers the production of appropriate flowering hormones that cause the meristems to produce flowers . Although various experiments ( i.e. , grafting ) show that hormones are involved in this process , no hormone has been unequivocally been shown to be involved . Florigen is the name given to the putative hormone involved in flowering . <p> VIII . Consequences of a Stationary Lifestyle - need to protect themselves from physical and biological dangers in the environment . <p> Problem : a non-motile organism can not flee when conditions get tough . It must " fight " it out . Both the physical environment and biological environment threatens the well being of plants . <p> A. Physical dangers - wind , water ( flood ) , drought , cold ( winter ) are among the physical dangers that a plant faces . In general , plants cope with these ( at least the predictable ones like winter and drought during summer ) by dormancy , senescence and even death . <p> Problem : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer ) or easily disperse offspring . Plants solve the gamete transfer problem by relying on various pollination vectors . Fruits/seed dispersal mechanisms help disperse offspring . Check out the Private Lives of Plants video series available in the Alcuin Library for some great footage of dispersal and pollination mechanisms . <p> X. Additional Consequences : The consequences of the wall <p> Problem : As we mentioned , plants evolved cell walls as a means of support . However , by surrounding their cells with a rigid box , this imposed certain limitations . These include : <p> Growth is restricted to meristematic regions . In contrast , growth in animals occurs throughout the body . Meristems are areas of active cell division in plants . The typical pattern for a plant is that the meristem produces new cells which then enlarge and finally differentiate ( become specialized ) . There are two major types of meristems : ( a ) Primary - responsible for growth in length and were originally present in the embryo . The apical meristems , found at root and shoot tips , are examples . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoots ; ( b ) Secondary - responsible for growth in girth . These are derived from the primary ( apical ) meristems . These are several secondary meristems including vascular cambium ( produces xylem and phloem ) , cork cambium ( produces cork ) and the pericycle ( found in stele , gives rise to the lateral roots ) <p> Since plants are built from rigid structures , morphogenesis occurs by way of cell addition , not cell movement ( as is found in development of animals ) <p> Since each cell is walled off from neighboring cells , plants need an effect means of cell-to-cell communication . Plants accomplish this through plasmodesmata - cytoplasmic connections , hormonal regulation , and some electrical signals .

" How about a compassionate misanthrope ? " That enigmatic thought , expressed in the spring of 1967 by Wellesley sophomore Hillary Rodham in a letter to a friend , provides a valuable clue to the character of Hillary Rodham Clinton . <p> Last fall , my student Avf Bahadoor and I conducted a study of the political personality of Hillary Clinton.We collected personal data from published biographical materials and political reports , and synthesized these public records into a personality profile using the second edition of the Millon Inventory of Diagnostic Criteria ( MIDC ) , which I adapted from the work of contemporary personality theorist Theodore Millon . <p> We found that Hillary Clintons primary MIDC scale elevations occurred as moderate loadings on the " Ambitious " and " Dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the " Conscientious " dimension.The Ambitious dimension is anchored at its adaptive pole by self-confidence and at its maladaptive pole by pathological narcissism.The Dominant dimension is anchored by , respectively , authoritativeness and pathological aggressivenessthe latter being conceptually related to " sadistic personality disorder , " listed in the appendix of the revised third edition of the American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( 1987 ) as a provisional personality disorder requiring further study.Finally , the Conscientious dimension ranges from conventional respectfulness to self-defeating compulsiveness . <p> The Millon Index of Personality Styles ( 1994 ) , employing the label Asserting , describes Ambitious personalities as bold , competitive , and self-assured individuals who easily assume leadership roles , expect others to recognize their special qualities , and often act as though entitled.Dominant personalitieslabeled Controllingenjoy the power to direct others and to evoke obedience and respect.They are tough , competitive , and unsentimental , and often make effective leaders.This amalgam of adaptive narcissism and dominance in Hillary Clintons personality profile parallels the recollection of high school classmate Art Curtis , as quoted in Gail Sheehys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive at everything.Even pugnacious.She was very ambitious . " <p> In this essay I will document some of the enduring personal characteristics that provide the empirical basis for my assessment of Hillary Clintons dominant , ambitious personality pattern . <p> After interviewing many of Clintons associates for a New Yorker article ( " Hillary the pol , " May 30 , 1994 ) Connie Bruck concluded , " In the end , the sureness about her own judgmentat its extreme , a sense that she alone is wiseis probably Hillarys cardinal trait . " Evident in Brucks assessment is the dogmatic inflexibility characteristic of the cognitive style of highly conscientious , dominant personalities , tinged with the hubris of high ambition . <p> Commenting on the leadership implications of these traits , Stanley Renshon , in his 1996 book , High Hopes , had this to say : " The view that one knows better than othersperiodcan lead to imperiousness and cause trouble in ones relations with others.It has done so in Hillarys case . " <p> Renshons contention seems to be borne out by Elizabeth Drew.In her book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hillary Clintons presence at health care meetings early in the Clinton presidency was a " source of discomfort , " with some attendees finding her " intimidatinghard to argue with and uninterested in the points they made.Mrs . Clintons style was very direct.She told people straight out what she thought . . . . Mrs. Clinton displayed a certain impatience.And her humor was biting . " <p> Drews reporting provides evidence of dominant behavior , but what evidence do we have that this is indicative of an enduring , consistent personality pattern rather than a situationally determined response simply reflecting Hillary Clintons seriousness of purpose concerning comprehensive health care ? <p> Childhood nicknames sometimes provide a useful index of an individuals ingrained , central personality traits.Among their mock predictions for seniors , Hillary Rodhams high school newspaper proclaimed that Hillarys destiny was to become a nun named " Sister Frigidaire . " " Obviously , " wrote celebrity biographer Norman King in The Woman in the White House ( 1996 ) , " she was known for her ability to freeze anyone with a glare from her blue eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Alls Fair : Love , War , and Running for President ( 1994 ) , co-authored with Mary Matalin , put it this way : " Hillary wont run you down for fun , and she wont run into a ditch to avoid scratching your fender , but if you are blocking something we need to get done you 'll get run over in a hurry . " Less folksy , if more gravely , Bob Woodward reported in The Choice ( 1996 ) that Hillary occasionally " snapped at people , even blew up , providing a momentary glimpse of inner rage.She seemed angry , bottled up.Hillary was smart and determined , knew what she wanted to happen.When she was focused and directed , she often seemed not to recognize when she was hurting people . " <p> Lani Guinier , who once considered herself close to the Clintons , has written poignantly about this hurt.In " Whos afraid of Lani Guinier ? " ( New York Times Magazine , Feb. 27 , 1994 ) , she related how , when her nomination for attorney general began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her " friends in the White House . " She writes that Hillary Clinton first " breezed by " her in the West Wing " with a casual Hi Kiddo " and then , when someone tried to tell the first lady that she was there to strategize on her nomination , Hillary " turned slightly and said , Oh , " and " to no one in particular , announced , I 'm thirty minutes late for lunch . " As Gail Sheehy has commented , " Empathy was not characteristic of Hillary . " <p> Millon proposes that the primary psychological precursor of an aggressive , controlling personality orientation is parental hostility.Sheehy describes Hillarys father , Hugh Rodham , as an " authoritarian drillmaster " who " neither offered nor asked for nurturing . " " He was gruff and intolerant and also famously tightfisted : he shut off the heat in the house every night and turned a deaf ear to his childrens complaints that they woke up freezing in the morning.Toughen up was the message . " Sheehy writes that Hillary " tried hard . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Village , Hillary Clinton wrote , " When I brought home straight As from junior high , my fathers only comment was , Well Hillary , that must be an easy school you go to. " Sheehy suggests that Hillarys " drive toward perfection , her severe self-discipline and overwhelming need for control " are rooted in the tyranny of her fathers " demand for perfection and his readiness to demean his daughter . " <p> The foregoing touches primarily on Hillary Clintons dominant traits.What do we know about her ambitiousness ? In this regard , Renshon writes that " one aspect of Hillary Rodhams character " that stands out is her confidence in herself , her positions , and her work.Noting that both Bill and Hillary Clinton " are very ambitious and confident , " but that Hillarys ambition " trumps her husbands , " Renshon speculates that Hillary " appears to have developed . . . boundary problems " stemming from " her strong self-confidence in the correctness of whatever she does , " in contrast to her husbands " failure to develop strong internal boundaries . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entitlement " a tendency to not want to be bound by limits that apply to others . " <p> It seems difficult to reconcile Hillary Clintons personality profile with her " It takes a village " persona.Part of the problem may be that character can be difficult to discern beneath a polished political persona.In one sense , Clinton has learned to soften publicly , as Bruck puts it , what others have viewed as the " hard edges " of her nature.But more importantly , clear perception of Hillarys character can be easily confounded by her embrace of humanitarian political issues as a vehicle for political expression.Had she remained a Goldwater Republican and subscribed to the agenda of say , a Margaret Thatcher , the character traits that drive her political ambitions might well have been more transparent.The point is that character largely remains a constant , even as ideological values migrate under the press of political socialization . <p> Acknowledgments <p> Avf Bahadoor , a biology/pre-med major at the College of St. Benedict , assisted with the data collection for this paper . <p> A slightly edited version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Journal of the Psychohistory Forum ) , vol. 7 , no. 2 ( September 2000 ) , pp. 65-66.

Making Mayonnaise Do you know how to make mayonnaise ? Simply mix vegetable oil , vinegar , and egg yolk .

You will hopefully recall that phospholipids like lecithin are amphipathic ( or amphiphilic ; click here for some info about phospholipids and triglycerides ) . In other words , they love , or are soluble , in both ( amphi- , think " amphibians " ) water and lipids because they have a hydrophilic side and a hydrophobic side .

Simple , the cell membrane has the same basic structure as mayonnaise . <p> For more details check out the dialog by Gink and Go . Among other things in the dialog you will learn that forming a membrane was a very early step in the evolution of life on the planet . Also , check out the article by Harold Morowitz , " Mayonnaise and the Origin of Life " . <p> II . Cell Membranes <p> A. Brief History of Discovery <p> 1670 's - Leeuwenhoek ( the " Founder " of microscopy ; Dutch lens-maker ) was one of the first to recognize the existence of the membrane . He concluded that " something " separated a cell from its environment . He came to the correct conclusion even though his initial observations were with plant cells and he was actually looking at plant cell walls . He eventually realized that animals had no walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Solubility studies suggested that both polar and non-polar materials passed through the membrane indicating that it must be made of a combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds . <p> 1910 - Studies of red blood cell " ghosts " showed that the membrane was made of phospholipids and proteins . <p> 1935 - Davson and Danielli proposed the " unit membrane " concept . They suggested that the membrane was essentially a sandwich stuffed with phospholipids between two slices of protein bread . This model explained many features of membranes including the typical structure observed in TEM photographs . <p> 1972 - Singer and Nicolson proposed the currently accepted " fluid mosaic model " for the cell membrane . <p> B. The Fluid Mosaic Model According to this model , the membrane is a bilayer of phospholipids with proteins randomly inserted in/on/thru the bilayer . <p> 1 . Phospholipid Structure <p> Glycerol backbone ( C3 ) <p> Fatty acids are joined ( esterified ) to two of the carbon atoms . <p> The fatty acids vary in length from C14 - C24 <p> One fatty acid is usually saturated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> The unsaturated fatty acid is " kinked " which prevents the phospholipids from packing too tightly and hence , the membrane remains more fluid at cool temperatures . In fact , the degree of unsaturation in the fatty acids in phospholipids is inversely correlated with temperature . Another way that membranes remain reasonably fluid is by incorporating cholesterol and other sterols . These hydrophobic molecules also break up the tight aggregation of phospholipids that would occur at cool temperatures . <p> The fatty acids are hydrophobic ( non-polar ) . <p> Phosphate - is esterified to the third carbon . <p> A polar group is attached to the phosphate . Choline is a common polar group . The unifying features of the polar groups are : ( a ) they have an electrical charge and ( b ) are hydrophilic . <p> Together , the phosphate and polar group make up the " head " of the phospholipid . <p> A good symbolic representation of a phospholipid is a two-tailed " sperm " structure where the head represents the hydrophilic phosphate and polar group and each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As mentioned above , phospholipids have a polar/hydrophilic part and a non-polar/hydrophobic region . Thus , they are amphipathic ( or amphiphilic ) . <p> 2 . Phospholipid Arrangement <p> The hydrophobic tail regions associate with one another as do the hydrophilic head regions aggregate . <p> Phospholipids readily forms a thin film that self-seals to form vesicles . <p> Liposomes are small , artificial vesicles created from phospholipids used to deliver drugs <p> The distribution of proteins is asymmetric ; or in other words , different proteins exist on the inside and outside of the membrane . This was first discovered by freeze-fracture studies . <p> Proteins on the inner surface are synthesized by free ribosomes and make their way to the inner surface of the membrane . <p> Proteins on the outer surface are synthesized by ribosomes associated with the ER . The protein is partially secreted into the ER lumen . The portion inside the lumen is chemically modified by adding a sugar . The protein pinches off in a vesicle which migrates to the golgi and proceeds from the cis to the trans faces of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell membrane where the vesicle fuses with the membrane and the protein becomes part of the membrane ( not on exam ) . <p> 4 . What 's in a name ? <p> Fluid - the model is termed fluid because an individual phospholipid or protein can move within the bilayer . This was demonstrated by some elegant experiments in which mouse and human cells with labeled proteins were fused and the redistribution of the proteins was followed . <p> Mosaic - based on the apparently random pattern of insertion of proteins in the membrane as observed in TEM photographs . <p> 5 . This model accounts for many observations that had previously been difficult to rationalize with the Davson and Danielli model : <p> membrane thickness is not uniform , it varies <p> the membrane is thinner than predicted if all the proteins are on the outsides ( for you trivia buffs , about 8000 membranes make up the thickness of paper ) <p> consistent with freeze fracture pictures showing that there is an asymmetric distribution of membrane components <p> protein and lipid content variable <p> III . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the cell membrane may be " sugar-coated " . In other words , many of the lipids and proteins on the outer surface of the membrane may have sugar units attached to them . These molecules are called glycolipids and glycoproteins , respectively . The sugar coating serves several functions including : ( 1 ) acts as a cell recognition system and ( 2 ) allows cells to make contact with one another . The sugar coating is called the glycocalyx . <p> Animal cells in particular may also have a gel-like network of carbohydrates and fibrous proteins surrounding them . The proteins include collagen and fibronectin . They are anchored by special protein receptors in the membrane called integrins . This network of external material is the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . <p> IV . Functions of the Cell Membrane . Among the many functions of the membrane are : <p> regulates cellular traffic into/out of the cell ( discussed below ) <p> serves as a boundary to separate the internal and external environments ( check out the quote at the beginning of this section ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reactions in the chloroplast and mitochondria rely on membranes ( more on this topic in a later class ) . <p> support ? the membrane can be considered to help maintain the structure of the cell <p> metabolism ( many of the proteins in the membrane are enzymes ) . The membrane acts like a platform on which reactions can occur <p> transport ? many of the proteins in the membrane act as transporters to move materials from one side of the membrane to the other . Other proteins pump ( using the energy in ATP ) materials into/out of the cell ( more at the end of this lecture ) . <p> compartmentalization - membranes serve to break up the cell into compartments ( i.e. , organelles ) that can be specialized for a particular function . <p> Information processing/communication - the membrane has many sites that bind hormones or antigens or otherwise act in recognizing other cells . <p> V. Permeability of the membrane We know that cell is surrounded by a membrane and that when a cell exchanges materials with its environment these materials obviously must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all substances ? The simple answer ? NO . <p> First , a brief digression : membranes are called semi-permeable . This means that they allow the passage of some materials but not others . Let 's use a goofy analogy ? consider the " Bouncer " at a night club . The bouncer permits some individuals to enter the club but not others . Thus , the club membrane ( doorway ) is semi-permeable allowing some individuals to pass through freely while denying others . The properties of the individuals diffusing into the club determine who enters . The doors are permeable to those 21 and older but impermeable to anyone younger . Just like the night club , the chemistry of the cell membrane serves as a bouncer that restricts the entry of some individuals but allows free passage of others . <p> So , what passes through the cell membrane ? Membranes are freely permeable to water , lipid soluble substances , and uncharged ( non-polar ) substances . Membranes are relatively impermeable to large polymers , ions and charged molecule . It might seem odd that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the membrane is hydrophobic . However , the reason water passes through so readily is because : ( 1 ) it is small enough to sneak into the cell between the phospholipids ; and ( 2 ) there are specialized protein channels in the membrane that permit the passage of water . These are called aquaporins . <p> VI . Moving molecules - Molecules can move from one place to another by : <p> A. Bulk Flow This is the mass movement of molecules in response to a pressure gradient . The molecules move from hi n++ low pressure , thus following a pressure gradient . A good example would be a faucet . When you turn a faucet on , water comes out . This occurs because the water in the tap is under pressure relative to the air outside the faucet . A toilet is another example ; high pressure in the tank/bowl but lower pressure in the sewer system . Some molecular movements rely on bulk flow which requires a mechanism to generate the pressure gradient . For example , animals have evolved a pump ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow of molecules through the circulatory system . Although important for the movement of blood and sap in plants , this is relatively unimportant in moving materials across membranes . <p> B. Diffusion Refers to the net , random movement of individual molecules from one area to another . The molecules move from hi n++ low , thus following a concentration gradient . Another way of stating this is that the molecules move from an area of high free energy ( higher concentration ) to one of low free energy ( lower concentration ) . The net movement stops when a dynamic equilibrium is achieved . <p> Imagine opening a bottle of perfume containing volatile essential oils in a very still room . Initially , the essential oils are concentrated in a corner of the room . As the molecules move randomly , in every different direction , over time they will eventually appear throughout the room . Ultimately the essential oils will reach a point , dynamic equilibrium , at which they are evenly distributed throughout the room . At this point the molecules are still moving . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference is that there is no net change in the overall distribution of the perfume in the room . <p> Now imagine that the room is divided by a partition with holes ( which is analogous to a membrane ) . If we place a drop of perfume on one side of the partition and then count at intervals the number of essential oil molecules on either side of the partition and graph the results : <p> plot # molecules vs. time on both sides of the partition . <p> We will observe that the number of molecules on one side will decrease while the other will increase until they reach dynamic equilibrium . Once at equilibrium the molecules continue to move back and forth from one side of the partition to the other and hence the number of molecules on either side of the partition at any given time is simply chance . The number oscillates about the midpoint . <p> A caveat - although this theoretical example helps us to better understand the nature of diffusion , it is technically wrong . The molecular movement attributed to diffusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , or convection . True examples of diffusion are hard to come by ( see Vogel , 1994 ; Wheatley , 1993 ) . Nevertheless , it serves our purpose to illustrate the general concept of diffusion . <p> C. Osmosis This is a specialized case of diffusion ; it represents the diffusion of a solvent ( typically water ) across a membrane . <p> D. Dialysis Another specialized case of diffusion ; it is the diffusion of solute across a semi-permeable membrane . Example ? consider a cell containing a sugar dissolved in water . If water ( the solvent ) moves out of the cell into the surroundings it moves osmotically ; if the sugar ( dialysis ) moves into the surroundings , it is an example of dialysis . <p> VII . Factors influencing the rate of diffusion <p> Several factors influence the rate of diffusion . These include : <p> A. Concentration Gradient Molecules move from an area of high concentration to one of lower concentration ; in other words , in response to a concentration gradient . Although this is true for solutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration of water ( 55.2 - 55.5 mol L-1 ) is nearly constant under all conditions ( i.e. , MW = 18 g/mol , and 1000 g/liter ; thus , 1000/18 = 55.5 mol/L ) . However , we can consider the movement of a solvent like water occurs from a region of greater mole fraction to a region where it has a lower mole fraction . The mole fraction of solvent = # solvent molecules/total ( # solvent molecules + # solute molecules ) . Water moves from an area of higher mole fraction or higher energy to an area of lower mole fraction or lower energy . Thus , the number of particles is the important consideration and the reason that concentrations are expressed in osmoles rather than molarity . <p> Fick ? s Law - is an equation that relates the rate of diffusion to the concentration gradient ( C1 ? C2 ) and resistance ( r ) . Diffusion rate , also called flux density ( J , in units of g m2 s-1 ) can be expressed in a very simplified form of the equation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / r <p> The take-home-lessons from this equation are that the rate of diffusion is : <p> directly proportional to the concentration gradient . The greater the difference in concentration between two areas , the greater the rate of diffusion . Thus , when the gradient is zero , there will be no net diffusion , diffusion will only occur so long as a concentration gradient exists ; <p> indirectly proportional to resistance . In other words , the greater the resistance to diffusion , the lower the rate of diffusion . Resistance refers to anything that reduces the rate of diffusion such as the partition in our perfume example . The width of the partitions is a resistance ; the wider the partitions , the lower the resistance . And , the membrane is a resistance to the movement of ions and other charged substances in or out of cells ; and <p> E. Solute effect on the solvent Solute particles decrease the free energy of a solvent like water . Thus , the more solute , the lower the free energy . Thus , water moves from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area of lower energy ( =higher solute concentration ) . <p> VIII . Measuring Osmosis Osmotic concentration ? refers to the number of osmotically-active particles of solute in a system . Water moves from a low osmotic concentration ( where the water concentration or mole fraction is higher ) to a higher osmotic concentration ( where the water concentration is lower ) . I prefer to remember that water always moves from an area of higher energy ( lower solute concentration ; lower osmotic concentration ) to an area of lower energy ( higher solute concentration ; higher osmotic concentration ) . <p> A solution with a lower osmotic concentration than another is said to be hypo-osmotic ( think hypodermic ? under the skin ) . In other words , the hypo-osmotic solution has fewer solute particles than the other . Conversely , the solution with more solute is hyper-osmotic relative to the other ? it has more solute particles . Iso-osmotic solutions have equal osmotic concentrations . <p> Now , consider an osmometer which is a device used to measure osmosis . In its simplest form it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The system is filled with water and then immersed in a beaker with water . At equilibrium , the height of water in the tube will be at the level of the water in the beaker . At equilibrium , for every water molecule that diffuses osmotically into the membrane another diffuses out . Now , what will happen if we put some sucrose inside of the membrane sac ? There will be a net movement of water from the beaker into the membrane sac . Water will move into the sac ( from high to low energy , or from low to high solute concentration , or from low to high osmotic concentration ) . As the water moves in , what happens to the column of water ? ? right , it moves up the tube . As it does , the water pressure inside the cell increases . Water stops moving in when the pressure inside the cell balances out the tendency for the water to move into the cell . We say that the solution inside the membrane sac has a higher osmotic pressure because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the beaker 's perspective , since it is loosing water it will have a lower osmotic pressure . Finally , we can consider this entire process from the perspective of pressure , or tonicity , on the membrane sac . As water moves into the sac , the increased volume of water causes the pressure on the membrane to increase . Thus , the sac is said to be hypertonic relative to the water in the beaker . Again from the beaker 's perspective , the water is hypotonic to the sac . <p> IX . A comparison of terminology Let 's try to make some sense of all the terms we have used . Imagine that the table below represents a system filled with water and separated by a semi-permeable membrane that allows water to pass from one side to the other , but not solute . Side 1 , the left column , is filled with pure water and side 2 with water containing a solute like sugar . Now , study the different terms . In all cases the water moves from side 1 to side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solute , it would move from side 2 to side 1 ) <p> As a review : Consider three beakers , one filled with water , a second with a dilute salt solution and the third with a concentrated salt solution . Place a potato core in each of the beakers and allow them to incubate for awhile . In the beaker filled with water we will observe that the potato core swells up and becomes more turgid . The pressure has increased inside the cells because water has moved into the potato from the solution . The pressure on the membrane is called tonicity . Thus the potato has greater tonicity ( or is hypertonic ) than the water in the solution . Conversely , we can envision that the tonicity of the solution is less or hypotonic . <p> Now consider the core in the concentrated solution . Water will move out of the potato into the solution ( because it is hypo-osmotic to the solution , or has more energy than the solution ) . As water leaves , the core shrivels and the membrane pressure decreases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaker ) . In the dilute sugar solution , there will be no change in the core ? it will neither gain no loose water . It is said to be isotonic . <p> XI . Carrier Mediated Transport <p> Facilitated Diffusion ? diffusion into/out of cell at rate more rapid than expect . Does n't use ATP . Transport proteins , like glucose permease , are involved . These proteins in the membrane provide a channel through which the substance will pass . Transport is in the direction of the concentration gradient . Thus , it doesn ? t require an additional , outside energy input . <p> XII . Vesicle Mediated Transport In these processes , small vesicles are involved with moving materials across the membrane . There are two basic types based upon the direction of movement : <p> Endocytosis ? cells engulfs particles/materials from the environment . As the process occurs , the materials are put into vesicles that pinches off from membrane . Lysosomes fuse with the vesciles to digest the newly obtained materials .

Hence 18:3 ? 9,12,15 could be written as 18:3 ( ? -3 ) or 18:3 ( n-3 ) where the terminal C is numbered one and the first double bond starts at C3 . Arachidonic acid is an ( ? -6 ) fatty acid while docosahexaenoic acid is an ( ? -3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds are cis , with a methylene spacer between double bonds - i.e. the double bonds are not conjugated . For saturated fatty acids , melting point increases with C chain length , owing to increased likelihood of van der Waals ( London or induced dipole ) interactions between the overlapping and packed chains . Within chains of the same number of C ? s , melting point decreases with increasing number of double bonds , owing to the kinking of the acyl chains , followed by decreased packing and reduced intermolecular forces ( IMFs ) . Fatty acid composition differs in different organisms : <p> animals have 5-7% of fatty acids with 20-22 carbons , while fish have 25-30% <p> animals have &lt;1% of their fatty acids with 5-6 double bonds , while plants have 5-6% and fish 15-30% <p> Recent work has suggested that contrary to images of early hominids as hunters and scavengers of meat , human brain development might have required the consumption of fish which is highly enriched in arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids. 0% of the brain consists of lipids , most which consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper development of the human brain and in adults , deficiencies in these might contribute to cognitive disorders like ADHD , dementia , and dyslexia . These fatty acids are essential in the diet , and probably could not have been derived in high enough amounts from the eating of brains of other animals . <p> Saturated fatty acids chains can exist in many conformations resulting from free rotation around the C-C bonds of the acyl chains . A quick review of the conformations of n-butane shows that the energetically most favorable conformation is one in which the two CH3 groups attached to the 2 methylene C ? s ( C2 and C3 ) are trans to each other , which results in decreased steric strain . Looking at a Neuman projection of n-butane shows the dihedral or torsional angle to be 180 degrees . When the dihedral angle is 0 degrees , the two terminal CH3 groups are syn to each other , which is the conformation of highest energy . When the angle is 60 ( gauche+ ) or 300 ( gauche- ) degrees , a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At a given temperature and moment , a population of molecules of butane would consist of some in the g+ and g- state , with most in the t state . The same applies to fatty acids . To increase the number of chains with g+tg- conformations , for example , the temperature of the system can be increased . <p> A cartoon digram showing the generic structures of triacylglyerides , glycerophospholipid and spingolipids is show below . In addition , the most common glycerophospholipids are shown . Learn phosphatic acid ( PI ) , phosphatidyethanolamine ( PE ) , phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) which is often called lechithin , and phosphatidylserine ( PS ) which is often called cephalin . <p> Glycerol is an achiral molecule , since C2 has two identical substituents , CH2OH . Glycerol in the body can be chemically converted to triacylglycerides and phospholipids ( PL ) which are chiral , and which exist in one enantiomeric form . How can this be possible if the two CH2OH groups on glycerol are identical ? It turns out that even though these groups are stereochemically equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the OH on C2 pointing to the left . Then replace the OH of C1 with OD , where D is deuterium . Now the two alcohol substituents are not identical and the resulting molecule is chiral . By rotating the molecule such that the H on C2 points to the back , and assigning priorities to the other substituents on C2 as follows : OH =1 , DOCH2 =2 , and CH2OH = 3 , it can be see that the resulting molecule is in the S configuration . Hence we say that C1 is the proS carbon . Likewise , if we replaced the OH on C3 with OD , we will form the R enantiomer . Hence C3 is the proR carbon . This shows that in reality we can differentiate between the two identical CH2OH substituents . We say that glycerol is not chiral , but prochiral . ( Think of this as glycerol has the potential to become chiral by modifying one of two identical substituents . ) <p> We can relate the configuation of glycerol above , ( when the C2 OH is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L-glyceraldehyde , a simple sugar ( a polyhydroxyaldehyde or ketone ) , another 3C glycerol derivative . This molecule is chiral with the OH on C2 ( the only chiral carbon ) pointing to the left . It is easy to remember that any L sugar has the OH on the last chiral carbon pointing to the left . The enantiomer ( mirror image isomer ) of L-glyceraldehyde is D-glyeraldehyde , in which the OH on C2 points to the right . Biochemists use L and D for lipid , sugar , and amino acid stereochemistry , instead of the R , S nomenclature you used in organic chemistry . The stereochemical designation of all the sugars , amino acids , and glycerolipids can be determined from the absolute configuration of L- and D-glyceraldehyde . <p> The first step in the in vivo ( in the body ) synthesis of chiral derivatives from the achiral glycerol involves the phosphorylation of the OH on C3 by ATP , to produce the chiral molecule glycerol phosphate . Based on the absolute configuration of L-glyceraldehyde , and using this to draw glycerol ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can see that the phosphorylated molecule can be named L-glycerol-3-phosphate . However , by rotating this molecule 180 degrees , without changing the stereochemistry of the molecule , we do n't change the molecule at all , but using the D/L nomenclature above , we would name the rotated molecule as D-glycerol-1-phosphate . We can ? t give the same molecule two different names . Hence biochemists have developed the stereospecific numbering system ( sn ) , which assigns the 1-position of a prochiral molecule to the group occupying the proS position . Using this nomenclature , we can see that the chiral molecule described above , glycerol-phosphate , can be unambiguously named as sn-glycerol-3-phosphate . The hydroxyl substituent on the proR carbon was phosphorylated . <p> The enzymatic phosphorylation of prochiral glycerol on the proR carbon OH to form sn-glycerol-3-phosphate is illustrated in the link below . As we were able to differentiate the 2 identical CH2OH substitutents as containing either the proS or proR carbons , so can the enzyme . The enzyme can differentiate identical substituents on a prochiral molecule if the prochiral molecule interacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prochiral reactants/enzyme system involves the oxidation of the prochiral molecule ethanol by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase , in which only the proR H of the 2 H ? s on C2 is removed .

Irreversible Covalent Inhibition <p> Given what you already know about protein structure , it should be easy to figure how to inhibit an enzyme . Since structure mediates function , anything that would significantly change the structure of an enzyme would inhibit the activity of the enzyme . Hence extremes of pH and high temperature , all of which can denature the enzyme , would inhibit the enzyme in a irreversible fashion , unless it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which interacts noncovalently with the enzyme to either change its conformation or directly prevent substrate binding . Finally , we could covalently modify certain side chains , that if they are essential to enzymatic activity , would irreversibly inhibit the enzyme . <p> We discussed previously the types of reagents that would chemically modify specific side chains that might be critical for enzymatic activity . For example , iodoacetamide might abolish enzyme activity if a Cys side chain is required for activity . These reagents will usually modify several side chains , however , and determining which is critical for binding or catalytic conversion of the substrate can be difficult . One way would be to protect the active site with a saturating quantities of a ligand which binds reversibly at the active site . Then the chemical modification can be performed at varying reaction times . The critical side chain would be protected from the chemical modification , but the extent of protection would depend on the Kd , concentration of the protecting ligand. , and the length of the reaction . <p> more TBA <p> The rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C2 . Competitive Inhibition <p> Reversible Competitive inhibition occurs when substrate ( S ) and inhibitor ( I ) both bind to the same site on the enzyme . In effect , they compete for the active site and bind in a mutually exclusive fashion . This is illustrated in the chemical equations and molecular cartoon below . <p> There is another type of inhibition that would give the same kinetic data . If S and I bound to different sites , and S bound to E and produced a conformational change in E such that I could not bind ( and vice versa ) , then the binding of S and I would be mutually exclusive . This is called allosteric competitive inhibition . Inhibition studies are usually done at several fixed and non-saturating concentrations of I and varying S concentrations . <p> The key kinetic parameters to understand are Vm and Km . Let us assume for ease of equation derivation that I binds reversibly , and with rapid equilibrium to E , with a dissociation constant Kis . The " s " in the subscript " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lineweaver-Burk plot changes while the y intercept stays constant . Kis is also named Kic where the subscript " c " stands for competitive inhibition constant . <p> A look at the top mechanism shows that even in the presence of I , as S increases to infinity , all E is converted to ES . That is , there is no free E to which I could bind . Now remember that Vm= kcatEo . Under these condition , ES = Eo ; hence v = Vm . Vm is not changed . However , the apparent Km , Kmapp , will change . We can use LaChatelier 's principle to understand this . If I binds to E alone , and not ES , it will shift the equilibrium of E + S &lt;==&gt; ES to the left , which would have the affect of increasing the Km app ( i.e. it would appear that the affinity of E and S has decreased . ) . The double reciprocal plot ( Lineweaver Burk plot ) offers a great way to visualize the inhibition . In the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase . Therefore , 1/Km , the x-intercept on the plot will get smaller , and closer to 0 . Therefore the plots will consists of a series of lines , with the same y intercept ( 1/Vm ) , and the x intecepts ( -1/Km ) closer and closer to the 0 as I increases . These intersecting plots are the hallmark of competitive inhibition . <p> Note that in the first three inhibition models discussed in this section , the Lineweaver-Burk plots are linear in the presence and absence of inhibitor . This suggests that plots of v vs S in each case would be hyperbolic and conform to the usual form of the Michaelis Menton equation , each with potentially different apparent Vm and Km values . <p> An equation , shown in the figure above , can be derived which shows the effect of the competitive inhibitor on the velocity of the reaction . The only change is that the Km term is multiplied by the factor 1+I/Kis . Hence Kmapp = Km(1+I/Kis) . This shows that the apparent Km does increase as we predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhibitor affects the slope of the double reciprocal plot . <p> If the data was plotted as vo vs log S , the plots would be sigmoidal , as we saw for plots of ML vs log L in Chapter 5B . In the case of competitive inhibitor , the plot of vo vs log S in the presence of different fixed concentrations of inhibitor would consist of a series of sigmoidal curves , each with the same Vm , but with different apparent Km values ( where Kmapp = Km(1+I/Kis) , progressively shifted to the right . Enyzme kinetic data is rarely plotted this way , but simple binding data for the M + L &lt; == &gt; ML equilibrium , in the presence of different inhibitor concentrations is . <p> Reconsider our discussion of the simple binding equilibrium , M + L &lt;==&gt; ML . When we wished to know how much is bound , or the fractional saturation , as a function of the log L , we considered three examples . <p> These scenarios show that if L varies over 4 orders of magnitude ( 0.01Kd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , from -2 + log Kd &lt; log Kd &lt; 2 + log Kd ) , irrespective of the magnitude of the Kd , that Y varies from approximately 0 - 1 . <p> In other words , Y varies from 0-1 when L varies from log Kd by +2 . Hence , plots of Y vs log L for a series of binding reactions of increasingly higher Kd ( lower affinity ) would reveal a series of identical sigmoidal curves shifted progressively to the right , as shown below . <p> The same would be true of vo vs S in the presence of different concentration of a competitive inhibitor , for initial flux , Jo vs ligand outside , in the presence of a competitive inhibitor , or ML vs L ( or Y vs L ) in the presence of a competitive inhibitor . <p> In many ways plots of v0 vs lnS are easier to visually interpret than plots of v0 vs S . As noted for simple binding plots , textbook illustrations of hyperbolas are often misdrawn , showing curves that level off too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of v0 vs lnS , in which it is easy to see if saturation has been achieved . In addition , as the curves above show , multiple complete plots of v0 vs lnS at varying fixed inhibitor concentration or for variant enzyme forms ( different isoforms , site-specific mutants ) over a broad range of lnS can be made which facilitates comparisons of the experimental kinetics under these different conditions . This is especially true if Km values differ widely . <p> Now that you are more familiar with binding , flux , and enzyme kinetics curves , in the presence and absence of inhibitors , you should be able to apply the above analysis to inhibition curves where the binding , initial flux , or the initial velocity is plotted at varying competitive inhibitor concentration at different fixed concentration nonsaturating concentrations of ligand or substrate . Consider the activity of an enzyme . Let 's say that at some reasonable concentration of substrate ( not infinite ) , the enzyme is approximately 100% active . If a competitive inhibitor is added , the activity of the enzyme would drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would remain . Graphs showing this are shown below . <p> Figure : Inhibition of Enzyme Activity - % Activity vs log Inhibitor <p> A special case of competitive inhibition : the specificity constant : In the previous chapter , the specificity constant was defined as kcat/KM which we also described as the second order rate constant associated with the bimolecular reaction of E and S when S &lt;&lt; KM . It also describes how good an enzyme is in differentiating between different substrates . If has enzyme encounters two substrates , one can be considered to be a competitive inhibitor of the other . The following derivation shows that the ratio of initial velocities for two competing substrates at the same concentration is equal to the ratio of their kcat/KM values . <h> C3 . Uncompetitive Inhibition <p> Reversible uncompetitive inhibition occurs when I binds only to ES and not free E. One can hypothesize that on binding S , a conformational change in E occurs which presents a binding site for I. Inhibition occurs since ESI can not form product . It is a dead end complex which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is illustrated in the chemical equations and molecular cartoon below . <p> Let us assume for ease of equation derivation that I binds reversibly to ES with a dissociation constant Kii . The second " i " in the subscript " ii " indicates that the intercept of the 1/v vs 1/S Lineweaver-Burk plot changes while the slope stays constant . Kii is also named Kiu , where the subscript " u " stands for the uncompetitive inhibition constant . <p> A look at the top mechanism shows that in the presence of I , as S increases to infinity , not all of E is converted to ES . That is , there is a finite amount of ESI , even at infinite S. Now remember that Vm = kcatEo if and only if all E is in the form ES . Under these conditions , the apparent Vm , Vmapp is less than the real Vm without inhibitor . In addition , the apparent Km , Kmapp , will change . We can use LaChatelier 's principle to understand this . If I binds to ES alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of E + S &lt;==&gt; ES to the right , which would have the affect of decreasing the Kmapp ( i.e. it would appear that the affinity of E and S has increased . ) . The double reciprocal plot ( Lineweaver Burk plot ) offers a great way to visualize the inhibition . In the presence of I , both Vm and Km decrease . Therefore , -1/Km , the x-intercept on the plot , will get more negative , and 1/Vm will get more positive . It turns out that they change to the same extent . Therefore the plots will consist of a series of parallel lines , which is the hallmark of uncompetitive inhibition . <p> An equation , shown in the diagram above , can be derived which shows the effect of the uncompetitive inhibitor on the velocity of the reaction . The only change is that the S term in the denominator is multiplied by the factor 1+I/Kii . We would like to rearrange this equation to show how Km and Vm are affected by the inhibitor , not S , which obviously is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kmapp = Km/ ( 1+I/Kii ) and Vmapp = Vm/ ( 1+I/Kii ) . This shows that the apparent Km and Vm do decrease as we predicted . Kii is the inhibitor dissociation constant in which the inhibitor affects the intercept of the double reciprocal plot . Note that if I is zero , Km and Vm are unchanged . <h> C4 . Noncompetitive and Mixed Inhibition <p> Reversible noncompetitive inhibition occurs when I binds to both E and ES . We will look at only the special case in which the dissociation constants of I for E and ES are the same . This is called noncompetiive inhibition . It is quite rare as it would be difficult to imagine a large inhibitor which inhibits the turnover of bound substrate having no effect on binding of S to E. However covalent interaction of protons with both E and ES can lead to noncompetitive inhibition . In the more general case , the Kd 's are different , and the inhibition is called mixed . Since inhibition occurs , we will hypothesize that ESI can not form product . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to return to ES or EI . This is illustrated in the chemical equations and in the molecular cartoon below . <p> Let us assume for ease of equation derivation that I binds reversibly to E with a dissociation constant of Kis ( as we denoted for competitive inhibition ) and to ES with a dissociation constant Kii ( as we noted for uncompetitive inhibition ) . Assume for noncompetitive inhibition that Kis = Kii . A look at the top mechanism shows that in the presence of I , as S increases to infinity , not all of E is converted to ES . That is , there is a finite amount of ESI , even at infinite S. Now remember that Vm = kcatEo if and only if all E is in the form ES . Under these conditions , the apparent Vm , Vmapp is less than the real Vm without inhibitor . In contrast , the apparent Km , Kmapp , will not change since I binds to both E and ES with the same affinity , and hence will not perturb that equilibrium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot ( Lineweaver Burk plot ) offers a great way to visualize the inhibition . In the presence of I , just Vm will decrease . Therefore , -1/Km , the x-intercept will stay the same , and 1/Vm will get more positive . Therefore the plots will consists of a series of lines intersecting on the x axis , which is the hallmark of noncompetitive inhibition . You should be able to figure out how the plots would appear if Kis is different from Kii ( mixed inhibition ) . An equation , shown in the diagram above can be derived which shows the effect of the noncompetitive inhibitor on the velocity of the reaction . In the denominator , Km is multiplied by 1+I/Kis , and S by 1+I/Kii . We would like to rearrange this equation to show how Km and Vm are affected by the inhibitor , not S , which obviously is n't . Rearranging the equation as shown above shows that Kmapp = Km(1+I/Kis)/ ( 1+I/Kii ) = Km when Kis=Kii , and Vmapp = Vm/ ( 1+I/Kii ) . This shows that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plot shows a series of lines intersecting on the x axis . Both the slope and the y intercept are changed , which are reflected in the names of the two dissociation constants , Kis and Kii . Note that if I is zero , Kmapp = Km and Vmapp = Vm . Sometimes the Kis and Kii inhibition dissociations constants are referred to as Kc and Ku ( competitive and uncompetitive inhibition dissociation constants . <p> Mixed ( and non- ) competitive inhibition ( as shown by mechanism above ) differ from competitive and uncompetiive inhibition in that the inhibitor binding is not simply a dead end reaction in which the inhibitor can only dissociate in a single reverse step . In the above equilibrium , S can dissociate from ESI to form EI so the system may not be at equilibrium . With dead end steps , no flux of reactants occurs through the dead end complex so the equilibrium for the dead end step is not perturbed . <p> Other mechanisms can commonly give mixed inhibition . For example , the product released in a ping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give mixed inhibition . <p> If P , acting as a product inhibitor , can bind to two different forms of the enzyme ( E ' and also E ) , it will act as an mixed inhibitor . <h> C5 . Enzyme Inhibition in Vitro <p> The whole pharmaceutical industrial is devoted to finding drug molecules that affect biological processes . Usually this means the development of small molecule inhibitors of target proteins , although recent work has expanded to development of inhibitory RNA molecules that affect DNA transcription and mRNA translation . Using combinatorial synthetic techniques and computational modeling , it has gotten easier to develop small molecule inhibitors ( especially competitive ones ) that inhibit proteins in vitro using purified enzymes , substrates , and inhibitors in lab testing . Assuming that the inhibitor could pass through the membrane and accumulate to a sufficient enough concentration , would it have the same inhibitory properties in the cell as in the test tube ? The answer turns out to be maybe . Remember that a cell is tightly packed with a multitude of other small molecules and macromolecules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely in part of a pathway of enzymes that feeds reactant into the enzyme and removes the product . Hence the flux of substrate and product is controlled by the entire pathway and not just the single target enzyme although the product concentration of the target enzyme is determined by kinetic parameters for the enzyme and available substrate concentration . . <p> The conditions under which the enzymes are studied ( in vitro ) and operate ( in vivo ) are very different . <p> In vitro ( in the lab ) , the enzyme is held at a constant concentration while the substrate is varied ( i.e the substrate concentration is the independent variable ) . The velocity is determined by the substrate concentration . When inhibition is studied , the substrate is varied while the inhibitor is held constant at several different fixed concentrations . <p> In vivo ( in the cell ) , the velocity might be held at a relatively fixed level with the substrate determined by the velocity . To avoid a bottleneck in flux , substrate ca n't build up at the enzyme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion to produce product as determined by the Michael-Menten equation . <p> What happens when an inhibitor is added in vivo ? Let 's assume that the enzyme is running at v = Vm/2 . We saw before for in vitro inhibition that it is sometimes difficult to differentiate competitive and uncompetiive inhibition ( as evidenced from real , not hypothetical perfect double reciprocal plots ) . How might in vivo inhibition plots look at constant velocity ( for example v=Vm/2 ) when both I and S can vary and in which S for an enzyme in the middle of a pathway is determined by v ? <p> The equations and graph below shows the ratio of S/Km vs I/Kix for inhibition at constant v , a condition encountered when an enzyme in a metabolic pathways is subject to flux controls imposed by the entire pathway . The x axis reflects the relative amount of inhibitor compared to its inhibition constant . Likewise the y axis reflects the relative amount of substrate compared to its Km . The graph for in vivo competitive inhibition is linear , but it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and associated equations are dramatically different from the very similar forms of inhibition equations and curves for in vitro inhibition at varying S and different fixed values of inhibitor . Consider the uncompetitive graph and equation . In the absence of inhibitor , if S=Km , then Vm/v = 2 and , of course , the calculated value from the equation above of S/Km = 1 . If I is allowed to increase to a value of Kii , again at constant v=Vm/2 , then the right hand side goes to infinity . <p> In a linked series of reaction , if the middle reaction is inhibited , the substrate for that enzyme builds , whether the inhibition is competitive or uncompetitive . With competitive inhibition , the substrate concentration can be raised to meet the requirements of the enzyme . But as the above figure shows , this ca n't happen for uncompetitive inhibition since as more substrate accumulates , the reaction reaches a point where the steady state is lost . <p> Obviously , this limiting case ca n't be realistically reached but it does suggest that uncompetitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metabolic pathway than competitive inhibitors . Cornish-Bowden argues that purely uncompetitive inhibitors are rare in nature because of the degree of inhibition they can hypothetical produce ( 1986 ) . Likewise he suggests that medicinal chemists should synthesize uncompetitive inhibitors if their goal is to maximally inhibit a metabolic pathway under the kind of flux control described above . Although it is more difficult to synthesis a purely uncompetitive inhibitor ( as it ca n't be modeled after the structure of a natural ligand that bind to the active site and are competitive inhibitors , he notes synthesizing mixed ( and noncompetitive ) inhibitors whose Kii values are of reasonable size compared to their Kis values , would be one approach to try . <h> C6 . Agonist and Antagonist of Ligand Binding to Receptors - An Extension <p> The analysis of competitive , uncompetitive and noncompetitive inhibitors of enzymes can now be extended to understand how the activity of membrane receptors are affected by the binding of drugs . When receptors bind their natural target ligands ( hormones , neurotransmitters ) , a biological effect is elicited . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmembrane protein , which activates intracellular activities . The bound receptor usually does not directly express biological activity , but initiates a cascade of events which leads to expression of intracellular activity . In some cases , however , the occupied receptor actually expresses biological activity itself . For example , the bound receptor can acquire enzymatic activity , or become an active ion channel . <p> Drugs targeted to membrane receptors can have a variety of effects . They may elicit the same biological effects as the natural ligand . If so , they are called agonists . Conversely they may inhibit the biological activity of the receptor . If so they called antagonists <p> Agonist <p> An agonist is a mimetic of the natural ligand and produces a similar biological effect as the natural ligand when it binds to the receptor . It binds at the same binding site , and leads , in the absence of the natural ligand , to either a full or partial response . In the latter case , it is called a partial agonist . The figure below shows the action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another kind of agonist , given the bizarre name inverse agonist . This term only makes sense when applied to a receptor that has a basal ( or constitutive ) activity in the absence of a bound ligand . If either the natural ligand or an agonist binds to the receptor site , the basal activity is increased . If however , an inverse agonists binds , the activity is decreased . An example of an inverse agonist ( which we will discuss later ) is the binding of the drug Ro15-4513 to the GABA receptor , which also binds benzodiazepines such as valium . When occupied by its natural ligand , GABA , the protein receptor is " activated " to become a channel allowing the inward flow of Cl- into a neural cell , inhibiting neuron activation . Valium potentiates the effect of GABA , which is enhanced even further in the presence of ethanol . Ro15-4513 binds to the benzodiazepine site , which leads to the opposite effect of valium , the inhibition of the receptor bound activity - a chloride channel . <p> As there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ligand ( hormone , neurotransmitter ) , agonist , partial agonist , and even inverse agonists . We can think of them as inhibitors of receptor activity , much as we considered in the sections above inhibitors of enzyme activity . As such , there can be different types of antagonists . These include : <p> competitive antagonist , which are drugs that bind to the same site as the natural ligand , agonists , or partial agonist , and inhibit the effect of the natural ligand or agonist . They would be analogous to competitive inhibitors of enzyme . One could also imagine a scenario in which an " allosteric " antagonist binds to an allosteric site on the receptor , inducing a conformational change in the receptor so the ligand , agonist , or partial agonist could not bind . <p> noncompetitive antagonist ( or perhaps more generally mixed antagonist ) which are drugs that bind to a different site on the receptor than the natural ligand , agonist , or partial agonist , and inhibit the biological effect of the natural ligand or agonist . In analogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may change the apparent KD for the ligand , agonist , or partial agonist ( the ligand concentration required to achieve half-maximal biological effects ) , but will change the maximal response to the ligand ( as mixed inhibitors change the apparent Vmax . The figure below shows the action of a competitive and noncompetitive antagonist . <p> irreversible agonist , which arises from covalent modification of the receptor . <h> C7 . Inhibition by Temperature and pH Changes <p> From 0 to about 40-50o C , enzyme activity usually increases , as do the rates of most reactions in the absence of catalysts . ( Remember the general rule of thumb that reaction velocities double for each increase of 10oC . ) . At higher temperatures , the activity decreases dramatically as the enzyme denatures . <p> affect E in ways to alter the binding of S to E , which would affect Km <p> affect E in ways to alter the actual catalysis of bound S , which would affect kcat <p> affect E by globally changing the conformation of the protein <p> affect S by altering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that certain side chains necessary for catalysis must be in the correct protonation state . Thus , some side chain , with an apparent pKa of around 6 , must be deprotonated for optimal activity of trypsin which shows an increase in activity with the increase centered at pH 6 . Which amino acid side chain would be a likely candidate ? <p> See the following figure which shows how pH effects on enzyme kinetics can be modeled at the chemical and mathematical level .
