Once connected , place the ISP router in bridge mode so threat actors can not take advantage of the backdoor access your ISP has to their router . <p> Invest in Network Protection Services Subscribe to services that block home systems from visiting known malicious websites .

That 's the nature of the software business . With time and effort , security researchers , admins , users and hackers find vulnerabilities within software that can compromise the integrity of the application or even the entire system . These vulnerabilities are often taken seriously by the application developer who will then attempt to get a patch out the door to their customers to neutralize the threat posed by the vulnerability . <p> Unfortunately , many organizations do n't  have a fully developed patch management system or are averse to patching their live systems unless they have no choice but to update . <p> Each time a new vulnerability or exploit makes the news we are inundated with recommendations as to how we can protect ourselves from the threat . A reoccurring theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . <h> The Making Of A Major Exploit <p> Applying a patch directly to a production environment is not advisable ; if at all possible , deploy the patch to a test environment to prevent service interruptions . Some of the most successful exploits available are attributed to software vulnerabilities that are years old and continue to be targeted due to poor patch management . Do n't  make attackers ' jobs easier , patch your software ! <p> A patch management process is not something you can set and forget . It 's essential to manage the process and keep it flowing smoothly with periodic assessments of effectiveness . According to Microsoft , a sound patch management process contains the following elements : <p> Testing Test the patch for potential issues prior to deploying the patch to your production environment <p> Deployment Deploy to production environment once the testing process is complete <p> Maintenance Make adjustments as needed to the process to ensure that patches are being deployed correctly and you have the whole picture on the state of your system 's security <h> Malicious IPs Targeting WordPress <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity against our customers , especially the REST API exploit .

The latest tally was more than 1.5 million websites affected , many of which displayed images attributing the defacement to the hacker who got there first , or in several cases , the most recent hacker to utilize the vulnerability to deface the vulnerable websites . The REST API vulnerability was patched by WordPress on January 26th , and the news of the update went public on February 1st . Multiple hacking campaigns ensued . The most successful of which was performed by the hacker MuhmadEmad with more than 400k websites defaced , followed by SA3D HaCk3D with 280k+ defacements . The campaigns are still ongoing , but as more and more sites update their WordPress , the success rates continue to drop . This extended campaign mirrors many major vulnerability announcements : there is a mad dash to exploit as many vulnerable machines as possible before the administrators have time to patch , while some will remain unpatched for years . <h> SELF-HEALING MALWARE <p> Self-healing is great for comic book heroes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered by Magento developer , Jeroen Boersma , and afflicts Magento-powered online stores . The malware is executed inside the database and written in SQL . Each time it executes , the malware checks to ensure its code can function properly . This way , it has the ability to heal from admin countermeasures . While in place , the malware can intercept the customer 's credit card data and send it back to the attacker . This is a departure from the normal JavaScript code used to steal information during credit card transactions . Unfortunately , the solutions are not as straightforward . In fact , one possible solution advocated is that malware detection should include database analysis . <h> GHOSTADMIN , DATA THEFT VIA BOTNET <p> Botnets are generally associated with various forms of denial of service attacks , now , thanks to the researchers at MalwareHunterTeam , we can add data theft to their repertoire . The newly discovered piece of malware , GhostAdmin , masquerades as a legitimate antivirus tool , downloaded by an unsuspecting user . What they actually install is a new form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting botnet who will then route it back to the botnet owner . GhostAdmin attempts to appear as a legitimate antivirus ( Symantec , Avast , Avira ) while hiding its actions from the user by cleaning up logs and making itself persistent in order to survive a reboot . In addition to data theft , there are more commands available for the malware to carry out on the target machine . These include installation of other software , hijacking other devices and monitoring user activity on the device . Effective user training can reduce the likelihood of a risky download taking place . <h> YAHOO CEO PUNISHED FOR HANDLING OF BREACH <p> The fallout of the massive breach of Yahoo users in 2014 amounts to a fine for the Yahoo CEO , Marissa Mayer . She and her leadership team were found to have improperly handled the breach when it was initially discovered . As a result of the investigation 's findings , Mayer lost her stock award and cash bonus . The CEO was not the only one affected . Yahoo 's top lawyer , Ronald Bell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled the response . The company 's handling of the breach and its disclosure is the subject of two federal investigations as well as more than 40 lawsuits . The direct expense of the breach investigation cost Yahoo more than 14 million dollars . However , the total cost of the breach is much higher . With the Verizon takeover looming for Yahoo , valuation of the company has dropped by $350 million . This clearly demonstrates the business impact of a breach . Hopefully , others will see this as a prominent reminder of the impact to a company 's bottom line when security and incident response are not properly addressed . 53419 @qwx253419

We 're talking about the lack of data backup best practices . It 's a widespread issue and something that significantly enhances threat actor effectiveness . Without a proper backup of the affected data , your options for recovery are limited in the event of compromise . In the case of ransomware , this means you 'll either have to pay or risk the possibility of losing the affected data entirely . While not inherently an exciting topic , data backups are critical to the restoration of operations post-incident . That 's why we decided to take a break from our standard external threat-focused format to stress the importance of data backups and the best practices every organization should incorporate into their security program . <h> How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data . Before implementing a backup plan , you must determine what data you want to protect and the importance of that data . This process determines the frequency your backups should occur . Additionally , by classifying the data , you can also determine any storage requirements . If there 's PII , financial or medical data , then additional considerations must be taken when establishing your backup plan , such as encryption and retention policies . <p> Make a backup plan . Carefully lay out what data will be backed up and at what interval . The plan should also cover retention periods and offsite storage agreements . Its not advisable to keep all backups on the same network or at the same site . During the planning phase , you might find that offsite storage solutions are too expensive for your organization and a cloud-based backup solution would be a better fit . For offsite locations , ensure that data is encrypted while at rest and while being transferred to offsite locations . <p> Test your backups in a non-production environment . Rolling out an untested backup plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or loss of data . It 's wise to roll out and test your backup plan in a non-production environment . Testing should cover various scenarios where data would be lost or compromised . <p> Roll out the backup plan . Once you have cleared the testing hurdle , roll out the backup plan to your live environment .

Unfortunately , for a small town in Ohio , this scenario unfolded when government employees discovered they were unable to access their computer or phone systems . The attackers demanded payment for the officials to resume using the towns systems . This is n't the first time a local government was hit with ransomware , and , unfortunately , it wo n't be the last . The full details of the ransomware strain used in this attack have n't been released , but as with any ransomware case , backups and user training are the most effective means of recovery and prevention . <h> WHEN BACKUPS FAIL <p> Phishing remains the most effective means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since its inception , phishing campaigns have been resource intensive since managing hosts and covering tracks is time-consuming .

WannaCry <p> Firewall ( External ) Firewall rules can be used to restrict internet access to internal resources . By only allowing inbound traffic to a minimal number of servers/services , the attack surface of your organization can be minimized . Since the primary infection vector of Wannacry was remote exploitation of SMBv1 via port 445 , a firewall rule on the edge of a company 's network blocking inbound traffic destined for port 445 would have prevented external infection . A similar rule prohibiting an organization 's machines from connecting to random machines on the internet on 445 would have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . <p> Network Segmentation " By dividing network resources into segments ( either through the use of additional firewalls or utilization of VLANs ) and restricting communications between these segments , the spread of worms such as Wannacry within an organization could have been minimized or prohibited . <p> OS Hardening Even if you cant have the latest patch , you can still disable unneeded services . Doing so reduces the number of potential attack points that exist on your systems . It also limits an adversarys options for movement should a compromise occur . In the case of Wannacry , a single line of code could have been used by a system administrator to disable SMBv1 and prevent a machine from being compromised . <p> For large enterprises , Windows Group Policy may also have been used to disable SMBv1 for all domain attached systems . <p> Firewall ( Host-Based ) " Firewalls on endpoints can also be used to minimize the number of exploitable services from within an organization . If you ca n't segregate the network utilizing VLANs or internal firewalls , host-based firewalls provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laterally . <p> Anti-Virus Software " No anti-virus software can catch everything , but installing one on each system that can support it serves as an additional hurdle for an adversary to overcome . Even if an attacker successfully exploits a system , the A/V can serve as the last line of defense and detect known payloads that an attacker might send . <h> Malicious IPs <p> We 've seen the following IPs involved in various malicious activity , and have taken steps to block them from our environment . We highly recommend blocking these IPs until they can be remediated and no longer pose a threat . It is prudent to heavily scrutinize any communications from your network to these IPs , especially C2 nodes . <p> IP <p> Attack Signature <p> IP Address Geo Location <p> 50.62.239.1 <p> Phishing <p> United States <p> 78.162.162.215 <p> Command and Control <p> Turkey <p> 89.16.176.158 <p> Malware Host <p> Great Britain <p> 27.145.126.63 <p> Command and Control <p> Thailand <p> 179.40.166.123 <p> SSH Brute Force <p> Argentina <p> 77.246.144.79 <p> Phishing <p> Russia <p> 190.50.230.202 <p> SSH Brute <p> Argentina <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Switzerland <p> 118.212.186.91 <p> SSH Brute Force <p> China <p> 109.120.189.36 <p> Phishing <p> Russia <p> 82.217.114.19 <p> Webshell Huntin <p> Netherland <p> 186.95.15.36 <p> Command and Control <p> Venezuela <p> 113.223.87.191 <p> Webshell Hunting <p> China <h> Security Trends and Insights <h> GOLDEN AGE OF CYBER ESPIONAGE <p> Espionage has long been the domain of nations with the financial resources needed to carry out an effective operation .

@@25520185 @5520185/ <h> CYBER SECURITY &amp; THREAT INTELLIGENCE FROM THE EXPERTS AT ARMOR . <h> Best Practices For Lowering Ransomware Risk <p> In recent months , ransomware campaign activity has increased exponentially . More than 27,000 incidents surged on the scene in early 2017 when a commonly misconfigured setting on open source database called MongoDB made hundreds of thousands of databases vulnerable to ransom . Threat actors logged on to victims ' databases , backed up data offsite , deleted it and offered to return it for .2 Bitcoins , which translates to $200 . <p> While this might seem like a minuscule amount , there is logic behind it . If too much is asked , the propensity to pay declines . Plus , the volume of the attack yields serious dividends . Regardless , for those afflicted , losing access to important information to operate a business is extremely disconcerting , creating desperation and making them prone to pay-up . <h> The Mechanics <p> There are two primary vectors into a commercial IT environment . The first is to assume remote access to a user 's computer and traverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are gained . This is accomplished by sending an employee a phishing email that entices them to open an attachment or visit a compromised website that loads malicious code on their computer terminal . Once the computer is compromised , threat actors scan the environment and try to find a computer terminal used to access network data . After a foothold on an administrator 's computer is established , they can remotely encrypt or wipe data and then issue ransom demands . <p> The second method is more of a frontal assault on the database servers . Most companies have public facing websites and as a result , threat actors will find a server with a vulnerable application , then exploit it to get a foothold in the data center . If an IT staff has not properly separated public facing websites from database servers and file shares - a common mistake with small staffs - a threat actor can use that access to pursue the database . While this vector requires more sophistication , ransomware actors are increasingly pivoting in this direction , implying that more skilled actors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these new techniques in play , what can security teams do to mitigate the threat ? The good news is that your IT staff is probably already doing many of the things needed to protect your environment . Here are a few best practices to help lower the risk further : <p> User Vector : <p> Establish a third-party user education program on how to identify a phishing email <p> Shut down the ability for user terminals to share resources peer-to-peer <p> Implement a back-up strategy for personal data on external drives or virtual drives <p> Install a reputable antivirus program that will block a majority of known ransomware attacks <p> Website Vector : <p> Never host an external-facing server on the same hardware as a database or data store <p> Have an incident response plan in place before an incident occurs . Having a plan in place allows for the immediate documentation all of the possible decisions and communication plans that need to be applied under the pressure of a real-life incident . <p> Visit the NoMoreRansom.org website to seek assistance .

The majority experts ' view is consistent with those of the Federal Bureau of Investigation " do not pay. - However , this is an easy decision for third-parties to make because it is someone else 's data being ransomed . <p> At the end of the day , the decision will come down to the impact of the attack on your company 's business . While ransomware actors do in many cases return the data as promised , they may leave backdoors to return for more money , time and time again , or may not return data at all . <p> These present very unattractive options , so it is best to avoid falling prey in the first place .

Once in , they 'll use a web shell to maintain their presence on the targeted machine and attempt to elevate their permissions to the root level . <p> What is DirtyCOW ? <p> Until recently , gaining initial access for a privsec attack was challenging for even the most talented threat actors . However , that 's no longer the case with the release of the Linux zero-day privilege escalation exploit , DirtyCOW . <p> DirtyCOW is a bug that has been present in the majority of Linux kernels since 2007 . There were attempts to fix the issue when it was first discovered 11 years ago , however these were abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , the bug is now easily recreated , enabling threat actors to locally exploit a race condition in the copy-on-write ( COW ) kernel memory subsystem .

The Armor network has been updated to defend against these threats . <h> ARMOR DIRTYCOW VULNERABILITY FIX <p> Due to the direct correlation between the number of FIM events and the DirtyCow vulnerability fix , a large amount of FIM events ( potentially 50K ) will be triggered by the kernel file attributes being modified . Please note this is not an indication of security concern . <h> Mitigating These Threats <p> Privilege Escalation <p> The majority of privesc exploits prey on unpatched operating systems and software . Ensuring your system has the latest patch is critical to alleviating these vulnerabilities . After initial disclosure of a new exploit , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalize on it . Fortunately , even if an exploit is released without corresponding patches there are steps you can take to minimize the chance that initial access to your environment takes place : <p> Patch vulnerable operating systems , software and firmware " Apply patch or firmware updates as soon as they 're available . This applies to your entire environment , not just web facing servers . You can reduce the likelihood an attacker compromising a vulnerable web service or an application on a host workstation by patching . <p> Scrutinize outbound traffic " Look for outbound traffic reaching out to known bad IPs . After initial access , threat actors will perform a wget command to pull additional files for exploitation . This may also be an attempt to connect with a command and control server for post-exploitation instructions . <p> Adhere to least privilege " All users and applications within your environment should operate on the least amount of privilege required to function . Running applications with elevated permissions increases the chance that a programming error might allow an attacker to use elevated application permissions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Applying updated patches is the only way to remove this security vulnerability . CentOS , Red Hat , Debian and Ubuntu have released patches with other distros to roll out theirs soon . Since some older versions of Linux dsitros may not be patched , we highly advise that you upgrade to a newer version of the Linux OS . <p> It 's important to note this bug is n't an exploit in itself and does n't grant threat actors remote access . However , once they have remote access , it allows them to use a wide array of remote exploits and web shells to gain root permissions in targeted machines that normally restrict user level access .

The victims are piling up , the money being paid to hackers is exorbitant , and the chances of getting ahead of this threat seem grim . <p> If you look hard enough though , you can find the heroes in every situation . Today , I was made aware of a new website , www.nomoreransom.org , where law enforcement and IT security companies are collaborating on a free , educational resource for victims ( and potential victims ) of ransomware . Their purpose is to educate the public of the threat and make all of us aware that WE DO NT HAVE TO PAY THE RANSOM ! <p> This project is amazing and there are three big reasons it should be on your radar as it continues to expand <p> 1 . Crypto Sheriff : Youve been hit by the most recent version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school paper due or you need to access an e-copy of your birth certificate . <p> Whatever the reason you have for accessing that data , it 's probably time sensitive . The last thing you need in your life right now is to have to pay a strange hacker on the other side of the world $600 so you can access your files again . <p> So , DO NT ! Go to the Crypto Sheriff page to find out what type of ransomware has taken hold of your files . You can upload the actual file to see if there 's a solution available . I highly recommend you also take advantage of the open entry spot on the page where you can enter in file names , keywords , domain names and any clue as to the type of ransomware . Many of the file names have the name of the ransomware in it . For example : KryptoLockerREADME. txt , ERROR? txt , filename.crypt , etc . <p> 2 .

This project is still in its early phases , but as it matures you can expect more versions of ransomware decryption tools to become available . <p> 3 . Report a ransomware crime : Now you can report that ransomware to your local ( US or European ) law enforcement agency . The Report USA button will take you to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center . Save all of the details of your incident , as it 's much easier for the FBI to prevent these crimes if they know exactly what they are fighting . <p> As a security professional , I look at this great reference tool and ca n't help but think of suggestions to make it even better , including : <p> More community involvement !

If you are locked from your computer and thieves already have access to your information , do n't pay , let them have it because chances are that they 've already taken what they wanted and regardless of payment , will do with it what they originally had intended . If your files are backed up , there 's nothing for them to bargain with .

If you 've tackled PCI compliance in the past , you might remember that PCI DSS 2.0 was n't always clear on the kind of documentation needed . Because of this ambiguity , many people " such as auditors , QSAs or security professionals " had questions on just what they had to provide . <p> Luckily , PCI 3.0 , 3.1 and 3.2 include additional detail . Instead of simply being told to document something , you 'll know what you need to document . Let 's look at the areas you 'll need to focus on thoroughly documenting . <p> Inventories As you know from defining your CDE , creating an inventory of all relevant components is critical . You 'll need to include all security services and segmentation systems , virtualization and network components and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mix as well . <p> Remember that you must describe your processes " - their purposes and functions " - and all relevant personnel , such as employees who process cardholder data or have access to cryptographic keys . Finally , remember this is n't a one-time obligation . Your inventory must be accurate at all times . <p> Policies &amp; Procedures Here we 're talking specifically about your compliance policies , which are high-level statements concerning a particular area and the procedures you implement to carry out those policies . <p> Why does PCI ask for these ? Because they want you to show that you understand the intent of PCI controls and have successfully implemented them within your environment . <p> Penetration Testing- We 've talked about the importance of penetration ( pen ) testing to ensure your new controls are working as intended . As you may have guessed , this is something else you 'll need to document . PCI 3.0 and 3.1 required that you develop and document a pen-testing methodology that will validate your cardholder data environment ( CDE ) definition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct your pen testing . <p> Change Control PCI 3.2 adds a new documentation requirement to your change control program . You must now add an analysis of the potential impact on PCI controls for every change within a CDE . This is not an insignificant addition as it will require work beyond documentation to implement an analysis process . <p> After you 've detailed every kind of threat ( e.g. , natural disasters , malicious human attacks and environmental threats ) , you 'll need to assign risk levels to each by assessing the likelihood of those threats occurring , as well as the severity of their impact . This means assessing the number of people impacted , the cost of the impact , and the impact to your brand reputation . Finally , you 'll create and implement risk mitigation strategies . <p> How does this relate to your PCI documentation ?

@@25520267 @5520267/ <p> Detailing almost 24 million cyberattacks , FireHost has seen a large percentage increase in the number of common Web attacks such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery . This increase can be attributed to ease of automation , enabling hackers to combine these techniques to quickly and surreptitiously steal data , install malware on servers , assimilate new botnet zombies or simply take down a site . For instance , Directory Traversal ( 23 percent of Q2s Superfecta attack traffic ) , which helps identify what files are on a system and accesses files that are n't  intended to be publicly available , may be used during the " reconnaissance phase " before attacking another vulnerability using techniques such as a SQL Injection , where the attacker or group of attackers can steal credit card details , usernames , passwords and other sensitive data . <p> Compared with Q1 2013 , the volume of Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ) attacks rose 16 percent while SQL Injection attacks , which have increased in each of the last five quarters , rose another 28 percent in Q2 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most prevalent attack type , with more than 1.2 million attacks being blocked this quarter , the small percentage increase ( just 0.7 percent ) in this type of attack suggests that XSS , when used in concert with other exploits , enables cybercriminals to gain access to more complex , higher reward attack vectors . What 's even more alarming is that these blended , automated attacks are being used increasingly from within cloud service provider networks . <p> " Cybercriminals can easily deploy and administer powerful botnets that run on cloud infrastructure , " said FireHost founder and CEO Chris Drake . " Unfortunately , many cloud providers do n't  adequately validate new customer sign-ups so opening accounts with fake information is quite easy . Once the account is created , application programming interfaces can be leveraged to deploy a lot of computing power on fast networks , giving a person the ability to create substantial havoc with minimal effort .

" Cybercriminals are also enumerating target workstation clients to identify software VPN connections to shared services platforms and accordingly , taking over workstations to gain access into cloud environments . " <p> IP Reputation Management <p> Since the start of 2013 , FireHost customers have been protected by an IP Reputation Management ( IPRM ) system . In the second quarter of 2013 , the IPRM system filtered about 10 million instances of illegitimate traffic , and to date in 2013 , 1.3 million unique attackers have been blocked , an average of 138,000 attacks per day . <p> " IPRM filters many types of illegitimate traffic including botnet command and control servers , botnet zombies , phishing attempts , spam and other malicious sources , " said Chris Hinkley , CISSP and senior security architect at FireHost . " Implementing this system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our customers by about 40 percent since the last quarter , which translates to an increase in our infrastructures performance and efficiency , even as we continue to add new customers with higher computing power needs .

Today we 're going to talk about another important step : validating your Cardholder Data Environment ( CDE . ) We talked a few weeks ago about defining your CDE and limiting your scope " steps that are critical to beginning your compliance journey . <p> Now you 'll need to prove and document those boundaries . This is n't just a smart compliance practice , but a PCI requirement as well . You ca n't just explain the boundaries of your CDE ; to meet 3.0 standards you need to prove that the boundaries you 've defined actually exist . <p> Testing Your Environment <p> Your first move will be running cardholder data searches . This is important for several reasons " one of which is that organizations often make dangerous assumptions about where their data is and do n't bother to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card information often ends up in rogue locations , so you 'll need to search your entire environment both on the systems where you think it exists as well as on more unlikely places . <p> If you 're wondering how data could end up in atypical places , the answer is very simple : the human element . Employees often create their own processes or habits to get their jobs done in a way that 's outside of policy , but convenient for them . One might put data in an Excel spreadsheet and save that on a local machine . Someone else might be putting full credit card numbers into emails or notes . It 's impossible to predict the random solutions employees will create to make their own jobs easier , so it 's critical to search everywhere . If you do n't yet have a tool you 're happy with for this , check out the options on the market that allow you to search for certain types of data . <p> This is also the time to examine your entire system , and review your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've described . Remember , you must ultimately prove that you 've segmented your networks sufficiently , so get on each network and see if you can get to the others . This will tell you if your segmentation controls are working as they should . <p> Finally , you also have to put some focus on pen testing . Per 3.0 , you need to have a documented pen testing methodology to prove that your segmentation approach is successful . If you have n't actually done a pen test in a while , now is the time to have someone do one , to make sure you 'll have enough time to address any deficiencies that are found . And of course , you 'll need written documentation proving your validation . <h> Kurt Hagerman <h> Chief Information Security Officer <p> As chief information security officer ( CISO ) for Armor , Kurt Hagerman is responsible for all aspects of security and compliance for both corporate and customer facing products .
