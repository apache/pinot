My friends and I who had witnessed the tsunami wanted to support the areas recovery from the disaster as best as we could so with with the support of Glasgows Lord Provost Liz Cameron established the charity Hikkaduwa Area Relief Fund ( HARF ) . We started with a programme of restarting businesses , and created a boatyard to allow for the rebuilding of the fishing fleet . Once wed rebuilt around 250 plus boats , we asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boatyard and they said they would like to set up a community arts organisation . <p> This became the Chandrasevana centre , and with funding from the then Scottish Arts Council and the INSITU Network , along with support from the Glasgow School of Art , we were able to start bringing in Scottish and international artists to live and work in the village . <p> In 2010 the lease on the centre finished , but the initiative continued at new premises at Sura Medura including a programme of artist residencies supported by Creative Scotland , Arts Council England and INSITU . Artists in residence work closely with the local community and are inspired by the areas culture and story , creating work of an incredibly high standard . <h> Can you tell us a bit more about the upcoming Sura Medura Exhibition at the Briggait ? <p> Scotland-based artists Nichola Scrutton and Natasha Russell will present collaborative work Wave Shift that emerged in the months following their time on the Sura Medura residency at the end of 2016 .

Well also be joined by artists who literally returned from residency two weeks ago Zoe Katsilerou , Ross Whyte and Lewis Sherlock , so its set to be an incredibly interesting evening . Essentially the exhibition is a retrospective and an appreciation of the exceptional standard of work that has been created as a consequence of Sura Medura . <p> Ive been thinking a lot recently about how we can best connect Scottish audiences with the work created through and inspired by Sura Medura , and at the launch Im excited to make some announcements about new initiatives that will do exactly that . <h> Are there any common threads that run through the work being presented in the exhibition ? <p> Undeniably , the culture of Sri Lanka , the culture of that particular area and the situation we started with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another common theme that tends to emerge is just how life-changing the experience can be . The shock of suddenly being totally emerged in a different culture and climate often results in some real self-reflection , and the artists find themselves asking questions of identity and meaning . Residents are encouraged to blog throughout their residency and these can make for some very interesting and revealing reading , watching and listening . <p> So , I 'd say certainly the culture of the area and the personal impact of the experience itself are the common threads that run through the work presented in the upcoming exhibition . <h> What is it like to be a Sura Medura resident ? <p> In terms of facilities there is lots of open space , as well as an open-air studio to allow for different approaches and practices .

It factors in casual culture and its link to street style , ideas surrounding football as a territory of designated authenticity in Scotland and examining this in the context of artistic production . <p> The phenomenon of Mockintosh , originally coined by filmmaker Murray Grigor , who 's documentary films feature in the publication , is also explored and raises questions around how we look at and value craft practices in Scotland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making in the context of Glasgows rich history of staging major events and festivals .

We work well together in the joint production of programmes that can extend the ideas and provocations that textiles can contain . Our exhibitions , public events and publications highlight style and clothing as refined but complex tools for expressing ideas of culture and of identity . <h> Who is The Inventors of Tradition II for ? <p> The exhibition and a series of events held last year were very much for a public audience and the book has the same ambition .

The album was recorded at the legendary Rockfield Studio in South Wales with Scottish producer Bruce Rintoul , and mixed by Adam Noble ( Placebo , Nothing But Thieves , Don Broco ) the record showcases the band 's ability to craft beautiful , emotional , uplifting , well-wrought songs that take their time to do their magic . <p> Frightened Rabbit ' Painting of a Panic Attack ' <p> Ever since Scott Hutchison started releasing music as Frightened Rabbit more than a decade ago , his emotionally honest and incisively worded lyrics have been among the projects most beloved qualities . Over the course of five albums , including their new Painting of a Panic Attack , Frightened Rabbits frontman has made poetry of his misery , and still somehow managed to make it sound anthemic . <p> Honeyblood ' Babes Never Die ' <p> Babes Never Die ' was recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by acclaimed producer James Dring , whose work with the likes of Jamie T and Gorillaz made him an intriguing choice for the duo .

Fronted by the Reid brothers , Jim and William , The Jesus And Mary Chain first reformed to play the Coachella festival back in 2007 . Despite regular touring most notably a 2015 world tour which revisited their landmark album Psychocandy it took some time before they could agree on a plan to record a much-mooted seventh album . <p> King Creosote ' Astronaut Meets Appleman ' <p> King Creosote , one of our most beloved voices , released his new record Astronaut Meets Appleman on the 2nd September 2016 . It explores the tension and harmony between tradition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling , King Creosote ( otherwise known as Fifes Kenny Anderson ) says , of " being caught between heaven and earth " . <p> Konx-om-Pax ' Caramel ' <p> Tom Konx-om-Pax Scholefields Caramel is quite a different record from the dark , mould-pocked ambience of his debut Regional Surrealism . Although its primarily a beatless album , its one with a big smile on its face . Caramel has a lightness and energy , an unrepentant joyful cheesiness even - like the rave piano and spiralling arpeggios of Cosmic Trigger or the big beatless build up of the title track . <p> Meursault ' I Will Kill Again ' <p> I Will Kill Again ' was intended to be a direct follow up to ' Something for the Weakened ' - a straight-up rock album . That record never got made , the live band dissolved and Neil started to play solo under the name Supermoon . In most cases , the songs became unrecognisable from their previous incarnations , but the lyrics and themes remained . Loosely , it 's about the idea of villainy within a narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own story . <p> Modern Studies ' Swell To Great ' <p> Working throughout the year at Pumpkinfield Petes rural Perthshire studio the band shaped a set of Emilys skeleton songs , drawing largely from the salt and spray of the sea . This communal arts-und-crafts-werk resulted in their debut LP Swell to Great ( named after an organ stop ) , which was released on Song , by Toad Records of Edinburgh , Scotland in September 2016 . <p> Mogwai ' Atomic ' <p> Constructed entirely of archive film , Atomic is an impressionistic kaleidoscope of the horrors of our nuclear times - protest marches , Cold War sabre-rattling , Chernobyl and Fukishima - but also the sublime beauty of the atomic world , and how x-rays and MRI scans have improved human lives . Mogwais soundtrack encapsulates the nightmare of the nuclear age , but its dreamlike qualities too . It is the latest in the bands series of impressive soundtracks and scores , following acclaimed albums Les Revenants ( The Returned ) and Zidane : A 21st Century Portrait . <p> Pictish Trail ' Future Echoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun-warped pop lens , where mesmerically-melodic guitar patterns collide with sampled gurgles and blissed-out vocals figure-skate over sine-waves of glacial synth . Future Echoes is a very personal musing on mortality , the death of friendships and the finality of things and represents the most confident , cohesive and pop-savvy collection of music Pictish Trail has written to date . <p> Rachel Newton ' Here 's My Heart Come Take It ' <p> Here 's My Heart Come Take It is a bold combination of traditional folk song and original composition set in a contemporary soundscape . Experimenting and improvising in the studio combined with a considered choice of material has resulted in a very personal and heartfelt piece of work . <p> RM Hubbert ' Telling The Trees ' <p> Returning to the collaborative format that saw him reconnect with a host of old friends and pick up a Scottish Album of the Year ( SAY ) Award for 2012s Thirteen Lost &amp; Found , RM Hubbert is back , and at the vanguard of another extraordinary ensemble of musicians and songwriters . In many ways a reflection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trees highlights the remarkable lyricism and musicianship of his individual co-writers whilst managing to cohere into a dazzling masterwork for all concerned . <p> Starless is the lushly orchestrated debut album from Paul McGeechan . An epic and unique album - widescreen in scope and ambition , featuring such illustrious collaborators as Paul Buchanan ( The Blue Nile ) , Karen Matheson ( Capercaillie ) , Julie Fowlis and Chris Thomson ( The Bathers ) . The album was recorded with the stunning Prague Philharmonic Orchestra resulting in an emotional soundscape with references ranging from Ennio Morricone to The Cocteau Twins and David Sylvian . <p> Teenage Fanclub ' Here ' <p> Here was recorded in Provence and Pollokshields , mixed in Hamburg , and mastered in London . The band worked on it slowly until they were happy with it , and then they put it out . Since their inception in 1989 and now , not much has changed , they 're still doing the same thing , in much the same way as they always have . <p> Scottish quartet VUKOVI mix heavy rock riffs with melodic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is fun .

@@43257712 @3257712/ <h> #sugarwater - behind the scenes of Deaf and disabled theatre <p> This Sunday , the Glasgow Film Festival will screen #sugarwater - an eye-opening documentary following pioneering Deaf and disabled theatre company , Graeae , as they rehearse for Jack Thornes " The Solid Life of Sugar Water " , a searing two-person drama about a miscarriage and its ramifications in a couples relationship . We spoke to director and producer Jo Lewis to find out why she felt this was an important tale to tell . <h> How did #sugarwater come about ? What was the inspiration to tell this story ? <p> I wanted to make a film that would inspire and persuade Deaf and disabled people who were thinking about getting involved in the Arts in some way , that they really should give it a go ! Following the work of Graeae allowed me to explore not only what life was like being a Deaf or disabled performer but also to engage with challenges faced by Deaf of disabled people seeking to watch or access theatre . <p> I also wanted to help people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it as part of their life , to understand some of the issues that Deaf and Disabled performers and audiences face . <p> Making theatre as accessible as possible is incredibly important . Coming together to share and tell stories is very much what theatre is all about. -&amp;nbspJo Lewis , Director of #sugarwater <p> I am the mother of a son with learning disabilities and before he was born I was a filmmaker working in drama and also documentaries with Glasgow-based IWC . After my son was born I got to know first hand how isolating and lonely the experience of living with disability could be , and also how limiting life and activity choices can be . <p> What really impressed me about Graeae is their worldview . They do not speak of disability , but talk of access . Give a Deaf person a signing interpreter and suddenly the disability barrier goes away - if you concentrate on the access needs then suddenly all the barriers go away , and anything and everything is possible . Its a social model of disability and provides the foundations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I 'd heard anyone in connection with disabilities speaking about it in this way . It changed the way I think about life and changed everything about how I approached my life with my son . <p> One of my early experiences of working in film was meeting my Deaf friend who was a clapper loader when I was a 3rd Assistant Director . She was on the FT2 trainee scheme , which sadly does not exist any more . When she graduated from the scheme , she really struggled to get work while the other graduates were constantly working . Employers were really intimidated by her disability . In the end she gave up working in the film industry altogether . I guess this experience stayed with me and made me really interested in championing and promoting Disability rights and breaking down the barriers and promoting understanding within our two communities something that Creative Scotland 's recent Screen Equalities work is also focused on . <p> Recently my disabled son was sad because he really wanted to play football , but none of the other boys in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because of Graeae I knew there must be opportunities out there for him - I got in touch with a local club and he now plays football foundation for Under 10s . If it was n't for Graeae I would have accepted his limitations . They taught me to challenge convention and change perceptions . <p> I wanted to get word out there and spread the news - its time now for disabled people to be put front and center and not marginalised and made invisible as Rufus Norris ( Director of the National Theatre ) says in the film . <h> How did you first hear about Graeae ? <p> Graeae first came to my attention through the London 2012 Paralympic opening ceremony , which blew my mind ! The ceremony was directed by Artistic Director of Graeae Jenny Sealey and featured many of their performers . <p> Living and working in London at that time , there was an explosion in awareness of the challenges faced by Deaf and disabled people and suddenly seeing for the first time this invisible community that lived amongst us being made visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I made contact with Graeae about a year or so later and was shocked and dismayed by how despondent they were feeling , post 2012 . I remember Jenny saying that after the Paralympics there was this huge feeling that this was their time and that finally things would change for them but instead all they were being faced with were cuts to their working independence funds , and cuts to their disability living payments . <p> On hearing this I knew I had to make a film about Graeae - I had to show the world what Deaf and disabled people could do . So we started to chat about working together and suddenly the opportunity came up for Graeae to take The Solid Life of Sugar Water to the National for the first time and I knew that this was it this was the moment to make the film and what followed was a wonderful and extraordinary journey . <h> As a " behind the scenes " look at the production , what stories were you able to unearth ? <p> The National Theatre were unbelievably helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filming of this documentary nothing was off limits and we were able to film the actors in their dressing rooms and backstage . They very rarely give filmmakers this level of access so we were incredibly lucky . <p> I have to say most of the stories that came out were about the tour - the show had been on a rigorous regional tour on a tight timescale before it came to the National , and there were stories of only just being able to get the set into buildings in time for curtain up and such like ! When we caught up with the team they were fairly focused they had a week to get the show ready for one of the biggest stages of them all ! <p> Actually there was a real sense of excitement with everyone we met at the National about having Graeae there . It was the first time they had played host to a disabled theatre company and there was a real buzz about the place . The National Theatre under the leadership of Rufus Norris is extremely forward thinking there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to make theatre much more accessible and much more diverse . <h> From the trailer its clear that everyone is very passionate about what they 're doing ? <p> Yes , and there was a palpable sense of something special going on . Jack Thorne , who wrote The Solid Life of Sugar Water ( and how also wrote Harry Potter and The Cursed Child currently in the West End ) is incredibly passionate about Graeae , in fact so much so that he calls them the National Theatre of disability . <p> Rufus Norris the Director of the National Theatre is really passionate about bringing about change to theatre and making it much more accessible both to audiences and performers . <p> We were very lucky too to get Sir Peter Blake - a patron of Graeae - to design the titles for the front of the film . Everyone was keen to help in any way they could . <h> How did the cast and crew respond to being followed and filmed at what must have been an intense time ? <p> It was incredibly tense actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are not getting in the way or treading on anyones toes sometimes literally ! Genevieve Barr and Arthur Hughes who star in the play were understandably very nervous - the opening night at the National Theatre is one of the biggest nights of any actor 's career ! <h> Why do you feel that accessible , inclusive theatre is so important ? <p> Its really important that non-disabled people work as hard as possible to make sure life in all its areas is fully accessible for Deaf and disabled people . We live in a first world country in the year 2017 and it 's the very least that we should all expect of ourselves . <p> I guess I work in film and have in the past worked in theatre and studied theatre ( at RADA ) so making theatre as accessible as possible , on the stage , backstage and for audiences is incredibly important to me . Disability can be a very isolating experience and coming together to share and tell stories is very much what theatre is all about . <h> What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that people take away that it does not matter if you are Deaf , disabled or non-disabled there are opportunities out there and the most important thing is to explore your creativity and give it a go ! <p> Director and producer Jo Lewis will attend the screening on Sunday 19 February along with Martin Prendergast ( Director of Communication at the National Theatre ) and Amit Sharma ( Director of the Solid Life of Sugar Water and Associate Director of Graeae ) . <h> Inclusive theatre - what else is happening around Scotland ? <p> The ongoing efforts of Graeae and other inclusive theatre companies are resulting in high-quality , high-impact productions , according to Maggie Maxwell , our Head of Equalities and Diversity . <p> " From the dark and twisted tale of Blood Wedding , co-produced by Dundee Rep , to the bitter comic tragedy of The House of Bernarda Alba , translated by Edinburgh-based Jo Clifford , the work and influence of London-based Graeae Theatre Company can often be seen north of the border . <p> " Elsewhere in Scotland , Solar Bears Deaf Youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaf , deafened or hard of hearing ; Birds of Paradise touring company is helping the sector to adopt inclusive practices whilst engaging with and promoting the work of Deaf and disabled artists ; and Lung Ha 's work with people with learning disabilities has seen the creation of over 40 original productions to date . <p> " These are just a few of the many creative organisations with a particular focus on Equality and Diversity , one of Creative Scotlands Connecting Themes .

So I made French puppets and in 2008 , with the support of Puppet Animation Scotland , Le Petit Monde was set up and had its first bilingual show ' Lapin Wants Breakfast ' . I toured with Lapin and his friends in my suitcase , performing in schools , nurseries and festivals . <p> In 2014 , I was awarded Creative Scotland funding to develop a new show and then in 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and create The Wonderful World of Lapin , which is touring now and hopefully next year . <h> How did you develop the ideas that fill Lapin 's Wonderful World ? <p> The ideas came from two main strands . From my previous work - where I made , designed , wrote and performed , all on my own - we kept the concept of the character Tania travelling with her precious garden in her suitcase . In the garden lives French-speaking Lapin and his friends . <p> Then the creative team - mainly Director Alasdair Satchel , Composers Nik Paget-Tomlinson and Niroshini Thambar , and Set Designer Iain Halket - all brought their own artistic tastes and ideas to feed the concept of this little French world . <p> We also found inspiration from children , TV cartoons from our own childhood , and French personalities like Coco Chanel . It has been a fun process , especially because everyone understood perfectly the vision I had of this world . <p> I also have an ongoing inspiration in my very close relationship with my brother , from Robbygraphics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been designing all Le Petit Monde graphics since 2008 .

So I carefully choose all the French words and sentences and make sure the stories can be enjoyed by all children , no matter their language background . <p> I try to make shows that are visually attractive , with stories that the children can relate to . The characters happen to speak French so the educational side emerges naturally and children learn new words without noticing .

They seem to instantly relate to the puppets and if they could , would cover them with kisses and cuddles - sadly , they are too fragile for all this adoration ! <p> The children 's feedback and drawings also show that the characters really tap into their imagination , which of course , makes remembering French words much easier and fun . Some children have had Lapin 's photo for years in their bedroom , so I am told . Some are totally broken hearted when the show is over . It is very touching . <p> I liked the worm and the rabbit a lot !

After seven years of working on my own , I was coming to a point where it was difficult to progress . I needed the input and skills of others to create the show I wanted . Therefore , I am extremely grateful to Creative Scotland for believing in Le Petit Monde and giving me the opportunity to work with some of the best artists in children 's theatre . <p> I have learned a lot through this project and because we are now touring the show , my practice continues to develop , the audiences ' positive energy and feedback encourage and inspire me to move towards new projects .

Focusing on the lives of offshore workers and the choices they make to work on the industrial islands of the North Sea , Crude also travels to the Niger Delta and the Arctic Circle to look at the global impact of oil production and its human and ecological cost . <p> We found some time with writer and director Ben Harrison to talk about the powerful production and the challenges of staging the show in a vast ( and chilly ) shed in the Port of Dundee . <h> What was the inspiration behind the piece ? <p> The starting point occurred just after we had opened Roam , the show we made at Edinburgh Airport in 2006 . As you can imagine that was a very challenging process so as a mental exercise more than anything else I tried to think of a site that would be more difficult .

We have a very loyal following but that might have been a step too far . <p> The other issue is that space is at a premium on a rig , the accommodation is rather compact , so the only spaces would have been the canteen , or the helideck , which would have brought its own issues in terms of North Sea weather . <h> The play explores the human and ecological cost of the oil industry . How do you set about tackling these themes ? <p> With honesty and humour . We are all complicit in the oil industry . I wear contact lenses , so I have oil products in my eyes . I see the world through oil . Plastics , derived from oil , flow in our bloodstream . Modern life , with its lighting , packaging , clothes and food is unthinkable without petrochemicals .

The problem lies with the end consumer , not with us at the oilface , said one . They are risking their lives every day to sustain ours . There is a character in our play who tries to live without hydrocarbons , which leads her onto a very difficult and dangerous path . <h> Why was it important for you to bring in so many different facets of the oil industry , showing different parts of the world , different involvement with and attitudes to oil ? <p> The global oil map was drawn up in Scotland in a hunting lodge in Achnacarry , in 1928 . The Four Horsemen , the original big four oil companies , so that 's Shell , BP , Exxon and Gulf , met there . The oil barons decided , agreed and marked out the oil territories that they were to going to each control all over the world .

This was in the time shortly after the Piper Alpha explosion . One can only imagine the anxiety felt by oil families in the years after 1988 . <p> Another story came from a brilliant documentary we all watched , called Sweet Crude , where a mother talks anxiously about her favourite son who worked hard at school and had got himself an education , but she could see that he was inevitably going to take up arms in a resistance against the Nigerian government . He had tried peaceful resistance but was turning to violence after the continual murder and rape of villagers in the region and the point-blank refusal to mend burst pipelines , stop gas flaring and divert any of the huge financial rewards of oil and gas to the people whose territory the oil fields are in . <h> Site-specific theatre is a Grid Iron speciality - what 's important to you about making theatre for new and unexpected locations ? <p> New and unexpected locations keep both artists and audiences fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) but each site makes us look at theatre and the world in a different way . I also like the relationships that naturally arise between us as guests making the piece of theatre for our audiences and the hosts of that space , which in this case are the brilliant and welcoming people in charge of Dundee Ports . <p> Rather than going to a rig , as was the original intention , we have not one , not two , but three exploration rigs moored up outside Shed 36 where Crude takes place . So we are right in the heart of the oil industry , but in a reasonably accessible location . I also always like the fact that we are taking the audience somewhere they would never be allowed access to if a piece of theatre was not taking place there . There is no public access to Dundee Ports so in a way the piece of theatre is smuggling you in .

It means that we have to be scrupulous in making the show rooted in the realities of the oil and gas industry whilst of course allowing ourselves to be theatrical and magical . <p> I would say the cold would be the biggest challenge , and audiences are advised to wrap up warm . It is a vast shed : 20 metres high , 75 metres long and 63 metres wide .

Arrivals and Sailings <p> Co-written by his eldest daughter Louise Wyllie and arts journalist Jan Patience , Arrivals and Sailings " The Making of George Wyllie explores the influences and early-life that shaped the worldview and creative journey of the much-loved Scottish artist known for his memorable pieces of public art such as the life-sized Straw Locomotive and the giant seaworthy Paper Boat . <h> How did you meet and where did the idea for the book come from ? <p> Louise Wyllie ( LW ) : It had started with my father being i 'll and suffering from a condition called frontal lobe dementia . I , along with the rest of the family , were mindful that he needed stimulus and with his 90th birthday approaching and a huge amount of his art just sitting in the house we thought it would be fitting to do something celebratory involving his work . My background is in events management , so the idea was to pull together an exhibition which is how Jan got involved . <p> Jan Patience ( JP ) : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually became the Why ? sman festival . Then amidst all the planning and preparation , George passed away in May 2012 . It was obviously an incredibly intense time for Louise and the family , and suddenly the exhibition took on a whole new meaning as a celebration of his life . <p> LW : What initially was to be a three-month retrospective became a yearlong programme of exhibitions , performances around his written work , educational events and much more . We had started out with a list of things we wanted to do and on that list was writing a book , but I do n't think I 'd ever thought we would be the ones to write it ! <p> JP : We knew there was a whole untold story there through not just the work we uncovered , but also George 's diaries dating way back to 1936 which revealed a whole array of experiences and influences that shaped him as a person and as an artist . We realised we were the ones to tell the story , and started formulating the idea for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were successful , which enabled us to really organise ourselves and invest time in researching and planning . <h> What was the process of writing the book together at a distance ? <p> JP : To get things started I went up to Louise 's house in Boat of Garten for a few days and we wrote the prequel together to find our common tone . <p> LW : From then on , Facetime was an incredible thing . It meant we were able to really communicate with one another in a way that you just ca n't over email or even the phone . Being able to talk face to face , despite being apart , made a huge difference and helped us to always be honest with one another . <p> JP : Completely , Facetime was key to overcoming our logistical challenge . I think we both learned a lot in the writing process , about George , about each other and about ourselves . We both found we were more suited to writing certain parts , I researched and wrote the war-years , Louise did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to George making art , and Louise did the last chapter in her own voice which I think we both felt was quite important . <h> Was there a lot you found out about George 's life through the writing process that you had n't been aware of before ? <p> LW : There were no skeletons in the closet ' as such , however there were a few things I 'd always been aware of but had never really thought about that we explored in more detail . Not least that George 's parents had had a child before him who had died very young from meningitis . And I think it 's something that at a distance you do n't really get too caught up in , but then when you actually start to think about it , you start to imagine what it must have been like for my Grandmother and it 's truly every woman 's nightmare . So you start to think about the impact that must have had on their family life , and my father 's own childhood . <p> Aside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legacy in our family but we did n't really know much more than that . So we did some research and found that my great , great , great Grandfather came from Corsica , and that he left at the age of 12 because his family volunteered him to join the British Navy . I know that 's what was done in those days , but again when you actually really pause to think about it there 's something very affecting about it . And it 's a story I 'm going to continue , researching that Corsican history in our family . <p> JP : For me , and I had never thought this way but it could be a common perception , what really became clear was that George was certainly not a one-trick-pony . It was n't just about the Straw Locomotive or the Paper Boat , from a young age he 'd been exposed to all these influences from family to the navy to engineering and it was as if they were all leading to this late flowering career as an artist . <h> What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> LW : To realise that anyone can be an artist , anyone can achieve what they want to if they persevere . It does n't matter about age , it does n't matter about background , it does n't matter about formal training if you follow your heart . If you have something to say , have a go . You do n't even have to be greatly successful , just as long as you do what feels right for you . <p> JP : I think it 's a book about how a creative person comes into their own , what shapes them and how , ultimately , they 'll find a way no matter the circumstances . George was very vital , constantly questioning , constantly looking for ways to express himself . And he also lived through a very tumultuous period of social change , and the book reflects on the post-war period and the later decline of heavy industry that clearly shaped George 's work . <p> LW : Yes absolutely , it 's very accurate to the time and a real insight into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast George 's childhood to what childhood is like now . And then I suppose at the other end of things , I hope the book helps to convey an understanding of his illness . He had maybe been suffering from frontal lobe dementia for about ten years , but we did n't really know . His behaviour had just gotten steadily worse over the years , and during that time he was ostracised by the things that may have helped that situation like his beloved yacht club and jazz club . And that was n't through unkindness , just a lack of understanding . People are living longer and longer , and these things can swoop on anyone regardless of how active their mind is . So I think it 's important we appreciate that older minds , great older minds included , still need stimulus , support and accepting . <h> And finally , what do you have planned for your Edinburgh International Book Festival Event on 26 August ? <p> LW : It 'll be afternoon tea George Wyllie style , so there 'll be some quirky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in discussion , and we 'll open it out to questions as that 's definitely when you get the most out of these things . <p> JP : I think it 's a really fitting format , the idea that art can be playful and serious at the same time - something George was a master of .

It is also about creating the conditions for excellent art to be produced . Equality is about removing barriers , and diversity is about supporting and reflecting different cultures in Scotland , enabling all artistic and creative voices to be heard . Inclusion is about creating opportunities for people to work in , engage with , participate in , and experience arts and creativity throughout the country . <p> Experience shows that organisations that embrace EDI are more successful creatively , as they recognise the rich artistic and creative opportunities that diversity and inclusion offers , as well as being more economically viable and sustainable .

Since then , we 've grown steadily , and have built up a new following as a fully-fledged festival of chamber music , featuring top class musicians and ensembles , recognised on the chamber music and festival circuits . <h> What are your aspirations ? Why do you do what you do ? <p> We do what we do because we are passionate about chamber music and want to share that passion with others .

We have a Steinway piano ( purchased with support from Creative Scotland many years ago ) and the House itself has fantastic facilities for eating and drinking . There are lots of things for families and visitors to see and do " including boat trips and house tours , and there 's a shop to browse in . The venue being small means that our audiences can get close up to the musicians and this is quite unlike going to a concert in a major concert hall .

Scotlands greatest modernist ruin , St Peters Seminary , will be transformed by light and music . Fifty years on since the building opened , you can explore this architectural masterpiece reanimated at night for the first time by public art company NVA . From 18 - 27 March , Hinterland will reveal the full glory of the towering concrete ruin , combining moving light installations and projection with a haunting choral soundscape . <p> " Eight years ago on a cold January morning I set off to Cardross a discrete village on the Firth of Clyde and tramped into the old woods of Kilmahew in search of what is fabled to be the greatest Modernist ruin in the UK . <p> " Approaching from a low slung burn that meandered through a steep-sided gorge peppered with ancient oak trees , the vast flanks of the old Roman Catholic teaching seminary emerged .

I felt halfway between the pages of Brave New World and stumbling onto an old set for Star Wars . <p> " 50 years old in 2016 and designed by Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein , it was a love letter to Le Corbusier , but no pastiche . Their work was so bold , ambitious , provocative and poetic that even now ravaged by fires , theft and 25 years of vandalism it takes your breath away . <p> " That first time wandering through the skeletal mega structure with my co-director Ellen , we glimpsed a shadowy figure moving along the high balustrades and simultaneously froze hearing the random tolling of an old bell . Traces of the past life of the building had re-manifested , in a spine-tingling scene worthy of Kubrick or Polanski . <p> " Its in this light that we have conceived Hinterland our first event in the recently cleaned buildings and wider landscape .

We wanted to allow the building itself to breathe . <p> " You may find you never love the form , but St Peters makes a brave assertion that architecture might reflect social change . This was perhaps na+ve and it shut after only 13 years of life as a seminary ; but the question remains relevant to this day as does the latent potential for great design to help frame progressive thinking , emboldening ordinary people to take and use their hard won freedoms with responsibility and imagination .

I had some projects in development , and it was a massive challenge to continue working on these while also adjusting to having a totally new set of responsibilities and passions as a parent . Trying to bring the energy required to get a film made to the table while adapting to this new phase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would it be to just stop right now " . <p> Then that led me to thinking , I wonder if this is one of the reasons why there are n't  as many female directors , writer-directors , etc. ( as females tend to be the primary caregivers , especially if you 're freelance ) . I talked to ( Raising Films co-founder ) Sophie Mayer , feminist academic and film writer , and she told me about models of financing in Sweden where childcare is more often included in budgets . So it led us to considering maybe there 's a different way to make films . Maybe there 's a way the process can be more inclusive to people with family responsibilities . <h> What reactions and responses have you had from people ? <p> As well as trying to tackle some of the structural process aspects of filmmaking , one of the biggest components of Raising Films is to create a community . Weve seen this growing , particularly online , and people are sharing their stories of how they 've managed it or not managed it , what theyd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . The responses we 've received from parents in the industry or people who are considering having families have been incredible , saying everything from how reading others stories have made them feel less alone and even made them feel empowered to have conversations in their workplaces theyd never have had before , or even conversations with themselves about how theyd manage if they were to start a family . <p> Recently someone I know said she read a testimonial on our website and immediately afterwards opened Final Draft for the first time in year , just from having read someone elses experience of how theyd done it . And that in itself is fantastic . Were not in a position of trying to rush people back to work or make drastic choices , but what we do want is to ensure if people are struggling to believe they can be a parent and do the work they love , that they have a space where they are encouraged and supported . <h> What are the conversations that are n't  being had in the film industry that Raising Films recognise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open up conversations about childcare . As freelancers have a very different set up making these arrangements can prove really challenging . From personal experience , I 've just recently gone into production on a feature film and my childcare arrangements were a hugely complicated part of planning how we were going to make the film . So a wider understanding of and willingness to talk about the demands and complexities of childcare within our industry could make a huge difference . <p> I appreciate the situations were talking about are by no means unique to the film industry , but I think the sporadic and often all-encompassing nature of production can really amplify their impact . And for people who do n't  have support systems then the prospect of balancing being a parent or carer alongside their work must seem , at times , a near impossible one .

I think if we can think about more inclusive ways of making films then were going to get a far , far more interesting selection of material on screen . Were also going to have an industry that reflects humanity rather than one that is presenting a kind of cultural vacuum , with only one tiny sliver of people represented . <p> The film industry can be a flexible one , but its also an expensive one that puts people under pressure .

@@43257931 @3257931/ <h> Virtual and real worlds collide at NEoN Digital Arts Festival <p> From 9 - 13 November 2016 the NEoN Digital Arts Festival will explore how physical urban space and virtual information space are inseparably intertwined as it hosts exhibitions , workshops , talks , conferences , live performances and public discussions across the city of Dundee . We spoke to associate curator Sarah Cook about the inspiration behind the festival , now in its seventh year . <h> What was the initial idea behind holding a Digital Arts Festival ? <p> It started with the curatorial vision of Donna Holford-Lovell and Clare Brennan at Abertay University with Interactive Tayside in 2009 to create an event that could promote digital media activity in the North East of Scotland . With a focus on moving image , music and information technologies , the festival offered talks , performances , screenings and exhibitions that expanded the notion of art , information communication , media production and game design . <p> In the six editions of the festival since then , it has contracted and expanded in different editions , across different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pools , and now includes partners at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design , LifeSpace , Generator Projects , and other cultural agencies across the city , as well as kept its international outlook . <p> The field of digital art has also changed since 2009 , as gaming , mobile technologies , screen-based work , and intermedia art has changed with new technological innovations and new audiences . <h> How have audiences been responding to the festivals so far ? <p> There is an appetite for shared experience of creative practice in Dundee - evidenced by things like the Make/Share forums , the Pecha Kucha nights ( which attract hundreds of audience members ) and the festivals devoted to everything from women in science to literature . <p> Dundee is a city with two universities and colleges offering courses in art and design , so to showcase art by artists from outwith Scotland is always well received . Dundee is an event-oriented place , which still surprisingly communicates what is going on through printed posters pasted up around the city . By putting the art into unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners , old warehouses - we are reaching new audiences of all ages and experience of art . <p> With the support of Creative Scotland we 've been able to be more ambitious in our programming - there are over 30 elements in this years edition which is drawing international attention to us as Scotlands only digital arts festival . <h> What can visitors expect at this years festival ? <p> There are a few world premieres of new work ! Because our theme this year is about architecture - the spaces were in - then many of the works are about how we understand physical and virtual space . <p> At the Visual Research Centre in DCA is a project called Paperholm by Charles Young . Since August 2014 Young has designed , made , photographed and uploaded a model of a building to the Paperholm website every day , often animating the results into gifs . NEoN and the Travelling Gallery are teamed up to present the entire collection of models which together make up a beautiful and beguiling archipelago city . <p> Berlin-based artist Aram Bartholl has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large-scale printed screenshot of a scenic view of Sin City from the computer game Grand Theft Auto V. You can sit in a car infront of this view and listen to YouTubers going nuts playing GTA V - the serene static view contrasting with the mayhem in the game as it is played . This is installed in the former print works of DC Thomson , so it makes sense to take a digital landscape of a big city , designed to be seen on screen and bring it into a huge space as a huge print . <p> Weve got engaging digital artwork , suitable for all ages featuring a room full of interacting virtual creatures created by award-winning digital artists Genetic Moo in the Wellgate Shopping Centre ; an opportunity to explore the city through sound with an app in collaboration with local musician , Andrew Wasylyk ; a poetic commission which fuses together a hybrid between print , the web and cloud-computing by J.R . Carpenter ; and Biome Collective and Joseph Delappes critically acclaimed video game , Killbox , which explores the nature of drone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data cloud , clouds , the sky , and the ground , in all of the works . Dundee is a city with big skies , so it makes sense . <h> How do you go about collaborating as a team to pull together such a diverse programme ? <p> NEoN has a flat curatorial structure , with regular open meetings on Wednesday mornings and a shared online note-taking system . If you rock up with an idea for a project , it will be discussed , considered and folded into the planning . We look at art work together , discuss its strengths and how it pushes at our understanding of art , and try and agree on the quality and value of everything we choose to programme . <p> NEoN works with cultural partners across Dundee - from venues such as DCA and Nomas*Projects , as well as agencies such as Creative Dundee or other festivals such as the Science Festival and we try to work with artists who match programming aspirations to the themes and aims of these partners . <p> When it comes to delivery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with artists , some organise equipment , some deal with press and questions like these ! It involves volunteer effort but artists works remain at the heart of our commitment . <h> Much of the festivals content is the result of ambitious creative collaborations too ? <p> NEoN is fortunate in that Dundee is a small city with an incredible international outlook and creative talent . Our core curatorial team are very well networked and , yes , ambitious in our aspirations for bring artists work to life . We collaborate very closely with New Media Scotland , Scotlands agency for fostering creative engagement with technology which manages the Alt-w Fund and has supported countless artists across Scotland to realise research and new productions . They are the partner in the Travelling Gallery show which will be in Dundee for NEoN , and are staging one of their ever-popular Atmosphere expanded cinema events with the film Wreck-it Ralph . <p> We also have a firm base within the Hannah Maclure Centre at Abertay University , an exhibition venue linked to learning and academic research . This means we do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art to local audiences by working in collaboration with producers and curators who know what they 're doing . The new works by JR Carpenter , Monica Studer &amp; Christoph van den Berg , Linda Havenstein , Knifeandfork and Aram Bartholl could n't ( and would n't ) happen without NEoNs aim to realise great new digital art tailored to the city were in . <h> There 's a strong link to this years national celebration of Innovation , Architecture and Design tell us more ... <p> In 2015 we chose not to have a theme but to focus attention on a geographic area , bringing artists from across northeast Asia to Scotland and shine a light on practices not so well known here . In the next few years we are linking ourselves with themes identified by the Scottish Government as we recognise that digital media art and creative technologies do n't  have geographic boundaries , but do cross disciplines . <p> Much digital media art considers real and virtual space , and consists of artists creating their own tools , designing their own landscapes , real and imagined . Guillaume Brisson-Darveau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospitalfield Arts in nearby Arbroath this summer , and when we met him we realised that his Cloud Walks were both a reflection on the idea of cloud computing and a playful reflection on what it is to not really know where you are in physical space . They will be represented in NEoN . <p> We have commissioned a work from Andrew Wasylyk which allows you to soundtrack your experience of buildings across Dundee , many of which will be illuminated as part of Light Nights , the Scottish Festival of Architecture finale later in November . The festival really does question whether there is negative space in cyberspace and how artists can manipulate space - virtual and real . We have a single channel screening programme and a mini symposium dedicated just to these questions . <h> The festival is far from " virtual " , with several exhibitions and installations hosted in the huge West Ward Works . How did you approach the challenge of filling such a space ? <p> As a new and largely untouched raw industrial space in Dundee it was too tempting not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill it ( its huge ! ) but rather to activate the ( enormous ) ground floor space with works that benefit from not being in either a white cube gallery , nor a black box cinema , but that have a relationship to the street , to informal or neglected spaces , to imagined or repurposed spaces . <p> There is also a key curatorial conceit in the choice of works exhibited in West Ward Works : West Ward was where papers were printed and then loaded on to lorries to be delivered across the country , so there was a constant journeying of information and images , cartoons and comments , to and from the building . <p> So the works in the show are similarly about print ( a giant billboard , digitally-rendered wallpaper ) or about temporary or recurrent movement - excursions - through spaces ( Studer and VdBergs Shack , Linda Havensteins walks , Brent Watanabes endless games , even the drones delivery of a bomb in the game Killbox ) . <p> While the newspapers once printed in West Ward have moved from paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born-digital things which have made the move back to the physical . <h> What do you foresee as being the next big trends and themes around digital and creative technology ? <p> We are working again this year with LifeSpace Science Art Research Gallery to bring artists Genetic Moo to Dundee - LifeSpace engages artists creating interdisciplinary work addressing biology , biotechnology and the visualisation of scientific research ; we have no doubt in Dundee that this area of interdisciplinary artistic practice will continue to grow . <p> We are working with Joseph DeLappe , an international artist , activist and recent appointment as Professor of Games Research to Abertay University , to present his collaborative game work about drone warfare - NEoN feels strongly that politically-engaged work about current technological shifts in society will always be relevant . <p> Dundee is revamping itself with the waterfront development and the impending arrival of the new V&amp;A Museum of Design , and NEoN wants to be there to show how art can create a space to question or interrogate these large-scale physical transitions as well as the personal digital and virtual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologies - the spaces were in . <p> NEoN Digital Arts Festival runs from 9 13 November 2016 across the City of Dundee .

There are many people in the world . The majority are people of colour . If broadly the 1 in 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women are half the population . Most of the worlds population is not wealthy .

Either in terms of who holds positions of power or via depictions created on screen . <p> " Contemporary uses of the word diversity can have a vague or obscuring quality . <p> " Sometimes it can mean , as academic Sara Ahmed has termed it , conditional hospitality . What does it mean when a predominantly white institution ( such as comprise the film industry ) aims to increase the numbers of people of colour participating ? If people are being welcomed in what does this mean ? It can be as if they are being welcomed into someones home that they own and where the rules of the house reasonably apply . But institutions such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of public life and human endeavour and as such should not require assimilation in order to participate in them . <p> " Participation should not be dependent upon dilution of ones own creative and/ or political voice . Film funding within the UK should support people from minority groups and/or women to develop their own autonomous creative practices , organisations and projects . All too often funding goes to predominantly white institutions to develop short term , tokenistic schemes that leave power residing in the same hands at the end of them as before . <p> " We hope that the use of the word diversity sits as part of an intention to address various forms of social inequality to try to tackle ableism , racism , the ills and dis-empowerment that poverty brings , transphobia , homophobia , sexism and more . <p> " And we hope that the vision for the process of addressing those inequalities involves centering the experiences and knowledge of those most immediately affected by them . <p> " Which raises the question of what does it mean to not see yourself represented on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent most people here wont get to experience the feeling of not seeing yourself reflected on screen . <p> " To only see a social group to which you belong either eclipsed entirely or portrayed in a stereotypical way is a hurtful and isolating experience . <p> " We hope that the use of the word diversity sits as part of an intention to address various forms of social inequality " to try to tackle ableism , racism , the ills and dis-empowerment that poverty brings , transphobia , homophobia , sexism and more .

It was developed at Stonypath , a hill farm on the edge of the Pentland Hills near Dunsyre , by the poet and artist Ian Hamilton Finlay . Finlay moved to Stonypath in 1966 with his wife Sue ( with whom he collaborated on the creation of the garden until the early 1990s ) and lived there until his death in 2006 . <p> Before moving to Stonypath , Finlay had been developing his concrete poetry on paper and on free-standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden at Stonypath developed , Finlay worked collaboratively with stonemasons and letter-cutters to make permanent outdoor works for the settings he and Sue created in the landscape .

It is now open to the public every summer and attracts a wide range of visitors each year . <p> In 2016 an Open Project Fund award from Creative Scotland made Sharing Little Sparta possible , a two-year pilot project designed to increase and enhance access to the garden both for the public and for artists . Working in partnership with the Scottish Poetry Library , the National Galleries of Scotland and the University of Edinburgh , the Trust launched a new Little Sparta Residency Programme last year as a means of making the garden and the national collections of Finlays work available as a resource for artists interested in his work and the ideas that informed and were generated by it .

We also hope to invite a specialist in horticulture , botany , landscape or garden design with a particular interest in contemporary art or writing . The residencies are non-residential : no accommodation is currently available on site at Little Sparta . Instead , the opportunity affords supported access over a prolonged period of time not only to the garden , but also to Finlays library within his house at Stonypath and to the archives and superb collections of his work held at SPL and NGS . The focus is not upon producing a final piece of work , but instead we hope these opportunities will create an inspiring context in which new ideas and projects can be developed .

The library reflects Finlays wide-ranging interests , his own research and the ideas he was exploring through the process of developing Little Sparta . Beyond this , I think its also the centrality of collaboration to Finlays work , which is very evident at Little Sparta , and the fact that his practice encompassed writing , poetry , publication , printmaking and sculpture . Cumulatively this all creates the perfect context for research , discussion and the development of new work . <h> How did last years residency participants find their time at Little Sparta ? <p> The residencies in 2016 worked very well and the artists found their time to be extremely productive .

All of the artists welcomed the time the residencies gave them to explore new ideas and focus upon the development of their own work in a different context and without a pressing deadline ! <h> What would you say to someone who has never visited Little Sparta ? <p> Visit !

Many consider it bad luck to utter the play 's name backstage , but Edinburgh-based theatre group Ludens Ensemble have gone a step further . Their production of Macbeth : Without Words strips the play of all spoken dialogue , trading it for smart visual tricks , intense physical mime , haunting sound and silent-era-inspired title cards announcing key moments . <p> As the show wraps up its 2016 Edinburgh Festival Fringe run , we caught up with Philippos Philippou ( Artistic Director ) and Vangelis Makriyannakis ( Dramaturg ) to talk about the process of developing such an unusual adaptation of the much-loved " Scottish play " . <h> It 's a bold move to strip a Shakespeare play of its words !

And at the heart of Scotland 's reputation for excellence and experimentation are the artists who live and work here . <p> We want to ensure that Regular Funding provides an infrastructure that can effectively support artists , at any stage in their career , with opportunities for the development , production and presentation of their work . <p> Looking beyond the central belt , Regular Funding will enable a network of spaces for making and thinking that includes DCA in Dundee , Peacock Visual Arts in Aberdeen , Highland Print Studio in Inverness , Scottish Sculpture Workshop in Aberdeenshire and Hospitalfield in Arbroath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also offers significant opportunities for public engagement through gallery , workshop , community and creative learning . <p> We believe that artists have the ability to engage and inspire us , testing out new ways of thinking and challenging us to see the world through different eyes . We want to build on the public profile and enjoyment of contemporary art across Scotland and to ensure that people have access to some of the very best work being made in our times . <p> In addition to traditional gallery spaces and forms of exhibition making , there is a particular strength in a more socially engaged form of practice beginning to emerge in the country . This work is highly effective in widening access and enjoyment , particularly in more rural locations where there are fewer galleries . Initiatives that enable artists to engage communities with new ideas and fresh perspectives can help to inspire and influence change at a local level . 
@@43258027 @3258027/ <p> Together these provide a comprehensive analysis of and response to the many and varied strengths , challenges , ambitions and opportunities for the sector and provide the context for our decision-making process for Regular Funding . <p> Scotland already has a strong international reputation for film and successes on which to build ; there are a significant number of filmmakers based here ; both on and off-screen talent are highly regarded and internationally recognised and we boast the 2nd and 3rd most attended film festivals in the UK . <p> However , the sector has faced challenges , some that are systemic and others as a result of the growth in new viewing technologies , the continually shifting international market for film and the global financial crisis . <p> Creative Scotland On Screen " Film Strategy 2014-17 clearly sets out the priorities for the next 12 months and the next 3 years ; working in partnership with the sector and public partners , we will see significant advances across the entire film value chain , taking in Film Education , Talent and Skills Development , Film Development and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Audiences . <p> It is clear from the Film Sector Review and consultation with the sector that film and moving image appreciation and education along with the development of audiences for diverse and culturally rich cinema experiences is fundamental to the creation of a healthy sector overall . <p> The portfolio of organisations supported through Regular Funding includes four of Scotland 's key organisations and two multi art-form venues that make up the bedrock of cultural cinema provision across Scotland and they will play a significant role in progressing the wider ambitions of the sector in the coming years . <p> Together these organisations deliver programmes of work that include access and enjoyment of cultural cinema , audience development initiatives , the development of remote cinemas and smaller scale film festivals , talent development and industry engagement programmes as well as international outreach programmes that connect Scotland 's filmmaking community to the international film industry . <p> Their work will help ensure that as many people as possible across Scotland have the opportunity to engage with and enjoy the very best of cinema from Scotland and around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production of quality film and television drama projects from Scotland 's filmmakers through our Targeted Funding route and we will work closely with the sector and public partners to address the wider challenges and opportunities identified in the Film Strategy , including film education , skills development , the delivery of a permanent film studio for Scotland and additional funding for the sector . <p> We are confident that support for this portfolio of organisations represents the first step towards realising the key ambition set out in the Film Strategy : to position the screen sector at the heart of Scotland 's economic and cultural life in a nation that celebrates the importance of every aspect of film culture .

@@43258029 @3258029/ <h> Glasgow-based theatre-makers bring Daphne Oram 's legacy to life <p> From 10 May to 2 June , the award-winning Blood of the Young present their first touring stage production Daphne Orams Wonderful World of Sound . <p> The production focuses on the life , ideas and legacy of Daphne Oram , the hugely influential sound pioneer and co-founder of the legendary BBC Radiophonic Workshop . Written and conceived by Paul Brotherston and Isobel McArthur with a live original sound score composed by SAY Award-nominated musician Anneke Kampman , we found out more from writer/director Paul Brotherston <h> What makes Daphne Orams story and legacy so fascinating ? <p> I first came across Daphne Oram when I encountered Victoria Mortons portrait of her at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art . There was something deeply entrancing about this bespectacled figure surrounded by cables and oscillators captured in greens and purples . Even the name , Daphne Oram , had a slightly alien feel to me and I was compelled to find out more . <p> I was amazed by what my research revealed , here was someone whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet she was relatively unheard in the mainstream musical consciousness . <p> What immediately occurred to me when I listened to her work was its vast theatrical potential , the movement dynamics coupled with this strange other-worldliness just seemed to brim with energy and intrigue . I went on read her book on her personal sound philosophy An Individual Note and I was totally struck by her voice . There 's a resolute single-mindedness but coupled with this charming geeky sense of humour . She talks a lot about " thinking beyond " , seeing music as a channel through which we can contemplate the very nature of being . Those ideas , along with a lot of other elements in the book really influenced the play . <h> How did the various elements of the production come together ? <p> Isobel McArthur and I had the idea to create a piece of theatre inspired by Daphne Oram , which we first presented at a Scratch night at The Arches . <p> We decided we wanted this initial presentation to not be set to a script , instead we wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with choreography all set in the BBC Radiophonic workshop . Around this point , Anneke Kampman came on board creating an original composition for the piece . <p> Our decision to work with Anneke instead of just using Daphnes music straight up was very much a purposeful one . We felt there was something more powerful about demonstrating just how huge her musical legacy is by working with someone who has been impacted by her ideas and could be creating the sort of work Daphne might be making if she was still around today . <p> The response to this initial performance at The Arches Scratch Night was wonderful , so we knew we wanted to take the idea further and present a full piece of theatre from it . <p> The funding from Creative Scotland , as well as the continual support from the Tron as our co-production partners has been absolutely vital in seeing the piece grow into what it is now . <h> What challenges have you faced in bringing the production to life ? <p> There are some obvious ones such as trying to visually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think people have an interwoven sense of what it looked and felt like so were trying to create that on stage . <p> And Daphnes sound philosophy was very much focused on turning the visual into sound , so were thinking about how to best portray that through certain movements and acts . Every moment demands a high level of precision . <p> Even in presenting Daphnes ideas there 's a challenge for Isobel and me to try to get our heads around circuitry and electronics to a much higher degree than we might have anticipated ! Anneke , along with the Glasgow School of Art department for Sound and the Moving Image , have been indispensable in that . We want to be able to translate her ideas into something that 's relatable to regular theatre-goers , while also being authentic and recognisable to massive fans of Daphne Oram . <p> Finally , just the fact that its been a long process between the plays origins to this point , with us all working on other major projects in that time . <h> Who do you think the play is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-time fans of Daphne Oram , as well as people with a general interest in music and particularly the legacy of electronic music and composition . <p> But I do feel like it has appeal for broader audiences , its a highly theatrical piece centred on a fascinating character whose story is n't as widely known as it should be . Ultimately , I hope its a fun , light , interesting and accessible show . <p> We 've not romanticised her story , this was a pioneer who was n't recognised in her lifetime , but we hope the play continues to fuel a growing interest and appreciation of her life and work . If audiences come away having been entertained as well as encouraged to find out more about Daphne Orams life and work then well be delighted . 
@@43258033 @3258033/ <h> Mark Vernon on the wonders of radio <p> Sound artist and producer Mark Vernon has been experimenting with radio as a platform since his involvement in Glasgow pirate station Radio Tuesday in the late 1990s . His recent Radiophrenia project at CCA saw him and cohort Barry Burns undertake the mammoth task of programming a weeks worth of radio using submissions from across the country . <p> We caught up with him to find out more about his work and to attempt to discover what it is about radio as a platform that continues to fuel his creative process ... <h> Tell us a bit more about yourself and your work ? <p> I 'm an artist working largely with sound and radio - from field recording and soundscape composition to live performances and releases on vinyl and CD . <p> Some recent projects include : <p> Sounds of the Modern Hospital - a collection of field recordings made in various hospital departments packaged as a Sound Effects Library LP . The recordings were made during a two-year period as digital artist in residence at Forth Valley Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely with Radio Royal ' to create Bedside Radio - a series of programmes for patients that gently challenged the normal conventions of hospital radio . <h> What is it about radio as a platform that inspires you creatively ? <p> I think radio is the point where several of my interests converge " the human voice , sound recording and the use of sound as a raw material to create something entirely new and unexpected . <p> There are two sides to radio production " the very solitary activity of putting together a feature in the studio for days or weeks at a time and the more social aspect of gathering the material to work with , whether it be sounds or voices . <p> Getting into odd places and meeting interesting people from different walks of life is one aspect I very much enjoy . There are many unusual situations I 've ended up in , from recording rain forests in Sri Lanka to getting dressed up in full surgical scrubs to capture the sounds of cataract surgery in a hospital operating theatre . Without the excuse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these situations . For all that I still feel that most of the magic really happens in the editing and production phase . Sound is an infinitely malleable medium . Just by putting two disparate elements side by side - the way one voice or sound bounces off another - can create a whole new series of associations and possible meanings . That excites me . <p> With radio though it is also the method of delivery - the fact that a broadcast is so ephemeral and fleeting , that at any one moment you do n't know who or how many people might be listening in . Sometimes I think it is insane the amount of time spent on a production for it to exist only for the 30 minutes or hour that it is on air . It 's there and then it 's gone " that is also part of the attraction though . <h> How do you uncover new topics and subjects for your broadcasts ? <p> Ultimately it 's about having a curiosity about the world around you and how that can be communicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea or story that are better expressed through sound or radio than any other medium . I do n't deliberately seek out new topics as such " I just follow where my interests lead me . <h> What do you think the future holds for radio as a creative platform ? <p> I think there has been a shift over the last decade or so . In the UK the availability of short term RSL licences from OFCOM has made it easier than ever to set up a station meaning that there has been a proliferation of temporary radio art projects and community stations . If you also take into account podcasts and online stations , the interest in what I would describe as radio content ' has had a huge resurgence of late . <p> Having said that , I think there is something very different about an FM broadcast transmitted through the airwaves compared with a podcast . Again , it 's that fleeting ephemerality . There is a growing interest in radio as a creative space . Just taking the recent Radiophrenia project as one example " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people interested in making their own broadcasts happen . That can only be a good thing . Despite the looming threat of a complete digital switch over , radio will survive I think - even if it means going back to pirate broadcasts . <h> How has collaborating with other artists influenced your work ? <p> There are always things to be learnt from others whether it 's a skill or technique , a different way of thinking or even just a difference in outlook . Working on your own it 's easy to get bogged down in details and lose sight of the bigger picture . It 's always refreshing to have someone come along and sweep away all your preconceptions about how a particular problem should be tackled . It 's also about compromise and creating something that neither collaborator could have produced individually yet still feels equal ownership over . In a live situation I find it is similar but in a much more magnified way . There is less time to consider the interaction " it is much more immediate and intuitive . <h> Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from ? How did you approach scheduling a whole week of radio ? <p> The motivation behind setting up the station was to provide an alternative to the stale and bland formats of commercial radio and to cater to the kind of radical , unusual or experimental content that would never get airplay on a mainstream station . <p> I 've had a long history of working with radio from setting up temporary RSL art radio stations in Scotland and England to pirate broadcasts as part of Radio Tuesday back in 1999 and as a producer I 've been making content for art stations like Resonance FM and Sound Art Radio for nearly 15 years now . Over recent years a network of independent stations that exist solely to promote radio as an artform have sprung up all over the world . Radiophrenia was in part a reciprocal gesture aimed at strengthening ties that have already been formed with these stations as well as an opportunity to draw attention to some of the great work that is being produced locally in Scotland . <p> Scheduling a whole week of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sheer volume of submissions we received . I co-ran the station with Barry Burns without whom it would have been impossible . Our selection criteria was simple " it was based on the originality of the idea , the quality of the production and whether or not a piece would be likely to get airplay on a more conventional station . Even then we did n't have enough airtime to play everything we would have liked to . <h> What 's next for Mark Vernon ? <p> Currently I 'm working on a collaborative project with Cumbrian oral historian and sound artist Jenn Mattinson . Using interviews and field recordings of circular processes , circuits , loops and rotating machines Circular Thinking is a new work commissioned by the Octopus Collective for The Hub , an outdoor ambisonic sound system situated in the town centre of Workington . The resulting piece will be premiered at the Full of Noises festival in Barrow-in-Furness on Saturday 1 August through a specially constructed Acousmonium-like surround sound system . <p> A new programme Domestic Weather will be aired very soon on WGXC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio transmissions as carriers of meteorological data and the effects of weather on the propagation of radio signals . The programme was commissioned by Wave Farm and Kunstradio as part of their ' Climactic Climate ' series and features interviews with members of Glasgow 's WOSARS ( The West of Scotland Amateur Radio Society ) . <p> Following such an encouraging response to the Radiophrenia project we are considering a second round of broadcasts possibly over a longer period . We 've proven that there is sufficient interest so the hope is that it in the future it could become a more established annual event or eventually a full time station even .

Work created during the residency will be exhibited at **28;1493;TOOLONG at Out of the Blue Drill hall in Edinburgh as part of Syn Festival 2017 from Thursday 9 March until Wednesday 22 March . Here Marissa tells us about her residency experience and the impact it had on her work <h> What development support did you have during the residency ? <p> During my residency at the Arteles Creative Centre in Finland , I had access to a variety support that helped the development of my thoughts and ways of working . The residency itself provided a large private room , studio and an environmental arts space as well as tools and equipment ; including a wood workshop and a variety of materials . A part-time assistant was provided and helped us to facilitate the practical aspects of our residency . I took part in discussions and shared ideas about my work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helped push my understanding of what I was doing and where I wanted to go . It was the informal chats with the other artists that helped me the most and the relaxed nature of the residency meant I was free to just be and do . This openness was the key for my personal development . <h> What were the facilities like ? Would you recommend it to other artists ? <h> In what ways has it developed your thinking in the short term and what do you imagine the long-term impact to be ? <p> Since I graduated in 2014 I have been working full time to support myself . I was in a place where I needed to fully immerse myself in research and the process of making art in order to push my practice forward . Attending Arteles gave me the space away from everyday distractions and the freedom to take risks . I found myself looking and making in new ways in response to the unfamiliar landscape . I started to think about environments with more intent and in the long term I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I no longer feel the need to stay on the wall and I am starting to consider how I can create environments within the gallery . I believe this will lead me to greater extremes and that hopefully I will travel to even more remote landscapes . <h> How does your work fit into the Metamorphosis Transformation exhibition taking place at Out of the Blue Drill Hall from 9 22 March ? <p> My work explores the juxtapositions of unfamiliar landscapes , with significant often other-worldly objects , shapes textures , and colours . Through these juxtapositions I explore many peculiarities of history , mythology , and belief , resulting in the creation of surreal , dystopian places . The works I created in Finland fit with the themes presented by the Metamorphosis Transformation show . The exhibition takes a rich mythical motif expressed through the arts and literature for thousands of years as a source of imaginative inspiration . The show will present works in various mediums in an attempt to re-examine Scottish , Greek and European mythology and to understand the substance behind the fictional cover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The piece I will be presenting under went a state of transformation and metamorphosis an act of art making in itself . I painted on top of wooden logs destined for the fire , focussing on the synergy of the abstract and the figurative , the symbolic and the merely formal . Through this mischievous play I found myself transforming the natural into something unnatural , giving it another life . <p> This related to my research on ancient Finnish culture . Akin to Scotland 's Celtic belief system , ancient Finland 's society was once Animistic ( the belief that natural objects , natural phenomena , and the universe itself possess souls ) . Wood and rocks were used as markers of significance , offerings and totems . It is this research , in combination with the striking physical drama of nature 's complexity , that led me to making of my small yet monumental objects . <h> How does the exhibition reflect the residency experience and what do you hope audiences will take from it ? <p> This exhibition will showcase the new works I made in Finland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sculptures themselves are made from the trees in the forest where I stayed , and in many ways for me are like objects I collect when I travel to remember a place . But the works are more then just a memento they are a physical reference to what I saw and experienced . Trees looked like drawings set against monochromatic spaces and yet there was still colour , line , pattern , darkness and light . By painting on top of the wood I have recorded this and highlighted the playfulness of these forms . What audiences might take from this is always difficult to predict but I hope the historical connection with Scotland and ' High North ' culture of the Nordic countries , including Finland , comes through . 
@@43258053 @3258053/ <h> The first Scottish Queer International Film Festival ran in September 2015 , what were the aims of the festival ? <p> The aims of SQIFF were primarily to provide a welcoming space for LGBTQ+ people and their friends and supporters to come together and to explore cinema as an art form . We wanted to promote queer films , especially those that would n't screen in Scotland otherwise , and we wanted to contribute to building LGBTQ community and individual wellbeing . <h> What sort of line-up did you pull together for the first SQIFF ? <p> The programme had a wide range of different content , aesthetics , and styles . We had quite a few documentaries that spoke about various angles of being LGBTQ . For example , we screened Open Windows , about older lesbian women in France and Spain , Peace of Mind , about a trans man and queer activist who lived and worked in Haiti before his death there , and Alive ! , in which a filmmaker recorded five gay men who have HIV training to do a parachute jump together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film Dyke Hard , love stories such as Frangipani , about a bisexual love triangle in Sri Lanka , and classic queer movies like Pedro Almodovar 's What Have I Done to Deserve This ? and John Waters ' Desperate Living . Then we had a good number of shorts programmes organised by theme or by political identity plus we had a programme of Scottish shorts . We also tried to include as many filmmaking workshops as possible in order to encourage more queer filmmaking activity in Scotland . <h> What were the challenges in curating the programme ? <p> The main challenge of putting together a queer film programme is being inclusive and intersectional . We wanted to represent as best we could all the letters in the LGBTQ acronym and to be aware of intersectional identities which affect people 's experiences of being LGBTQ , particularly race , age , class , and disability . To meet this challenge requires doing a lot of research on all the work that is out there and thinking long and hard about what your programme should look like . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature films because access to funding and training which making a feature film generally requires is restricted for people who are especially marginalised in society , such as transgender women and deaf and disabled queer people . Our response to this in our programme was to include filmmaking workshops either aimed at or accessible for trans people and deaf and disabled people to try to counter these groups ' exclusion from getting involved in film culture and the industry . We hope that through focusing on representing marginalised groups as best we can and by trying to make our festival itself accessible to them we can contribute towards improving the intersectional nature of queer arts in Scotland and encouraging a wider range of LGBTQ individuals to have a go at making films themselves . <h> What reactions and responses did you have to the festival ? <p> Responses to the festival were overwhelming positive . People let us know they were very happy to have a safe and welcoming LGBTQ community arts event on their doorstep . Some people had never attended a queer film or arts festival before and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We got particularly good feedback on our accessibility measures . People noted how good it was that we only used venues which were accessible for wheelchairs , that we screened all films with subtitles and had BSL interpretation to make events more accessible for deaf and hard of hearing people , and that we converted the toilets at all our venues to gender neutral . Many of our international guests noted that these measures and the inclusivity of our programming made us stand out from queer film festivals in other parts of the world . Responses to the films we chose for the programme were mostly good . Though , of course , people had different opinions on what they enjoyed and what they did n't but this resulted in real dialogue and debate about queer film as a genre and art form , which was great . <h> How are plans for 2016 's festival looking , what 's next for SQIFF ? <p> We want to replicate the success of last year 's event and work on how we can improve it to be more accessible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any feedback from LGBTQ+ individuals and communities in this regard . One of the best ways we know to keep improving is to get more people involved in programming and planning and we have expanded our organising committee to include LGBTQ+ people with a wider range of identities , experiences , and film expertise , which we hope will feed into an even better programme and festival for 2016 . <h> Equality Matters <p> Creative Scotland is calling on Scotland 's Film and TV professionals to take part in a wide-ranging screen equalities survey , to inform our understanding of issues of under-representation .

The projects worked towards one or more specific outcomes and were expected to produce a final showcase of completed work , an event or performance . <p> Phase Two of TTS.Digital involved close joint working with members of Youth Arts Voice Scotland ( YAVS ) , a national youth advisory group for the TTS strategy .

The highlight in the North American craft calendar , the show has up to now only showcased the work of North Americas leading craftspeople . <p> Attended by over 20,000 people and showcasing over 650 different designers across three days from Friday 24 to Sunday 26 February , the work of Scotlands makers proved a massive hit as the Craft Scotland areawas inundated by visitors across the three days resulting in -100,000 worth of sales . As well as record sales Scottish makers have secured contracts with galleries in the US , have had invitations to further industry shows and for some secured US gallery representation for their work . <p> Craft Scotland Director Fiona Logue said : " Craft Scotland is delighted with the success of our visit to the Baltimore Craft Show at the invitation of the American Crafts Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work on show from organisers , fellow exhibitors and visitors .

This show eclipsed Philadelphia in sales ( about 50% greater ) and also in exposure and interest from the general public . I had customers coming to buy work having visited my studio on Skye and was able to realise several sales from social media contacts . It highlighted to me the importance of making and maintaining personal contacts and continuing to develop exposure of my work on several social media platforms . <p> " It was a strange and interesting time to be in the States .

The stand helped highlight our presence and brand and made us easy to find on the floor amongst hundreds of other makers . <p> " One of the major factors in applying to participate in this show was the subsidised shipping organised by Craft Scotland .

@@43258069 @3258069/ <h> Creative City Networks Review <p> Earlier this year , Creative Scotland commissioned EKOS to study the impact of three creative city networks , Creative Dundee , Creative Edinburgh and Creative Stirling . Each network is independent , focussing on their own distinctive aims and objectives tailored to each of the three cities and has received funding support from Creative Scotland . <p> The review intended to provide information on the impact of each network on its respective city , identifying potential for future development , and any lessons that might be adopted in other cities . <h> Summarising the Review <p> A summary of the review can be downloaded here and some of the key highlights are included below : <p> Operational Models <p> Each of the three projects has evolved a distinctive model , albeit with some common characteristics . In particular , each network shares the following : <p> a broad and inclusive focus that seeks to encourage collaboration right across the spectrum of creative activity ; <p> an emphasis on largely informal styles of networking activities and events ; <p> a bottom up ' approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maintains close connection to the creative community in each city ; <p> a strong feel of being of the sector ' rather than for the sector ' , a function of fact that those leading each network come themselves from the creative community " this enables a high degree of trust ; <p> a commitment to working in partnership across the creative industries and the public sector ; provision of information via digital means ; <p> and a focus on signposting to existing business support rather than direct provision . <p> Impacts <p> All three projects are reportedly creating benefits for participant businesses and practitioners as well as for their wider constituencies ( sector and city ) . In each base , the feedback from beneficiaries was positive , and it is clear that the networks are providing valuable opportunities for cross-sector networking and facilitating collaboration across disciplines . This is entirely in line with their organisational ambitions . <p> It is also worth noting that even though economic impact is not an explicit objective of any of the projects , evidence was found of some such benefit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of networking in supporting growth in the creative sector . <p> In fact , this last point is part of the central rationale for these projects , and three issues are important in this respect : <p> contrary to popular myth , the creative process is not a solitary pursuit . It is more often a collaborative effort across disciplines . Networking is an essential means of facilitating this collaboration ; <p> innovation is what drives growth and development in the creative industries , and the very process of innovation is also highly collaborative and interdisciplinary . Networking is again crucial in creating the opportunities for innovation to coalesce ; <p> the creative industries congregate at regional rather than national levels . It makes good sense to support networking at a local ( city ) level . <p> Clearly then the networks are achieving impacts insofar as they are creating the opportunities for knowledge sharing , peer learning and support and collaboration . At the city level , impacts and benefits are far harder to evidence . <h> Creative City Networks Review Event <p> During a review event on 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , network members , Creative Scotland and Jim Galloway , Head of Enterprise and Innovation " Economic Development at City of Edinburgh Council discussed the value of the Creative City Networks . <p> Below you can watch the video of all talks , view the slides and read blogs about each network .

Funds raised through this innovative approach will then be directed into an ongoing training and support programme for female entrepreneurs in Uganda , The Barefoot in Business Fund . <p> We spoke to Carol to find out more about the film , the fund and how people can get involved ... <h> What inspired you to tell the story of the women featured in Barefoot in Business ? <p> I myself am a sort of accidental entrepreneur as I fell into running a business from being a freelance filmmaker , and through doing so had developed a bit of a fascination with how people do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing some work with a womens group in Uganda , so I went out with the intention of capturing some film . While there I attended an awards ceremony to recognise the female entrepreneur of the year , and I saw every trade , every sector represented . It really stuck me that women were the unsung heroes of Ugandas economy and that there was a huge story to tell about their experiences and the challenges they may face . For example , women make up 40% of entrepreneurs in Uganda , but only 10% of allocated credit . <p> What was key to the story I wanted to tell was that these women were not asking for anything , it was very far removed from a typical Western stereotype view of Africa focussed on poverty or need . Uganda has a thriving economy , and these women are trading day-in-day-out , but what they do need are simple things ; access to networks , access to training and finance opportunities . A handout is n't sustainable nor is it suitable as there 's no shortage of talent and ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . <p> For example , Benedicata Nanyonga , who is one of the entrepreneurs featured in the trailer , just needs to find the right engineer to help tailor-make a machine for her very specific craft . Through Barefoot in Business and the Barefoot Fund we want to help to join the dots in these situations . <h> What do you hope audiences take away from the film ? <p> I hope they enjoy watching a positive and empowering portrait of Uganda that might challenge any preconceptions they have . I also hope people take inspiration from the women in the film and that aspiring entrepreneurs learn from them . Our screening in Glasgow has been organised with Young Enterprise Scotland and it would be fantastic if young people come away feeling engaged and excited about all that is possible . <p> Its particularly close to my heart that we reach out to women , as generally men are still twice as likely to set up a business .

We have been able to mobilise like-minded female entrepreneurs and angel investors keen to be involved in matchmaking female entrepreneurs in Uganda with the right opportunities and markets to turn their big ambitions into reality . <p> What 's vital though is that this is about trade not aid , we want to level the playing field . The fund is about creating a win-win situation where Ugandas female entrepreneurs are able to do business with the organisations that want to do business with them . The ambition is there , the talent is there , the appetite is there , this is a way of bringing all the strands together . <p> Carol means business <h> What 's next for Barefoot in Business ? <p> I am already overwhelmed by the reception and backing of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international development . I am extremely excited about this project 's potential to not just empower the female entrepreneurs in Uganda but also globally as we move forward to the launch of the Fund on International Women 's Day .

We 've made a very clear call to action that comes hand-in-hand with the film so it 's easy for audiences to engage and respond .

@@43258103 @3258103/ <p> The documentary , which was filmed over four years and resulted in the creation of a new sound recording technique , explores the unique hunting culture of the Faroe Islands and our effect on the environment . <p> We caught up with Mike Day ahead of Edinburgh International Film Festival to find out more about the film . <h> What inspired you to tell the story of The Islands and the Whales ? <p> I met a group of Faroese sailors while I was shooting my previous film The Guga Hunters of Ness for BBC Scotland . They wondered what we were doing out there in the gales north of the Isle of Lewis ! When we told them about the seabird hunters they were keen to show us their own hunting , as they are one of the very few places to eat seabirds . <p> It soon emerged that their story was about a lot more than hunting seabirds and whales . Their seabirds were in rapid decline , the birds ' food sources gone and their bellies full of plastic ; while the whales were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat . It seemed these faraway islands had a story that we all needed to hear , the pollution was coming from us not from the Faroes . <h> What were the biggest challenges in making The Islands and the Whales ? <p> We never knew when the whales would come , they only hunt the whales when they are spotted by chance , no one searches for them . It took time to gain the relationships needed to make a film this intimately , it 's a sensitive and controversial subject and many had told us our cameras would be smashed at a hunt . That did n't happen , but it took months of waiting to capture a hunt on camera . <h> Filming resulted in the creation of a new sound recording technique , can you tell us more about this ? <p> We used an ambsionic mic , it 's a tetrahedral system that allows us to record not only stereo , left and right , and surround , front and back , but also up and down , so we can capture the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were filming . This coincided with the launch of Dolby 's 128 speaker Atmos system . We hoped that we could map our source recordings to this new system and recreate the vertical sound . This had never been done before , so we worked with Harpex , an ambisonic software designer , and Skywalker Sound on George Lucas ' Skywalker Ranch to convert the field recordings and map them to Dolby Atmos . The results have been a real success . It 's not meant to be a firework display FX , but something you should feel adding a layer of storytelling and place , transporting the audience into the world on screen . It 's also another unique reason to see the film on the big screen . <h> What role did the Faroese community play in the film coming together ? <p> There could n't have been a film without the Faroese community , in time we were really embraced and it was incredibly moving how much people supported us . As much as they defend the hunting against outside criticism , they know that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a feeling amongst many that this was a tradition that would end , and that it should be documented . <p> Most of the Faroese population have vastly reduced the amount of whale they eat , so there were others including our main characters , who wanted the film to send a message to the world that the Faroes were a warning to us all , that they may be the first to feel the effects of how badly polluted the seas are , but if we do n't act now we 'll be next . <h> How does it feel to have been selected for , and premiering at EIFF ? <p> I grew up with the festival as inspiration , and it was also the first place I pitched this film right before heading off on the first filming trip in 2011 , so it 's really a great honour to be going full circle and taking it home to the Scottish audiences . We will have an extended Q&amp;A with some of the main characters from the film , and we also have Faroese band Sakaris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the film can be found on our Facebook page . <p> We are then heading to screen at AFI DOCS , the American Film Institute 's festival in Washington DC . <h> What do you hope audiences take away from the film ? <p> I hope it 's a film that transports the audience into a place they have n't seen . The film shows the unique Faroese community wrangling with environmental problems we all face , and the film gives the audience a chance to consider many aspects of this story . I hope the film gives us all a chance to take stock of how we live with the natural world , not to ignore the clear signs of the damage we are causing . There is a chance to act now before it 's too late , if not we will all find ourselves in the dilemma the Faroese face , putting contaminated food on the table . <p> The Islands and the Whales premieres at Edinburgh International Film Festival on 17 June , with a further screening on 19 June .

Showing for three nights only ( 3-5 April ) , we find out more about the piece from Francis <h> What was the inspiration behind Cosmonaut ? <p> Eight years ago my cousin was clearing out magazines , amongst them I spotted a " Fortean Times " with a story about two Italian brothers whose interest in space was sparked by Sputnik . They built probably the only full scale space tracking station in the world run by amateurs . Their activities went mainly unremarked until they released a recording in late 1960 . They claimed it was evidence of a failed Soviet manned mission months before Yuri Gagarin was announced as the first man in space . Other recordings followed ; heartbeats , the dying breaths of an unconscious man , a woman crying for help as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dramatic and unsettling than the last . This was the beginning of the " Lost Cosmonaut " conspiracy theory which is still alive today . I was gripped by the story and wanted to know more . <p> As I deepened my research I found the Italian recordings led nowhere other than an echo chamber of unchallenged and unsubstantiated repetition . The story has been re-exploited by dubious cable channel " documentaries " . Each reposting , each comments thread reduces the story until it becomes simply " Evil Russians mercilessly fire young men to their death " . When I talked about the recordings to friends and colleagues their reaction was often " yeah , I bet that really happened " . I was intrigued by the allure of this ghoulish idea . <p> Meanwhile my research on the real history of the Soviet space programme revealed a story as gripping and certifiably true . The " Chief Designer " , Sergei Pavlovitch Korolev was a single-minded visionary who steered the Soviets nuclear missile programme to achieve his ambition of taking mankind into space . As a survivor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . He was denied two Nobel prizes , firstly for Sputnik 1 , the worlds first artificial satellite , and then for the successful mission which put the first human in space . On both occasions the Soviet authorities refused to name their lead scientist stating that it had been the collective effort of the whole people that had achieved these goals . Here was a figure who truly was a " lost " , and one whose incredible work should be known and celebrated . <h> Who is the performance for ? <p> Cosmonaut is a show for anyone who looks at the stars and wonders . <p> In his early 20s Korolev had a group of friends experimenting with rockets . They made their first engine from a converted blow torch . The only way to get the high-grade steel they needed for parts was to melt down cutlery . They had a vision . Korolev was inspired by a scientist of the previous generation , Konstantin Tsiolkovsky , a reclusive mathematical theorist who lived in a log cabin . Korolev worked from first principles , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had it all mapped out ; the Moon by ' 67 , the Red Flag flying on Mars by 75 . <p> Both men combined in their nature great technical and theoretical ability , along with a capacity to dream vast dreams . So , whether you look at the stars and think about escape velocities and faster than light speed travel , or you picture a child playing on a distant world , you share these qualities with them and with our story . <p> The notion of the lost cosmonaut is also at some level a romantic one . It appeals to our taste for doomed heroism . Amelia Earhart and Captain Robert Scott have similarly inspired many hours of screen and stage drama . I decided that the two brothers could become one allowing me to focus on their younger sister , who was their Russian translator . This then also allowed a conduit for an impossible romance to flourish with the Cosmonaut . Its a love story . <h> What do you hope audiences take away from Cosmonaut ? <p> Once I 'd immersed myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays purpose is to bring into public view a figure who should be as famous as Neil Armstrong . This is the man who took humanity into space . But I saw that the lurid hook of the " Lost Cosmonaut " story was where to begin . I repeatedly found that people were initially more interested in this seductive hoax than they were in the true facts . However , as the scale of Korolevs purpose and achievements are revealed the lies are scorched away . <p> I believe the reason that conspiracy theories in general flourish , even in the face of directly contradictory evidence , is that they appeal to strong prejudices that the listener already holds . They do not wish to hear the facts , they do not fit their beliefs . We are living through a period where news media itself is becoming a battle zone , and the tag " Fake News " is used repeatedly to achieve a kind of denigration through repetition . <p> So , I hope audiences will take two key things away from the play . One is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did . The other is an invitation to be sceptical ; to question the seductive lie , no matter how well it is told , or how much you want to believe it . <h> What role can theatre can play in bringing scientific ideas to life ? <p> Scientific concepts about the mechanics of space flight and the workings of radio are threaded through the narrative . They sit naturally as part of the telling ; one could not tell the story without them . We experience , through the characters , obstacles and solutions in way that allows us to understand the " story " of the science . <p> Detailed technicalities of Korolevs work would be hard to stage , however his vision for humanity 's future in space is pure drama . So too is the story of his survival and release from the Kolyma Gulag which he barely survived . He attributed this himself to " three miracles " and there , straight away , Korolev the story teller has gifted me with a dramatic spine . <h> What do you have planned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruitful collaboration with the Edinburgh International Science Festival has always been seen as a first step by both parties . Were very keen to expand on the opportunity that they and Creative Scotland have given us .

Site specific theatre is a passion of mine and I would love to see the piece staged in a major cold war site . There 's a gigantic nuclear bunker near our house in Corstorphine I have an eye on . I 'd also like to explore weaving back through the piece an original idea to include British Sign Language as a second and equal performance language . <p> Cosmonaut performs at Summerhall from Monday 3 Wednesday 5 April as part of the Edinburgh International Science Festival .

Following a poethon in London , where poets read aloud for 24 consecutive hours in many different venues in Edinburgh and London , the funds were raised to convert a long dilapidated cottage and steading into a residential creative writing centre . <p> In partnership with Arvon ( formerly the Arvon Foundation ) , the first course was tutored by Roger McGough and Liz Lochhead and welcomed 15 aspiring writers . This course signified the beginning of a tradition that has become a staple in the literary landscape of Scotland .

Scottish writer Jessie Kesson was born within a few miles of the centre , and themes in her stories are joined by the stories brought by the many aspiring and established writers who visit , in the broad conversation about writing that surrounds the centre . <h> What are your aspirations ? Why do you do what you do ? <p> In 2015 we 've launched our very first programme of creative writing courses under our own name . This first year as an independent writing centre will see significant changes in our artistic programme including our pricing structure and the range of support we can offer to writers . The programme will continue our mainstay of residential courses but will also expand on what we can do for those based more locally by hosting evening events , running shorter courses and having the freedom to be able to adapt to the needs of the writers we meet . <p> We recognise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a space in which to write , so building low-cost retreats into our programme has been an important move in our transformation . <p> Our Youth Programme Manager has also been working hard to expand our young writers programme , and last year we were successful in gaining funding through Cashback for Creativity , so we are looking forward to planning lots of activity to help young people get the opportunity to experience the creative writing process . <p> Everyone who works at the centre is passionate about helping people towards their writing ambition , no matter how great or modest . All the work we do : from the practical side of running the centre , preparing recipes and filling the fridges , and stoking fires to running bursaries , awards and fellowships , is to help any writer who visits us to achieve their target . <p> We 'll continue to work with some of the finest writers in the UK and beyond to provide the opportunity for our visitors to learn industry skills from professional and experienced tutors . <p> A workshop in the sun at Moniack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main house at Moniack Mhor ( photo : Nancy MacDonald ) <p> Moniack Mhor ( photo : Nancy MacDonald ) <p> Moniack Mhor ( photo : Nancy MacDonald ) <p> Moniack Mhor in the snow ( photo : Nancy MacDonald ) <p> Inside the Straw Bale studio ( photo : Nancy MacDonald ) <p> The community garden at Moniack Mhor ( photo : Nancy MacDonald ) <h> What kinds of courses and opportunities do you offer to writers ? <p> Our 2015 programme sees a wider choice of course than we have previously offered . There are short courses , which run from Thursday until Sunday , inspiring a short burst of creativity . We continue to run working week courses , and we also have a one day workshop and several evening events , which are designed to she 'd light on areas of the publishing and agency side of writing . Genres of courses have been expanded and this year we are offering courses in playwriting , songwriting , nature writing , and science fiction alongside poetry and fiction to writers working at varying stages . We screened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed by a talk by Claire Keegan .

The two fellows we are hosting this year , the Gavin Wallace Fellowship and the Jessie Kesson Fellowship , will use some of this time to develop their own work . <p> We are offering wider opportunities for young writers this year including residential courses , outreach workshops , mentoring , online networking and work experience .

This support will include retreat space at the centre and any other input that Jen deems useful to support her project coming to fruition . Jen 's project focusses on the idea of flotsam and jetsam and what washes up on the shores of Shetland , where she lives . Jen has just returned from a research trip to Mexico and we are all looking forward to hearing about what she discovered on that trip . <h> What are your plans for the future ? <p> This is an incredibly important time for Moniack Mhor .

The centre will expand its work with writers who may experience barriers by developing the strand of its programme that focuses on using writing therapeutically . We hope to make mentoring a part of the programme to allow us to support individual writers out with the residential setting . <p> In 2013 , with the help of the Beechgrove Garden , we built a community garden around the centre , so we 're looking forward to seeing how that grows , and improving the productivity of our gardens .

Following the first showing of this work at Fujiya Gallery Hanayamomo in Kyushu , Japan , the exhibition will extend to include a new series of prints commissioned by Peacock . Artist Ilana Halperin and curator Naoko Mabon tell us more <h> What brought you to work on Geologic Intimacy ( Yu no Hana ) together ? <p> Ilana : Naoko and I met at a SCAN event in Glasgow , after she had seen and enjoyed my exhibition The Library at National Museum of Scotland the year before . It emerged that Naoko was from Fukuoka , where I had just returned from , following my research residency with Beppu Projects . In fact I left Fukuoka the day after the opening celebrations for the blossom festival in Naoko 's home city , which was a wonderful experience ! In Beppu , I was researching the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot springs around the city . These potential works were a sort of next sculptural generation of the geothermal and cave based work in The Library . In thinking of how to develop this international collaboration , I realised Naoko would be an ideal curatorial partner , as she was born and raised in Fukuoka and therefore deeply connected to Kyushu . I liked that we are both Scottish based cultural practitioners who are from very different cultures and places - for me as a Jewish New Yorker based in Glasgow , and for Naoko as a Kyushu born , Aberdeen based Scot - who could come together to develop something new across our home terrains . As our initial conversation at the SCAN event was extremely lively and touched on ideas around forming new geological artworks , I felt it would be a great match to invite Naoko to work with me on Geologic Intimacy ( Yu no Hana ) - and it absolutely has been ! <h> The exhibition at Peacock Visual Arts follows the first showing of this work at Fujiya Gallery in Kyushu , Japan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how do you think this project fits into a wider context of cultural exchange ? <p> Naoko : Aberdeen and Kyushu enjoy an historic connection , notably through the Aberdeenshire-born 19th Century Scottish Samurai merchant Thomas Blake Glover . Glover was a long-term resident in Nagasaki in Kyushu , and a founder of what became Mitsubishi Corporation and Kirin Beer Company . <p> This project is not only Ilanas first opportunity to exhibit at both locations , but also engages the public in bigger questions around the earths subsurface . A contemporary art project like this can open up a dialogue crossing art and science on how the earth beneath us brings us energy , such as oil , shale gas , and even geothermal sources , but also risk like earthquakes and tsunamis . This is especially true in both Beppu and Aberdeen , where the environment is shaped by material coming up from under the ground , in hot springs and granite blocks respectively . <p> To illustrate this , we held a public event in Beppu , featuring picture storytelling performance of a local tale about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hells and open Kannawa Onsen . For the Aberdeen event we invite Professor Tim Ingold , whose recent work includes Solid Fluids in the Anthropocene a project between Aberdeen and Chile focusing on ice , concrete and volcanic activity . We also invite Director of Peacock Visual Arts Dr Nuno Sacramento who is deeply interested in questions of energy and the environment , to join the discussion . <h> How does Geologic Intimacy ( Yu no Hana ) build on your previous work and what did it mean for you to be able to work Beppu , somewhere you 've been described as having a long-term fascination with ? <p> Ilana : Over the last few years , my ongoing interest in articulating our relationship to the geological world has manifested through Physical Geology - a project exploring our desire to make corporeal contact with geological phenomena . I have been amassing a new sculptural geology collection , through making work employing naturally occurring geological processes to form each object , as a way of connecting with geology and a more daily sense of geological time . I have made limestone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit alongside geothermal objects submerged in the Blue Lagoon in Iceland . This constellation of new sculptural landmass continues to grow with each new geologically active field site . <p> Geologic Intimacy ( Yu no Hana ) builds on this potentially life long project in several new and unexpected ways . I have now completed a new series of geothermal sculptures , formed over 12 months in hot springs throughout the city of Beppu . The sculptures are made of ceramic and sandstone encrusted in new geothermal mineral deposits . On a material level this is a leap for me as for some time I have been interested in facilitating ' new geological conglomerates ' , artworks entirely composed of minerals and rocks from different geographic locations but which grow into newly merged rock forms . Perhaps this also echoes the conceptual content of the project , as ultimately rocks were the first immigrants travelling across the surface of the earth , and throughout deep time , they have met , formed new landmass , and created unexpected geologies . So in a micro-context , this project has brought Scottish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptural landmass - which feels apt at this particular moment in time . <p> To live and work in Beppu was a dream of mine for twenty years , as I first encountered the place in a photographic spread in an old book about volcanoes that I bought on the street in New York City in 1995 . The phenomenal geothermal wonder of those pictures stayed with me , especially a geothermal pool called Bloody Pond Hell , a pool as red as blood . I am happy to say that Naoko facilitated contact with the keepers of Bloody Pond Hell , and in the exhibition at Peacock I am developing a new wood block print made with red mud from this incredible pool . <h> What were the challenges of curating Geologic Intimacy ( Yu no Hana ) ? <p> Naoko : Firstly the geographical distance between Japan and Scotland . While Ilana and myself are based in Scotland , new geothermal sculptures were growing in Kannawa and our Japanese partners were all based in a faraway country with an 8-9 hour difference . Thankfully we had support from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . The sculptures were looked after well , but the distance often meant 6am phonecalls in my pyjamas ! <p> Secondly , working with a local community not always directly related to the visual art world . Thanks to the lively presence of arts in Beppu through a number of projects by Beppu Project , the Kannawa community is open and supportive to creative activities but building trust between partners while being distant was a challenge - as I knew that it was the key to the projects success . <h> You are working with Glasgow based design studio Graphical House on a limited edition Artist Book to mark the completion of the project . Can you tell us a bit more ? <p> Ilana : As my connection to Beppu grew out of print in the form of my old volcano book , it felt important to develop a printed matter response to the project . It is wonderful to be able to collaborate with Graphical House on this piece , as they bring such an intelligence and specificity of thought to every project they work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired by an amazing catalogue of Pre-Colombian art that I found deep in my father 's books when we were clearing his office - it is not a large volume , but it is exceptionally beautiful . Naoko and I decided it would be appropriate to have a spring celebration to complete the project , especially as early days of the project began during spring blossom celebrations in Fukuoka . With this in mind , we also thought it would be nice to bring an element of the project to my home city of Glasgow , so we are in the process of planning a book launch with Patricia Fleming Projects in May . <p> Find out more about Geologic Intimacy ( Yu no Hana ) and the Artist book at the project website . <p> The exhibition opens on Thursday 30 March at Peacock Visual Arts until Sunday 29 April , with an Artist Talk taking place on Saturday 1 April .

Community cinemas , such as those being nurtured by the Grow Your Own Cinema project , are providing vital access to film titles on the big screen in their local ( and often rural ) areas . These organisations are also often providing a mix of specialised and mainstream films , and opening access to a whole world of cinema on their doorstep as a result .

We managed to get some time with Festival Director Alison Strauss , Festival Producer Emma Mortimore and Marketing Co-Ordinator Emma Henderson to hear more about what audiences can expect . <h> Since it began in 2011 HippFest has won awards , rave reviews and adoration from audiences what 's the secret of its success ? <p> Alison : One of the precious things about HippFest is how open it is . Even though it represents a niche area of cinema the audience is not exclusive in any way . I passionately believe that silent cinema , presented well , is for everyone who enjoys movies . That non-exclusive , democratic approach filters into the programme , the presentation , the welcome and everything we do . Weve managed to tread a fine line appealing to silent film aficionados and academics as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoying a particular film star , or perhaps the musician performing the live accompaniment . <p> The programme is n't narrowed down to a particular countrys output or genre and allows for a really broad insight into the first 40 odd years of cinema . When people come to HippFest they have a chance to hear world-class musicians in a really intimate setting and to see films that very rarely get shown on the big screen , if at all . Sometimes we are screening films that havent been seen in Scotland since they were made a hundred years ago , so there 's a palpable sense of being part of something extra special . <p> Another element of the festivals success , I think , that it manages to draw people from across the UK whilst managing to engage people on the doorstep as well this festival is n't just parachuted in to Boness for five days , shunting aside the loyal year-round attenders . We work hard to engage the local community and local businesses so that the festival is genuinely part of the fabric of the town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and give an unrivalled window on social history. -&amp;nbspAlison Strauss , Festival Director <h> What can audiences look forward to this year ? What are your personal highlights ? <p> Alison : Of course I 'm passionate about every single one of the titles in this years line-up and the particularly exciting combinations of musician and film in each case . But I do have particular satisfaction in the shorts programme this year as it reflects so much of what HippFest is about . Each year we choose shorts to complement the features and we are working with the three UK film archives in 2016 to showcase the invaluable work that they do . <p> For example we are presenting the just discovered , rare , long-lost , Walt Disney animated film , Sleigh Bells ( 1928 ) featuring the first ever Disney character , Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , a long-eared precursor to Mickey Mouse as a short before Peter Pan on Sunday 20 March , discovered by the BFI National Archive last year and screened only once since its restoration . <p> Alongside this will be more rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visit to Kelvinhall in Glasgow in 1929 .

I 'd also like to see Bryony Dixons talk about early cinemas contribution to the war effort in WW1 .

The idea that we 'll see on-screen the Peter Pan J.M. Barrie himself chose ( Betty Bronson ) while listening to the harp accompaniment of Elizabeth-Jane Baldry I think will be something really quite magical . <h> Why do you think silent cinema continues to fascinate audiences ? <p> Alison : Probably the real question here is why would n't it ? The first films of phantom rides with cameras strapped to the front of trams and trains , or static shots of people leaving work , of experiments in editing , trick work , narrative , genre and colour were all part of an incredibly rich and rapid exploration of the capabilities and power of the new medium .

Hopefully screening some of these , on a big screen , with a fine live accompaniment , amongst an appreciative audience and in a proper cinema will play some part in persuading more people that silent film can be relevant , engaging , challenging or simply entertaining ... and that we should do what we can to continue to seek out , preserve , restore and share this creative period of cinema . <h> The century-old Hippodrome is a fitting host what 's its history ? <p> Alison : The Hippodrome is the biggest star of the Festival .

Back in 1912 when the Hippodrome was built , films were being shown regularly in travelling fairs , town halls etc but local Boness entrepreneur Louis Dickson was the first person in Scotland to realise the dream of a purpose-built Picture Palace . He commissioned a local architect Matthew Steele - to design the building and the result is a quietly grand and very beautiful pre-Art Deco delight complete with balcony and still retaining many lovely original features . <p> The cinema is held very dearly in the hearts of the people of Boness and many still refer to the place as Dicksons with reference to Louis himself who , by all accounts , was a terrific character standing at the door to welcome his patrons personally , giving out free oranges on local miners days , and christening his house " Hollywood " . <h> We see you 've got an impressive list of supporters and partners <p> Emma M : We are extremely grateful to our supporters and partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the scale it has . The willingness of international archives to assist with our programme , along with the BFI and National Library of Scotland Moving Image Archive closer to home , allows us to consistently bring newly discovered or newly restored films to the screen . <p> We 've benefited again this year from an on-going relationship with the Goethe-Institut Glasgow who are sponsoring German percussionist Frank Bockius in his UK debut accompanying two Festival screenings , our Laurel &amp; Hardy triple bill and Variety . <p> Support from the University of Edinburgh and the Confucius Institute has allowed us to develop a Chinese strand including the rarely screened Daybreak , a talk on Early Chinese Cinema and workshops for primary schools ( Discover China ) and the general public ( Chinese Calligraphy for Beginners ) . <p> Polish band Czerwie 's accompaniment of Mania ( starring the divine Pola Negri in another HippFest debut ) has been made possible by sponsorship from their hometown , Andrychow , and we 're delighted to be able to welcome the Mayor of the city to the Festival . <p> Film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Bo'ness and Kinneil Railway and Metro Ecosse donate equipment so we can show films on as wide a range of formats as possible . <p> HippFest will again go on tour throughout 2016 , which has been made possible by funding from Film Mobile Scotland . Wunder der Sch+pfung , with a newly commissioned score by Herschel 36 ( Stu Brown and Paul Harrison ) will visit six venues across Scotland between April and September . <h> Although it attracts people from further afield , what does the festival mean to the local community ? <p> Emma M : We aim to work closely with local businesses and community organisations to ensure that the Festival has an impact across Bo'ness and further afield . From the free listings that all Bo'ness shops and eateries can have in our brochure ( kindly sponsored by Town Centre Management ) to the partnerships we 've forged with the Bo'ness and Kinneil Railway , Bo'ness Library , Kinneil House and Museum , the Richmond Park Hotel , Tesco Bo'ness and the Bo'ness Networking Group , the Festival has a reach well outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year to be able to bring the second HippFest Speakeasy featuring the exuberant Bevvy Sisters and the Bad Boys to The Corbie Inn , which we hope will encourage those who may not watch silent cinema to engage with the Festival and support a local business . <p> Kinneil Brew Hoose , located at The Corbie , Inn has again brewed us a special Festival Ale , ' Buster 's Brew ' , which will be on tap at the pub and in bottles at the cinema . With a large Festival crowd coming into town , we get feedback from the local restaurants and cafes who work with us that they see a positive impact on their sales figures during this time and we work with them so they can capitalise on this . <p> More than ever this year , thanks to the continuity offered by our two-year funding from Creative Scotland , the Festival is n't just about five days in March . We 'll have a community tour visiting several venues in and around Bo'ness during the summer months . Cinema ' events ' should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live music out to those who may not have the opportunity or means to visit the Festival at the Hippodrome itself . <h> There 's clearly something for all ages , with youth engagement playing an important part in the programme <p> Emma M : Youth Engagement is certainly an important part of the Festival offering . Local business Caledonian Produce , part of the Bakkavor Group , has generously sponsored this aspect of HippFest for the past three years , enabling us to provide hands-on workshops for Bo'ness Primary School Youth Clubs and beatboxing sessions and equipment for secondary school students . <p> This year we 're delighted that this funding has been complemented by money from the Cashback for Creativity scheme , allowing Screen Education Edinburgh to lead a group of young people from Bo'ness through an intensive Introduction to Film course . This offers practical skills development and the opportunity to qualify for a longer BFI Film Academy course , which could have a real impact on their future . By learning to tell a story through sound , the group will produce a film that will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last day of the Festival . <p> This event in turn is made possible by the Youth Music Initiative which has funded a mentor for six music students from Falkirk High to enable them to compose a score to a film from the National Library of Scotland Moving Image Archive . This will be performed by a local youth orchestra , which they will conduct , with local trad bands also accompanying two other shorts from the archive . New Found Sound is an integral part of the HippFest line-up and is a great showcase for the wealth of musical and creative talent within the local community . <p> The Hippodrome Festival of Silent Cinema runs from 16 - 20 March 2016 , at the Hippodrome , Bo'ness .

@@43258145 @3258145/ <h> Fanning The Flames at Luminate <p> The Flames is a new multi-media theatre group in Glasgow for performers aged over 50 , created by Tricky Hat Productions . The Flames will launch on Wednesday 26 October with two performances at Glasgows CCA as part of Luminate . We find out more from Tricky Hat Artistic Director Fiona Miller . <h> Where did the idea for The Flames come from ? <p> The idea developed from the work we do through Tricky Hat collaborating with many diverse organisations all over Scotland and working with a huge range of people . Often this involves working with people who do n't  necessarily know they want to do it yet . The idea for The Flames came from those who realise not just that they want to do it , but that they want to do more of it and be part of creating and developing their own performances . <p> I also felt as though there werent that many theatre opportunities that were open and non-prescriptive in the way The Flames is for people over 50 . <p> It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might never have before. -&amp;nbspFiona Miller , Artistic Director <h> Who can get involved with The Flames ? <p> Anyone over 50 who wants to be involved ! It really is as open as that . We 've had people taking part whove never had any experience performing before , or maybe people who used to do it but have n't in a long time . Its completely open and we welcome everyone to try something new and take a chance with it . <h> What will The Flames set out to explore in their work and performances ? <p> The performances really are completely dependent on the people involved so its interesting and exciting to find out what theyll choose to explore . <p> General themes that have come out of previous work with older people have included the sense of invisibility some people experience , as well as how we see and perceive older people . Research from Age Scotland has shown that age-based discrimination starts from 50 so these are really relevant themes for this group . <p> Beyond that , one really interesting thing we 've seen being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the idea of trying something new and performing itself as risk , or how our sense of risk changes as we age and what things become risks that never were before . <p> But vitally , it really is all about the participants and what they want to do with this opportunity . <h> Why create a theatre group for specifically the over 50s ? <p> The Flames has definitely developed from the experience we 've gained over the past 16 years of working with older people through Tricky Hat , but I think as well as that it really came down to me asking myself " What do I want to be doing when I 'm older ? " . I think there are n't  really many opportunities like The Flames , and there is a new older generation now who are looking for different things . A lot of these people might have worked their whole lives up to this point and never really found time to do something just for them . Its a chance for them to find their voice in a way they might never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that the type of work they create will be totally distinct - what you 're going to end up with will be so different from if you were working with a group of young people . The life-experience , the energy , all of that will dictate the sort of performance created and I find that in itself exciting . <h> What does it mean to be part of Luminate ? <p> Its fantastic . Were delighted to be part of something bigger with a nationwide impact giving us a chance to reach even more people . I think for our participants as well it really adds value . They already feel the value of what they 're doing , but to have it formally recognised by inclusion in the Luminate programme is definitely very significant for them . <p> Were really excited for the launch and performances on Wednesday 26 October at CCA . The piece has been devised in a really short amount of time so were looking forward to seeing how our audience responds . <h> What next for The Flames ? <p> Following Wednesdays performances were hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were people who wanted to take part this time around but dates just did n't  work out , so itd be great to get ever more participants on board . Were hoping to deliver two more performances next year , one around spring time and another a year from now to hopefully coincide with Luminate again . <p> I think were really seeing this as a first time to test the model , see what we can learn from it and how we can reach even more people with it . If we can bring The Flames to other parts of Scotland thatd be fantastic , we really just want to see how best to bring it forward . <p> You can see The Flames at the CCA in Glasgow on Wednesday 26 October at 2:30pm and 7pm . The Flames is supported by Creative Scotland through our Open Project Fund , as well as Luminate , The Robertson Trust and Glasgow Life . Find out more about Tricky Hat at www.trickyhat.com.

It is inspired by the sense we are all connected by the ocean , no matter where we stand on the planet , and the sense of home and familiarity in that . <p> The title track is a safe return to dry land , and the wintry landscape of West Yorkshire .

It was such great fun , and they were an absolute inspiration and pleasure to work with . The results are evident on the record ! <h> Youll be launching the EP over two weekend dates in Skye , what can people expect from the live performances ? <p> The EP is a musical celebration of everything I love about living on Skye - the folk music , the land , and particularly the amazing experiences I have had playing with some incredible musicians over the years . <p> So the live performances will be a reflection of this .

Most people we work with do n't know that they want to perform yet , but we offer them the opportunity to immerse themselves within the performance scene . <p> We give people the space to experiment with their creativity , growing their confidence and skill set before developing work . <p> We wanted to open up opportunities for people over the age of 50 , regardless of their creative experience .

The great thing about performance though is that an audience member can also add to a show everything is forever evolving , and never static . <h> This will be The Flames second-coming , having performed at the CCA last year . What can audiences expect to be different ? <p> Whilst there are a few performers from the first Flames event , most of the people involved are new to the company ; adding dynamism to the group . <p> We have also invited new artists into the devising sessions so they will bring new ideas to the table too . <p> While the format may be similar , combining mixed media through performance , live music and visual projections , The Flames create quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time around .

We caught up with Jenna and producer Callum Smith to hear about the journey so far . <p> Growing up with family living and working on the Faslane nuclear base ( situated 40 miles from Glasgow and home to the Trident nuclear missile programme ) Jenna was brought up with an awareness of the base , but not of what it really meant . <p> " As the 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum rolled around and the issue of Trident became a political hot topic , " Jenna recalls , " I decided it was time to find out what I really thought about the issue " . <p> What followed was a two-year journey of research and self-discovery where the personal and political collided as Jenna tried to make up her mind about where she stood . <p> Callum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really balanced piece which does n't  try to convince an audience of one view or another on this issue , instead presenting a range of opinions and arguments drawn from Freedom of Information requests , visits to the base , interviews with family members and even forays into activism and protest . <p> " Jenna collaborated with composer Kim Moore , who created an immersive sound design featuring clips from parliamentary speeches and from protests alongside evocative music created by Kim .

" <h> Why was it so important to take the show on tour ? <p> Jenna : " We 've been extremely keen to get Faslane out on the road given its political significance and the lack of unbiased reporting on the subject in the media .

We 've had some amazing responses from the children who are always very vocal in their enjoyment of Gooses playful disruption of Marthas routine ! <h> Why is touring country-wide in Scotland so important ? <p> Scotland has an international reputation for producing some of the best childrens theatre in the world .

We wanted to find a way of making it more accessible and to share with a broader audience . This year we re-imagined the original aesthetic , adding a full set and lighting design and re-working the score to transform it from a simple show with no set to a full theatrical production for larger Scottish venues . <p> It is currently on tour at the moment and we are thrilled this special piece is able to reach a whole new generation of Scottish children and families . <h> What is the impact of creating and delivering high-quality theatre for children and young people in Scotland ? <p> The value of delivering high-quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the shows themes - changing friendships , moving to a new place , feeling different - are important to address and theatre can provide a more engaging and meaningful way of doing so . <p> These are ideas and feelings which all children will relate to in some way but perhaps find theatre a more immediate way of engaging with and talking about them . <p> We also want the diverse arts scene in Scotland to continue to grow and thrive . By giving innovative and high-quality work to children from a young age we are instilling in them the idea that creativity is valued and presenting the option of the arts as a possible career . You need to feed the idea from a young age that making your own work is possible and seeing a theatre company come into your school , put up a wonderful set and perform a few metres in front of you is a brilliant way of making theatre and performing arts feel tangible and accessible .
