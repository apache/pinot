Coroners usually have a legal background but will also be familiar with medical terms . <p> Coroners investigate deaths reported to them if it appears : <p> The death was violent or unnatural ; <p> The cause of death is unknown ; or <p> The person died in prison , police custody or another type of state detention . <p> In these cases coroners must investigate to find out , for the benefit of bereaved people and for official records , who has died and how , when and where they died . <p> Coroners also deal with finds that may be classified as treasure . <h> Post-mortem examination <p> If a coroner decides an investigation is necessary , a pathologist will normally carry out a post-mortem examination of the body . <p> The coroner must release the body as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral . You should let the coroner know in writing if you wish to take the body outside of England and Wales . <p> If the post-mortem examination shows the cause of death , the coroner will send a form to the registrar of births and deaths stating the cause of death . You can then make an appointment to register the death . <h> Inquest <p> If it was not possible to find out the cause of death from the post-mortem examination , or the death is found to be unnatural , the coroner must hold an inquest . An inquest is a public court hearing held by the coroner to establish who died and how , where and when the death occurred . <p> The inquest will be held as soon as possible and normally within six months of the death if at all possible . The coroner will notify you if more time is needed and what to expect in your case . <p> If the death occurred in prison or custody , or if it resulted from an accident at work , the inquest will usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquest <p> The coroner or jury comes to a conclusion at the end of an inquest .

The coroner or jury may use one of the following terms when recording the cause : <p> accident or misadventure ; <p> alcohol / drug related ; <p> industrial disease ; <p> lawful killing ; <p> natural causes ; <p> open ; <p> road traffic collision ; <p> stillbirth ; <p> suicide ; or <p> unlawful killing . <p> The coroner or jury may also make a brief ' narrative ' conclusion to provide more detail about facts surrounding the death and explain the reasons for the decision . <p> The coroner will send a form to the registrar after the inquest is complete .

This can be sought from a hospital or doctor , or from the coroner 's officer . The coroner must be told and must agree before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donation may not be possible for medical reasons or because of delays when a death has to be investigated . <p> If you wish to take the body abroad , you must give written notice to the coroner , who will tell you within four days whether further enquiries are needed . <p> If you wish to bring the body back to England or Wales , the coroner may need to be involved . In certain circumstances , an inquest may be necessary . You can ask for advice from your local coroner 's office . <p> If you find something that may be treasure you must report all finds to the coroner within : <p> 14 days after the day you made the find ; or <p> 14 days after the day you realised the find might be treasure ( for example , as a result of having it identified ) . <p> Everyone is required to report finds , including archaeologists . <h> The definition of treasure <p> The following finds are classed as treasure under the Treasure Act 1996 : <p> Coins <p> All coins from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 years old when found . If the coins contain less than ten per cent of gold or silver , there must be at least ten of them to count as treasure . <p> Objects other than coins <p> Any other object may count as treasure if it contains at least ten per cent of gold or silver and is at least 300 years old when found . Note that objects with gold or silver plating normally have less than ten per cent of precious metal . <p> An object or coin is part of the same find as another object or coin if it is found in the same place as , or had previously been left together with , the other object . Finds may have become scattered since they were originally deposited in the ground . <p> Only the following groups of coins will normally be regarded as coming from the same find : <p> Hoards that have been deliberately hidden ; <p> Smaller groups of coins , such as the contents of purses , that may have been dropped or lost ; and <p> Votive or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trove <p> An object that would previously have been treasure trove , but does not fall within the specific categories given , must be made substantially of gold or silver and have been buried with the intention of recovery .

You should also keep the information confidential . <p> The person receiving the find will notify the Sites and Monuments Record as soon as possible ( if that has not already happened ) so archaeologists can investigate the site if necessary . <h> If you fail to report a find of treasure <p> If you fail to report a find of treasure you could be imprisoned for up to three months or receive a fine of up to 5,000 , or both .

The museum will then decide whether they or any other museum may wish to acquire it . <p> If no museum wishes to acquire the find , the coroner will usually notify the occupier and landowner the office intends to return the object to the finder after 28 days unless an objection is received . If the coroner receives an objection , the find will be retained until the dispute has been settled . <h> If a museum wants to acquire the find <p> If a museum wants to acquire part or all of a find , the coroner will hold an inquest to decide whether it is treasure . The coroner will inform the finder , occupier and landowner and they will be able to question witnesses at the inquest . Treasure inquests will normally be held without a jury . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be taken to the British Museum so it can be valued . <h> Receiving a fair price for the find <p> Any find of treasure a museum wishes to acquire must be valued by the Treasure Valuation Committee , which consists of independent experts who will commission a valuation . You , together with the museum that wishes to acquire the find and any other interested party , will have an opportunity to comment on the valuation and to send in a separate valuation of your own , before the committee makes its recommendation . If you are dissatisfied you can appeal to the Secretary of State . <h> Loss or damage to the find <p> The coroner or museum is required to take reasonable steps to ensure the find is not lost or damaged . In the unlikely event this happens , you should be compensated . <h> Receiving the reward <p> The person who receives the reward is set out in detail in a Code of Practice .

If the finder makes an agreement with the landowner/occupier to share a reward , the Secretary of State will normally follow it . <p> If the finder does not remove the whole of a find from the ground but allows archaeologists to excavate the remainder of the find , the original finder will normally be eligible for a reward for the whole find . <p> Rewards will not normally be payable when an archaeologist makes the find . <p> Where the finder has committed an offence regarding to a find , has trespassed , or has not followed best practice as set out in the Code of Practice , they may expect no reward at all or a reduced reward .

@@23526122 @3526122/ <h> Previous consultations <p> We plan to publish a new carers strategy in the summer which focuses on the health and wellbeing of carers . It will be an all-ages strategy , aimed at supporting carers to both continue caring and to have a life of their own . <p> The strategy will last from 2017 to 2022 and has been produced by the health and wellbeing board for North Yorkshire , working on behalf of local residents . <p> Three in five of us will be a carer at some point and almost everyone will know a family member , friend or colleague who is currently a carer . <p> With the help of carers and other organisations we 've been finding out what 's working , what needs to change and how we can do that in partnership . <p> As a result of this engagement with carers and partners over the last 12 months we have proposed a number of themes for the draft strategy . These are : <p> We have a contractual commitment to review fee levels with our social care providers on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in different ways , ranging from a flat rate percentage increase to a fixed-rate uplift subject to financial review and on occasion no uplift has been agreed .

The parties believe that by both coordinating and integrating their planning and commissioning activities will help facilitate the best use of resources to support the local resident and patient population .

Maintenance of the network is arranged by a small team of officers with support from landowners , contractors and a dedicated group of countryside volunteers . <p> We have had to reduce our spending by around 35 per cent over recent years and this has affected all council services , including public rights of way . As a consequence we are now looking at ways to continue managing the public rights of way network with less money . <h> Network categorisation <p> The purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new approach to categorising the public rights of way network . Doing so will allow us to focus routine maintenance in areas where paths are agreed as being more important or better used . The category of a route will also help us to plan how we respond to defects that we find or are reported to us . <p> We will manage the network based on sections of the paths or ' links ' . We will then assign a route category as follows . <p> Each link will have a score for the key characteristic of the path . Example characteristics are safe routes to schools and paths in areas of outstanding natural beauty . <p> Each link will also have a score based on an assessment of the value placed on the link by the local community . <p> We will categorise each link based on the combination of characteristic and community value scores . <p> We will map the category banding of all routes and publish this on our website . <p> We have taken this approach because we think that : <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The inclusion of community value will help focus attention and resource onto parts of the network that will provide greatest benefit and value to local communities . <p> Measuring the value that different communities place on different routes is intended to make sure that we focus resources and effort onto paths that benefit users and local communities the most . However , it is difficult to define and measure community value , so we intend to implement our approach initially based on path characteristics alone . An important part of this consultation is to gather views over how best to measure community value in future . <p> Elected members of the county council 's executive met on 31 January 2017 and considered the outcomes of the public consultation . Following careful consideration , they agreed to publish statutory proposals to close the school from 31 August 2017 . <p> The statutory proposals were published on 16 February 2017 to run to 16 March 2017 , with a final decision being made by the executive on 28 March 2017 . <p> The statutory proposals provide four weeks for representations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The single primary school would operate on the existing Ingleby Arncliffe school site and serve the two catchment areas currently served by both Swainby and Potto and Ingleby Arncliffe Primary Schools . <p> In order to maintain the historical link between the schools and the Diocese of York , the single school would retain its status as a Voluntary Aided Church of England school .

It would be subject to a single Ofsted inspection and would receive a single budget . <p> The Governing Body has not reached the decision to initiate consultation lightly and has already considered a number of alternatives .

It has been a pleasure being able to engage with our customers and confirm we are on the right path . <p> We have accepted the government 's four-year financial settlement . The settlement is very challenging given that it represents the phased removal of the government 's revenue support grant by 2020 . <p> However , it also offers a degree of certainty and the opportunity for contingency planning during a period of extreme uncertainty . Given the national and global economic environment including the impact of Brexit , the offer will form part of the council 's prudent financial management and plan to maintain sensible levels of reserves as a buffer against unforeseen events . <p> We are consulting on our budget for 2017-18 and as part of that consultation would like to hear from you . <p> Our long-term plan is to increase council tax by 3.99 per cent for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will go towards adult social care . Most of this increase will be required to cover the government 's announced increase in the national living wage , the rest will be used to fund the increasing demand . In 2015-16 we supported 7,297 older people in North Yorkshire who need long-term help with their care and support ( e.g. support in dressing and eating ) . Currently over 40 per cent of our budget , some 136m , goes on adult social care . <p> The 1.99 per cent increase in council tax is more than offset by the further reduction in government grants from 59m to zero by 2020 . Without this increase there will therefore be a further 5m of savings required in 2017-18 alone . <p> More information on our budget and how we spend it is available on our spending pages . <p> The county councils executive agreed to publish statutory proposals and notices on 5 January 2017 proposing that Horton-in-Ribblesdale Primary School should close . <h> Decision <p> On 21 February , the county council 's executive considered a report containing the responses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close Horton-in-Ribblesdale Church of England ( Voluntary Aided ) Primary School from 31 August 2017 . <p> To extend the catchment area of Austwick Church of England ( Voluntary Aided ) Primary School from 1 September 2017 to serve the area currently served by Horton-in-Ribblesdale Church of England ( Voluntary Aided ) Primary School . <h> Update - appeal and decision <p> An appeal against the decision to cease to maintain Horton-in-Ribblesdale CE ( VA ) Primary School was referred to the Office of the Schools Adjudicator . <p> On 28 June 2017 the Schools Adjudicator approved the proposal that Horton-in-Ribblesdale Church of England ( Voluntary Aided ) Primary School should close from 31 August 2017 . <h> Background papers <p> We are developing a healthy weight , healthy lives strategy to address the rise in childhood and adult obesity in North Yorkshire and would like your views . <p> The most recent North Yorkshire joint strategic needs assessment has highlighted the worrying rise in childhood and adult obesity as an increasing problem across the county , particularly among the adult population , with North Yorkshire now being ranked 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To address this problem , the North Yorkshire health and wellbeing board has agreed that a healthy weight , healthy lives strategy should be developed .

However , the Commons Act 2006 provides safeguards for common land against deregistration to ensure its long-term protection . <p> Under section 19 of the Commons Act 2006 , you can apply to correct any error in the registers made by the registration authority . <p> You can also correct some other types of error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered as common land and town and village green and do not affect the quantification of a right of common . You must provide evidence showing what caused the inaccuracy in the register . <p> The following may be corrected : <h> Mistakes made by the registration authority <p> You can apply to correct any mistake the registration authority made when recording an entry in the registers , such as : <p> if the registration authority made an error when mapping the boundary of land during the provisional registration ; or <p> if , in amending an entry in the registers , the registration authority made an error when entering the number of rights . <p> The applicant is responsible for providing evidence the registration authority made the mistake . <h> Duplicate entries <p> You can remove a duplicate entry in the registers .

Any new right of common must be attached to land in order for it to become exercisable . <h> Existing rights <p> Under section 7 of the Commons Act 2006 , you can apply to vary an existing right of common so it becomes exercisable over new land , in replacement or in addition to the existing common land , or is otherwise varied , such as the stock which may be grazed . <p> If the transfer of a right of common held in gross occurred on or between 2 January 1970 and 15 December 2014 , then you can apply to transfer the right held in gross under Schedule 3 of the Commons Act 2006 .

It may be helpful to draw our attention to any statutory disposition which has not been registered under this section . 
@@23526145 @3526145/ <h> Important information to consider <p> We make the decisions about admissions to North Yorkshire community and voluntary-controlled schools . This is based on the over-subscription criteria . <p> Admissions to voluntary-aided , foundation , trust schools and academies are controlled by their governing bodies . You can get policies for these schools from the school concerned . We do , however , coordinate admissions on their behalf and will make the offer of a place . If you want to apply to a voluntary-aided , foundation , trust school or academy , you should name it as a preference on the online or paper common application form . <p> It is important to note that some voluntary aided schools require parents/carers to provide additional information by completing a supplementary information form . Failure to complete and submit this form to the school will mean that you application is considered after all other applications for which a form was submitted . Where the school is oversubscribed this could mean that a place can not be offered to your child . If you have any queries about this issue please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Government 's coordinated admission scheme , all applications for school places need to be made through your home authority . Local authorities will then liaise with each other regarding cross border requests to make sure places are allocated according to the relevant admissions criteria . <p> You can get details of the admission criteria for schools outside North Yorkshire by contacting the authority responsible for admissions to that school . <h> Think ahead <p> Places at secondary schools are based on your home address , not the primary school your child will , or may , be going to . If you list a primary school which is not your normal area school , your child may not be able to transfer to secondary school with their friends . <p> If you list a school which is not your normal area school , you will normally be responsible for transport arrangements and costs . <h> Nursery schools and nursery and pre-reception classes <p> Some schools run a nursery class , these are are marked by the letter ' N ' in the list of primary schools . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term after their fourth birthday . These are marked by a ' P ' on the list of primary schools . <p> Parents must be aware that attendance at a nursery or pre-reception class attached to a primary school neither guarantees nor gives priority to a place at that school . To prioritise children attending the nursery would discriminate against : <p> Younger children ; <p> Children who are attending a nursery class in another school or setting ; and <p> Children whose parents choose not to use any of the pre school provision available . <h> Provision for two , three and four year olds <p> All three and four year olds are entitled to 15 hours per week of free Early Years Foundation Stage provision from the beginning of the school term following their third birthday until compulsory school age . This free entitlement can be taken up in maintained school nursery classes and/or private and voluntary sector Ofsted registered provision . It is your choice as to which type of provision is most appropriate for your child and most convenient for your individual circumstances . <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preschools or child-minders , have to meet Early Years Foundation Stage requirements and your child will get the same experiences whichever type of provision you choose , it is only the environment that changes . <p> To be eligible to offer the free entitlement , early years providers have to register with us , and we maintain a directory of providers . You can get information on all Early Years Foundation Stage providers from the North Yorkshire Families Information Service website at www.nyfamilies.info or by calling 01609 533483 , our staff will be pleased to talk you through the options available to you . <p> You can access the 15 hours of free provision flexibly , within the following parameters : <p> To be taken over a minimum of two days . <p> Sessions can vary in length but the minimum length is 2+ hours . <p> The earliest a session can start is 7am and the latest it can finish is 7pm . <p> You do not have to take all the 15 hours with one early years provider but the maximum number of providers you can use is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the entitlement by taking fewer hours a week over more weeks of the year . <p> This flexibility is designed to enable you to plan provision that best suits you and your child . You can not assume that all the Early Years Foundation Stage providers in your area will be able to meet your requirements , but you can expect as a minimum to be able to access provision either as five sessions of three hours ( five mornings or afternoons or a combination of mornings and afternoons ) or as three sessions of five hours , although not necessarily at every setting . <p> Once you have chosen the provision you wish to use you will be asked to sign a parental agreement that specifies exactly when your child will attend . This agreement will remain in force for at least a school term and possibly for the whole school year . <p> Applications for a place at a nursery school or a school with a nursery class should be made directly to the head teacher . <h> Provision for two year olds <p> From September 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of provision in exactly the same way as three and four year olds . To be eligible the family must be receiving at least one of the income support ; income based job seeker 's allowance ; child tax credit with income less than 16,190 and not receiving working tax credit ; support under part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 ; guarantee element of state pension credit . <p> Eligibility checks are undertaken by the Families Information Service , to whom applications must be made . You can contact them on 01609 533483 or email **33;108;TOOLONG . <p> In addition all children who are currently or have been previously looked after are also eligible . This includes those who have left care through adoption orders , residence orders or special guardianship orders . <h> Infant class sizes <p> Infant classes ( Key Stage 1 - Reception Year 1 and Year 2 ) must not contain more than 30 pupils with a single school teacher . Additional children may be admitted under limited exceptional circumstances . We will need to take account of this when we offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advice on applying for a school place <p> If your child is aged between 5 and 16 , you have a legal duty to ensure they receive a full-time education suitable for their age and ability and we must make arrangements to help you decide which school you would prefer your child to attend . <p> As a parent or carer , you are able to preference any school you would like your child to attend . We encourage parents to preference between 3 and 5 different schools and to rank them in order of preference . When making your preferences it is important you check which school serves your home address , this may be known as your catchment , local , normal or appropriate school . You can find information on types of schools here . If you list a school which is not your catchment school you will be responsible for transport arrangements and any associated costs . <p> Information for children with a final statement of special educational needs ( SEN ) or an education health and care plan ( EHCP ) can be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools except independent schools . The School Admissions Code ( 2014 ) states admission authorities must allocate places on the basis of their determined admission arrangements only , and a decision to offer or refuse a school place must not be made by a single individual in an admissions authority . Where a school is its own admissions authority the whole governing body or admissions committee , established by the governing body , must make such decisions . It is important you understand the type of school you are applying for , as the type of school affects the criteria used to determine which children will be offered places , who make the decisions and who you must appeal to if you are unhappy with the decision . <p> Please note head teachers or other school officials are not allowed to give any indication of whether your application will be successful . In addition they can not inform parents their child has been allocated a place before a formal offer has been made by the local authority . <p> When a school is oversubscribed , that is , where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places is determined by the published admissions criteria . Part of the criteria uses the child 's principle , permanent home address . You must notify us of any change of address immediately . The definition of ' home address ' or ' principle , permanent residence ' , for the purpose of school admissions is the address at which your child resides most of the time . If the residency of your child is split between both parents , we consider the home address to be the address where the child lives for the majority of the school week ( Monday to Friday ) . Parents will be required to complete and return a split residency form detailing the split deprived of their rightful place , therefore we check carefully to ensure correct addresses are used to prioritise applications . <p> fraudulent or intentionally misleading , the local authority reserves the right to withdraw the offer of a place .

Access to enhanced mainstream provision is shared across the wider local area . A child may access the provision when the local authority deems the child has special educational needs and the provision is appropriate to meet those needs . It is important to note the presence of enhanced mainstream provision at a school does not form part of the local authority 's admission policy and is not considered as a reason for applying for a place at that particular school unless a child has a final statement of special educational needs ( SEN ) or an education health and care plan ( EHCP ) which names that school . <p> reduction of fees for board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits . <p> Schools must provide , free of charge , any activities which take place out of school hours but relate to the national curriculum or form part of a public exam syllabus . The exception to this is where the activities are provided by Bewerley Park and East Barnby Outdoor Centres . Schools may charge for the cost of board and lodgings on field trips and may ask for voluntary contributions for activities which the law does not allow them to charge for . Schools may levy a charge for certain activities but only after the governors have agreed on a detailed policy for charging . <p> If you would like your child to attend a school which is state funded , the law states you must make an application for admission .

If you have any queries regarding admission to a voluntary-aided faith school please contact the school . <p> In accordance with the school admission code ( 2014 ) , the local authority may only offer one school place per child . <p> If parents disagree which school they would prefer their child to attend a school place will not be offered until the dispute has been resolved . <p> The local authority will require evidence of parental agreement in the form of either , written confirmation from each parent or a Court Order .

Schools that are their own admission authority , such as voluntary aided , foundation , trust schools and academies maintain their own waiting lists . <p> Please note , a waiting list is a living document which can change , for example , when the offer of a place is turned down or a child moves in/out of area . Whenever a change is made the waiting list is re-ranked in line with the published oversubscription criteria for the school .

Priority must not be given to a child based on the date their application was received or the date their name was added to the waiting list . However , ' looked after children ' , ' previously looked after children ' and those allocated a place at the school in accordance with a fair access protocol must take precedence over those children on a waiting list . <p> We can only accept a different name if you provide written evidence that everyone with parental responsibility for the child is agreeable to the change of name . <p> A deed poll or statutory declaration is not sufficient to allow the admissions , transport and welfare team or a school to change a child 's surname , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parental responsibility agreeing to the change . <p> If either parent does not agree , or can not be contacted , the name can only be changed legally by a court order . <p> It is the responsibility of the parent who wishes to change the surname to obtain the consent of the other person with parental responsibility . <p> If you are applying for a community or voluntary controlled school , you must complete the relevant section of the common application form and provide supporting evidence from an appropriately qualified professional . <p> This evidence should be current and state why your highest preference school is the only school which can meet your child 's needs and the difficulties which would be encountered if your child had to attend another school .

The closing dates for providing evidence of exceptional social or medical reasons are : <p> If you live within another local authority but are applying for a place at a North Yorkshire community or voluntary controlled school , you must complete your home authority 's application form .

An early review can be arranged , if necessary , to review your child 's progress and discuss whether he or she would benefit from a specialist placement or if additional support or provision can be made within the current setting .

If your request is refused , you must decide whether to accept the offer of a place for the normal age group , or to refuse it and make an in year application for admission to year one for the September following your child 's fifth birthday . Where your request is agreed , you must make a new application as part of the main admissions round the following year . <p> If you have not been offered any of your higher preferences , this is because there were more applications than there were places available at the school and other children had a higher priority under the published admission criteria . <h> Class size 30 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 class sizes to no more than 30 children per class . <p> If you have not been offered a place at a school due to class size 30 , further information will be sent to you in due course . <h> Statutory right of appeal <p> You have the statutory right of appeal to an independent admission appeal panel , should you wish to do so .

What 's it like when you first come home with your adopted child or children ? Where do you turn for support ? Here , some of our adopters share their experiences . <p> Some children need a lot of help to deal with their past experiences . Older children will need lots of time and patience before they start to really believe that people can be trusted and some may never fully believe this . But children are amazingly resilient and determined - they can be a real inspiration to their adoptive families . <p> The greatest need is always for adopters of children aged between three and eight and we prioritise applicants for this age range . We also need adopters of disabled children . <p> Michelle ( 42 ) and Chris ( 47 ) adopted their son last year when he was five years old .

It 's not like having a baby , because he 's already got a personality , he 's already learnt a lot of behaviours and he can speak for himself . <p> We spent five days with him before bringing him home . They said he 's so ready for his new family , there 's no point in dragging it out . On the Monday we met him for the first time and on the Friday , we drove him home ! <p> We had to teach him things like boundaries , we had to tell him , you do n't need to shout , we 're just here , and we 'll hear you ! They wanted him to go to a couple with no children so he 'd have one-to-one care and we noticed that his development came on leaps and bounds straight away . <p> But he 's so secure now and he 's more than happy to go on a sleepover on his own to his auntie 's house . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and downs like everybody else , but he 's just great fun ! <h> Did you start out wanting a five year old boy ? <p> No , I wanted a baby girl - the younger , the better ! But the whole process changed your attitude . You became more open to other possibilities . <p> The people who led the course were really good . They introduced us to a lady who had adopted a little girl at the age of eight . Her story opened your eyes a bit and you thought well , if they can manage with a girl who 's eight and been through a lot of stuff , so can we . <p> Those stories that those people were able to bring were really useful . But you get so much theory thrown at you because you need to have your eyes and your mind open . <p> I think because of his age he was kind of running out of options , because people often do want a younger one . I did , until I saw his picture , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy who needed a break and you 've given him a break and he gives you so much back . <h> Did you have any preconceptions about the adoption process ? <p> We had spoken to a colleague who adopted two children , and I think she had a more negative experience than we did . For us , the information that we were given at the beginning of the process was quite clear about what was going to happen and when . <p> We went to an information evening where we watched a film to show the circumstances that some of the kids come from , and I think that was supposed to really upset you . The social worker said it might feel like they 're trying to put you off and in a funny way they are because they need to know you 're up for this . <p> The preparation course that we did was really well put together . We were concerned the first day we went and we left after every day feeling , energised and motivated and fired up . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , introducing real people who had gone through it , giving us exercises to do , making us aware of the things we need to know . It did n't feel like a drag or anything . <p> But then once we got approved as adopters , the same day we got given our son 's profile . <h> Did you have the support you needed ? <p> Yes , our employers were very supportive indeed . One of our bosses lives with a lady who has adopted so he was very supportive . <p> And our son 's social worker was fantastic . She really easy to talk to , you just felt she was there , she was on your side and I think that 's what you need . <p> But we got some great advice from a friend within our support network one time who said , just remember , he 's a child first and he 's adopted second . <h> What 's the best thing about adoptive parents ? <p> That 's a big question ! But I 'd say it was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he smiles . <p> This morning , at breakfast time he was just sat there , and I ca n't remember what he was saying but he 's got a beautiful smile and he had this massive great grin on his face and you think , it 's great , this ! But when it 's just been me and him for the day , he likes nothing better than to go for a walk in the countryside and it 's lovely , just spending the day with him . It 's the simple pleasures . <p> But also watching him progress and grow is phenomenal , actually . We take him swimming quite a lot and he just loves it . And he would n't go down the slide on his own at first but his confidence is building . He 's just in now and he 's off ! <h> What would you say to someone who was thinking about adoption ? <p> Just do it . If you 're thinking about it , just do it . We never considered IVF . It could have been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right for us . <p> If you can talk to someone who 's been through it and you can meet the kids , I think that 's really important . <p> Do n't be scared by it . We were talking to someone about it the other day , who was saying that they could n't face the inquisition , but you need to get over it , do n't you . What 's more important - feeling uncomfortable for an afternoon or having a child for the rest of your life ? <p> Paul ( 33 ) and Anne ( 37 ) adopted two brothers 18 months ago , after several unsuccessful IVF attempts . They 're now starting the process again to adopt their third child . Here , they share their experiences and urge others to take the plunge . <p> How long did you think about adopting before you took the first step ? <p> We 'd been thinking about it for about a year before . We 'd previously had IVF for the best part of four or five years and it 'd not worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than a year . Looking back , if we knew then what we know now , we 'd have just gone straight for it . <p> When we initially contacted social services , they were a bit unsure about us being in the army , with all the moving around , but by the second meeting they were really positive . And our social worker has been really good . <h> How did you find the application process ? <p> We got on our preparation course very quickly but some people did have to wait quite a while . So we were quite lucky to get on that pretty quickly . <p> There were some positives from it , like meeting successful adopters with their children - that was very good . There was another day when we went to a discussion forum with other potential adopters and some who had recently adopted , and again that was very helpful to speak to those people . The application process was quite long , but I understand things have changed a bit now , which is good . <h> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process and since then ? <p> Our social worker has been fantastic , she 's been really good . We can call her whenever we want . We 've never really had to , but we know that we could if we needed to . <h> Has the Army supported you through the process as well ? <p> Yes , they 've been very supportive . As soon as we let them know know what we wanted to do , they were really very good about it . They knew we 'd been going through IVF and I 'd had time off for that anyway . <p> On camp here , they 're very good . They 've got things that you can take your kids to and they 're all free . And they 're open to civilian families as well so you can meet local families too . It 's ideal really . <p> I was even meant to be getting posted to Nottingham last week and I went through the welfare system and told them we were in the middle of adopting a third child and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you start out wanting to adopt siblings or did you come round to the idea as you went through the process ? <p> We always wanted to adopt siblings from the start . We knew we wanted more than one child , and we did n't want to go through the process of adopting again , even though we are . We wanted our children to always have each other in their lives , to be able to grow together and have that connection . Even though they have been adopted they would always have each other . <p> Having them together has been great , sometimes exhausting but very rewarding . They love each other very much and are best friends and I can see them always being close as they grow up . <h> So you 've not been put off going through it all again for a third child ? <p> No , not at all ! Especially now it 's shorter as well . We 've had to redo all the application forms again but a lot of it 's just cut and paste . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many children we 've got ! <h> What do you get out of an adoptive parent ? <p> We do n't feel like adoptive parents , we just feel like parents . These are our children and we love them very , very much . We 've got two amazing boys and they 're thriving . <h> Is there anything you 'd say to someone who was thinking about adopting ? <p> Just do it . Take the plunge and go along with the ride ! We 're just so glad we did it because it 's the best thing we 've ever done . <p> Alice ( 46 ) and Ben ( 47 ) adopted James and his disabled brother Luke , when they were four and three respectively , and their four birth children were in their teens . <h> What led you to start thinking about adoption ? <p> We 've been married nearly 25 years and we 've always had the idea that we 'd like to have four children and then adopt after that . And that 's exactly what happened ! But it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we first looked into adoption , it was back 2006 , we were renting a farmhouse , Ben had just started his business and we had four children close together in age so it was quite a handful . The adoption service thought it would work better if the children were a bit older . At the time we did n't like that , we were anxious to get on with it straight away . But I think that the children being a bit older has made it easier for them , because they can understand the whole thing better . They can be sympathetic rather than feeling like they 're competing . <h> Were there any aspects of the adoption process that worried you ? <p> No , people always said they want to know everything about you but as far as we were concerned that was a good thing . From our angle , they 're working to find what 's best for us because they 're on our side really , so we did n't find that difficult . People say it 's scary but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find the process in the end ? <p> North Yorkshire were really , really good . The course was brilliant . All the social workers were really just brilliant people . You started to want to be a social worker , because we were really impressed by all of them . We felt on their wave length with them , all the communication and all our contact at home was really good . <h> Were there any elements of the preparation course that particularly stand out for you ? <p> The bit we always remember is how they teach you that adopted children have missed out on the ' blocks ' in their early years , so even though they 're aged three and four , you might expect to be doing something that you 'd do for a one year old . Like , when they first arrived , they woke up at five every morning and they 'd have snuggle time , and we wrapped them in blankets ! That time is really valuable . Because they are babies really and that 's the sort of baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also spoke to the school about giving James and Luke opportunities to give them back those early years , and they 've been brilliant about it . <h> Did you always want to adopt a child with additional needs or a disability ? <p> Not initially , no . We got in touch with a fostering organisation some time ago and through them we met this one woman who had four birth children , four adopted children and two of them were disabled and she really inspired us . In the end it was obvious that we were n't fosterers , we were adopters . But it was still really helpful and they gave us the vision that things can work really well with disabled children . <p> We thought that maybe our birth children would be able to find it easier to understand a disabled child - there 's a physical need there and maybe that was easier for them to engage with . Sometimes I think the disability protects them from a bit of trauma as well , because the health professionals get in there quite early on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> How have your birth children taken to being adoptive siblings ? <p> We were just terrified of hurting our own children , but we started believe that it would be a great thing for them and it has been . The centre of the home is still focused on children because we 've got the two little ones . And they all do different things with them and they all have a different way of relating to them and it 's been really exciting to watch . There 's a nice kind of pride in them about it , like they feel part of something that 's been really worthwhile . It 's made the home go on being a family home for longer . <p> When they arrived it was the Easter holidays before our eldest child 's A-levels and I was a bit worried about that . Jess played with them loads and she said it made it easier to revise because she had two different focuses , which helped her in a way . In the end she got into university with really high marks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> And what sort of support have you received from the council and from other areas/sources ? <p> Our social worker knew the children really well , so everything that she had to offer was really valuable . All her visits were great and we found it was best just to be completely honest and whatever was happening , we 'd tell her . She always had a good piece of advice every time . <p> The worst that can happen is that people do n't ask for help when they need it . Because things could get much worse . But that 's why the support after adoption is good , because they want you talk about things . <p> Like right at the beginning , it was lots for James to cope with to come to a new home and then into a new school . He would explode into confusion and muddle when he came home after school because everything was too much . Our social worker arranged some help just for that hour after school so I could just take him off on my own and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dogs . It 's just having that extra pair of ears and eyes to think of solutions . <p> But our faith has been really important as well , just in helping us get this far and in how we function as a family and how we cope on a day-to-day basis . It is really vital to us . <p> There was another mother from school who 'd had birth children like us and they adopted a boy with a disability , so we started meeting for coffee about once a month . It was really helpful because you 're on a different track to the rest of the world and there are some things you 're going through that nobody else has experienced . Then we asked other families who 'd adopted to come along and it gradually grew into a bit of a group . Usually we meet about once a month and everybody finds it so encouraging . It 's just a chance to be with other people like us ! <p> What 's nice also about this group is that now the children have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had them all here for a big get together and it was just really nice , you know , for adopted children to mix together and they 've always got each other as well . <p> We were talking about it recently and we said that the people you think might be the most supportive are n't always and then it might come from an unexpected place . You do n't quite know how people are going to respond to adoption , it 's a bit of an unknown . So your closest friend might not end up being your best support , you just do n't know what will happen . <h> How does it make you feel , being an adoptive parent ? <p> We 're definitely happy ! It feels like you 're doing something every day that 's so worthwhile . Sometimes you forget , you just get on with the busyness and plodding on with life but then you just stop for a second ... Someone I know described it like sunshine has come into their family , it sounds a bit hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I did n't know how nice everybody was , really , in our society . You start seeing the world through a different pair of eyes because I 've always got Luke with me so you start seeing people 's reactions and people are just so nice and so warm towards him . They both bring out the best in other people , I think . <p> The social worker said that it 's quite likely that if you 're adopted that at some time in your life that you might receive some sort of prejudice about it and as a parent you have to be prepared for it . <h> How does it feel with them in the family now ? <p> It feels like they 've always been here . I suppose it just fills your mind , you 're a family with six children and you 're aware of them all six of them , all of the time . I ca n't really remember what it was like only having four ! <p> And it 's very rewarding in the end because you see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes as well and they start saying things to you and that 's nice as well . <h> Is there anything you 'd like to say to anyone else thinking about adoption ? <p> Do n't give up , especially if circumstances in your life make it seem impossible . Do n't give up . And it wo n't go away , I think , if you 've got that dream . <p> When you have a baby and it 's in your womb , you do n't stop because something 's happened , you just carry on and it 's almost like that , anything could happen but just do n't give up , because that 's life , circumstances keep changing . <p> You could say that there are a lot of parallels between pregnancy and adoption . You might get tired during the pregnancy and you 'll get tired during the adoption , or you might get a bit fed up with pregnancy and you 'll get fed up with the preparation for adoption . But you just forget about all of that as they get older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better experiences start filling your mind . <h> Any other words of advice ? <p> Be honest . The more honest you are , the more they can really work with who you are to get the best match . Just follow your heart and do n't give up ! <h> Support and advice <p> We provide training for all our adoptive parents before they take their child home , but sometimes adopted children can have a range of emotional , behavioural and physical needs because of their early life experiences . <p> If you feel your adopted child requires specific support , you can ask us to do an adoption support assessment . This is a holistic review which gathers in-depth information about your child , your relationship with them , your family circumstances and other things that may be affecting their sense of security . <p> This helps us identify the underlying issues and concerns and we can develop an individual advice and support package where there is an assessed need . This can include : <p> advice on sharing a birth family 's history ; <p> access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child who is asking questions about their identity ; <p> preparing a child for direct or indirect ' post box ' contact with their birth family ; <p> liaising with the child 's school to ensure they receive the educational support they need ; <p> parenting support and help to manage challenging behaviours ; <p> help with specialist funding from the Adoption Support Fund to provide therapeutic services ; and <p> providing short break care . <p> We also offer ongoing training , drop-in events and family fun days out to all adoptive family members . <h> Support for adopted young people <h> Step parent / partner adoption <p> If you or your partner have children from a previous relationship living with you then you are a step-family . Some step-parents may want to make their relationship with these children more formal . One way to do this is adoption . <p> Depending on their age , your child 's wishes and feelings about being adopted will be very important to the court . Before you begin the process , you will need to show that your child has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they know that they have another birth parent with whom they no longer live . Your child will also need to know that they are growing up with a birth parent and a step parent . <p> You will also need to show that you have made efforts to locate and contact the absent partner . This is in order to give the court an indication of the likely attitude of the absent parent to the proposed adoption . <p> Sometimes step-parent ( or partner ) adoption is very much the right thing to do . There are however implications which you will need to be aware of before entering into this process . There are also a number of other options which you may wish to consider . 22769 @qwx222769 <p> In the Yorkshire and Humber areas adoption services are changing to be delivered on a regional basis . This means that local authorities will no longer be individually providing adoption services but will combine to form a larger , more effective regional adoption agency . <p> In the north of Yorkshire and the Humber this will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April the local authorities in the area will be recruiting adopters jointly through a new regional recruitment website , ' One Adoption North and Humber ' . This will join together adoption services from North East Lincolnshire Council , Hull City Council , North Yorkshire County Council , City of York Council , East Riding of Yorkshire Council , North Lincolnshire Council , the voluntary adoption agencies and the adoption support agencies . <h> Changes to the adoption service in your area <p> Working regionally will allow children to be placed in a more timely way and improve the adoption and therapeutic support offered as well as enabling us to share best practice and develop our services more effectively . While the names of the agency in your local area will eventually change , the people and ethos remains the same . <p> Our aim is to continue to provide quality adoption support that meets the needs of those involved in adoption . We will : <p> share good practice across the region ; <p> place children for adoption in a more timely way ; <p> recruit families for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the range and accessibility and quality of adoption support ; and <p> provide a timely assessment and approval process for those wanting to adopt . <p> For more information about One Adoption North and Humber see www.oneadoption.co.uk or telephone 01904 566007 . <p> There are several misconceptions about adoption that can result in people thinking they ca n't adopt . For example , if you are single you can adopt , which people sometimes assume is n't the case . <p> What is more important is whether you have the right skills and qualities to help a child feel happy and safe . Please see the information below to see if you are eligible to apply to adopt . <h> Age <p> By law , as long as you are over 21 you can adopt . We do n't have a fixed upper age limited . You just need to be fit , healthy and able to demonstrate a settled home life . <h> Bereavement of a child <p> If you 've recently experienced the trauma of a lost pregnancy or the bereavement of a child , we recommend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adjust to the loss before contemplating adoption . <h> Children <p> You can adopt if you already have children . We normally recommend that there is at least a two year gap , ideally three , between the age of your youngest child and the child you adopt . <p> You can also adopt if you do not have any children . Adoption is more a matter of your commitment , stamina and understanding . <h> Criminal convictions <p> Having a criminal conviction does n't necessarily stop you from applying to adopt as much depends on the seriousness of the offence and how long ago the crime was committed . <p> However , an adult who has an offence of a violent or sexual nature against a child or young person is legally barred from being approved to adopt a child . <h> Employment situation <p> You can adopt if you work full time , are unemployed or on a low income . We consider people from every walk of life regardless of working or financial status . <p> If you work full time , you can still apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you if you 're a couple ) will usually be expected to take extended time off work , when your child first arrives . <h> Fertility treatment <p> We would not normally accept your application if you are currently trying to conceive or are undergoing investigations for fertility treatment . It can also be distressing to experience infertility difficulties . If this is the case , we recommend that you give yourself time ( at least a year ) to come to terms with this before contemplating adoption . <h> Health or disability issues <p> You can still apply to adopt if you have a disability or health problem . Everyone who applies to adopt is asked to undergo a full medical . The Council 's adoption medical adviser will take this into account when making their recommendation . <h> Marital status <p> You can adopt if you are married , single or living with a partner . The only thing we ask is that if you are in a relationship , it is an established one and you should have been together for at least three years when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong families alone ; everyone needs support but not everyone needs a partner . Being a single parent will bring extra demands which you need to consider and assess for yourself . There can also be benefits for some children and we will happily look at all these areas with you . <h> Owning or renting your home <p> It does not matter if you own or rent the home you live in , you can still adopt . You do need to show us that you have enough room to care for a child , in a safe and secure environment . <h> Sexual orientation <p> You can adopt if you are gay or lesbian . We are only interested in the skills and experience you have to offer , not your sexuality . <h> Smoking <p> If you smoke , you can still apply to adopt . However , we are likely show preference to non-smokers , particularly when placing very young children or those with identified health problems . <h> Where you live <p> We would only consider an application from outside North Yorkshire if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years of age ; a child with a disability ; a child from an ethnic minority group ; or if you were thinking of taking three or more children as a sibling group . <p> If you live outside of the UK , we would not normally accept an application from you in these circumstances . <p> The process to becoming an adoptive parent is thorough and can be lengthy , depending on how quickly we are able to match you to a suitable child or children . <p> On 1 July 2013 , the government introduced new regulations about the approval process for prospective adopters , to make sure a decision about whether or not a person or couple can adopt is made within six months of receiving their formal registration of Interest to adopt . <p> The application and approval process involves an intensive training and learning programme for adopters , as well as close working with the adoption social workers to make sure we fully understand your needs and requirements . This will make sure we can make the best possible match with one or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two telephone discussions to take your details and get an initial picture of your circumstances . We will give you information about what to expect from adopting and the application process . <p> Within four weeks of initial enquiry <p> You will be able to attend an information evening to find out more about adopting and to meet the adoption team . <p> Within a few days of the information evening . <p> We will visit you at home to talk to you in more detail about adopting . At this point , you will submit your registration of interest form to start the formal application process . <p> We will review your registration of interest form and then decide if we can accept your application . If we decide not to accept it , we 'll tell you why and advise you on what your options are at this point . <p> If we accept your application to proceed with the process , we will allocate a social worker to you , who will be with you every step of the way to becoming a new family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit our offices to sign an agreement about how we will progress your application and discuss your personal training , learning and workshop programme . <p> Disclosure and barring service ( formerly known as CRB ) , medical and other local authority checks are carried out . We will also start contacting your references during stage one . <p> Stage two : Four months from completion of stage one . <p> During stage two , we agree further home visits and your ongoing training , learning and workshop programme . This will be formalised with another signed agreement . <p> We may start to discuss some specific children 's needs with you at this point . <p> Towards the end of your training programme , we will write an assessment report for the adoption panel . This report will be shared with you at least five days before the panel 's assessment and you will be given the chance to contribute your own comments . <p> The adoption panel will consider your application and will make their recommendation to the adoption service , who will make a final decision about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching process with you . <p> Variable <p> You discuss children waiting for a family with your adoption social worker and we propose a choice to the panel for agreement . <p> One to two months <p> You prepare for a life together through planning and introductions before your child arrives . <p> Three months or more <p> When you and your child have settled in together , after a minimum of ten weeks you can apply for an adoption order . You will have lots of advice and support in reaching this decision . <p> After adoption , the support that you receive from the adoption service can continue for as long as you need . <p> Early permanence placements are for a small number of children who may not be able to be safely cared for by their birth parents , who need a short period of time in local authority care , and who are likely to need to be adopted , but still have a chance of being reunited with their birth family . <p> The mainstream or traditional route to adoption can be an unsettling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanence placements can prevent the number of moves that these very young children can experience at a crucial stage in their development and growth . <p> In early permanence the child , often ( but not always ) a baby , is placed with an approved adopter who can foster the child while assessments of the birth family and court proceedings are ongoing . <p> The prospective adopter will the provide the child with a short-term fostering placement and will then go on to adopt the child if the court agrees the adoption plan for the child and makes the relevant legal order . <p> Early permanence allows the prospective adopter(s) the opportunity to parent a baby or very young child , sometimes from birth or soon after , to allow them to be a part of the child 's life from the beginning and also be involved in the key stages of a child 's early development . <p> You will be first be known as an early permanence placement carer . You will also be willing to be approved as an adopter and then a temporary foster carer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assessments of birth family are ongoing . As an early permanence placement carer you should primarily want to adopt a child and be prepared to return the child to their birth family if the court decides that is the best plan for the child 's future . <h> Important points to consider <p> The child will be placed to live with the carers as early as possible often from birth so he/she will be able to experience stability from a much earlier age . The child will also be able to form secure relationships and attachments without disruption and frightening moves of placement even though uncertainty regarding their long-term placement remains and is being considered by the courts . It provides consistency for the child and avoids delays for their future , whether that is to remain with their early permanency carer or to return to their birth family . <p> For a number of these children the court will decide that a return to their birth family is not possible . If that is the decision the child will remain with the carers and will be adopted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared for the child from a very young age . They may have also been in a special position where they have met the birth parents , possibly also through contact . <p> However , if the court decides that the birth parents or other members of the birth family are able to meet the needs of the child , the carers will be involved in helping the child to return to their birth family . While this would of course be very sad and upsetting for you , you will have enough emotional resilience to take solace from the fact that you have given the child the love and security that they needed at a difficult time in their lives , as well as being a key support in helping them settle back with their family . The carers will then continue to receive support from us to help them decide what they want to do next . <h> What this means for adoptive parents <p> In order to help you achieve becoming an early permanence placement carer you will receive mainstream preparation training and specialised early permanence training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivation , resilience , support networks and ability to manage this specialised task . The decision as to whether this is the right choice for you will be a two-way process that will be visited throughout your adoption journey . <p> Following your approval and placement of a child you will receive intensive support from your social worker and the child 's social worker . This will involve a lot of social work visits as well as visits from other professionals . You will be entitled to a fostering allowance until the child 's placement becomes and adoptive one or returned to the birth family . You will also need to attend several meetings about the child and his/her current and future care . <p> It is possible that you will be involved in taking the child for contact while decisions about the child 's future are being made . You will need to work co-operatively with the child 's family and the other professionals involved with the child during this time . <p> You would need to be able to take time off work , be able to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with and manage the uncertainty and challenges within this planning and prepared to work with the child 's birth parents . <h> Quotes from carers <p> Why early permanency <p> " We decided to be early permanence carers because we wanted the chance to be part of the baby 's life from as early as possible . We knew the risks and that we may not be able to keep her but we felt it was worth it . " <p> Process <p> " It has been an amazing process but not an easy one . " <p> " We 're helping to get the best outcome for the child . " <p> Meeting birth parents <p> " We got to meet the birth parents before she was born and while it was a bit awkward for us all we liked them and could see they really wanted to keep the baby . " <p> " We 're glad we met them as she needs to know there are other people out there later in her life . " <p> The only way we could manage at first was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking after her for them . It was hard though because we really loved her and got attached to her . But that was the point of her being with us , so she could feel safe and loved and could build attachments . <p> It was harder to live with the risk than we thought as we were at the mercy of the court 's decision . By this time we loved her dearly and would have been devastated if she had gone back to birth parents . However we really felt for them as well as they tried hard . Whatever the outcome from the courts , one of us would suffer a great loss . <p> In the end she stayed with us and her parents had to say goodbye to her . It was very sad and we had a lot of mixed emotions of feeling glad she was with us but seeing them so upset was hard . <p> The good thing for us is that we got to know her parents . We can tell her all about them when she is growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and how much they loved and tried all they could to keep her . We feel that this will be more beneficial to her ( and us ) than if we had gone through mainstream adoption . She will grow up to know where she comes from and that two sets of people really loved and wanted her . <p> We are coming back a second time for another placement through early permanency so for us it was worth the risk and it has n't prevented us from coming back again .

The Living Well Coordinators will work with individuals ( and their carers ) who are on the cusp of becoming regular users of health and social care services by helping them access their local community and supporting them find their own solutions to their health and wellbeing goals . The role will help to reduce loneliness and isolation and help to prevent or resolve issues for people before they become a crisis . <p> As well as working with many teams within the council ( such as public health and Stronger Communities ) , the living well team will also be working in partnership with NHS clinical commissioning groups , district councils and voluntary , community and social enterprise organisations ( VCSE ) . <h> What do they do <p> Living Well in North Yorkshire aims to improve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so reduce their use of formal support services , including emergency admissions to hospital .

They will work with individuals to achieve the outcomes that are important to them . <p> Help them make simple changes to their lifestyle and their home environment . This may , for example , include providing basic advice to help people be more active , improve their mobility and therefore increase their independence and reduce the risk of falling , <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and independence , and help to remove those barriers . For example , finding ways for a person to attend a local community group <p> As well as supporting people to maximise their own health , wellbeing and independence , Living Well Coordinators have excellent knowledge of local services and initiatives and where necessary they will support people to access those services . <p> This might range from access to home adaptations , such as a grab rail to prevent someone having a fall in their own home , support to access a local friendship club to stop someone feeling isolated , to providing advice on healthy living and sign posting to lifestyle services . <p> In addition to working with individuals , Living Well Coordinators will be extra eyes and ears in the community . They will provide feedback on the quality and availability of low level support in the community to health and care commissioners . <p> They will also support the work of the stronger communities team to identify gaps , needs and community assets , providing information for the community directory .

She has been unable to work for a number of years due to i 'll health . She suffered two heart attacks and as a result had to have numerous operations and has been left feeling very breathless . This has resulted in her becoming more and more isolated in her own home lacking the confidence to go out . She has no family nearby and her friends do not live locally . She had quite a lot of support from her neighbours but she did n't like to rely on them too much . She struggles to maintain her home and it gets her down . <h> What does she want to achieve ? <p> Phyllis identified her financial situation as something she wanted to sort out and something that was causing her some distress . She also identified lots of other goals such as increasing exercise , improving her social life , being able to keep a clean and tidy home , doing small DIY jobs , finding a different means of transport , going back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regaining her independence . <h> How did living well support Phyllis ? <p> The living well agreement was used to ask her about her current situation and what she wanted to achieve . Identifying what strengths she had and support networks in place also enabled us to focus on the positives in her life and to build on them . <p> Phyllis agreed to be referred to the income maximisation team which helped her to gain attendance allowance and a reduction in her council tax bill . This meant she had more money to spend on social activities and jobs around the house . <p> Phyllis said that she had got to a stage where she had been in the four walls of her house for so long , not feeling that she could go out , that she became more and more demotivated . The living well coordinator provided support around motivation , helping to prioritise her goals . Visiting each week gave her the motivation to get the jobs done .

Initially she accompanied Mr Jones on a couple of walks as he finds it difficult initially to engage with strangers and finds that if too many people are talking at once he is unable to follow the conversation . He was introduced to the group gradually and encouraged to get to know a few people .

He is now aware of bird watching opportunities in the area and will make a decision whether to go to the local nature reserve . <p> Mr Jones said " I now feel able to join new walks and find it easier to speak to new people . I will just tell them I have a poor memory and that it 's hard for me to join in conversations if too many people are talking " . <p> Mrs Jones said " I am much happier now that I am not worrying about my husband going walking on his own and maybe getting lost and I can also get to spend some quality time on my own " . <p> Mr and Mrs Ambrose were referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was concerned about their isolation and other issues . <p> Mr and Mrs Ambrose rent a bungalow in a small rural village from a housing association .

He struggles to use his lathe both due to his grasp but also because his knowledge of the machine had faded . <p> The living well agreement was used to ask him about his current situation and what he wanted to achieve . The use of questions such as ' what 's important to you ? ' and ' describe what a good day means to you ' allowed the living well coordinator to find out more about Albert and how to support him .

Albert enjoyed taking the lead over his situation as it was control he felt he had n't had for a long time . This increased his confidence and motivation to make changes . <p> Albert 's request for a volunteer was so specific that the contact with local voluntary agencies was not successful and different approaches were taken by a ) ringing the local Craven College Joinery section to ask if anyone would be interested in giving up some free time to come and aid Albert and b ) creating an advert to place in a local DIY shop to attempt to find an appropriate volunteer . 22774 @qwx222774 <p> Albert achieved his goal of finding a volunteer from the college that was able to support him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played musical instruments , which he lent to Albert .

Listing only 1 school or the same school more than once , will not increase your chances of obtaining a place at that school and may lead to you being allocated a place at a school you would prefer your child not to attend . <p> Parents who have expressed a preference for a school will be considered first . If you do not preference a school , we will allocate a place at the catchment school for your home address if there are places available . If the catchment school for your home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest school with a vacancy , which may be some distance from your home .

Access to enhanced mainstream provision is shared across the wider local area . A child may access the provision when the local authority deems the child has special educational needs and the provision is appropriate to meet those needs . It is important to note the presence of enhanced mainstream provision at a school does not form part of the local authority 's admission policy and is not considered as a reason for applying for a place at that particular school unless a child has a final statement of special educational needs ( SEN ) or an education health and care plan ( EHCP ) which names that school . <p> reduction of fees for board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits . <p> Schools must provide , free of charge , any activities which take place out of school hours but relate to the national curriculum or form part of a public exam syllabus .

Schools may charge for the cost of board and lodgings on field trips and may ask for voluntary contributions for activities which the law does not allow them to charge for . Schools may levy a charge for certain activities but only after the governors have agreed on a detailed policy for charging . <p> If you would like your child to attend a school which is state funded , the law states you must make an application for admission .

Schools that are their own admission authority , such as voluntary aided , foundation , trust schools and academies maintain their own waiting lists . <p> Please note , a waiting list is a living document which can change , for example , when the offer of a place is turned down or a child moves in/out of area . Whenever a change is made the waiting list is re-ranked in line with the published oversubscription criteria for the school .

Many schools will host an open evening for prospective pupils ; you should contact the schools direct to find out the dates and times . <p> Speak to the school 's Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator ( SENCo ) - the SENCo has a role in ensuring provision meets the needs of pupils with special educational needs . <p> View the school 's Ofsted report - this will also be a good source of information . <p> The authority 's expectation is the majority of children with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of special educational needs ( SEN ) or education , health and care plan ( EHCP ) , will have their needs met in a mainstream setting . <p> In some cases a special school will provide the best setting to meet a child 's needs however to be considered your child will need a final statement of special educational needs ( SEN ) or education health and care plan ( EHCP ) . <p> If your child already has one of these , you should discuss your preference and concerns with the special educational needs co-ordinator ( SENCo ) in your child 's school or setting . An early review can be arranged , if necessary , to review your child 's progress and discuss whether he or she would benefit from a specialist placement or if additional support or provision can be made within the current setting .

@@23526177 @3526177/ <h> Important information to consider <p> We make the decisions about admissions to North Yorkshire community and voluntary-controlled schools . This is based on the over-subscription criteria . <p> Admissions to voluntary-aided , foundation , trust schools and academies are controlled by their governing bodies . You can get policies for these schools from the school concerned . We do , however , coordinate admissions on their behalf and will make the offer of a place . If you want to apply to a voluntary-aided , foundation , trust school or academy , you should name it as a preference on the online or paper common application form . <p> It is important to note that some voluntary aided schools require parents/carers to provide additional information by completing a supplementary information form . Failure to complete and submit this form to the school will mean that you application is considered after all other applications for which a form was submitted . Where the school is oversubscribed this could mean that a place can not be offered to your child . If you have any queries about this issue please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Government 's coordinated admission scheme , all applications for school places need to be made through your home authority . Local authorities will then liaise with each other regarding cross border requests to make sure places are allocated according to the relevant admissions criteria . <p> You can get details of the admission criteria for schools outside North Yorkshire by contacting the authority responsible for admissions to that school . <h> Think ahead <p> Places at secondary schools are based on your home address , not the primary school your child will , or may , be going to . If you list a primary school which is not your normal area school , your child may not be able to transfer to secondary school with their friends . <p> If you list a school which is not your normal area school , you will normally be responsible for transport arrangements and costs . <h> Nursery schools and nursery and pre-reception classes <p> Some schools run a nursery class , these are are marked by the letter ' N ' in the list of primary schools . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term after their fourth birthday . These are marked by a ' P ' on the list of primary schools . <p> Parents must be aware that attendance at a nursery or pre-reception class attached to a primary school neither guarantees nor gives priority to a place at that school . To prioritise children attending the nursery would discriminate against : <p> Younger children ; <p> Children who are attending a nursery class in another school or setting ; and <p> Children whose parents choose not to use any of the pre school provision available . <h> Provision for two , three and four year olds <p> All three and four year olds are entitled to 15 hours per week of free Early Years Foundation Stage provision from the beginning of the school term following their third birthday until compulsory school age . This free entitlement can be taken up in maintained school nursery classes and/or private and voluntary sector Ofsted registered provision . It is your choice as to which type of provision is most appropriate for your child and most convenient for your individual circumstances . <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preschools or child-minders , have to meet Early Years Foundation Stage requirements and your child will get the same experiences whichever type of provision you choose , it is only the environment that changes . <p> To be eligible to offer the free entitlement , early years providers have to register with us , and we maintain a directory of providers . You can get information on all Early Years Foundation Stage providers from the North Yorkshire Families Information Service website at www.nyfamilies.info or by calling 01609 533483 , our staff will be pleased to talk you through the options available to you . <p> You can access the 15 hours of free provision flexibly , within the following parameters : <p> To be taken over a minimum of two days . <p> Sessions can vary in length but the minimum length is 2+ hours . <p> The earliest a session can start is 7am and the latest it can finish is 7pm . <p> You do not have to take all the 15 hours with one early years provider but the maximum number of providers you can use is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the entitlement by taking fewer hours a week over more weeks of the year . <p> This flexibility is designed to enable you to plan provision that best suits you and your child . You can not assume that all the Early Years Foundation Stage providers in your area will be able to meet your requirements , but you can expect as a minimum to be able to access provision either as five sessions of three hours ( five mornings or afternoons or a combination of mornings and afternoons ) or as three sessions of five hours , although not necessarily at every setting . <p> Once you have chosen the provision you wish to use you will be asked to sign a parental agreement that specifies exactly when your child will attend . This agreement will remain in force for at least a school term and possibly for the whole school year . <p> Applications for a place at a nursery school or a school with a nursery class should be made directly to the head teacher . <h> Provision for two year olds <p> From September 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of provision in exactly the same way as three and four year olds . To be eligible the family must be receiving at least one of the income support ; income based job seeker 's allowance ; child tax credit with income less than 16,190 and not receiving working tax credit ; support under part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 ; guarantee element of state pension credit . <p> Eligibility checks are undertaken by the Families Information Service , to whom applications must be made . You can contact them on 01609 533483 or email **33;597;TOOLONG . <p> In addition all children who are currently or have been previously looked after are also eligible . This includes those who have left care through adoption orders , residence orders or special guardianship orders . <h> Infant class sizes <p> Infant classes ( Key Stage 1 - Reception Year 1 and Year 2 ) must not contain more than 30 pupils with a single school teacher . Additional children may be admitted under limited exceptional circumstances . We will need to take account of this when we offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advice on applying for a school place <p> If your child is aged between 5 and 16 , you have a legal duty to ensure they receive a full-time education suitable for their age and ability and we must make arrangements to help you decide which school you would prefer your child to attend . <p> As a parent or carer , you are able to preference any school you would like your child to attend . We encourage parents to preference between 3 and 5 different schools and to rank them in order of preference . When making your preferences it is important you check which school serves your home address , this may be known as your catchment , local , normal or appropriate school . You can find information on types of schools here .

The School Admissions Code ( 2014 ) states admission authorities must allocate places on the basis of their determined admission arrangements only , and a decision to offer or refuse a school place must not be made by a single individual in an admissions authority . Where a school is its own admissions authority the whole governing body or admissions committee , established by the governing body , must make such decisions . It is important you understand the type of school you are applying for , as the type of school affects the criteria used to determine which children will be offered places , who make the decisions and who you must appeal to if you are unhappy with the decision . <p> Please note head teachers or other school officials are not allowed to give any indication of whether your application will be successful . In addition they can not inform parents their child has been allocated a place before a formal offer has been made by the local authority . <p> When a school is oversubscribed , that is , where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places is determined by the published admissions criteria . Part of the criteria uses the child 's principle , permanent home address . You must notify us of any change of address immediately . The definition of ' home address ' or ' principle , permanent residence ' , for the purpose of school admissions is the address at which your child resides most of the time . If the residency of your child is split between both parents , we consider the home address to be the address where the child lives for the majority of the school week ( Monday to Friday ) . Parents will be required to complete and return a split residency form detailing the split deprived of their rightful place , therefore we check carefully to ensure correct addresses are used to prioritise applications . <p> fraudulent or intentionally misleading , the local authority reserves the right to withdraw the offer of a place .

If you apply for a place at an infant school for your child and they have a brother or sister at the junior school we will not give your application priority under the sibling link criterion . <p> If you have multiple birth children , for example twins or triplets , we will try , wherever possible , to offer all the children a place at the same school .

Access to enhanced mainstream provision is shared across the wider local area . A child may access the provision when the local authority deems the child has special educational needs and the provision is appropriate to meet those needs . It is important to note the presence of enhanced mainstream provision at a school does not form part of the local authority 's admission policy and is not considered as a reason for applying for a place at that particular school unless a child has a final statement of special educational needs ( SEN ) or an education health and care plan ( EHCP ) which names that school . <p> reduction of fees for board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits . <p> Schools must provide , free of charge , any activities which take place out of school hours but relate to the national curriculum or form part of a public exam syllabus .

Schools may charge for the cost of board and lodgings on field trips and may ask for voluntary contributions for activities which the law does not allow them to charge for . Schools may levy a charge for certain activities but only after the governors have agreed on a detailed policy for charging . <p> If you would like your child to attend a school which is state funded , the law states you must make an application for admission .

The school prospectus will contain information regarding the school 's admission arrangements including whether or not a supplimentary information form is required . If you have any queries regarding admission to a voluntary-aided faith school please contact the school . <p> In accordance with the school admission code ( 2014 ) , the local authority may only offer one school place per child . <p> If parents disagree which school they would prefer their child to attend a school place will not be offered until the dispute has been resolved . <p> The local authority will require evidence of parental agreement in the form of either , written confirmation from each parent or a Court Order .

Schools that are their own admission authority , such as voluntary aided , foundation , trust schools and academies maintain their own waiting lists . <p> Please note , a waiting list is a living document which can change , for example , when the offer of a place is turned down or a child moves in/out of area . Whenever a change is made the waiting list is re-ranked in line with the published oversubscription criteria for the school .

Many schools will host an open evening for prospective pupils ; you should contact the schools direct to find out the dates and times . <p> Speak to the school 's Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator ( SENCo ) - the SENCo has a role in ensuring provision meets the needs of pupils with special educational needs . <p> View the school 's Ofsted report - this will also be a good source of information . <p> The authority 's expectation is the majority of children with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of special educational needs ( SEN ) or education , health and care plan ( EHCP ) , will have their needs met in a mainstream setting . <p> In some cases a special school will provide the best setting to meet a child 's needs however to be considered your child will need a final statement of special educational needs ( SEN ) or education health and care plan ( EHCP ) . <p> If your child already has one of these , you should discuss your preference and concerns with the special educational needs co-ordinator ( SENCo ) in your child 's school or setting . An early review can be arranged , if necessary , to review your child 's progress and discuss whether he or she would benefit from a specialist placement or if additional support or provision can be made within the current setting .

They may not be refused because the school is unable to cater for their needs .

We will apply our normal admission arrangements as set out on the admissions policies page . <p> Please note if you apply for your child to transfer from infant school to a primary school at the end of year 2 , rather than to a junior school , your application will be processed during June and July . <p> You will not be offered as place on national offer day as year 3 is not the normal your of entry into a primary school . <p> Admission authorities must consider parental requests and make decisions based on the merits of each case . <p> Parents must make their request , in writing and well in advance of the closing date for the normal admissions round .

The new admission authority has the legal right to re-consider the request at the time of application . <p> If the request is agreed the parent will need to apply the following year . Where the request is not upheld , the child will be considered for a Reception place in the standard year of entry , provided the application form is received on time , otherwise it will be considered alongside other late applications .

Children reach compulsory school age on the prescribed day following their fifth birthday ( or on their fifth birthday if it falls on a prescribed day ) . The prescribed days are 31 August , 31 December and 31 March . <h> Summer born children ( deferred ) <p> Children born in the summer term are not required to start school until a full year after the point at which they could first have been admitted - the point at which other children in their age range are beginning year 1 .

You will be advised of the outcome of your request for delayed entry prior to the primary national offer date of 18 April 2017 . <p> ' It is reasonable for admission authorities to expect parents to provide them with information in support of their request - since without it they are unlikely to be able to make a decision on the basis of the circumstances of the case . This should demonstrate why it would be in the child 's interests to be admitted to reception rather than year one ; and <p> In some cases parents may have professional evidence that it would be appropriate for them to submit , for example , when a child receives support from a speech and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that parents will obtain professional evidence that they do not already have . Admission authorities must still consider requests that are not accompanied by professional evidence . In such cases the supporting information might simply be the parent 's statement as to why they have made their request . ' <p> If your request is agreed , your application for the normal age group may be withdrawn before a place is offered . If your request is refused , you must decide whether to accept the offer of a place for the normal age group , or to refuse it and make an in year application for admission to year one for the September following your child 's fifth birthday . Where your request is agreed , you must make a new application as part of the main admissions round the following year . <p> If you have not been offered any of your higher preferences , this is because there were more applications than there were places available at the school and other children had a higher priority under the published admission criteria . <h> Class size 30 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 class sizes to no more than 30 children per class . <p> If you have not been offered a place at a school due to class size 30 , further information will be sent to you in due course . <h> Statutory right of appeal <p> You have the statutory right of appeal to an independent admission appeal panel , should you wish to do so .

The tests are not related to national curriculum subjects or the associated key stage standard tests of attainment ( SATs ) , which assess your child 's current level of achievement in national curriculum work and take place much later in the academic year . <p> Appropriately recruited and trained invigilators supervise and administer these tests . <p> After the marks have been standardised to take into account your child 's age ( see www.nfer.co.uk ) , your child 's best verbal reasoning and best non-verbal reasoning scores are added together to give a final score which is used to determine whether they have reached the cut-off mark . <p> Pupils who do not reach the necessary cut-off mark for entry into year 7 may ask to be assessed again for entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although we do not recommend transfers beyond year 10 . The selection tests for children transferring in Year 7 onwards are different from those taken by Year 6 pupils and are usually taken towards the end of the summer term . These tests are arranged by the school and details of these tests may be obtained from the head teacher of the selective school concerned . <h> Suitability for a selective grammar school education <p> The definition of who is suitable for a grammar school education is very precise . The results of the North Yorkshire selection tests are used to find the highest scoring 28 per cent ( or as close as possible ) of all year 6 children who live in the Ripon area and the highest scoring 28 per cent ( or as close as possible ) of all year 6 boys who live in the Skipton area . The number of children this percentage figure identifies sets the cut-off mark in each selective area , thereby setting the standard which children must reach to be considered as suitable for a selective grammar school education in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skipton areas are usually different and will vary from year to year . In the last three years the cut-off marks for these two areas have been : <p> Year of entry <p> Ripon cut-off <p> Skipton cut-off <p> 2017 <p> 201 <p> 218 <p> 2016 <p> 210 <p> 213 <p> 2015 <p> 214 <p> 218 <p> Children who live outside the Ripon selective area must achieve the cut-off mark set by the performance of the pupils who live in that area in order to be considered . <p> Similarly , boys who live outside the Skipton selective area must meet the cut-off mark which is set by the performance of the boys who live in that area in order to be considered . <p> If your child has achieved the appropriate cut-off mark for Ripon Grammar School or Ermysted 's Grammar School , they will be eligible to be considered for a place at the selective school that has been listed as a preference . Even if your child meets the standard required for a selective education , it does not guarantee they will be allocated a place at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With regard to opting in or out of selection procedures , you need to carefully consider whether : <p> Your child meets the academic achievement expected of pupils in those selective schools ; and <p> That a selective grammar school is the right one for your child . <p> If you live in a selective area of the county and your child attends a maintained primary school in that area , your child will be put forward for the selection procedure . All children will be tested at the local grammar school . <p> All parents of the above children will be sent a letter with a reply slip to confirm if their child will be sitting the selection test or if they wish to withdraw their child . This will need to be returned to their primary school by Monday 19 June 2017 . <p> We will advise you in writing of the time , date and location of the tests during the week commencing 28 August 2017 . <p> We class children who do not live in either of the two selective areas as ' living out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's principal permanent residence , i.e. the place where your child lives permanently most of the time . If the residency of your child is split between two parents , we consider the home address to be where the child lives for the majority of the time . When a child lives equally with both parents , with both parents ' agreement , they can elect one of their two addresses to be used for allocating a school place . If you live outside of the selective area , and would like your child to sit the selection tests , you need to apply for your child to be tested . You can do this by filling in the online selection application form . Alternatively you can send an email or letter . You must do this by 23 July 2017 . Please give your child 's full name , date of birth , home address and telephone number , and the name and address of their current school . <p> All children will sit the selection test within the Grammar School that is being applied for . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date and location of the tests . <p> You need to apply for your child to be tested if : <p> You live in one of the selective areas but your child does not attend a maintained primary school in one of the selective areas ; or <p> You live outside the selective areas , including outside of North Yorkshire ; or <p> Your child attends an independent school . <p> If you apply late after the registration date of 23 July 2017 your child will normally be tested after the allocation of secondary school places ( 1 March 2018 ) , unless you have an exceptional reason agreed by the local authority for doing so . Such reasons may include moving home or a serious illness . <p> If , on the day of the tests , you feel it would be inappropriate for your child to take the tests due to illness , family bereavement or other serious issue which may affect your child 's performance in the selection tests , you must contact the emergency number provided immediately and confirm the reason for their absence in writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tests at a later date . <p> If your child can not take the tests on the arranged day , they will not be penalised but it will delay your child 's results being provided to you . By bringing your child to the tests , you are confirming that they are fit and well and there are no serious issues which could prevent them achieving their full potential . If you are unsure whether your individual circumstances fall into this category , please seek advice from the admissions team . <h> Children who may need special arrangements to access the selection tests <p> Our test procedures are compliant with the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 . Where we are made aware that special arrangements may be required , a report is requested from the primary school head teacher . This report and any other evidence provided will be considered by a specialist panel who will agree what appropriate testing arrangements are required . <p> Pupils that require special arrangements will not sit the tests at the published times and the tests will normally be held towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordingly of the arrangements once agreed . <p> North Yorkshire County Council believes that children should be allowed to sit the tests under conditions which are as normal as possible without facing the pressure of extra coaching or home tutoring . <p> The authority does not encourage coaching but can not , of course , prevent it . Some schools do carry out verbal reasoning and non-verbal reasoning tests for assessment purposes whilst others do n't . The authority does not expect any of its schools to carry out these assessment tests more than once each year and head teachers are instructed not to provide coaching and further practice for children in verbal reasoning or non-verbal reasoning selection tests . Further information regarding practice and coaching can be found at www.nfer.co.uk . <h> Familiarisation booklets <p> We have arranged for GL Assessment to produce familiarisation booklets . They include examples to indicate the range of skills required to complete the assessment and the manner in which questions are answered . The booklets are not definitive and the inclusion of any question types does not guarantee that they will be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These booklets are subject to copyright and must not be reproduced , photocopied , sold or distributed in any form or by any means . <p> You may want your child to transfer to a selective grammar school at a time other than the normal transfer time ( the end of year 6 ) , for example if you move into the area when your child is already in secondary education . <p> If you are applying for a place at Ripon Grammar School or Ermysted 's Grammar School please tell the admissions team in writing , or apply online here . Arrangements can then be made to test your child . For a place at Skipton Girls ' High School , you should contact the school direct . <p> Please provide your child 's full name , date of birth , home address and telephone number , and the name and address of their current school . Testing arrangements for pupils in the current year 7 and above are arranged by staff in each of the selective schools . <p> The tests children take for transferring to a selective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for example years 7-10 ) are curriculum-based tests in English , maths and science . Ripon Grammar School also tests proficiency of a modern foreign language . Details of these tests are available from the head teacher of the school concerned . <p> You need to be aware that if your child reaches the required standard and is found suitable for a grammar school education by reaching the required standard that we may be unable to offer your child a place at the school , if the year group applied for is oversubscribed . If this is the case you will then be offered the statutory right of appeal . <p> Your child can be tested only once for a particular year of entry and normally this will be within their chronological age group . We do not recommend that a pupil transfers schools beyond year 10 due to potential differences in the exam boards and the curriculum .

If we do not hear from you we will assume that you do not wish your child to sit the test . <p> Children that live in the selective area but attend an out of area primary school or an independent school must make an application by 23 July 2017 . <p> All pupils living outside the selective area who would like to sit the selection test must apply ; this can be done online or in writing .

The local authority has , for several years now , consistently set the number of ' in-area ' children who are to be deemed suitable for a selective education in each selective area ( Ripon and Skipton ) , as being 28 per cent ( or as close as possible ) of all year 6 pupils who live in the Ripon area and all year 6 boys who live in the Skipton area . The cohort is the number of children who live in each selective area who are eligible to take the test , rather than those who are actually entered .

If your child is not given alternative arrangements they will be tested under normal conditions later than the published dates and the results will not be available before the closing date of 31 October for applying for a secondary school place . <p> You need to contact the admissions team as soon as possible to let us know and confirm in writing the reason .

Boarding is either weekly or termly and a boarding fee is required . Any student wishing to board must pass the selection test which is administered by the local authority . <p> It is the only state boarding school in Yorkshire and also admits students to the Sixth Form who wish to board . The accommodation is of a very high standard and a recent extension to Johnson House ( girls ' boarding ) provides separate study bedrooms for older students . <p> Each year , there are up to 14 boarding places available in year 7 at Ripon Grammar School , with admission being based on the same selection procedures as other pupils .

Boarding and day places will be allocated in early March . <p> It is possible to list both a day and a boarding place , however , each one is considered as a separate preference . If you want your child to be considered for a boarding place , you must stipulate the type of place you want to apply for ( that is , weekly , termly , or both ) on the common application form . <p> Day places are offered in accordance with our admissions criteria . The offer of a boarding place can not be converted into a day place , or the other way round . <p> You have to pay fees for boarding places which are paid termly . Fees for 2016 - 2017 are : <h> First form to fifth form <p> Weekly boarding 9,570 per academic year <p> Termly boarding 10,575 per academic year <h> New sixth form <p> Weekly boarding 10,080 per academic year ( excluding lunches ) <p> Termly boarding 11,070 per academic year ( excluding lunches ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips and / or activities . <p> These fees are subject to change each year , as deemed by the governors . <p> There are two separate boarding houses : School House for boys and Johnson House for girls . <p> You are advised that , should you decide to withdraw your child from Ripon Grammar School prior to the completion of their secondary education , you are required to give the authority and the school one term 's written notice of that decision . You should also be aware that all boarders will be required to pay a bond , equivalent to 50 per cent of the first term 's boarding fee when returning the signed formal acceptance . This bond is returned to you when your child leaves boarding , assuming all due fees have been paid to the school . <p> The ' Suitability for Boarding ' form is available on the school website and will need to be completed prior to an offer of a boarding place being confirmed . <p> The suitability for boarding form is used to make sure that the school can meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offer of a place ( this is done through the selection test and admissions process ) .

Children with a boarding need include:a ) Children at risk or with an unstable home environment and children of service personnel who have died while serving or who have been discharged as a result of attributable injury ; b ) Children of key workers and Crown Servants working abroad , e.g. the children of charity workers , people working for voluntary service organisations , the diplomatic service or the European Union , teachers , law enforcement officers and medical staff working abroad whose work dictates that they spend much of the year overseas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Children with a sibling currently attending the school <p> Children living furthest from the school measured using the authority 's electronic mapping system . <p> *This applies to all looked after children , including those who are in the care of another local authority .

For details contact the admissions transport and welfare team . <p> We will only offer your child a boarding place if we consider them to be suitable for selective education at Ripon Grammar School .

If children are refused a day place in March they will be placed in the appropriate position on the day place waiting list . If a day place becomes available it is offered to the child at the top of the day place waiting list . However if we have allocated less than 14 boarding places any late boarding applications which are on the boarding waiting list will take priority over day places when offering from the waiting list . <p> If we receive more than 14 applications for boarding places , children are placed in criteria order on the boarding waiting list .

Please discuss this with a direct payments advisor who will advise you how to do this . We strongly advise that you only use an agency that is registered . <p> You may choose to employ your own personal assistant . If you do , the direct payments support service can give you as much support as you need to help you use direct payments . We specialise in this advice and can provide support and information on all aspects of direct payments and how to be a good employer . <p> We can also keep you up to date with changes in employment legislation and developments within independent living that may be of benefit to you when choosing to use your own staff . We strongly recommend that you use the support of the service when using your direct payment to employ personal assistants . <p> Should you choose not to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-ordinator who is supporting you . They will provide you with a factsheet pack to give you some guidance on being a good employer and how to keep safe and use direct payments . <p> We strongly recommend that if you choose to use a personal assistant to provide your support , that you employ the staff and not use people who offer a service as self-employed personal assistants . <p> When you choose to employ people you take on significant responsibilities . You must think about all the aspects of employing your own staff to ensure you are a good employer . <h> Employed personal assistants <p> If you employ staff this means that you become an employer . If you become an employer you must register with . There are a number of things you must ensure you have in place when employing staff : <p> We can support you with all this and make employing staff easier for you . When you recruit your own staff you may have to apply a selection process that involves advertising and interviewing staff . We can help you to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make use of this support , we advise that you follow a number of steps to ensure you keep safe . You must also inform us that you will not be using the direct payments support service . <p> Some things that you will be responsible for when recruiting personal assistants : <p> Advertising/job description/job specification ; <p> Short listing and interviewing your staff ; <p> Job references , appointing staff ; <p> Criminal records check ; <p> Employing people legally ; and <p> Employer 's liability insurance . <p> The direct payments support service can provide all or part of this support . <h> Self-employed <p> Some people will tell you that they are self-employed ; however , it is the responsibility of the person who engages a personal assistant to operate PAYE and to account for National Insurance Contributions ( NIC ) unless the personal assistant is engaged through an agency . <p> You can find guidance on employment status on the website but the quickest way of getting HMRC 's view if a personal assistant is employed or self-employed is to use their employment status indicator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status indicator tool and are unsure of the personal assistant 's employment status you can telephone the HMRC status customer service team on 0300 052 7450 or you can contact your direct payments advisor . <p> If the personal assistant is recognised as self-employed by HMRC you will not become the employer . They must provide you with insurance cover and they can choose if and when they work for you . You must decide if this will work for you . You should always ask for references from other people they have worked for . <p> We can provide you with support to ensure you keep safe when using self-employed personal assistants . However , we strongly recommend that you do not use people who are self-employed to support you as a personal assistant . <p> You must complete these checks before anyone starts working for you . You can offer them employment once the checks are completed and you are satisfied they can work in the United Kingdom . You must not employ anyone who is not legally able to work in the United Kingdom . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be straightforward . HM Revenue &amp; Customs have advised they would consider almost all personal assistants to be employed rather than self-employed for tax purposes . We can provide you with further advice before proceeding with this option . <p> If you use a registered domiciliary agency this law does not apply to you . We recommend that you ask the agency if they carry out these employment checks . <p> As an employer you will need to be aware that your personal assistant is entitled to annual leave . It is advisable that you check the current entitlement and make sure you keep up to date with changes ; and <p> A number of new employer duties have been introduced that will give personal assistants access to pension provision : <p> From October 2012 under the Provisions of Pensions Act 2008 as an employer you may be subject to the automatic enrolment duty and will be required to automatically enrol your personal assistants into a pension scheme ; <p> A key requirement is to automatically enrol certain workers , known as eligible jobholders , into a pension scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme ' . We can provide you with information on the conditions to be an automatic enrolment scheme . However , automatic enrolment is only one of the duties ; and <p> As an employer compliance with the new employer duties and safeguards is compulsory . If you fail to comply with your employer duties , HM Revenue &amp; Customs may take enforcement action and issue a notice and/or a penalty . <p> We strongly recommend that you seek advice from the direct payment support service or another organisation specialising in employment . We can help you with any of the requirements above for free . <p> You may want to use a home care ( sometimes known as domiciliary care ) agency to provide your care . If you choose to use an agency the staff who will work with you will usually be employed by the agency . In this case you will not be the employer and the agency will be responsible for managing the staff and will pay their wages . <p> You will still maintain choice and control as you will make arrangements directly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where your support will be provided . <p> You will pay the agency invoice when you receive it from your direct payments bank account . Always check that you have discussed all of your arrangements with the agency and have an agreement in writing . Ensure that the agency has given you a breakdown of all their costs in writing . You do not want to have any unexpected costs , such as additional charges for mileage , bank holidays etc. that you have not previously agreed to pay . <p> Sometimes the agency may charge an hourly rate which is more than the direct payment hourly rate paid to you . It is likely you will have to pay the difference from your own personal funds . We will advise you to discuss any additional costs with your social care co-ordinator when your direct payments are arranged . <p> Agencies providing personal care are required by law to be registered with the Care Quality Commission . You can ask the agency staff to show you details of its registration . We can also provide support with making these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Before you decide to buy a service from a particular agency we recommend that you ask the agency : <p> About their registration with the Care Quality Commission ; <p> To see a copy of their insurance policy ; <p> If all their staff have had a disclosure and barring service check ; <p> How it manages its staff and how often someone will come and check you are happy with its service ; <p> If they employ the staff and meet all their tax and national insurance payments ; <p> How they would deal with any complaint you may have with the agency 's service ; <p> How they arrange for staff cover during holiday time or through absence due to sickness and if a member of the agency staff will discuss this with you when cover for regular staff needs to be made ; <p> What training they provide for their staff and what qualifications and experience do they have ; <p> How you can you tell them if you are not happy with their service ; <p> If they carry out a risk assessment for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies of the hours the staff work so that you can pay the correct amount ; and <p> How much it will cost you to use their service and how to pay the money to them . <p> Once you have been working with individual members of staff for some time you may think you could employ them direct as a personal assistant and not use the agency . <p> We strongly recommend that you talk to us before you do this . Some agency agreements allow you to employ their staff directly but may charge you a fee as part of their conditions for providing the service for you . If you want to do this please contact the direct payment support service on 0845 034 9410 . <p> We have only given you a few suggestions of the type of questions you may want to ask . Please think about the information you want and what questions you need to ask the agency to help you to choose the right agency for you . <p> If the agency tells you they will not be able to continue providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . <p> There are certain insurance considerations you should take into account when employing people using a direct payment . We can provide support and guidance to ensure you have all the insurance cover you will need . <h> Employed personal assistants <p> You are legally required as a person who employs staff to have insurance . We can provide support for you to do this . <p> Accidents can happen in a number of ways , for example the personal assistant may trip , fall or be involved in a car accident . It could be that the personal assistant thinks you as the employer is to blame for this and may hold you responsible . <p> Sometimes employer 's liability insurance and public liability Insurance can be included in a comprehensive household policy but most policies do n't . You must check with your own insurance company and not assume that it does for these purposes . <p> This insurance must be in place before your personal assistant can start work : <p> Employer liability insurance <p> If your employee is injured whilst working for you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover legal costs and compensation . By law most employers must have employer 's liability insurance . <p> Public liability insurance <p> This will insure you against any damages or injury caused to someone else by you or your personal assistant while working for you . <p> We will fund the cost of this insurance as part of your direct payment . We do not recommend who you use to provide your insurance cover but we will provide you information on where to go . <p> We advise you take out a policy that covers you in the event that your personal assistant takes you to an industrial tribunal or you need to make someone redundant . There are terms and conditions you must adhere to and these will be explained by the insurance company . <h> Self-employed personal assistants <p> It is extremely unlikely that HM Revenue &amp; Customs would consider anyone who works as a personal assistant in your home as self-employed , but if you have had this confirmed ( see the employing people legally page for details ) it is the responsibility of the personal assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer their services . You must ask to see a copy of the policy before you agree they can provide you with their service . You would not pay for the insurance for someone who is self-employed . <h> Agency <p> It is the responsibility of the agency to have the correct insurance cover before offering their services . You must ask to see a copy of this before buying their service with your direct payment . <h> Using a vehicle <p> If your personal assistant is providing transport for you in their own vehicle they will need to ensure they take out the appropriate insurance cover . You must advise the personal assistant to contact their insurance company and request business cover and show you a copy . <p> If the personal assistant is driving your vehicle you must ensure they are added onto your insurance cover . <h> What are direct payments ? <p> If you are eligible for social care support from us then you can choose to have direct payments so that you can organise and buy services yourself instead of the council arranging services for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carers ' services . <h> Why would I want direct payments ? <p> Direct payments allow you to make more of the decisions that affect your life . You can decide how your support needs are met . You can make arrangements directly so that any staff you employ report directly to you . If you use an agency , the agency deals with you , not the council . <h> How could I get direct payments ? <p> To get direct payments as a carer you need first to have a carer 's needs assessment . You can request an assessment by contacting us or talking to your doctor , health visitor , district nurse or community psychiatric nurse as they could make a referral on your behalf if you would like them to . <p> If the person you care for is in hospital , speak to a nurse and ask to be put in touch with a hospital social worker . If you are eligible for support because of all you do as a carer your assessor will explain what the options are - this will include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you already receive carers ' services arranged by us and want to talk about having direct payments instead please contact us on 0845 034 9410 . Direct payments are one of many options available to you . We will explain what these are and you can then decide what will work best for you . <h> Young carers <p> If you are aged 16 or 17 years old and are undertaking a substantial caring role for an adult , direct payments might be an option for you . You can request a carer 's needs assessment by contacting us . <h> What can direct payments be used for ? <p> Direct payments must be used to meet the needs that have been agreed through your carer 's needs assessment so that you are supported in your caring role and helped to keep well and healthy . <p> Direct payments can be used to buy goods and services or to directly employ someone . There are some things you can not use direct payments for : <p> To pay yourself as a carer for the care you provide ; <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in the household the person you care for ( unless it is agreed this is necessary ) ; or <p> Services of an intimate nature ( e.g. bathing ) or respite care for the person you care for ( if we agree following their assessment that they need such support , they could have their own direct payments or have their services arranged by a social care co-ordinator ) . <h> Will I need to pay anything myself ? <p> We do not charge for services for carers . You will not be financially assessed . Direct payments do not affect any benefits you may be receiving . However they will affect the benefits of anybody you choose to employ . <h> Could the person I care for receive direct payments ? <p> Most people who have social care support at home from us could now receive direct payments : <p> Older people who have been assessed as needing community care services ; <p> Disabled people aged 16 and over , including those with short as well as long-term needs ; <p> Carers , in place of receiving carers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's services ; <p> Disabled parents for children 's services ; and <p> People receiving a direct payment on behalf of someone else who lacks capacity . <p> Sometimes a person who needs social care support is not able to make the necessary decisions about direct payments . This is described as lacking capacity . It is possible for someone to receive direct payments on their behalf and to use them to meet the person 's needs . If you are the carer of someone who would benefit from direct payments and either you or someone you know would be willing to act as the ' suitable person ' to receive the direct payments for them , please get in touch with the direct payment support service . <p> There are only very limited circumstances when direct payments could not be offered and the reasons would be explained . <p> If you choose to employ your own personal assistants , the person assisting you with drawing up your support plan and/or your direct payment advisor can help you be more specific about what you need to do to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you/your staff will need to undertake . <p> You need to make sure any staff you employ are able to carry out the tasks you expect of them and do not put you or themselves at risk of being injured . It is , therefore , particularly important that you and your staff understand the implications of any moving and handling tasks expected of them . <p> Insurance companies state that they will only pay out if the personal assistant is trained in moving and handling by an appropriate trainer . In the event of a claim it is important you understand the implications . <p> Employers are required to provide their staff with instruction , information , training and supervision . In particular , health and safety legislation applies to employers of five or more staff who are then legally required to provide training . We strongly recommend that you identify your own training needs so you can provide some formal guidance/training to your personal assistants . We may be able to advise on this and also provide information about suitable , available training . <p> We also recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This may mean attending some courses together . Some training is also available in the home . <p> If your personal assistant has not already undertaken training , and depending on the tasks they will be asked to undertake , the sorts of courses you may need to consider could be : <p> Moving and handling - if your personal assistant supports you with any moving and handling tasks , then they will need to have moving and handling training ; <p> First aid ; <p> Infection control ; <p> Food hygiene ; <p> Administration of medication ; or <p> Health and safety . <p> You may also want to consider other specialist courses , such as dementia awareness , autism , diabetes , etc . <p> Some useful information is also available from Skills for Care for the training of personal assistants : <p> Common induction standards - there are new standards being completed at this moment through Skills for Care and Skills for Health who are including personal assistants in the common induction standards and also they have completed a code of conduct for health and social care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocational qualifications - the QCF level 3 diploma in health and social care called " For those working as a personal assistant " replaces NVQs . There are standalone units that personal assistants can complete as they can now choose only units applicable to what they are doing . The direct payment support service or your social care co-ordinator will be able to advise you about access to this in your area ; <p> The workforce development fund can help with training costs . People who employ their own care and support staff will need to register some basic details about themselves and their personal assistants on to the National Minimum Data Set for Social Care to be able to access the funding . The fund can only be utilised by adult social care providers that employ social care staff within England . See accessing the workforce development fund for details ; and <p> When someone in receipt of a direct payment dies , we need to be informed so that we can stop the arrangements that are in place . <p> Please contact us on 01609 780780 . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person who will be dealing with the affairs of the deceased ( the executor will be named in the deceased 's will as the person who will deal with their affairs after their death ) . We will also ask you if there is a solicitor . If there is a solicitor involved please give their name and contact details , e.g. address and telephone number . We need this information so we know where to send correspondence . <p> We will contact the care management team who will close the direct payment and payments will cease . They will write to the executor/solicitor to explain and support you regarding the direct payment account and fulfilling all the legal requirements . <p> The direct payment support service will also be involved during this time to ensure all the employer responsibilities are completed correctly . <h> The direct payment account <p> The money has been provided to buy services for someone who needed social care support . It does not form part of the person 's estate and can not be used for any other purpose other than direct payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be used for such things as funeral expenses . <p> Any money left in the direct payment account once all the contractual and legally required sums have been paid must be returned to us . We will advise you on how this can be done . <h> If you are the executor of the will <p> You will need to find out if there are any contractual obligations or payments that need to be made from the dedicated direct payment account . For example , if the deceased had been employing a personal assistant , this person will need to be paid for the work that they have already completed and any redundancy/annual leave pay that is due to them . The direct payment support service can assist you to do this ( the redundancy payment due to each employee under the statutory redundancy payment scheme depends on the individual 's age and length of service ) . <h> If you are not the executor of the will <p> It is very important that you explain the direct payments scheme to the executor . They may not know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bank account is a dedicated direct payment account and that the remaining money in it , after all contractual and legally required sums have been paid out , needs to be returned to the council . <h> If there is no will <p> The individual is said to have died ' intestate ' . Usually a close relative like a spouse , child or parent will be able to apply for the legal right to sort out the estate of the person who has died . In order to be able to administer someone 's estate you ( or the friend or relative ) will need to apply to the Probate Registry for a ' Grant of letters of administration ' . See GOV.UK - wills , probate and inheritance for more guidance . <h> Access to the direct payment account <p> It is advisable that you obtain a solicitor to help you through the process . On receipt of the grant , you or the individual will become the ' administrator ' of the estate . The grant provides proof to banks , building societies and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were held in the deceased 's name . You will then be able to access the direct payment bank account and will be able to make any payments that need to be made . Once all payments have been made , you will need to return the remaining money to the council . <h> How can we meet the contractual responsibilities if we can not access the money ? <p> In the case where the account has been frozen or there is no access to the account , then we will , in certain circumstances , pay out some outstanding payments e.g. salaries on the individual 's behalf . This money will then be recovered once the account has been reactivated and closed . To enable you to fulfil all your legal requirements please contact the direct payment support service for more information . <p> The Care Act 2014 focuses on people having control , therefore employing personal assistants can be very empowering for many disabled and older people . To optimise a person 's control over their delivery of care and support , we offer direct payments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a provider . <p> Unless we are satisfied that it is necessary to meet a person 's or child 's needs , people are advised not use direct payments to secure services from self-employed personal assistants . <p> We will retain the discretion to make an exception which must be approved in writing . <p> Where a person wishes to pursue to pay a self-employed personal assistant from the direct payment , an exception application must be completed . <h> What is a self-employed personal assistant ? <p> The UK Government website clearly states where a person uses personal assistants , the user is an employer if they pay a personal assistant directly , even if you get money from your local council ( direct payments ) or the NHS ( personal health budget ) to pay for them . Your personal assistant is usually treated as an employee because in law there are certain conditions that must be met for someone to be viewed as self-employed . <p> You can not just choose a self-employed personal assistant if you want to avoid your responsibilities as an employer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems daunting .

There could be implications for any household benefits . Talk to your social care co-ordinator first . <p> You can take as long as you want to decide if you want to use direct payments .

For instance you could ask us to arrange some of your support and use a direct payment to arrange some of the support yourself - a mix and match of services that you choose . <p> You do not have to calculate tax and National Insurance if you employ someone - the direct payment support service will signpost you to a payroll service . <p> There are no difficult forms for you to fill in - on most occasions we only need a copy of your bank statements to check your fund is working properly . <p> If you are considering direct payments for someone who lacks capacity to consent to the direct payment please discuss with your social care co-ordinator . <p> If direct payments do not work for you we can arrange services for you instead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not choose to have services arranged for them again . The most important thing is to be in control of your own life . Direct payments mean that you have freedom , choice , control and flexibility in your life to have the help you need by making your own arrangements . <h> Direct payments - frequently asked questions <p> The money you receive through direct payments enables you to arrange and be in control of the services you choose to meet your needs . There are a wide range of options available for using the money but there are also certain limitations . <p> The available options and limitations are explained below . You must also only spend your direct payments on things that your assessment shows that you need and that are reflected in your support plan . <p> You could use the money received through direct payments to : <p> Employ your own staff to provide personal care ; <p> Set up a contract with an agency to provide staff and services for you ; <p> Arrange for relief from the stress and demands of caring by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carer a break ; <p> Purchase a holiday or short break , provided this has been agreed with your assessor and is considered an appropriate way to meet your assessed needs ; or <p> Get a practical service which will help you to stay living at home . <p> You can use the money to receive any combination of these options and any other services that are available . In this way you can create your own service that fits your choices and needs . <p> You can not use the money received through direct payments to : <p> Buy services provided by the local authority , i.e. North Yorkshire County Council ( but you can ask us to buy them on your behalf ) ; <p> Buy permanent residential or nursing care ; <p> Employ a spouse , partner or other close relative , if that person lives with you in the same household ( exceptions can be made to this but only in exceptional circumstances as authorised by us ) ; <p> Pay for a personal assistant 's expenses such as food and drink or entry fees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support workers and personal assistants a reduced entry fee or free entry and all these options must be explored prior to any agreement being sought for payment of entry fees ) ; <p> Buy health-related services or equipment that should be provided by the NHS ; <p> Pay household bills or buy clothes , food etc. ; or <p> Buy anything that does not meet your agreed needs . <p> Once your support plan has been agreed the direct payments can only be used in the way indicated in this plan . If you want to change how your direct payments are used then a new plan will have to be agreed with your social care assessor . <h> Reviewing direct payments <p> We recognise that each case will be different and that costs for services will differ but agreements for direct payments must be subject to regular review . This is so that we can fulfil our duty to ensure that the services we arrange achieve the best value . <h> Help with managing direct payments <p> If you receive direct payments you will be personally responsible for how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with how you manage it . We run a direct payments support service to provide help and support for people receiving direct payments . <p> Note that direct payments are not seen as income and have no effect upon tax or benefits . <p> No , you are financially assessed to determine how much you can afford to pay towards the cost of your support needs . The service user contribution must be used first to pay for your support prior to the direct payment being used . <p> If you decide to use less support , your care needs will be reassessed to determine the correct level of support and you will be financially reassessed to determine the service user contribution for your new package . <p> You should collect receipts for services bought using direct payments under certain circumstances . However , for some situations , this is not strictly necessary . <p> If the direct payment is under 400 , for example , for a one-off direct carers grant , then it is not necessary for assessment staff to routinely collect receipts . Please note however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may ask to either see the item purchased or have sight of the receipt . <p> If the direct payment is to purchase a regular service , for example , regular entrance to a club or venue as part of your assessed needs , then receipts are required as part of the monitoring process of the direct payment . <p> If you are unsure about collecting a receipt then it is always best to do so as this will prevent potential problems in the future . Your social care worker will be able to advise you about what to do in specific situations . <p> Note that direct payments are not seen as income and have no effect upon tax or benefits . <p> We offer comprehensive support for people receiving direct payments through our direct payments support service . <p> The direct payments legislation requires that people who are interested in receiving direct payments should have access to independent , good quality information , advice and support when considering or receiving direct payments . <p> Contracting with other agencies , including using agencies approved by health and adult services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contractor ; and <p> Completing returns for the local authority . <p> Note that direct payments are not seen as income and have no effect upon tax or benefits . <h> Contacting the direct payments support service <p> You can contact the direct payments support service at any time within office hours .

They can be used in a variety of ways to pay for services such as personal care , respite and day services , minor home adaptations and specialist equipment . Direct payments enable you to have more choice and control over the support you receive and how your social care needs are met . <p> Direct payments are not seen as income and have no effect on tax or benefits . Direct payments should not be confused with Direct Payment from the Department for Work and Pensions . This is a way of paying pensions and other benefits direct into bank accounts . <h> Who is eligible ? <p> To be eligible for direct payments , you must be : <p> A person aged 16 or over that has been assessed as needing and being eligible for services , or <p> A carer with an agreed assessment of need that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent of a disabled child who has been assessed as needing and being eligible for services ; <p> and <p> Be able to take responsibility for arranging ( with support if required ) and managing your own care ; <p> Be willing to use direct payments ; and <p> You must also be able and willing to consent to a direct payment and be able to manage the payment . <p> You can always choose whether to receive direct payments or to receive services arranged by us .

They must provide you with insurance cover and they can choose if and when they work for you . You must decide if this will work for you . You should always ask for references from other people they have worked for . <p> We can provide you with support to ensure you keep safe when using self-employed personal assistants . However , we strongly recommend that you do not use people who are self-employed to support you as a personal assistant . <p> You must complete these checks before anyone starts working for you . You can offer them employment once the checks are completed and you are satisfied they can work in the United Kingdom . You must not employ anyone who is not legally able to work in the United Kingdom . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be straightforward . HM Revenue &amp; Customs have advised they would consider almost all personal assistants to be employed rather than self-employed for tax purposes . We can provide you with further advice before proceeding with this option . <p> If you use a registered domiciliary agency this law does not apply to you . We recommend that you ask the agency if they carry out these employment checks . <p> As an employer you will need to be aware that your personal assistant is entitled to annual leave . It is advisable that you check the current entitlement and make sure you keep up to date with changes ; and <p> A number of new employer duties have been introduced that will give personal assistants access to pension provision : <p> From October 2012 under the Provisions of Pensions Act 2008 as an employer you may be subject to the automatic enrolment duty and will be required to automatically enrol your personal assistants into a pension scheme ; <p> A key requirement is to automatically enrol certain workers , known as eligible jobholders , into a pension scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme ' . We can provide you with information on the conditions to be an automatic enrolment scheme . However , automatic enrolment is only one of the duties ; and <p> As an employer compliance with the new employer duties and safeguards is compulsory . If you fail to comply with your employer duties , HM Revenue &amp; Customs may take enforcement action and issue a notice and/or a penalty . <p> We strongly recommend that you seek advice from the direct payment support service or another organisation specialising in employment . We can help you with any of the requirements above for free . <p> You may want to use a home care ( sometimes known as domiciliary care ) agency to provide your care . If you choose to use an agency the staff who will work with you will usually be employed by the agency . In this case you will not be the employer and the agency will be responsible for managing the staff and will pay their wages . <p> You will still maintain choice and control as you will make arrangements directly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where your support will be provided . <p> You will pay the agency invoice when you receive it from your direct payments bank account . Always check that you have discussed all of your arrangements with the agency and have an agreement in writing . Ensure that the agency has given you a breakdown of all their costs in writing . You do not want to have any unexpected costs , such as additional charges for mileage , bank holidays etc. that you have not previously agreed to pay . <p> Sometimes the agency may charge an hourly rate which is more than the direct payment hourly rate paid to you . It is likely you will have to pay the difference from your own personal funds . We will advise you to discuss any additional costs with your social care co-ordinator when your direct payments are arranged . <p> Agencies providing personal care are required by law to be registered with the Care Quality Commission . You can ask the agency staff to show you details of its registration . We can also provide support with making these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Before you decide to buy a service from a particular agency we recommend that you ask the agency : <p> About their registration with the Care Quality Commission ; <p> To see a copy of their insurance policy ; <p> If all their staff have had a disclosure and barring service check ; <p> How it manages its staff and how often someone will come and check you are happy with its service ; <p> If they employ the staff and meet all their tax and national insurance payments ; <p> How they would deal with any complaint you may have with the agency 's service ; <p> How they arrange for staff cover during holiday time or through absence due to sickness and if a member of the agency staff will discuss this with you when cover for regular staff needs to be made ; <p> What training they provide for their staff and what qualifications and experience do they have ; <p> How you can you tell them if you are not happy with their service ; <p> If they carry out a risk assessment for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies of the hours the staff work so that you can pay the correct amount ; and <p> How much it will cost you to use their service and how to pay the money to them . <p> Once you have been working with individual members of staff for some time you may think you could employ them direct as a personal assistant and not use the agency . <p> We strongly recommend that you talk to us before you do this . Some agency agreements allow you to employ their staff directly but may charge you a fee as part of their conditions for providing the service for you . If you want to do this please contact the direct payment support service on 0845 034 9410 . <p> We have only given you a few suggestions of the type of questions you may want to ask . Please think about the information you want and what questions you need to ask the agency to help you to choose the right agency for you . <p> If the agency tells you they will not be able to continue providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . <p> There are certain insurance considerations you should take into account when employing people using a direct payment . We can provide support and guidance to ensure you have all the insurance cover you will need . <h> Employed personal assistants <p> You are legally required as a person who employs staff to have insurance . We can provide support for you to do this . <p> Accidents can happen in a number of ways , for example the personal assistant may trip , fall or be involved in a car accident . It could be that the personal assistant thinks you as the employer is to blame for this and may hold you responsible . <p> Sometimes employer 's liability insurance and public liability Insurance can be included in a comprehensive household policy but most policies do n't . You must check with your own insurance company and not assume that it does for these purposes . <p> This insurance must be in place before your personal assistant can start work : <p> Employer liability insurance <p> If your employee is injured whilst working for you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover legal costs and compensation . By law most employers must have employer 's liability insurance . <p> Public liability insurance <p> This will insure you against any damages or injury caused to someone else by you or your personal assistant while working for you . <p> We will fund the cost of this insurance as part of your direct payment . We do not recommend who you use to provide your insurance cover but we will provide you information on where to go . <p> We advise you take out a policy that covers you in the event that your personal assistant takes you to an industrial tribunal or you need to make someone redundant . There are terms and conditions you must adhere to and these will be explained by the insurance company . <h> Self-employed personal assistants <p> It is extremely unlikely that HM Revenue &amp; Customs would consider anyone who works as a personal assistant in your home as self-employed , but if you have had this confirmed ( see the employing people legally page for details ) it is the responsibility of the personal assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer their services . You must ask to see a copy of the policy before you agree they can provide you with their service . You would not pay for the insurance for someone who is self-employed . <h> Agency <p> It is the responsibility of the agency to have the correct insurance cover before offering their services . You must ask to see a copy of this before buying their service with your direct payment . <h> Using a vehicle <p> If your personal assistant is providing transport for you in their own vehicle they will need to ensure they take out the appropriate insurance cover . You must advise the personal assistant to contact their insurance company and request business cover and show you a copy . <p> If the personal assistant is driving your vehicle you must ensure they are added onto your insurance cover . <h> What are direct payments ? <p> If you are eligible for social care support from us then you can choose to have direct payments so that you can organise and buy services yourself instead of the council arranging services for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carers ' services . <h> Why would I want direct payments ? <p> Direct payments allow you to make more of the decisions that affect your life . You can decide how your support needs are met . You can make arrangements directly so that any staff you employ report directly to you . If you use an agency , the agency deals with you , not the council . <h> How could I get direct payments ? <p> To get direct payments as a carer you need first to have a carer 's needs assessment . You can request an assessment by contacting us or talking to your doctor , health visitor , district nurse or community psychiatric nurse as they could make a referral on your behalf if you would like them to . <p> If the person you care for is in hospital , speak to a nurse and ask to be put in touch with a hospital social worker .

We will explain what these are and you can then decide what will work best for you . <h> Young carers <p> If you are aged 16 or 17 years old and are undertaking a substantial caring role for an adult , direct payments might be an option for you . You can request a carer 's needs assessment by contacting us . <h> What can direct payments be used for ? <p> Direct payments must be used to meet the needs that have been agreed through your carer 's needs assessment so that you are supported in your caring role and helped to keep well and healthy . <p> Direct payments can be used to buy goods and services or to directly employ someone . There are some things you can not use direct payments for : <p> To pay yourself as a carer for the care you provide ; <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in the household the person you care for ( unless it is agreed this is necessary ) ; or <p> Services of an intimate nature ( e.g. bathing ) or respite care for the person you care for ( if we agree following their assessment that they need such support , they could have their own direct payments or have their services arranged by a social care co-ordinator ) . <h> Will I need to pay anything myself ? <p> We do not charge for services for carers . You will not be financially assessed . Direct payments do not affect any benefits you may be receiving . However they will affect the benefits of anybody you choose to employ . <h> Could the person I care for receive direct payments ? <p> Most people who have social care support at home from us could now receive direct payments : <p> Older people who have been assessed as needing community care services ; <p> Disabled people aged 16 and over , including those with short as well as long-term needs ; <p> Carers , in place of receiving carers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's services ; <p> Disabled parents for children 's services ; and <p> People receiving a direct payment on behalf of someone else who lacks capacity . <p> Sometimes a person who needs social care support is not able to make the necessary decisions about direct payments . This is described as lacking capacity . It is possible for someone to receive direct payments on their behalf and to use them to meet the person 's needs . If you are the carer of someone who would benefit from direct payments and either you or someone you know would be willing to act as the ' suitable person ' to receive the direct payments for them , please get in touch with the direct payment support service . <p> There are only very limited circumstances when direct payments could not be offered and the reasons would be explained . <p> If you choose to employ your own personal assistants , the person assisting you with drawing up your support plan and/or your direct payment advisor can help you be more specific about what you need to do to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you/your staff will need to undertake . <p> You need to make sure any staff you employ are able to carry out the tasks you expect of them and do not put you or themselves at risk of being injured . It is , therefore , particularly important that you and your staff understand the implications of any moving and handling tasks expected of them . <p> Insurance companies state that they will only pay out if the personal assistant is trained in moving and handling by an appropriate trainer . In the event of a claim it is important you understand the implications . <p> Employers are required to provide their staff with instruction , information , training and supervision . In particular , health and safety legislation applies to employers of five or more staff who are then legally required to provide training . We strongly recommend that you identify your own training needs so you can provide some formal guidance/training to your personal assistants . We may be able to advise on this and also provide information about suitable , available training . <p> We also recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This may mean attending some courses together . Some training is also available in the home . <p> If your personal assistant has not already undertaken training , and depending on the tasks they will be asked to undertake , the sorts of courses you may need to consider could be : <p> Moving and handling - if your personal assistant supports you with any moving and handling tasks , then they will need to have moving and handling training ; <p> First aid ; <p> Infection control ; <p> Food hygiene ; <p> Administration of medication ; or <p> Health and safety . <p> You may also want to consider other specialist courses , such as dementia awareness , autism , diabetes , etc . <p> Some useful information is also available from Skills for Care for the training of personal assistants : <p> Common induction standards - there are new standards being completed at this moment through Skills for Care and Skills for Health who are including personal assistants in the common induction standards and also they have completed a code of conduct for health and social care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocational qualifications - the QCF level 3 diploma in health and social care called " For those working as a personal assistant " replaces NVQs . There are standalone units that personal assistants can complete as they can now choose only units applicable to what they are doing . The direct payment support service or your social care co-ordinator will be able to advise you about access to this in your area ; <p> The workforce development fund can help with training costs . People who employ their own care and support staff will need to register some basic details about themselves and their personal assistants on to the National Minimum Data Set for Social Care to be able to access the funding . The fund can only be utilised by adult social care providers that employ social care staff within England . See accessing the workforce development fund for details ; and <p> When someone in receipt of a direct payment dies , we need to be informed so that we can stop the arrangements that are in place . <p> Please contact us on 01609 780780 . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person who will be dealing with the affairs of the deceased ( the executor will be named in the deceased 's will as the person who will deal with their affairs after their death ) . We will also ask you if there is a solicitor . If there is a solicitor involved please give their name and contact details , e.g. address and telephone number . We need this information so we know where to send correspondence . <p> We will contact the care management team who will close the direct payment and payments will cease . They will write to the executor/solicitor to explain and support you regarding the direct payment account and fulfilling all the legal requirements . <p> The direct payment support service will also be involved during this time to ensure all the employer responsibilities are completed correctly . <h> The direct payment account <p> The money has been provided to buy services for someone who needed social care support . It does not form part of the person 's estate and can not be used for any other purpose other than direct payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be used for such things as funeral expenses . <p> Any money left in the direct payment account once all the contractual and legally required sums have been paid must be returned to us . We will advise you on how this can be done . <h> If you are the executor of the will <p> You will need to find out if there are any contractual obligations or payments that need to be made from the dedicated direct payment account . For example , if the deceased had been employing a personal assistant , this person will need to be paid for the work that they have already completed and any redundancy/annual leave pay that is due to them . The direct payment support service can assist you to do this ( the redundancy payment due to each employee under the statutory redundancy payment scheme depends on the individual 's age and length of service ) . <h> If you are not the executor of the will <p> It is very important that you explain the direct payments scheme to the executor . They may not know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bank account is a dedicated direct payment account and that the remaining money in it , after all contractual and legally required sums have been paid out , needs to be returned to the council . <h> If there is no will <p> The individual is said to have died ' intestate ' . Usually a close relative like a spouse , child or parent will be able to apply for the legal right to sort out the estate of the person who has died . In order to be able to administer someone 's estate you ( or the friend or relative ) will need to apply to the Probate Registry for a ' Grant of letters of administration ' . See GOV.UK - wills , probate and inheritance for more guidance . <h> Access to the direct payment account <p> It is advisable that you obtain a solicitor to help you through the process . On receipt of the grant , you or the individual will become the ' administrator ' of the estate . The grant provides proof to banks , building societies and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were held in the deceased 's name . You will then be able to access the direct payment bank account and will be able to make any payments that need to be made . Once all payments have been made , you will need to return the remaining money to the council . <h> How can we meet the contractual responsibilities if we can not access the money ? <p> In the case where the account has been frozen or there is no access to the account , then we will , in certain circumstances , pay out some outstanding payments e.g. salaries on the individual 's behalf . This money will then be recovered once the account has been reactivated and closed . To enable you to fulfil all your legal requirements please contact the direct payment support service for more information . <p> The Care Act 2014 focuses on people having control , therefore employing personal assistants can be very empowering for many disabled and older people . To optimise a person 's control over their delivery of care and support , we offer direct payments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a provider . <p> Unless we are satisfied that it is necessary to meet a person 's or child 's needs , people are advised not use direct payments to secure services from self-employed personal assistants . <p> We will retain the discretion to make an exception which must be approved in writing . <p> Where a person wishes to pursue to pay a self-employed personal assistant from the direct payment , an exception application must be completed . <h> What is a self-employed personal assistant ? <p> The UK Government website clearly states where a person uses personal assistants , the user is an employer if they pay a personal assistant directly , even if you get money from your local council ( direct payments ) or the NHS ( personal health budget ) to pay for them . Your personal assistant is usually treated as an employee because in law there are certain conditions that must be met for someone to be viewed as self-employed . <p> You can not just choose a self-employed personal assistant if you want to avoid your responsibilities as an employer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems daunting . HM Revenue &amp; Customs decide upon the status of employment / self-employment based on various factors . <p> If your personal assistant is an employee , you have more control as you decide the working hours . You are also responsible to give the personal assistant pay slips , paid holiday , a contract of employment and sick pay . See the GOV.UK - employing someone to work in your home page for detailed advice on employment status for people you employ to work in your home . <h> What are the risks of paying a self-employed personal assistant ? <p> Whether someone is employed or self-employed is referred to as their status . You are responsible for ensuring your personal assistant 's status is correct . It is important that you check their status for tax , employment law and pension auto-enrolment purposes . <p> Remember , a personal assistant may be treated as self-employed by HM Revenue &amp; Customs for tax purposes but still be considered an employee in employment law , or for auto-enrolment into a workplace pension . <p> The final decision on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual choice . It will be decided according to case law by either HM Revenue &amp; Customs or an employment tribunal . If you get your personal assistant 's employment status wrong there could be serious consequences : <p> If HM Revenue &amp; Customs decide your personal assistant should have been treated as an employee , you may be liable for any tax , National Insurance contributions and possibly penalties due ; <p> If an employment tribunal decides your personal assistant should have been treated as an employee , you may have to pay the personal assistant for unfair dismissal , which could be many thousands of pounds ; and / or <p> If the Pensions Regulator decides your personal assistant should have come within the scope of auto-enrolment , they may also levy penalties on you as the employer . <p> It is important to remember that we will not pay these liabilities for you . <h> How can I check my personal assistant 's status ? <p> If your personal assistant claims to be self-employed , or you decide to treat your personal assistant as self-employed , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is acceptable : <p> See the HM Revenue &amp; Customs employment status indicator tool This can be completed anonymously and will produce a 14 digit employment status indicator reference number on the outcome screen and the result can be downloaded or printed out ; <p> Direct payments are not a benefit - the money comes from North Yorkshire County Council to meet your assessed social care needs and is an alternative to services which are organised for you . <p> Having direct payments will not affect your benefits or be counted as income . <p> Sometimes you may be able to employ someone who lives with you ( this could be a family member ) but you must talk to us about this first . There could be implications for any household benefits . Talk to your social care co-ordinator first . <p> You can take as long as you want to decide if you want to use direct payments . While you decide we will arrange interim services to meet your needs . <p> You can add your own money to top up a direct payment to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of work but do n't worry , there is a lot of support to help you manage the scheme and succeed . The most important thing is you are in control but this does n't mean doing everything on your own . <p> You can mix your care arrangements . For instance you could ask us to arrange some of your support and use a direct payment to arrange some of the support yourself - a mix and match of services that you choose . <p> You do not have to calculate tax and National Insurance if you employ someone - the direct payment support service will signpost you to a payroll service . <p> There are no difficult forms for you to fill in - on most occasions we only need a copy of your bank statements to check your fund is working properly . <p> If you are considering direct payments for someone who lacks capacity to consent to the direct payment please discuss with your social care co-ordinator . <p> If direct payments do not work for you we can arrange services for you instead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not choose to have services arranged for them again . The most important thing is to be in control of your own life . Direct payments mean that you have freedom , choice , control and flexibility in your life to have the help you need by making your own arrangements . <h> Direct payments - frequently asked questions <p> The money you receive through direct payments enables you to arrange and be in control of the services you choose to meet your needs . There are a wide range of options available for using the money but there are also certain limitations . <p> The available options and limitations are explained below . You must also only spend your direct payments on things that your assessment shows that you need and that are reflected in your support plan . <p> You could use the money received through direct payments to : <p> Employ your own staff to provide personal care ; <p> Set up a contract with an agency to provide staff and services for you ; <p> Arrange for relief from the stress and demands of caring by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carer a break ; <p> Purchase a holiday or short break , provided this has been agreed with your assessor and is considered an appropriate way to meet your assessed needs ; or <p> Get a practical service which will help you to stay living at home . <p> You can use the money to receive any combination of these options and any other services that are available . In this way you can create your own service that fits your choices and needs . <p> You can not use the money received through direct payments to : <p> Buy services provided by the local authority , i.e. North Yorkshire County Council ( but you can ask us to buy them on your behalf ) ; <p> Buy permanent residential or nursing care ; <p> Employ a spouse , partner or other close relative , if that person lives with you in the same household ( exceptions can be made to this but only in exceptional circumstances as authorised by us ) ; <p> Pay for a personal assistant 's expenses such as food and drink or entry fees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support workers and personal assistants a reduced entry fee or free entry and all these options must be explored prior to any agreement being sought for payment of entry fees ) ; <p> Buy health-related services or equipment that should be provided by the NHS ; <p> Pay household bills or buy clothes , food etc. ; or <p> Buy anything that does not meet your agreed needs . <p> Once your support plan has been agreed the direct payments can only be used in the way indicated in this plan . If you want to change how your direct payments are used then a new plan will have to be agreed with your social care assessor . <h> Reviewing direct payments <p> We recognise that each case will be different and that costs for services will differ but agreements for direct payments must be subject to regular review . This is so that we can fulfil our duty to ensure that the services we arrange achieve the best value . <h> Help with managing direct payments <p> If you receive direct payments you will be personally responsible for how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with how you manage it . We run a direct payments support service to provide help and support for people receiving direct payments . <p> Note that direct payments are not seen as income and have no effect upon tax or benefits . <p> No , you are financially assessed to determine how much you can afford to pay towards the cost of your support needs . The service user contribution must be used first to pay for your support prior to the direct payment being used . <p> If you decide to use less support , your care needs will be reassessed to determine the correct level of support and you will be financially reassessed to determine the service user contribution for your new package . <p> You should collect receipts for services bought using direct payments under certain circumstances . However , for some situations , this is not strictly necessary . <p> If the direct payment is under 400 , for example , for a one-off direct carers grant , then it is not necessary for assessment staff to routinely collect receipts . Please note however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may ask to either see the item purchased or have sight of the receipt . <p> If the direct payment is to purchase a regular service , for example , regular entrance to a club or venue as part of your assessed needs , then receipts are required as part of the monitoring process of the direct payment . <p> If you are unsure about collecting a receipt then it is always best to do so as this will prevent potential problems in the future . Your social care worker will be able to advise you about what to do in specific situations . <p> Note that direct payments are not seen as income and have no effect upon tax or benefits . <p> We offer comprehensive support for people receiving direct payments through our direct payments support service . <p> The direct payments legislation requires that people who are interested in receiving direct payments should have access to independent , good quality information , advice and support when considering or receiving direct payments . <p> Contracting with other agencies , including using agencies approved by health and adult services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contractor ; and <p> Completing returns for the local authority . <p> Note that direct payments are not seen as income and have no effect upon tax or benefits . <h> Contacting the direct payments support service <p> You can contact the direct payments support service at any time within office hours . Email them at **32;1175;TOOLONG or telephone 01609 533621 . They will work closely with your care co-ordinator to give you as much help as possible .

@@23526337 @3526337/ <h> Important information to consider <p> We make the decisions about admissions to North Yorkshire community and voluntary-controlled schools . This is based on the over-subscription criteria . <p> Admissions to voluntary-aided , foundation , trust schools and academies are controlled by their governing bodies . You can get policies for these schools from the school concerned . We do , however , coordinate admissions on their behalf and will make the offer of a place . If you want to apply to a voluntary-aided , foundation , trust school or academy , you should name it as a preference on the online or paper common application form . <p> It is important to note that some voluntary aided schools require parents/carers to provide additional information by completing a supplementary information form . Failure to complete and submit this form to the school will mean that you application is considered after all other applications for which a form was submitted . Where the school is oversubscribed this could mean that a place can not be offered to your child . If you have any queries about this issue please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Government 's coordinated admission scheme , all applications for school places need to be made through your home authority . Local authorities will then liaise with each other regarding cross border requests to make sure places are allocated according to the relevant admissions criteria . <p> You can get details of the admission criteria for schools outside North Yorkshire by contacting the authority responsible for admissions to that school . <h> Think ahead <p> Places at secondary schools are based on your home address , not the primary school your child will , or may , be going to .

To prioritise children attending the nursery would discriminate against : <p> Younger children ; <p> Children who are attending a nursery class in another school or setting ; and <p> Children whose parents choose not to use any of the pre school provision available . <h> Provision for two , three and four year olds <p> All three and four year olds are entitled to 15 hours per week of free Early Years Foundation Stage provision from the beginning of the school term following their third birthday until compulsory school age .

It is your choice as to which type of provision is most appropriate for your child and most convenient for your individual circumstances . <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preschools or child-minders , have to meet Early Years Foundation Stage requirements and your child will get the same experiences whichever type of provision you choose , it is only the environment that changes . <p> To be eligible to offer the free entitlement , early years providers have to register with us , and we maintain a directory of providers . You can get information on all Early Years Foundation Stage providers from the North Yorkshire Families Information Service website at www.nyfamilies.info or by calling 01609 533483 , our staff will be pleased to talk you through the options available to you . <p> You can access the 15 hours of free provision flexibly , within the following parameters : <p> To be taken over a minimum of two days . <p> Sessions can vary in length but the minimum length is 2+ hours . <p> The earliest a session can start is 7am and the latest it can finish is 7pm . <p> You do not have to take all the 15 hours with one early years provider but the maximum number of providers you can use is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the entitlement by taking fewer hours a week over more weeks of the year . <p> This flexibility is designed to enable you to plan provision that best suits you and your child . You can not assume that all the Early Years Foundation Stage providers in your area will be able to meet your requirements , but you can expect as a minimum to be able to access provision either as five sessions of three hours ( five mornings or afternoons or a combination of mornings and afternoons ) or as three sessions of five hours , although not necessarily at every setting . <p> Once you have chosen the provision you wish to use you will be asked to sign a parental agreement that specifies exactly when your child will attend . This agreement will remain in force for at least a school term and possibly for the whole school year . <p> Applications for a place at a nursery school or a school with a nursery class should be made directly to the head teacher . <h> Provision for two year olds <p> From September 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of provision in exactly the same way as three and four year olds .

We encourage parents to preference between 3 and 5 different schools and to rank them in order of preference .

The School Admissions Code ( 2014 ) states admission authorities must allocate places on the basis of their determined admission arrangements only , and a decision to offer or refuse a school place must not be made by a single individual in an admissions authority . Where a school is its own admissions authority the whole governing body or admissions committee , established by the governing body , must make such decisions . It is important you understand the type of school you are applying for , as the type of school affects the criteria used to determine which children will be offered places , who make the decisions and who you must appeal to if you are unhappy with the decision . <p> Please note head teachers or other school officials are not allowed to give any indication of whether your application will be successful . In addition they can not inform parents their child has been allocated a place before a formal offer has been made by the local authority . <p> When a school is oversubscribed , that is , where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places is determined by the published admissions criteria . Part of the criteria uses the child 's principle , permanent home address . You must notify us of any change of address immediately . The definition of ' home address ' or ' principle , permanent residence ' , for the purpose of school admissions is the address at which your child resides most of the time . If the residency of your child is split between both parents , we consider the home address to be the address where the child lives for the majority of the school week ( Monday to Friday ) .

Access to enhanced mainstream provision is shared across the wider local area . A child may access the provision when the local authority deems the child has special educational needs and the provision is appropriate to meet those needs . It is important to note the presence of enhanced mainstream provision at a school does not form part of the local authority 's admission policy and is not considered as a reason for applying for a place at that particular school unless a child has a final statement of special educational needs ( SEN ) or an education health and care plan ( EHCP ) which names that school . <p> reduction of fees for board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits . <p> Schools must provide , free of charge , any activities which take place out of school hours but relate to the national curriculum or form part of a public exam syllabus .

If your request is refused , you must decide whether to accept the offer of a place for the normal age group , or to refuse it and make an in year application for admission to year one for the September following your child 's fifth birthday . Where your request is agreed , you must make a new application as part of the main admissions round the following year . <p> If you have not been offered any of your higher preferences , this is because there were more applications than there were places available at the school and other children had a higher priority under the published admission criteria . <h> Class size 30 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 class sizes to no more than 30 children per class . <p> If you have not been offered a place at a school due to class size 30 , further information will be sent to you in due course . <h> Statutory right of appeal <p> You have the statutory right of appeal to an independent admission appeal panel , should you wish to do so .

There are 9,000km of roads in North Yorkshire , meaning there is a considerable length of verge , mostly covered in grass . <p> You can access our online maps to view the urban grass cutting status of verges in your area . The map shows parish information , and areas of urban grass within each parish and what will be cut . 22769 @qwx222769 <p> We have to balance the safety of road users and pedestrians with environmental considerations , recognising that verges are important for wildlife . Some of our grass cutting is done early in the year , and some in July , August or September , to allow flowers to set seed whilst also maintaining safety . The frequency of the cut depends on where the verge is located . <p> We are not responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private properties , or for the vast majority of hedges by the roadside which are usually the responsibility of the adjacent landowner . Motorway and trunk road verges are maintained by Highways England . <p> Where weed problems exist , we use one application of a non-residual contact herbicide called ' glyphosate ' , which conforms to health and safety and Environment Agency requirements . We may use additional treatments where required . <h> Urban and rural grass cutting <p> Our grass cutting policy is split into two : urban and rural . Urban grass cutting takes place on roads with a speed limit of 40mph or less , and rural grass cutting takes place on roads with a speed limit of 50mph or above . <h> Changes to our urban grass cutting policy <p> From April 2015 , we are making changes to our urban grass cutting policy on roads of 40mph or less . <p> Until recently , most urban grass cutting has been provided for amenity purposes only . However , due to reductions in the money we receive from the government , we have had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we will now fund grass cutting in urban areas that is essential for visibility or safety purposes only . <p> The rural grass cutting policy , which applies to verges on roads of 50mph or above , remains unchanged and has not been reduced . <p> In parts of Harrogate and Scarborough , the urban grass cutting is carried out by the borough council on behalf of the county council through a service level agreement . We are currently in discussions with the borough councils and the current grass cutting arrangements will continue for the remainder of 2015 . We are hopeful of an agreement for the period after this , however this is still subject to further discussions and we will update this information when we know more . <p> We have entered into a formal agreement with Selby District Council for urban grass cutting in parts of the district and enquiries should be directed to the district council for these areas . <p> Grey <p> No urban grass <p> There is no urban grass in this parish .

As parishes contact us , this information may change . <h> How to use the map <p> To view the urban grass and what will be cut , you need to zoom the map in towards street level.When zoomed out , the map shows the whole county split into parishes , each of which is colour-coded according to the table above . <p> Urban grass is shown in a green hatch , and visibility or safety cut areas are shown in blue . Areas of rural grass ( verges next to roads where the speed limit is 50mph or greater ) are not shown on the map as these are unaffected . <h> Example showing grass we will cut <p> If the parish chosen is one where the county council cuts the grass , only areas in blue will be cut . This will happen five times a year for visibility or safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncut . <h> Reporting concerns with the map <p> If you have concerns about urban grass cutting in an area for which we are responsible , for example you feel we have n't included a safety critical junction , you can report this to us online . If your concerns relate to urban grass cutting in an area looked after by parish , district or borough councils , please contact them directly . <h> Offering to cut the grass in your parish <p> If you are prepared to cut the grass in your parish , you should speak to your parish council directly to get permission . We have offered parish councils a financial contribution for cutting the visibility and safety areas of urban highway grass . <h> Inaccuracies on the map <p> Some parish councils have not yet decided whether to carry out grass cutting in their area . These areas will receive a visibility or safety cut by the county council in the interim until the parish council meeting .

The single primary school would operate on the existing Ingleby Arncliffe school site and serve the two catchment areas currently served by both Swainby and Potto and Ingleby Arncliffe Primary Schools . <p> In order to maintain the historical link between the schools and the Diocese of York , the single school would retain its status as a Voluntary Aided Church of England school .

The settlement is very challenging given that it represents the phased removal of the government 's revenue support grant by 2020 . <p> However , it also offers a degree of certainty and the opportunity for contingency planning during a period of extreme uncertainty .

Currently over 40 per cent of our budget , some 136m , goes on adult social care . <p> The 1.99 per cent increase in council tax is more than offset by the further reduction in government grants from 59m to zero by 2020 .

@@23526374 @3526374/ <h> Care Act <p> The Care Act introduced changes to the way care and support is delivered . You can find out more about these changes here . <p> The Care Act , implemented in April 2015 , introduced changes to the way care and support is delivered . As people live longer and with a better quality of life , their care needs become different , so the way care and support is provided changed to reflect this . <p> The changes , embodied in the Care Act , are designed to make care and support clearer and fairer and to promote the wellbeing of both the people who are cared for and their carers . The aim is to prevent or delay people 's care needs becoming more serious and to help carers to continue their caring role . <p> Changes to provision of and eligibility for care and support was introduced in April 2015 and funding changes were planned to be introduced in April 2016 . However , these funding changes have now been delayed until 2020 . <p> We have a team working to implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparations and is already doing much that the Care Act requires . We will continue to develop and shape our practice in line with the Care Act requirements . <h> Main changes April 2015 <p> A new national eligibility threshold based on whether a person 's needs are due to a physical or mental impairment or illness ; to what extent this affects their abilities and how this affects their wellbeing ; <p> Unpaid carers will have the same rights as those they care for , so may be able to get more help to carry on caring and look after themselves ; <p> Continuity of care when people move to another area ; and <p> Deferred payments , which North Yorkshire already offers , will become universal . This means people should not have to sell their home in their lifetime to pay for care . <p> We are already taking action that will help to achieve many of the Care Acts aims . For example : <p> We are helping people to cope in their own homes through our reablement service , which provides intensive short-term support after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with partners and through projects such as the innovation fund , which supports local facilities ; <p> We have officers who will help people to maximise the benefits available to them ; and <p> Our online AskSARA tool allows people to find information and advice , as well as products that can help them remain independent in their daily lives . This is used between 500 and 600 times a month . <h> Changes in April 2016 <p> The government announced on Friday 17 July 2015 that Care Act Phase 2 elements due to be delivered on 1 April 2016 have now been delayed until April 2020 . See the full written statement here . <p> In summary , there are a number of areas within the Care Act 2014 legislation that will not be implemented anytime soon , including : <p> Delayed Care Act element <p> What does this mean now ? <p> The 72,000 cap on care costs <p> Current financial assessment rules continue to apply and there will be no mechanism for individuals to set up a care account at present . <p> The extension to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding how much someone will pay towards their care continues to apply . <p> A new appeals system for care and support <p> Existing compliments , comments and complaints procedures for adult social care remain in place . <p> Meeting the eligible needs of self-funders <p> Anyone is entitled to an assessment of their care and support needs from us . If someone who is eligible for care and support but is financially assessed as a full cost payer ( self-funder ) , we will signpost them to relevant information and advice . <h> Changes to care and support <p> The frequently asked questions below explain more about the changes to care and support , what they are and how they may affect you . <p> ' Care and support ' is the term used to describe the help some adults need to live as well as possible with any illness or disability they may have . It can include help with things like getting out of bed , washing , dressing , getting to work , cooking meals , eating , seeing friends , caring for families and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional support at a time of difficulty and stress , helping people who are caring for an adult family member or friend or even giving others a lift to a social event . <p> Care and support includes the help given by family and friends , as well as any provided by North Yorkshire County Council or other organisations . <p> From April 2015 , care and support in England was changed for the better . The new Care Act will help make care and support more consistent across the country . <p> The new national changes are designed to put you in control of the help you receive . Any decisions about your care and support will consider your wellbeing and what is important to you and your family , so you can stay healthy and remain independent for longer . <p> Some changes were introduced in April 2015 and other funding changes were planned to be introduced in April 2016 . We have now been told the funding changes planned for April 2016 will not be introduced until 2020 . Those in April 2015 include : <p> changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we will support carers ; and <p> introducing new arrangements that are the same for all local authorities to help decide if you are eligible for care and support . <p> As people are now living longer and with a better quality of life , the care and support needs they have are different . The way care and support is provided has to change to reflect this . The Care Act was passed to make care and support , and the way we pay for it , clearer , easier to access and more consistent across the whole of England . <p> The changes mean that more people will be able to get the care and support they need , either from North Yorkshire County Council or from other organisations in the community . Different ways to pay for care and support will be available across the whole of England , so people should not have to sell their home in their lifetime to pay for care . People who receive care and support from North Yorkshire County Council will have more say over what sort of help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available for people who give unpaid care and support to an adult family member or friend . <p> Care and support organised by North Yorkshire County Council can include help with everyday things like washing and dressing , getting in and out of bed , and keeping your home clean and safe . <p> As well as care and support organised by us , some people are also eligible to receive help from the NHS . This help may be a nursing service for people who are i 'll or recovering at home after leaving hospital . It could include things like changing the dressings on wounds or giving medication . If you are eligible for this kind of help , a health professional such as your GP or community nurse should be able to tell you . <p> In exceptional circumstances , where an adult has a complex medical condition and substantial ongoing care needs , the NHS provides a service called NHS Continuing Healthcare . NHS Continuing Healthcare provides care and support in a person 's home , care home or hospice . <h> Deferred payment agreements <h> Introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arrangement with North Yorkshire County Council that will enable people to use the value of their homes to help pay care home costs . If you are eligible , we will help to pay your care home bills on your behalf . You can delay repaying us until you choose to sell your home , or until after your death . <p> Deferred payment agreements will suit some people 's circumstances better than others ' . From 1 April 2015 we can charge interest on the amount owed to us , and there will be a fee for setting this arrangement up . <p> A deferred payment agreement is only one way to pay for care . To find out more about the options available you can speak to a financial adviser or seek advice from an independent organisation . <p> Please note that before agreeing to enter into a deferred payment agreement , we have to look at the value of your home . We can also look at any outstanding mortgage , other legal charges or equity release agreements in order to ensure that it is realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A person can sell their home and repay the deferred payment agreement at any point . Or they can have a deferred payment agreement for the full length of their stay in a care home and it will be paid back out of their estate , following their death . <p> The amount you can defer will depend on the value of your home , which determines your ' equity limit ' . As a guide , most people can use around 80 to 90 per cent of the equity available in their home . The limit on equity is to protect you from not having enough money to pay sale costs of the property ( like solicitor 's fees ) and to protect the council against a drop in housing prices and the risk that we may not get all of the money back . We will provide regular statements to advise on the up to date value of the person 's debt . <p> If you need care in a care home but your partner lives in your own home then we will consider your partner 's circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's circumstances , we may decide to exclude the value of your home when we assess your finances to work out how much you will have to pay towards the costs of your care . This means that you will not face having to sell your home to pay for care and will not need a deferred payment agreement . If ownership is in doubt we will seek further legal advice . <p> If your partner has circumstances that mean we decide that the value of your home is not excluded , you should still be able get a deferred payment agreement , provided your partner is willing to sign the agreement too . If your partner does not sign the agreement then there is no entitlement to a deferred payment agreement . <p> A deferred payment agreement is designed for people who are most at risk of selling their home to pay care fees . If you are still living in your own home , you should not need a deferred payment agreement , and there are other ways for you to pay for your care ( including council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments ) . You could speak to a financial adviser or an independent organisation to find out more . <p> If you have savings and investments of less than 23,250 and you do not have a partner or dependent living in your home , you should be eligible for a deferred payment agreement . If you have more than 23,250 , we may still offer you a deferred payment agreement . <p> This is up to you - though there are benefits to keeping your home occupied . It must be maintained and insured for as long as you have the deferred payment agreement , and this can be cheaper and / or easier if someone is living there . You might choose to rent it out and use the income to reduce the amount you asked to defer . <p> If you have a deferred payment agreement , it means you should not have to sell your home in your lifetime unless you decide you want to . <p> The money owed to North Yorkshire County Council from care home bills paid on your behalf during the deferred payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either be repaid by selling your house or you can arrange another way to pay if you are able to . For example , someone else could pay the money owed , or your family could use any pay-out from your life assurance after your death . <p> Your deferred payment agreement will end automatically following your death , and your executor will have 90 days to arrange payment of the money owed . If someone else ( like a friend or relative ) chooses to pay the bill , then your home will not have to be sold . <p> Your home and your money still belong to you if you have a deferred payment agreement , so you can of course make gifts to your children . But a deferred payment agreement for care costs will always need to be repaid - either by the sale of your home after your death , by someone else , or by something like the pay-out from a life assurance policy . If we believe that your home or your money have been given away deliberately to avoid paying care charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are owed . <p> During the first twelve weeks you are in a care home , your home is ignored for the purposes of calculating what you might pay and a deferred payment agreement would usually start after that period . If you are eligible , we should be able to set up a deferred payment agreement within twelve weeks of you moving to a care home but some will be arranged more quickly than this . <p> We will arrange to have your property valued and you can also request an independent valuation if you disagree with that valuation . We will arrange for the cost of the initial valuation to be incorporated into the administration fee for setting up the deferred payment agreement . <p> In order to be eligible for a deferred payment agreement your property will need to be insured . Please contact us if you have specific concerns about this . You will have to provide proof of your insurance arrangements , including proof of payment of premiums . <p> Carers and families can help people to make decisions about their care and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the person applying for the deferred payment agreement does not have the capacity to understand , or wo n't have capacity to understand in the near future , then another person may need to represent them . Only a person that is properly authorised , like someone with legal power of attorney , can represent someone in applying for a deferred payment agreement . <h> Costs and charges of a deferred payment agreement <p> We charge an administrative fee of 125 for setting up a deferred payment agreement . This fee is to cover the costs we incur in setting it up , and not to make a profit . There are also some other costs involved . The full set up costs are : <p> One-off set-up legal costs , which are currently 125 ; <p> A Land Registry charge for a land search . This currently costs 48 ; <p> A professional valuation of your home . This costs 350 but may be 500 for more complex cases ; you will be advised if the higher rate applies ; and <p> An administration charge of 125 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these charges if you decide to take out an agreement . <p> We can charge interest on the amount owed to us ( 2.65% currently ) whilst we are helping to pay a person 's care home bills on their behalf . The interest rate will be reviewed every six months . Interest is charged to cover our costs and not to make a profit . <p> No . We need to make sure that we can invest in the scheme so that people can benefit from it for many years to come . The interest rate and administrative fee will cover our costs , and we wo n't make a profit from them . <p> We can charge interest on the amount owed to us whilst we are helping to pay your care home bills on your behalf . The interest rate will be reviewed every six months . Interest is charged to cover our costs and not to make a profit . <p> The loan will have interest charged on it in the same way a normal loan would be charged on money borrowed from a bank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the government . Currently the maximum rate to be charged is based on the cost of government borrowing , and will change on 1 January and 1 July every year . This interest will be compounded on a four-weekly basis . <p> The interest will apply from the day you enter into the deferred payment agreement . <p> You will receive regular statements advising you how your charge is being calculated and what the outstanding sum on your deferred payment agreement is . <p> In addition to the interest charged , there are also ongoing annual administrative costs of 359 ( 2017-18 rates ) . <p> The disposable income allowance ( formally known as PEA ) is a fixed amount ( up to 144 per week ) of a person 's income which we must allow you to retain ( if you want to retain it ) . We can require you to contribute the rest of your income , but must allow you to retain as much of your disposable income allowance as you want to . <h> Repaying a deferred payment agreement <p> You can sell your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or you can have a deferred payment agreement for the full length of your stay in a care home and pay it back out of your estate , following your death . <p> The executor of your estate should arrange repayment of the money owed to us , either by putting your home up for sale , or by arranging for another person , such as your heir , to pay . This will usually need to be done within 90 days . If the money owed is repaid without your home being sold , then your property will be dealt with according to any instructions you have left . 22770 @qwx222770 <p> The maximum amount of costs that we will pay on your behalf , along with the interest rate and any administrative fees , will be set out at the start of the deferred payment agreement . These will be reviewed regularly and can be changed . <p> Any other conditions , for example how the property should be maintained , will also be written down in your agreement . Make sure that you understand the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , financial advisor or an independent organisation before signing a deferred payment agreement . <p> A deferred payment agreement is only one way to pay for care if you own or have a financial interest in the property . To find out more about the options available , see our paying for care in a residential or nursing home page or speak to a financial adviser or seek advice from an independent organisation . <h> Needs and eligibility <p> Information about the eligibility and needs assessments relating to the Care Act . <p> A needs assessment is a discussion between you ( or the person you look after if you are a carer ) and a trained person either from North Yorkshire County Council or another organisation that we work with , where you will talk about the care and support needs you have and the goals you want to achieve . We will use the assessment to identify your care and support needs , and to discuss how these could be met . This might mean that we will give you help or put you in touch with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to . <p> If you think you have any care and support needs , you can contact us to ask for an assessment . If you are a carer and you need some support , get in touch with us or the council covering the area where the person you care for lives for information and advice about how the assessment will work . <p> The needs assessment will consider what care and support needs you have and how these affect your wellbeing . This will include identifying any physical needs , such as whether you need help to wash or dress , get in and out of bed or keep your home safe to live in . The assessment will also look at your mental and emotional needs and ask what is important to you in how you live your life , such as being able to carry on working or volunteering , or being able to meet your friends . <p> Everyone 's needs and the ways they affect people 's wellbeing are different . Identifying your needs and the things you want to achieve will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what needs you have , we may give you information and advice about other kinds of support available locally that can help you , such as charities or community groups . <p> A ' needs assessment ' is an assessment of an adult who may need care and support . A ' carer 's assessment ' is for someone who gives care and support to an adult family member or friend . Caring can include lots of different things , like helping with their washing , dressing or eating , taking them to regular appointments or keeping them company when they feel lonely or anxious . <p> The assessment is about you and we will make sure that you are able to be involved . If you wish , then your carer , a friend or family member can help and represent you . If you do n't have a carer , family member or friend who you can ask , and you have a lot of difficulty doing the assessment yourself , we will find an independent advocate to help you . <p> If you are already receiving care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for a reassessment . We will contact you if there are any changes that affect you . If your needs have changed recently and you feel like you need more care and support , you can ask for a new assessment . <p> Lots of different people can carry out assessments - as long as they have the right training . You could also be offered a supported self-assessment . This means you do your assessment yourself with help from the council . <p> A needs assessment wo n't ask about your finances . But if you are eligible for care and support from North Yorkshire County Council , you may have to pay something towards the cost . To find out how much you might need to pay , we may ask you to do a financial means test and you would then need to disclose details about your savings , assets and income . <p> For the first time from April 2015 , there will be a national level of care and support needs that all councils will consider when we assess what help we can give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs with you , and decide if they are at the level where you need help from us . Your needs could be eligible if you are not able to do a combination of certain things that seriously effects your wellbeing . These may include washing yourself , getting dressed , getting in and out of bed or keeping your home safe for you to live in . <p> After the assessment we will write to you about our decision and give you reasons to explain what we have decided . <p> If you have eligible needs , we will contact you to discuss what help might be available . This will be based on the information you gave us during your assessment . As far as possible we will agree your care and support plan with you . <p> If you do not have needs that are eligible , we will give you information and advice about what care and support is available to help you locally . This could be help from local charities or voluntary organisations for example . <p> Everyone 's needs are different . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that the support you need could be met by something going on in your local community , for example services organised by local charities or other support networks . Whatever your level of need , we will give you information and advice that can help you . We might also be able put you in touch with other organisations who can support your wellbeing and help you remain independent for longer . <p> We will assess you to see if you have any eligible needs . If you do have eligible needs , we will work out if we can help you and we will calculate how much it should cost to meet your needs . This amount will count towards your cap . <p> The new national level will give you peace of mind that if you decide to move to another area in England ; the new council will meet at least the same minimum level of care and support needs as your old one . Councils will also have to work together to make sure that there is no gap in your care . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be able to get some help from your council wherever you live in England . Although the level of need councils use to decide whether or not they can help will be the same across the country , the help they give you might be different in different areas . For example , one council might provide a buddying service to stop people from feeling lonely , whilst another might help people to stop feeling lonely by introducing them to community events in their area . <h> Support for adult carers <p> In England , millions of people provide unpaid care or support to an adult family member or friend , either in their own home or somewhere else . <p> ' Caring ' for someone covers lots of different things , like helping with their washing , dressing or eating , taking them to regular appointments or keeping them company when they feel lonely or anxious . <p> If this sounds like you , you are considered to be a ' carer . ' <p> From April 2015 , care and support in England is changing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an adult ( aged 18 or over ) you may be able to get more help to carry on caring and look after your own wellbeing . <p> Our customer services centre staff will help you decide what you may need and who to contact . They can put you in touch with our specialist social care staff , who will look at what extra help may be needed . <p> ' Support for carers ' is what we mean by the help and advice that carers can get from North Yorkshire County Council , national services and local networks . As a carer , you may be able to get more help so that you can carry on caring and look after your own wellbeing . <p> From April 2015 , changes to the way care and support is provided in England mean you may be eligible for support , such as a direct payment to spend on the things that make caring easier ; or practical support , like arranging for someone to step in when you need a short break . Or you may prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have people to talk to . <p> North Yorkshire County Council or the council covering the area where the person you care for lives can help you find the right support and you can ask them for a carer 's assessment . <p> A carer 's assessment will look at the different ways that caring affects your life and work out how you can carry on doing the things that are important to you and your family . Your physical , mental and emotional wellbeing will be at the heart of this assessment . As a result , you may be eligible for support from the council , who will also offer you advice and guidance to help you with your caring responsibilities . <p> You can have a carer 's assessment even if the person you care for does not get any help from the council , and they will not need to be assessed . <p> The council covering the area where the person you care for lives can help you find the right support and you can ask them for a carer 's assessment . The carer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need and how much help the council can give you . <p> If you are a young carer yourself , or if you are a parent caring for a disabled child , you have similar rights to assessment and support but they are covered by the Children and Families Act , not the new Care Act . <p> If you or the person you are caring for is about to reach the age of 18 years , you will be able to get a ' transition assessment ' which will let you know whether you or they are likely to be eligible for support as an adult caring for another adult . <p> The Department for Education will soon be publishing further information on the rights of parent carers and young carers and how councils should support them . <p> If you provide care and support to an adult friend or family member , you may be eligible for support , such as a direct payment to spend on the things that make caring easier ; or practical support , like arranging for someone to step in when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put in touch with local support groups so you have people to talk to . <p> A carer 's assessment will consider the impact the care and support you provide is having on your own wellbeing and important aspects of the rest of your life . <p> You can ask for a carer 's assessment at any time . You should contact the council covering the area where the person you care for lives , if it is not North Yorkshire County . If you do n't want a carer 's assessment but you are looking for advice and information about local support , the council will be able to help you . <p> A carer 's assessment will look at the different ways caring affects your life and work out how you can carry on doing the things that are important to you and your family . It should cover your caring role , your feelings about caring , your physical , mental and emotional health , and how caring affects your work , leisure , education , wider family and relationships . <p> Your physical , mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment . This means that you will be able to tell the council how caring for someone is affecting your life and what could make things better for you and the person you look after . <p> You wo n't need to do a financial means test as part of the carer 's assessment but you might be asked about what impact the cost of caring is having on your finances . The carer 's allowance that some people receive for caring on a full-time basis is different and does require a means test . <p> A carer 's assessment is about you and your wellbeing . It will consider the impact that caring is having on your life and what support might be available for you . Its purpose is not to judge the care that you provide . <p> Yes . But you will need to do this through the council of the person that you support , if it is not the same as North Yorkshire County Council . You can also ask for an assessment for the person you care for , if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be offered . If you care for an adult family member of friend , and you feel like you need some support , you can contact the council covering the area where the person you care for lives to ask for a carer 's assessment . <p> If the council decides that you have needs that meet the new national level they will discuss with you what support they can provide . <p> If your needs are not eligible , the council will give you information and advice about other types of support that are available in your area . This may include putting you in touch with local charities or community organisations . <p> Each person 's situation is different . The cost would either be covered by the council , or a contribution would need to be paid by the person receiving the care . You as a carer can not be charged for any support provided directly to the person you care for , even if it helps you to take a break .

@@23526398 @3526398/ <h> Trading standards news <p> Issues with recently purchased used cars are the subject area we receive the highest number of complaints about . Finding the exact car you were looking for is exciting , but it really is worth taking a step back and doing your homework before purchasing . This reduces the chance that you will be one of the people contacting trading standards for advice on resolving an issue with your car in the future . <p> You should look at the following : <h> The number of previous keepers <p> The number of previous keepers has a real impact on the value of a car . If it has been advertised as one previous keeper , but it turns out later to have had three previous keepers , it will make the car far less valuable when you come to sell it . Avoid this pitfall by asking to see the vehicle registration document , the V5C . This tells you how many previous keepers the car has . If it does n't match up to what you have been told , you may wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deal . <h> Is the mileage correct ? <p> Car mileages are recorded at each MOT so you can ask the garage for the MOT document . If applicable , this will show up to four years of mileages . Alternatively , to be extra sure , you can enter the registration number and make of the car into the DVLA online MOT checker to look at the previously recorded mileages . If the numbers do n't  stack up , it probably is n't the car for you . <h> Is the full service history actually a full service history ? <p> Ask to see the service record for the car . Find out what the manufacturer 's recommended service intervals are for the car you are interested in . If you see gaps where there has not been a service undertaken , you might want to consider whether you are willing to buy the car and if you still are , what you are willing to pay for it . Timely and appropriate services mean a car is less likely to develop faults in the long term and might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Has the car been involved in an accident and been written off ? Is there outstanding finance on the car ? <p> If a car is an insurance write off , it will be worth significantly less than you thought . If you buy a car which has outstanding finance associated to it , the finance company will have a legal claim to ownership of that car . There are a variety of mechanisms that you can use to check if a car is recorded as an insurance right off or has outstanding car finance on it , including via the AA , HPI , and the RAC . <h> Is the price right ? <p> It 's easy to be blinded by finding your perfect car , but consider if the price you will be paying is the right price . You can check in guides like Parkers or Glasses Guide , but a crude test is to see what other cars , of the same make and model , with similar age and mileage are being sold for . Although everyone loves to get a bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison to the same model sold elsewhere . This could be an indication that the car has hidden problems and the garage is eager for a quick sale . <h> Is the garage a member of a Code Approval Scheme or a trade body that offers arbitration if you do end up in dispute with your garage ? <p> There may be signs around the garage stating they are . Go onto the trade association website to confirm the garage 's membership . <h> If the car comes with a warranty or even of you plan to buy a separate warranty , what does the warranty cover ? <p> It is important to know what faults the warranty will cover and if the warranty has a limit . Many have a 1,000 limit , meaning if the required work will cost more than that , you would have to foot the bill over the first 1,000 . Many will not cover certain faults . Make sure you know the limitations of the warranty . <p> Newer cars might still have part of a manufacturer 's warranty covering some aspects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations or restrictions which could apply . <p> Remember , even if the car is sold with a warranty , if things go wrong , you can still reply on your statutory rights ; that the car should be as described , fit for purpose and of satisfactory quality . <h> Is the car in sound mechanical order ? <p> Unless you are a mechanic , you may not be able to make any judgment as to the car 's mechanical condition . Ensure that you test drive the car and that the test drive is sufficiently to make a proper assessment . If necessary , get a friend or family member to drive the car as well on your behalf , to get a second opinion on how it drives . Are there any odd knocking noises ? Do the brakes and the gearbox feel ok ? You should consider obtaining an independent mechanical report before you purchase the car . <h> Is this car really for you ? <p> Having considered all of the points above , it is also advisable to consider whether the car suits your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost you in petrol , what will it cost to tax and insure the car ? If you are taking out finance on the car , how much will it cost you overall and does that still make the car good value . <h> Other sources of information <p> There is also a smartphone app available for both Android and iPhones called " Car Buyers Guide " which gives hints and tips which you can use as a prompt while you are looking at cars at garages . <h> What if I purchase the car and in spite of all these checks , there is a problem ? <p> If a car has been misdescribed , as well as being a breach of contract , which you can pursue the trader for using your statutory rights , there is likely to have been criminal offences committed which trading standards want to know about . The Citizens Advice consumer helpline will provide you with advice on your statutory rights and will pass your complaint on the trading standards , to consider any criminal offence . <p> The Citizens Advice consumer helpline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Why has the Consumer Rights Act been introduced ? <p> The Consumer Rights Act 2015 is intended to make consumer law simpler and clearer , and will make sorting out problems , when they arise , quicker and cheaper . <h> When will it apply ? <p> The rights given by the Consumer Rights Act will apply to goods and services bought after 1 October 2015 . For goods and services bought before the 1 October 2015 , as a consumer , you will still rely on the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 . <h> What are the main changes to the consumer rights ? <p> Digital content Your rights as a consumer when you purchase digital content are mentioned specifically , for the first time . When buying digital content , you will now have the same rights as you have when you buy any other goods ; that the goods are of satisfactory quality , fit for the purpose the consumer makes known to the trader and as described . <p> Time scale for rejection The Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek to reject the goods and seek a full refund , if the goods they have bought are not of satisfactory quality , fit for purpose or as described . The old legislation , the Sale of Goods Act 1979 just said that if goods were found to be faulty within a reasonable time after purchase , the consumer could reject the goods and seek a full refund . What the time limit was for a " reasonable time " was up for debate . The Consumer Rights Act introduces a time limit of 30 days from purchase for consumers to reject faulty goods and seek a full refund . <p> One chance at repair or replacement Under the previous legislation , once the time in which a consumer 's right to reject had run out , they could seek a repair , a replacement or a partial refund . The new Consumer Rights Act state that if the seller has provided a replacement or a repair and the goods become faulty again , that then the consumer does n't have to accept a further repair or replacement , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer has had from the goods . <p> Services - right to repeat performance For services , it remains the right of consumers that the service is done with reasonable care and skill , and that where the price or the time frame in which the service is done , is not agreed in advance , the price should be a reasonable price and the timescale for completing the work should be a reasonable timescale . For the first time , under the Consumer Rights Act , where a service is not done with reasonable care and skill , the consumer has a right to require the trader to repeat the work . <h> What can consumers do when they have a dispute with a business that they ca n't agree on ? <p> The Consumer Rights Act allows for alternative dispute resolution to be used to try to resolve disputes between consumers and businesses , rather than having to go to the civil court . This should make settling disputes quicker and cheaper . <h> Where can consumers go for more advice ? <p> If you are a consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consumer Rights Act , they can visit the Citizens Advice website ; **25;1809;TOOLONG . The Citizens Advice provide some great practical examples of how the Consumer Rights Act will affect you , as a consumer in practice , which can be found here . If as a consumer you want advice about a problem you are having with goods or a service that do not meet your statutory rights , you can get specific advice from the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 . <h> Here are some examples of how the Consumer Rights Act 2015 will affect you in practice <h> Where you have had a product for a while <p> Scenario : You buy a mobility scooter and use it frequently over the course of five months . By the end of this time you notice that the battery is not performing properly or retaining its charge for long . The trader performs a repair but the scooter continues to perform poorly so you choose to reject it and get a refund . <p> Your rights : Under the Act , because you had only had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full refund . If , however , you had rejected the scooter more than six months after you received it , the trader would have been entitled to reduce the refund to take account of the use that you had had of the goods . <h> Where you have had a product for a short time <p> Scenario : You buy a toaster but find a week later , when you try to use it for the first time , that it wo n't turn on and the bread wo n't stay down . The toaster is not of satisfactory quality . <p> Your rights : Under the Act , because you had had the faulty toaster for fewer than 30 days you are entitled to reject it for a full refund so you can return it to the shop . Because the fault is obvious there is no need for further testing and the trader must agree to provide a refund . <h> Faulty digital content <p> Scenario : You pay to download a TV series which is described as containing all 13 episodes . When you download it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your rights : Under the Act , the digital content is not as described . You are entitled to a repair or replacement of the digital content , to bring it in line with the description . In this instance , an appropriate remedy may be a download of the final episode . <h> Services not carried out with reasonable care and skill <p> Scenario : A trader is contracted by you to decorate a room for a party . You inspect the work the day before it is due to be finished and say that it is not in line with the colour scheme you agreed with the trader 's assistant . The trader phones the assistant , who agrees that you did specify the colour scheme . <p> Your rights : Under the Act , you can ask the trader to re-do the decorating . Due to the purpose of the service , the trader would need to re-do the work before the party to have done so within a " reasonable time " . <p> In the past year , over 200 consumer products were subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the goods . Each week , we send messages out via our Facebook page ( North Yorkshire Trading Standards ) and Twitter feed ( @nyccts ) on the latest products subject of recalls , using #CheckItTuesday . <p> All consumer products are required , by law , to be safe , however , there are a small number of instances where products are found not to be safe and the manufacturers and retailers need to take steps to recall their products . You can find out how to register your appliances so that you are notified of any recalls or check all recalls using these websites : <h> Electrical appliances <p> When buying large electrical appliances , there are several measures you can take to ensure that , if your appliance is subject to a product recall , you will be contacted regarding the recall . The first option is to complete the product registration card which is often included in the packaging of the appliance , which you can complete and generally post back to the manufacturer via freepost . If you have already thrown that product registration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supported by the Department if Business , Innovation and Skills , has created http : **32;1836;TOOLONG . Via this website , you can register your appliances , to inform the manufacturers that you are an owner of their product . If one of those products is then unfortunately subject to a product recall , you can be contacted and the issue rectified . <p> If you choose not to register your electrical appliances , you may want to refer to the Electrical Safety First website . Electrical Safety First is a charity which was set up to reduce deaths and injuries caused by electrical accidents . Its website provides details of recalls of electrical equipment . <h> Food recalls <p> For food products , the Food Standards Agency website provides food alerts about food recalls . The website carries both allergy alerts and general food alerts . The allergy alerts are a must for food allergy sufferers , letting you know about foods that may contain an allergen which has not been declared on the packaging .

North Yorkshire County Council Trading Standards have the following advice to help make sure that remedial work goes ahead as smoothly as possible . <h> Do not agree to have work done by anyone who cold calls or door knocks at your property <p> Cold callers rarely give householders their contact details or provide them with details of their legal right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also tell you that work is required when it is not . If things go wrong you are unlikely to be able to contact the trader again and will have no guarantee for the work . <h> Obtain at least three quotes for any work <p> Obtaining a choice of written quotes ensures you can have time to assess and compare the price of work and can make an informed choice about which tradesperson to use . <h> Check trade body approval or certification <p> If a tradesperson claims to be a member of a trade body or approval scheme check whether this is true on the scheme or body website . There are advantages to using a trader who is a member of a trade body or approval scheme as they will have been vetted and it is likely that there will be a complaints or arbitration procedure in place in the event that anything goes wrong . <p> For certain work , such as electrical or gas work , traders must be qualified and approved as fit to do that work .

For electrical work , traders must be registered with NICEIC or ELECSA and you can check who is registered via the NICEIC website and via the ELECSA website . Always check before you engage a trader that they hold the appropriate authorisation to complete work safely and certify it to Buildings Regulations . As well as ensuring the work is safe , you will be required to have certification if you sell your home in the future . <h> Do not pay the full contract price upfront <p> Legitimate tradespeople will generally not expect to be paid anything until work is completed to your satisfaction . You may be required to pay an amount upfront if the work involves expensive parts or fittings but you should only pay the full amount once the work is completed . If work is not satisfactory , the law allows you to withhold a reasonable percentage to reflect any deficiencies in the work . <h> Speak to your insurance company <p> If you are insured , make sure you speak to your insurance company before arranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have their own list of approved contractors or will want to see quotes before they agree to pay for work . <p> We hope that everything goes well with the repairs to your home but if you do need more specific advice at any stage you can ring the Citizens Advice Consumer Helpline on 03454 04 05 06 .

They are ' all-ability ' schools and may not use academic selection as part of their admissions process . Free schools are run on a ' not-for-profit ' basis and may be set up by groups such as parents , teachers , businesses , charities etc . <h> Independent schools <p> Independent schools are privately run and charge fees to attend instead of being funded by central government . These schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for further details . If you would prefer your child to attend an independent school you should still complete a Common Application Form ( CAF ) , naming the independent school as well as any other schools you may be interested in . We will consider any preferences for a North Yorkshire school according to the order of preference however we will not co-ordinate admissions with any independent school nor offer a place there . <p> We will offer a place at a North Yorkshire school even if you have not named one on your CAF . This is because we have a duty to ensure a school place is available for every North Yorkshire child , unless you confirm in writing , prior to the national offer day , that you have accepted a place at an independent school . If you accept a place at an independent school after national offer day , please confirm , in writing , to the admissions team so the place offered to your child may be allocated to another . <h> Selective grammar schools <p> Within North Yorkshire there are 3 selective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Grammar School for Boys ( Skipton ) ; and <p> Skipton Girls ' High School ( an academy school ) . * <p> Admission into Ripon Grammar School and Ermysted 's Grammar School for Boys is based on a child 's performance in a series of tests designed to identify academic potential . You should consider carefully whether a selective grammar school is the right choice for your child and whether or not they can meet the required academic standard . Further information about Ripon Grammar School , Ermysted 's Grammar School for Boys and the selection test procedure can be found here . <p> If you would like your child to attend a grammar school in North Yorkshire you must list the school(s) on your Common Application Form . <h> Special schools <p> To attend a ' special school ' your child will need to have a final Statement of Special Educational Needs or Education Health and Care Plan .

It manages its own assets , employs its own staff and sets its own admission arrangements . <h> University technical college ( UTC ) <p> A UTC is government funded schools and open to young people aged 14 - 18 years . A UTC is designed to integrate technical , practical and academic learning and is supported by industry and a local university to deliver its curriculum .

All have foundation governors appointed to protect and develop the religious or educational character of the school .

@@23526414 @3526414/ <h> Previous consultations <p> We plan to publish a new carers strategy in the summer which focuses on the health and wellbeing of carers . It will be an all-ages strategy , aimed at supporting carers to both continue caring and to have a life of their own . <p> The strategy will last from 2017 to 2022 and has been produced by the health and wellbeing board for North Yorkshire , working on behalf of local residents . <p> Three in five of us will be a carer at some point and almost everyone will know a family member , friend or colleague who is currently a carer . <p> With the help of carers and other organisations we 've been finding out what 's working , what needs to change and how we can do that in partnership . <p> As a result of this engagement with carers and partners over the last 12 months we have proposed a number of themes for the draft strategy . These are : <p> We have a contractual commitment to review fee levels with our social care providers on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in different ways , ranging from a flat rate percentage increase to a fixed-rate uplift subject to financial review and on occasion no uplift has been agreed . We always have an obligation to take account of the market pressures and to consult with providers on fee levels . From April 2015 we have had new statutory responsibilities under the Care Act 2014 to shape and sustain our markets . <p> The position for 2017-18 is further complicated as some relevant provider lists are in the process of being renewed . <p> We are therefore consulting with social care providers to agree increases for the financial year 2017-18 and to agree a formula for increases up to 2020 . <p> Organisations who have a contract following a procurement exercise are excluded from the consultation as their contract will have agreed expectations in respect of annual uplifts . <p> A consultation on a proposal to close Ingleby Arncliffe primary school . <p> The @qwx222768 <p> A consultation on proposed partnership with Scarborough and Ryedale CCG . <p> North Yorkshire County Council and NHS Scarborough and Ryedale Clinical Commissioning Group wish to enter into a partnership agreement to encourage greater integration and planning . We have an agreed vision to provide a timely transformation towards an integrated approach to the provision of health care , public health and social care services in Ryedale and Scarborough . The parties believe that by both coordinating and integrating their planning and commissioning activities will help facilitate the best use of resources to support the local resident and patient population . This approach will be developed through the joint arrangements with an agreed work plan including the joint commissioning strategy . <p> The partnership arrangements seeks to provide for shared planning , oversight and commissioning arrangements for the people in Scarborough and Ryedale so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Maintenance of the network is arranged by a small team of officers with support from landowners , contractors and a dedicated group of countryside volunteers . <p> We have had to reduce our spending by around 35 per cent over recent years and this has affected all council services , including public rights of way . As a consequence we are now looking at ways to continue managing the public rights of way network with less money . <h> Network categorisation <p> The purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new approach to categorising the public rights of way network . Doing so will allow us to focus routine maintenance in areas where paths are agreed as being more important or better used . The category of a route will also help us to plan how we respond to defects that we find or are reported to us . <p> We will manage the network based on sections of the paths or ' links ' . We will then assign a route category as follows . <p> Each link will have a score for the key characteristic of the path . Example characteristics are safe routes to schools and paths in areas of outstanding natural beauty . <p> Each link will also have a score based on an assessment of the value placed on the link by the local community . <p> We will categorise each link based on the combination of characteristic and community value scores . <p> We will map the category banding of all routes and publish this on our website . <p> We have taken this approach because we think that : <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The inclusion of community value will help focus attention and resource onto parts of the network that will provide greatest benefit and value to local communities . <p> Measuring the value that different communities place on different routes is intended to make sure that we focus resources and effort onto paths that benefit users and local communities the most . However , it is difficult to define and measure community value , so we intend to implement our approach initially based on path characteristics alone . An important part of this consultation is to gather views over how best to measure community value in future . <p> Elected members of the county council 's executive met on 31 January 2017 and considered the outcomes of the public consultation . Following careful consideration , they agreed to publish statutory proposals to close the school from 31 August 2017 . <p> The statutory proposals were published on 16 February 2017 to run to 16 March 2017 , with a final decision being made by the executive on 28 March 2017 . <p> The statutory proposals provide four weeks for representations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The final decision was taken by the executive at their meeting on 28 March 2017 . <p> The governing body of Swainby and Potto Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School is consulting on a proposal for the creation of a single Church of England voluntary aided primary school to serve the Ingleby Arncliffe and Swainby and Potto areas . <p> It is proposed that a single Voluntary Aided Church of England primary school , serving children aged 4-11 , would be created by the retention of Ingleby Arncliffe Church of England VA Primary School and the associated technical closure of Swainby and Potto Church of England VA Primary School . The single primary school would operate on the existing Ingleby Arncliffe school site and serve the two catchment areas currently served by both Swainby and Potto and Ingleby Arncliffe Primary Schools . <p> In order to maintain the historical link between the schools and the Diocese of York , the single school would retain its status as a Voluntary Aided Church of England school .

It would be subject to a single Ofsted inspection and would receive a single budget . <p> The Governing Body has not reached the decision to initiate consultation lightly and has already considered a number of alternatives . They have reached the conclusion that bringing together the two schools would be the best way to secure the interests of current and future pupils from the schools because pupil numbers . <p> Bond End was declared an Air Quality Management Area ( AQMA ) in 2013 .

The fund will pay for modifications on buses to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide by at least 50 per cent . 22768 @qwx222768 <p> We gathered your feedback on the strategy through engagement sessions around the county with our customers , visitors and partner organisations . <p> We have reviewed all the feedback and have tried to apply the common themes that we received , including what the strategy aims to achieve , how it looks and feels , and the way it is written . <p> As a result , we have created a newer version of the customer strategy and would , once more , appreciate it if you could look at this version and give us some feedback using the survey below .

It has been a pleasure being able to engage with our customers and confirm we are on the right path . <p> We have accepted the government 's four-year financial settlement . The settlement is very challenging given that it represents the phased removal of the government 's revenue support grant by 2020 . <p> However , it also offers a degree of certainty and the opportunity for contingency planning during a period of extreme uncertainty . Given the national and global economic environment including the impact of Brexit , the offer will form part of the council 's prudent financial management and plan to maintain sensible levels of reserves as a buffer against unforeseen events . <p> We are consulting on our budget for 2017-18 and as part of that consultation would like to hear from you . <p> Our long-term plan is to increase council tax by 3.99 per cent for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will go towards adult social care . Most of this increase will be required to cover the government 's announced increase in the national living wage , the rest will be used to fund the increasing demand . In 2015-16 we supported 7,297 older people in North Yorkshire who need long-term help with their care and support ( e.g. support in dressing and eating ) . Currently over 40 per cent of our budget , some 136m , goes on adult social care . <p> The 1.99 per cent increase in council tax is more than offset by the further reduction in government grants from 59m to zero by 2020 . Without this increase there will therefore be a further 5m of savings required in 2017-18 alone . <p> More information on our budget and how we spend it is available on our spending pages . <p> The county councils executive agreed to publish statutory proposals and notices on 5 January 2017 proposing that Horton-in-Ribblesdale Primary School should close . <h> Decision <p> On 21 February , the county council 's executive considered a report containing the responses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close Horton-in-Ribblesdale Church of England ( Voluntary Aided ) Primary School from 31 August 2017 . <p> To extend the catchment area of Austwick Church of England ( Voluntary Aided ) Primary School from 1 September 2017 to serve the area currently served by Horton-in-Ribblesdale Church of England ( Voluntary Aided ) Primary School . <h> Update - appeal and decision <p> An appeal against the decision to cease to maintain Horton-in-Ribblesdale CE ( VA ) Primary School was referred to the Office of the Schools Adjudicator . <p> On 28 June 2017 the Schools Adjudicator approved the proposal that Horton-in-Ribblesdale Church of England ( Voluntary Aided ) Primary School should close from 31 August 2017 . <h> Background papers <p> We are developing a healthy weight , healthy lives strategy to address the rise in childhood and adult obesity in North Yorkshire and would like your views . <p> The most recent North Yorkshire joint strategic needs assessment has highlighted the worrying rise in childhood and adult obesity as an increasing problem across the county , particularly among the adult population , with North Yorkshire now being ranked 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To address this problem , the North Yorkshire health and wellbeing board has agreed that a healthy weight , healthy lives strategy should be developed .

These schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for further details . If you would prefer your child to attend an independent school you should still complete a Common Application Form ( CAF ) , naming the independent school as well as any other schools you may be interested in . We will consider any preferences for a North Yorkshire school according to the order of preference however we will not co-ordinate admissions with any independent school nor offer a place there . <p> We will offer a place at a North Yorkshire school even if you have not named one on your CAF . This is because we have a duty to ensure a school place is available for every North Yorkshire child , unless you confirm in writing , prior to the national offer day , that you have accepted a place at an independent school . If you accept a place at an independent school after national offer day , please confirm , in writing , to the admissions team so the place offered to your child may be allocated to another . <h> Selective grammar schools <p> Within North Yorkshire there are 3 selective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Grammar School for Boys ( Skipton ) ; and <p> Skipton Girls ' High School ( an academy school ) . * <p> Admission into Ripon Grammar School and Ermysted 's Grammar School for Boys is based on a child 's performance in a series of tests designed to identify academic potential . You should consider carefully whether a selective grammar school is the right choice for your child and whether or not they can meet the required academic standard .

@@23526419 @3526419/ <h> Previous consultations <p> We plan to publish a new carers strategy in the summer which focuses on the health and wellbeing of carers . It will be an all-ages strategy , aimed at supporting carers to both continue caring and to have a life of their own . <p> The strategy will last from 2017 to 2022 and has been produced by the health and wellbeing board for North Yorkshire , working on behalf of local residents . <p> Three in five of us will be a carer at some point and almost everyone will know a family member , friend or colleague who is currently a carer . <p> With the help of carers and other organisations we 've been finding out what 's working , what needs to change and how we can do that in partnership . <p> As a result of this engagement with carers and partners over the last 12 months we have proposed a number of themes for the draft strategy .

The parties believe that by both coordinating and integrating their planning and commissioning activities will help facilitate the best use of resources to support the local resident and patient population .

Maintenance of the network is arranged by a small team of officers with support from landowners , contractors and a dedicated group of countryside volunteers . <p> We have had to reduce our spending by around 35 per cent over recent years and this has affected all council services , including public rights of way . As a consequence we are now looking at ways to continue managing the public rights of way network with less money . <h> Network categorisation <p> The purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new approach to categorising the public rights of way network . Doing so will allow us to focus routine maintenance in areas where paths are agreed as being more important or better used . The category of a route will also help us to plan how we respond to defects that we find or are reported to us . <p> We will manage the network based on sections of the paths or ' links ' . We will then assign a route category as follows . <p> Each link will have a score for the key characteristic of the path . Example characteristics are safe routes to schools and paths in areas of outstanding natural beauty . <p> Each link will also have a score based on an assessment of the value placed on the link by the local community . <p> We will categorise each link based on the combination of characteristic and community value scores . <p> We will map the category banding of all routes and publish this on our website . <p> We have taken this approach because we think that : <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The inclusion of community value will help focus attention and resource onto parts of the network that will provide greatest benefit and value to local communities . <p> Measuring the value that different communities place on different routes is intended to make sure that we focus resources and effort onto paths that benefit users and local communities the most . However , it is difficult to define and measure community value , so we intend to implement our approach initially based on path characteristics alone . An important part of this consultation is to gather views over how best to measure community value in future . <p> Elected members of the county council 's executive met on 31 January 2017 and considered the outcomes of the public consultation . Following careful consideration , they agreed to publish statutory proposals to close the school from 31 August 2017 . <p> The statutory proposals were published on 16 February 2017 to run to 16 March 2017 , with a final decision being made by the executive on 28 March 2017 . <p> The statutory proposals provide four weeks for representations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The final decision was taken by the executive at their meeting on 28 March 2017 . <p> The governing body of Swainby and Potto Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School is consulting on a proposal for the creation of a single Church of England voluntary aided primary school to serve the Ingleby Arncliffe and Swainby and Potto areas . <p> It is proposed that a single Voluntary Aided Church of England primary school , serving children aged 4-11 , would be created by the retention of Ingleby Arncliffe Church of England VA Primary School and the associated technical closure of Swainby and Potto Church of England VA Primary School . The single primary school would operate on the existing Ingleby Arncliffe school site and serve the two catchment areas currently served by both Swainby and Potto and Ingleby Arncliffe Primary Schools . <p> In order to maintain the historical link between the schools and the Diocese of York , the single school would retain its status as a Voluntary Aided Church of England school .

It would be subject to a single Ofsted inspection and would receive a single budget . <p> The Governing Body has not reached the decision to initiate consultation lightly and has already considered a number of alternatives . They have reached the conclusion that bringing together the two schools would be the best way to secure the interests of current and future pupils from the schools because pupil numbers . <p> Bond End was declared an Air Quality Management Area ( AQMA ) in 2013 .

The fund will pay for modifications on buses to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide by at least 50 per cent . 22768 @qwx222768 <p> We gathered your feedback on the strategy through engagement sessions around the county with our customers , visitors and partner organisations . <p> We have reviewed all the feedback and have tried to apply the common themes that we received , including what the strategy aims to achieve , how it looks and feels , and the way it is written . <p> As a result , we have created a newer version of the customer strategy and would , once more , appreciate it if you could look at this version and give us some feedback using the survey below .

It has been a pleasure being able to engage with our customers and confirm we are on the right path . <p> We have accepted the government 's four-year financial settlement . The settlement is very challenging given that it represents the phased removal of the government 's revenue support grant by 2020 . <p> However , it also offers a degree of certainty and the opportunity for contingency planning during a period of extreme uncertainty . Given the national and global economic environment including the impact of Brexit , the offer will form part of the council 's prudent financial management and plan to maintain sensible levels of reserves as a buffer against unforeseen events . <p> We are consulting on our budget for 2017-18 and as part of that consultation would like to hear from you . <p> Our long-term plan is to increase council tax by 3.99 per cent for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will go towards adult social care . Most of this increase will be required to cover the government 's announced increase in the national living wage , the rest will be used to fund the increasing demand . In 2015-16 we supported 7,297 older people in North Yorkshire who need long-term help with their care and support ( e.g. support in dressing and eating ) . Currently over 40 per cent of our budget , some 136m , goes on adult social care . <p> The 1.99 per cent increase in council tax is more than offset by the further reduction in government grants from 59m to zero by 2020 .

@@23526422 @3526422/ <h> Previous consultations <p> We plan to publish a new carers strategy in the summer which focuses on the health and wellbeing of carers . It will be an all-ages strategy , aimed at supporting carers to both continue caring and to have a life of their own . <p> The strategy will last from 2017 to 2022 and has been produced by the health and wellbeing board for North Yorkshire , working on behalf of local residents . <p> Three in five of us will be a carer at some point and almost everyone will know a family member , friend or colleague who is currently a carer . <p> With the help of carers and other organisations we 've been finding out what 's working , what needs to change and how we can do that in partnership . <p> As a result of this engagement with carers and partners over the last 12 months we have proposed a number of themes for the draft strategy . These are : <p> We have a contractual commitment to review fee levels with our social care providers on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in different ways , ranging from a flat rate percentage increase to a fixed-rate uplift subject to financial review and on occasion no uplift has been agreed . We always have an obligation to take account of the market pressures and to consult with providers on fee levels . From April 2015 we have had new statutory responsibilities under the Care Act 2014 to shape and sustain our markets . <p> The position for 2017-18 is further complicated as some relevant provider lists are in the process of being renewed . <p> We are therefore consulting with social care providers to agree increases for the financial year 2017-18 and to agree a formula for increases up to 2020 . <p> Organisations who have a contract following a procurement exercise are excluded from the consultation as their contract will have agreed expectations in respect of annual uplifts . <p> A consultation on a proposal to close Ingleby Arncliffe primary school . <p> The @qwx222768 <p> A consultation on proposed partnership with Scarborough and Ryedale CCG . <p> North Yorkshire County Council and NHS Scarborough and Ryedale Clinical Commissioning Group wish to enter into a partnership agreement to encourage greater integration and planning . We have an agreed vision to provide a timely transformation towards an integrated approach to the provision of health care , public health and social care services in Ryedale and Scarborough . The parties believe that by both coordinating and integrating their planning and commissioning activities will help facilitate the best use of resources to support the local resident and patient population . This approach will be developed through the joint arrangements with an agreed work plan including the joint commissioning strategy . <p> The partnership arrangements seeks to provide for shared planning , oversight and commissioning arrangements for the people in Scarborough and Ryedale so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Maintenance of the network is arranged by a small team of officers with support from landowners , contractors and a dedicated group of countryside volunteers . <p> We have had to reduce our spending by around 35 per cent over recent years and this has affected all council services , including public rights of way . As a consequence we are now looking at ways to continue managing the public rights of way network with less money . <h> Network categorisation <p> The purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new approach to categorising the public rights of way network . Doing so will allow us to focus routine maintenance in areas where paths are agreed as being more important or better used . The category of a route will also help us to plan how we respond to defects that we find or are reported to us . <p> We will manage the network based on sections of the paths or ' links ' . We will then assign a route category as follows . <p> Each link will have a score for the key characteristic of the path . Example characteristics are safe routes to schools and paths in areas of outstanding natural beauty . <p> Each link will also have a score based on an assessment of the value placed on the link by the local community . <p> We will categorise each link based on the combination of characteristic and community value scores . <p> We will map the category banding of all routes and publish this on our website . <p> We have taken this approach because we think that : <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The inclusion of community value will help focus attention and resource onto parts of the network that will provide greatest benefit and value to local communities . <p> Measuring the value that different communities place on different routes is intended to make sure that we focus resources and effort onto paths that benefit users and local communities the most . However , it is difficult to define and measure community value , so we intend to implement our approach initially based on path characteristics alone . An important part of this consultation is to gather views over how best to measure community value in future . <p> Elected members of the county council 's executive met on 31 January 2017 and considered the outcomes of the public consultation . Following careful consideration , they agreed to publish statutory proposals to close the school from 31 August 2017 . <p> The statutory proposals were published on 16 February 2017 to run to 16 March 2017 , with a final decision being made by the executive on 28 March 2017 . <p> The statutory proposals provide four weeks for representations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The final decision was taken by the executive at their meeting on 28 March 2017 . <p> The governing body of Swainby and Potto Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School is consulting on a proposal for the creation of a single Church of England voluntary aided primary school to serve the Ingleby Arncliffe and Swainby and Potto areas . <p> It is proposed that a single Voluntary Aided Church of England primary school , serving children aged 4-11 , would be created by the retention of Ingleby Arncliffe Church of England VA Primary School and the associated technical closure of Swainby and Potto Church of England VA Primary School . The single primary school would operate on the existing Ingleby Arncliffe school site and serve the two catchment areas currently served by both Swainby and Potto and Ingleby Arncliffe Primary Schools . <p> In order to maintain the historical link between the schools and the Diocese of York , the single school would retain its status as a Voluntary Aided Church of England school . This would allow the Church to continue to appoint foundation governors to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The proposed name for the single school is the " Mount Grace Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School " . <p> This change would take place from 31 August 2017 when Swainby and Potto would close as a separate school . <p> The amalgamated school would have a single governing body , head teacher and staff group . It would be subject to a single Ofsted inspection and would receive a single budget . <p> The Governing Body has not reached the decision to initiate consultation lightly and has already considered a number of alternatives . They have reached the conclusion that bringing together the two schools would be the best way to secure the interests of current and future pupils from the schools because pupil numbers . <p> Bond End was declared an Air Quality Management Area ( AQMA ) in 2013 .

The fund will pay for modifications on buses to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide by at least 50 per cent . 22768 @qwx222768 <p> We gathered your feedback on the strategy through engagement sessions around the county with our customers , visitors and partner organisations . <p> We have reviewed all the feedback and have tried to apply the common themes that we received , including what the strategy aims to achieve , how it looks and feels , and the way it is written . <p> As a result , we have created a newer version of the customer strategy and would , once more , appreciate it if you could look at this version and give us some feedback using the survey below .

It has been a pleasure being able to engage with our customers and confirm we are on the right path . <p> We have accepted the government 's four-year financial settlement . The settlement is very challenging given that it represents the phased removal of the government 's revenue support grant by 2020 . <p> However , it also offers a degree of certainty and the opportunity for contingency planning during a period of extreme uncertainty . Given the national and global economic environment including the impact of Brexit , the offer will form part of the council 's prudent financial management and plan to maintain sensible levels of reserves as a buffer against unforeseen events . <p> We are consulting on our budget for 2017-18 and as part of that consultation would like to hear from you . <p> Our long-term plan is to increase council tax by 3.99 per cent for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will go towards adult social care .

You will need to pinpoint the issue on a map and will be given the opportunity to provide additional information . <p> If a pothole or road condition issue is causing an immediate danger to the safety of road users , it is classified as an emergency . You should contact us by telephone to report an emergency rather than using our online form . Our opening hours are Monday to Friday 8am - 5.30pm . Dial 999 outside office hours for our emergency service . <p> Motorways and trunk roads such as the A19 ( north of Thirsk ) , A66 and A64 are not the responsibility of the council . For these roads , you should report potholes or road condition issues to Highways England by email : **26;2015;TOOLONG or by telephone on 0300 123 5000 . <p> You can tell us about a potholes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' my account ' section of the website . ' My account ' also allows you to view details of services you have previously applied , booked and paid for . You can also see updates on their progress . <p> In wet or icy conditions a permanent repair would n't actually work ; the hot bitumen would instantly cool before adequate compaction could be achieved and the ice or water would also prevent the repair bonding to the road . <p> Permanent repairs take more time and , depending on their location , may require a road closure or temporary traffic lights to be brought in . This requires more equipment , staff and planning , particularly at times when the resource is n't available immediately - perhaps because highway staff are on winter gritting duty and have more urgent potholes to fix . <p> Potholes , or a series of them , may be symptomatic of a more general , underlying problem on the stretch of road . This requires further investigation and potential resurfacing of an entire road section . This is a larger job and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the repair of potholes based on the level of risk to road users . <p> If a pothole has been inspected and assessed as needing attention , it will be added to a programme of work . We prioritise their repair based on a number of factors including the depth , size and location of the pothole on the road ; the volume of traffic ; and the speed of the road . <p> If the reported pothole does need attention but does not pose an immediate hazard to the road user , it will be fixed along with a number of other potholes in the same vicinity as part of an overall programme of work . It is more cost effective to repair defects in this manner . Contractors are required to complete their work within 90 days of it being issued however this target is dependant of weather conditions and changing priorities . <p> We check the state of current known defects during monthly safety inspections of main roads to ensure that they have not worsened to the point where they now pose a hazard to road users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low traffic roads where further erosion is likely to be slower due to the reduced traffic volumes . <p> Funds from vehicle excise duty ( VED ) and fuel do n't come directly to us , they go to central government . Each year , we receive an allocation of funds from central government which we must decide how to use . <p> We face the following challenges : <p> Overall , the indicative settlement from the government for transport for the next four years equates to an approximate 12 per cent cut in cash terms , and an approximate 15 per cent cut in real terms taking into account inflation ; <p> The previous two exceptionally severe winters resulted in approximately 36million worth of accelerated damage to the highway , providing significant additional budget pressures . This impact has been recognised and we have received an extra 6.632million this year to repair the damage . A programme of schemes has already been developed ; and <p> It 's thought that the nation as a whole has a 1billion backlog of road repairs ; in North Yorkshire road maintenance needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the required cuts are significant we should not lose sight of the fact that for the next four years we still expect to have between 54million and 57million available each year to deliver the highways service . Although the network we manage is vast ( over 5,800 miles of roads , 2,600 miles of footways and 2,000 bridges ) we still aim to deliver a high quality service . This covers all repair and improvement work , not just the repair of potholes . <p> When a pothole is identified on an inspection or is otherwise reported to us , any necessary repairs are carried out or they are made safe . <p> If the pothole causes you to suffer an injury or damage to your property , the Highways Act makes it clear there is no automatic right to compensation and provides councils with a defence to claims which we are obliged to use . <p> It is important to understand the circumstances in which we can be held responsible . As the highway authority , we have a duty to ' maintain ' the highway . The law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are excluded , for example it does not include keeping a road free of mud . <p> If you think the council has failed to maintain the highway , then you will have to prove this . You will have to show that : <p> the highway in question has not been maintained appropriately with regard to its importance and use and was therefore dangerous ; and <p> this was the direct cause of the incident and that you have suffered a loss as a result . <p> Even if you can prove these things , the law gives a defence to the highway authority , and it will not have to compensate you if it can demonstrate that the council took all reasonable steps to ensure that the highway was safe . This means that all inspections and repairs had been carried out as planned or reported . Where we have fulfilled our duty to inspect and repair , yet were unaware of a defect related to your incident , usually where it has appeared since the last inspection and we have not been notified by the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See the highway claims page for more details , including how to make a claim . <p> If you wish to report a pothole or other highway fault , we encourage you to do so via our online reporting system . <p> Reports made on our website are cheaper for the council to process and give you a speedier resolution where we are able to repair the fault . <p> However , there are various third party websites on which people can log reports of potholes . We process reports received from these sites , but they can take up more staff time and do not always provide all the information we require . <p> If you use our system <p> You can pinpoint a pothole on a map to report its exact location . <p> Reports go straight to the highway inspector to investigate without needing to go through any other staff . <p> You can log in to track the progress of your pothole report and view any updates from the highways inspector . <p> It saves the council money , because reports go straight into our system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you use other third party websites <p> Issues are sent to us by email and go to our customer service team . As we receive hundreds of emails it can take time to get to your report and log it in our system . Using our website ensures your report is logged much faster . <p> We always acknowledge receipt of pothole reports from third party websites . However , the sites do not always reflect this . <p> Third party websites do not always give us the minimum level of information we need to investigate and repair a pothole ; reports can be vague and we do not have the resources to analyse miles of road to find a single fault . <p> A benefit often cited by third party sites is that you can see reports other people have made and monitor the performance of your council in filling potholes . However , as there are several third party sites , a pothole you report may already have been reported elsewhere , but you would not see this . <p> Third party sites display a list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled . However , these will be inaccurate unless customers return to update their report to say a fault has been rectified , or we make a special effort to mark reports as rectified , at a cost of staff time .

Maintenance of the network is arranged by a small team of officers with support from landowners , contractors and a dedicated group of countryside volunteers . <p> We have had to reduce our spending by around 35 per cent over recent years and this has affected all council services , including public rights of way .

We will then assign a route category as follows . <p> Each link will have a score for the key characteristic of the path . Example characteristics are safe routes to schools and paths in areas of outstanding natural beauty . <p> Each link will also have a score based on an assessment of the value placed on the link by the local community . <p> We will categorise each link based on the combination of characteristic and community value scores . <p> We will map the category banding of all routes and publish this on our website . <p> We have taken this approach because we think that : <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The inclusion of community value will help focus attention and resource onto parts of the network that will provide greatest benefit and value to local communities . <p> Measuring the value that different communities place on different routes is intended to make sure that we focus resources and effort onto paths that benefit users and local communities the most . However , it is difficult to define and measure community value , so we intend to implement our approach initially based on path characteristics alone . An important part of this consultation is to gather views over how best to measure community value in future . <p> Elected members of the county council 's executive met on 31 January 2017 and considered the outcomes of the public consultation . Following careful consideration , they agreed to publish statutory proposals to close the school from 31 August 2017 . <p> The statutory proposals were published on 16 February 2017 to run to 16 March 2017 , with a final decision being made by the executive on 28 March 2017 . <p> The statutory proposals provide four weeks for representations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The settlement is very challenging given that it represents the phased removal of the government 's revenue support grant by 2020 . <p> However , it also offers a degree of certainty and the opportunity for contingency planning during a period of extreme uncertainty . Given the national and global economic environment including the impact of Brexit , the offer will form part of the council 's prudent financial management and plan to maintain sensible levels of reserves as a buffer against unforeseen events . <p> We are consulting on our budget for 2017-18 and as part of that consultation would like to hear from you . <p> Our long-term plan is to increase council tax by 3.99 per cent for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will go towards adult social care .

Currently over 40 per cent of our budget , some 136m , goes on adult social care . <p> The 1.99 per cent increase in council tax is more than offset by the further reduction in government grants from 59m to zero by 2020 .

We will consider any preferences for a North Yorkshire school according to the order of preference however we will not co-ordinate admissions with any independent school nor offer a place there . <p> We will offer a place at a North Yorkshire school even if you have not named one on your CAF . This is because we have a duty to ensure a school place is available for every North Yorkshire child , unless you confirm in writing , prior to the national offer day , that you have accepted a place at an independent school .

@@23526445 @3526445/ <h> Previous consultations <p> We plan to publish a new carers strategy in the summer which focuses on the health and wellbeing of carers . It will be an all-ages strategy , aimed at supporting carers to both continue caring and to have a life of their own . <p> The strategy will last from 2017 to 2022 and has been produced by the health and wellbeing board for North Yorkshire , working on behalf of local residents . <p> Three in five of us will be a carer at some point and almost everyone will know a family member , friend or colleague who is currently a carer . <p> With the help of carers and other organisations we 've been finding out what 's working , what needs to change and how we can do that in partnership . <p> As a result of this engagement with carers and partners over the last 12 months we have proposed a number of themes for the draft strategy .

The parties believe that by both coordinating and integrating their planning and commissioning activities will help facilitate the best use of resources to support the local resident and patient population .

Maintenance of the network is arranged by a small team of officers with support from landowners , contractors and a dedicated group of countryside volunteers . <p> We have had to reduce our spending by around 35 per cent over recent years and this has affected all council services , including public rights of way . As a consequence we are now looking at ways to continue managing the public rights of way network with less money . <h> Network categorisation <p> The purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new approach to categorising the public rights of way network . Doing so will allow us to focus routine maintenance in areas where paths are agreed as being more important or better used . The category of a route will also help us to plan how we respond to defects that we find or are reported to us . <p> We will manage the network based on sections of the paths or ' links ' . We will then assign a route category as follows . <p> Each link will have a score for the key characteristic of the path . Example characteristics are safe routes to schools and paths in areas of outstanding natural beauty . <p> Each link will also have a score based on an assessment of the value placed on the link by the local community . <p> We will categorise each link based on the combination of characteristic and community value scores . <p> We will map the category banding of all routes and publish this on our website . <p> We have taken this approach because we think that : <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The inclusion of community value will help focus attention and resource onto parts of the network that will provide greatest benefit and value to local communities . <p> Measuring the value that different communities place on different routes is intended to make sure that we focus resources and effort onto paths that benefit users and local communities the most . However , it is difficult to define and measure community value , so we intend to implement our approach initially based on path characteristics alone . An important part of this consultation is to gather views over how best to measure community value in future . <p> Elected members of the county council 's executive met on 31 January 2017 and considered the outcomes of the public consultation . Following careful consideration , they agreed to publish statutory proposals to close the school from 31 August 2017 . <p> The statutory proposals were published on 16 February 2017 to run to 16 March 2017 , with a final decision being made by the executive on 28 March 2017 . <p> The statutory proposals provide four weeks for representations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The single primary school would operate on the existing Ingleby Arncliffe school site and serve the two catchment areas currently served by both Swainby and Potto and Ingleby Arncliffe Primary Schools . <p> In order to maintain the historical link between the schools and the Diocese of York , the single school would retain its status as a Voluntary Aided Church of England school .

It would be subject to a single Ofsted inspection and would receive a single budget . <p> The Governing Body has not reached the decision to initiate consultation lightly and has already considered a number of alternatives .

It has been a pleasure being able to engage with our customers and confirm we are on the right path . <p> We have accepted the government 's four-year financial settlement . The settlement is very challenging given that it represents the phased removal of the government 's revenue support grant by 2020 . <p> However , it also offers a degree of certainty and the opportunity for contingency planning during a period of extreme uncertainty . Given the national and global economic environment including the impact of Brexit , the offer will form part of the council 's prudent financial management and plan to maintain sensible levels of reserves as a buffer against unforeseen events . <p> We are consulting on our budget for 2017-18 and as part of that consultation would like to hear from you . <p> Our long-term plan is to increase council tax by 3.99 per cent for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will go towards adult social care . Most of this increase will be required to cover the government 's announced increase in the national living wage , the rest will be used to fund the increasing demand . In 2015-16 we supported 7,297 older people in North Yorkshire who need long-term help with their care and support ( e.g. support in dressing and eating ) . Currently over 40 per cent of our budget , some 136m , goes on adult social care . <p> The 1.99 per cent increase in council tax is more than offset by the further reduction in government grants from 59m to zero by 2020 .

Maintenance of the network is arranged by a small team of officers with support from landowners , contractors and a dedicated group of countryside volunteers . <p> We have had to reduce our spending by around 35 per cent over recent years and this has affected all council services , including public rights of way . As a consequence we are now looking at ways to continue managing the public rights of way network with less money . <h> Network categorisation <p> The purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new approach to categorising the public rights of way network .

We will then assign a route category as follows . <p> Each link will have a score for the key characteristic of the path . Example characteristics are safe routes to schools and paths in areas of outstanding natural beauty . <p> Each link will also have a score based on an assessment of the value placed on the link by the local community . <p> We will categorise each link based on the combination of characteristic and community value scores . <p> We will map the category banding of all routes and publish this on our website . <p> We have taken this approach because we think that : <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The inclusion of community value will help focus attention and resource onto parts of the network that will provide greatest benefit and value to local communities . <p> Measuring the value that different communities place on different routes is intended to make sure that we focus resources and effort onto paths that benefit users and local communities the most . However , it is difficult to define and measure community value , so we intend to implement our approach initially based on path characteristics alone . An important part of this consultation is to gather views over how best to measure community value in future . <p> Elected members of the county council 's executive met on 31 January 2017 and considered the outcomes of the public consultation . Following careful consideration , they agreed to publish statutory proposals to close the school from 31 August 2017 . <p> The statutory proposals were published on 16 February 2017 to run to 16 March 2017 , with a final decision being made by the executive on 28 March 2017 . <p> The statutory proposals provide four weeks for representations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The single primary school would operate on the existing Ingleby Arncliffe school site and serve the two catchment areas currently served by both Swainby and Potto and Ingleby Arncliffe Primary Schools . <p> In order to maintain the historical link between the schools and the Diocese of York , the single school would retain its status as a Voluntary Aided Church of England school .

It would be subject to a single Ofsted inspection and would receive a single budget . <p> The Governing Body has not reached the decision to initiate consultation lightly and has already considered a number of alternatives .

The settlement is very challenging given that it represents the phased removal of the government 's revenue support grant by 2020 . <p> However , it also offers a degree of certainty and the opportunity for contingency planning during a period of extreme uncertainty . Given the national and global economic environment including the impact of Brexit , the offer will form part of the council 's prudent financial management and plan to maintain sensible levels of reserves as a buffer against unforeseen events . <p> We are consulting on our budget for 2017-18 and as part of that consultation would like to hear from you . <p> Our long-term plan is to increase council tax by 3.99 per cent for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will go towards adult social care .

Currently over 40 per cent of our budget , some 136m , goes on adult social care . <p> The 1.99 per cent increase in council tax is more than offset by the further reduction in government grants from 59m to zero by 2020 . Without this increase there will therefore be a further 5m of savings required in 2017-18 alone . <p> More information on our budget and how we spend it is available on our spending pages . <p> The county councils executive agreed to publish statutory proposals and notices on 5 January 2017 proposing that Horton-in-Ribblesdale Primary School should close . <h> Decision <p> On 21 February , the county council 's executive considered a report containing the responses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close Horton-in-Ribblesdale Church of England ( Voluntary Aided ) Primary School from 31 August 2017 . <p> To extend the catchment area of Austwick Church of England ( Voluntary Aided ) Primary School from 1 September 2017 to serve the area currently served by Horton-in-Ribblesdale Church of England ( Voluntary Aided ) Primary School . <h> Update - appeal and decision <p> An appeal against the decision to cease to maintain Horton-in-Ribblesdale CE ( VA ) Primary School was referred to the Office of the Schools Adjudicator . <p> On 28 June 2017 the Schools Adjudicator approved the proposal that Horton-in-Ribblesdale Church of England ( Voluntary Aided ) Primary School should close from 31 August 2017 . <h> Background papers <p> We are developing a healthy weight , healthy lives strategy to address the rise in childhood and adult obesity in North Yorkshire and would like your views . <p> The most recent North Yorkshire joint strategic needs assessment has highlighted the worrying rise in childhood and adult obesity as an increasing problem across the county , particularly among the adult population , with North Yorkshire now being ranked 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To address this problem , the North Yorkshire health and wellbeing board has agreed that a healthy weight , healthy lives strategy should be developed .

You could ask the Job Centre to advertise for you - they have their own process which will help you to stay safe or you can perhaps use a mail box number ; <p> Make sure you ask for two written job references from the people you interview and follow them up ; <p> When you interview people do it away from your home address if you can and have someone with you to support you ; <p> You must comply with employment legislation and we strongly advise you have support to do this ; and <p> When the personal assistant starts working with you it is advised that you arrange for a friend parent or someone you trust to spend some time with you when your personal assistant first starts work . <p> If you still choose to recruit staff without this help please talk to your social care co-ordinator about it so that the direct payment support service can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can speak with a safeguarding officer who will give you advice . <p> If you choose to use an agency the law says that care agencies must be registered with the Care Quality Commission . Please discuss this with a direct payments advisor who will advise you how to do this . We strongly advise that you only use an agency that is registered . <p> You may choose to employ your own personal assistant . If you do , the direct payments support service can give you as much support as you need to help you use direct payments . We specialise in this advice and can provide support and information on all aspects of direct payments and how to be a good employer . <p> We can also keep you up to date with changes in employment legislation and developments within independent living that may be of benefit to you when choosing to use your own staff . We strongly recommend that you use the support of the service when using your direct payment to employ personal assistants . <p> Should you choose not to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-ordinator who is supporting you . They will provide you with a factsheet pack to give you some guidance on being a good employer and how to keep safe and use direct payments . <p> We strongly recommend that if you choose to use a personal assistant to provide your support , that you employ the staff and not use people who offer a service as self-employed personal assistants . <p> When you choose to employ people you take on significant responsibilities . You must think about all the aspects of employing your own staff to ensure you are a good employer . <h> Employed personal assistants <p> If you employ staff this means that you become an employer . If you become an employer you must register with . There are a number of things you must ensure you have in place when employing staff : <p> We can support you with all this and make employing staff easier for you . When you recruit your own staff you may have to apply a selection process that involves advertising and interviewing staff . We can help you to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make use of this support , we advise that you follow a number of steps to ensure you keep safe . You must also inform us that you will not be using the direct payments support service . <p> Some things that you will be responsible for when recruiting personal assistants : <p> Advertising/job description/job specification ; <p> Short listing and interviewing your staff ; <p> Job references , appointing staff ; <p> Criminal records check ; <p> Employing people legally ; and <p> Employer 's liability insurance . <p> The direct payments support service can provide all or part of this support . <h> Self-employed <p> Some people will tell you that they are self-employed ; however , it is the responsibility of the person who engages a personal assistant to operate PAYE and to account for National Insurance Contributions ( NIC ) unless the personal assistant is engaged through an agency . <p> You can find guidance on employment status on the website but the quickest way of getting HMRC 's view if a personal assistant is employed or self-employed is to use their employment status indicator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status indicator tool and are unsure of the personal assistant 's employment status you can telephone the HMRC status customer service team on 0300 052 7450 or you can contact your direct payments advisor . <p> If the personal assistant is recognised as self-employed by HMRC you will not become the employer . They must provide you with insurance cover and they can choose if and when they work for you . You must decide if this will work for you . You should always ask for references from other people they have worked for . <p> We can provide you with support to ensure you keep safe when using self-employed personal assistants . However , we strongly recommend that you do not use people who are self-employed to support you as a personal assistant . <p> You must complete these checks before anyone starts working for you . You can offer them employment once the checks are completed and you are satisfied they can work in the United Kingdom . You must not employ anyone who is not legally able to work in the United Kingdom . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be straightforward . HM Revenue &amp; Customs have advised they would consider almost all personal assistants to be employed rather than self-employed for tax purposes . We can provide you with further advice before proceeding with this option . <p> If you use a registered domiciliary agency this law does not apply to you . We recommend that you ask the agency if they carry out these employment checks . <p> As an employer you will need to be aware that your personal assistant is entitled to annual leave . It is advisable that you check the current entitlement and make sure you keep up to date with changes ; and <p> A number of new employer duties have been introduced that will give personal assistants access to pension provision : <p> From October 2012 under the Provisions of Pensions Act 2008 as an employer you may be subject to the automatic enrolment duty and will be required to automatically enrol your personal assistants into a pension scheme ; <p> A key requirement is to automatically enrol certain workers , known as eligible jobholders , into a pension scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme ' . We can provide you with information on the conditions to be an automatic enrolment scheme . However , automatic enrolment is only one of the duties ; and <p> As an employer compliance with the new employer duties and safeguards is compulsory . If you fail to comply with your employer duties , HM Revenue &amp; Customs may take enforcement action and issue a notice and/or a penalty . <p> We strongly recommend that you seek advice from the direct payment support service or another organisation specialising in employment . We can help you with any of the requirements above for free . <p> You may want to use a home care ( sometimes known as domiciliary care ) agency to provide your care . If you choose to use an agency the staff who will work with you will usually be employed by the agency . In this case you will not be the employer and the agency will be responsible for managing the staff and will pay their wages . <p> You will still maintain choice and control as you will make arrangements directly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where your support will be provided . <p> You will pay the agency invoice when you receive it from your direct payments bank account . Always check that you have discussed all of your arrangements with the agency and have an agreement in writing . Ensure that the agency has given you a breakdown of all their costs in writing . You do not want to have any unexpected costs , such as additional charges for mileage , bank holidays etc. that you have not previously agreed to pay . <p> Sometimes the agency may charge an hourly rate which is more than the direct payment hourly rate paid to you . It is likely you will have to pay the difference from your own personal funds . We will advise you to discuss any additional costs with your social care co-ordinator when your direct payments are arranged . <p> Agencies providing personal care are required by law to be registered with the Care Quality Commission . You can ask the agency staff to show you details of its registration . We can also provide support with making these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Before you decide to buy a service from a particular agency we recommend that you ask the agency : <p> About their registration with the Care Quality Commission ; <p> To see a copy of their insurance policy ; <p> If all their staff have had a disclosure and barring service check ; <p> How it manages its staff and how often someone will come and check you are happy with its service ; <p> If they employ the staff and meet all their tax and national insurance payments ; <p> How they would deal with any complaint you may have with the agency 's service ; <p> How they arrange for staff cover during holiday time or through absence due to sickness and if a member of the agency staff will discuss this with you when cover for regular staff needs to be made ; <p> What training they provide for their staff and what qualifications and experience do they have ; <p> How you can you tell them if you are not happy with their service ; <p> If they carry out a risk assessment for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies of the hours the staff work so that you can pay the correct amount ; and <p> How much it will cost you to use their service and how to pay the money to them . <p> Once you have been working with individual members of staff for some time you may think you could employ them direct as a personal assistant and not use the agency . <p> We strongly recommend that you talk to us before you do this . Some agency agreements allow you to employ their staff directly but may charge you a fee as part of their conditions for providing the service for you . If you want to do this please contact the direct payment support service on 0845 034 9410 . <p> We have only given you a few suggestions of the type of questions you may want to ask . Please think about the information you want and what questions you need to ask the agency to help you to choose the right agency for you . <p> If the agency tells you they will not be able to continue providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . <p> There are certain insurance considerations you should take into account when employing people using a direct payment . We can provide support and guidance to ensure you have all the insurance cover you will need . <h> Employed personal assistants <p> You are legally required as a person who employs staff to have insurance . We can provide support for you to do this . <p> Accidents can happen in a number of ways , for example the personal assistant may trip , fall or be involved in a car accident . It could be that the personal assistant thinks you as the employer is to blame for this and may hold you responsible . <p> Sometimes employer 's liability insurance and public liability Insurance can be included in a comprehensive household policy but most policies do n't . You must check with your own insurance company and not assume that it does for these purposes . <p> This insurance must be in place before your personal assistant can start work : <p> Employer liability insurance <p> If your employee is injured whilst working for you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover legal costs and compensation . By law most employers must have employer 's liability insurance . <p> Public liability insurance <p> This will insure you against any damages or injury caused to someone else by you or your personal assistant while working for you . <p> We will fund the cost of this insurance as part of your direct payment . We do not recommend who you use to provide your insurance cover but we will provide you information on where to go . <p> We advise you take out a policy that covers you in the event that your personal assistant takes you to an industrial tribunal or you need to make someone redundant . There are terms and conditions you must adhere to and these will be explained by the insurance company . <h> Self-employed personal assistants <p> It is extremely unlikely that HM Revenue &amp; Customs would consider anyone who works as a personal assistant in your home as self-employed , but if you have had this confirmed ( see the employing people legally page for details ) it is the responsibility of the personal assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer their services . You must ask to see a copy of the policy before you agree they can provide you with their service . You would not pay for the insurance for someone who is self-employed . <h> Agency <p> It is the responsibility of the agency to have the correct insurance cover before offering their services . You must ask to see a copy of this before buying their service with your direct payment . <h> Using a vehicle <p> If your personal assistant is providing transport for you in their own vehicle they will need to ensure they take out the appropriate insurance cover . You must advise the personal assistant to contact their insurance company and request business cover and show you a copy . <p> If the personal assistant is driving your vehicle you must ensure they are added onto your insurance cover . <h> What are direct payments ? <p> If you are eligible for social care support from us then you can choose to have direct payments so that you can organise and buy services yourself instead of the council arranging services for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carers ' services . <h> Why would I want direct payments ? <p> Direct payments allow you to make more of the decisions that affect your life . You can decide how your support needs are met . You can make arrangements directly so that any staff you employ report directly to you . If you use an agency , the agency deals with you , not the council . <h> How could I get direct payments ? <p> To get direct payments as a carer you need first to have a carer 's needs assessment . You can request an assessment by contacting us or talking to your doctor , health visitor , district nurse or community psychiatric nurse as they could make a referral on your behalf if you would like them to . <p> If the person you care for is in hospital , speak to a nurse and ask to be put in touch with a hospital social worker . If you are eligible for support because of all you do as a carer your assessor will explain what the options are - this will include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you already receive carers ' services arranged by us and want to talk about having direct payments instead please contact us on 0845 034 9410 . Direct payments are one of many options available to you . We will explain what these are and you can then decide what will work best for you . <h> Young carers <p> If you are aged 16 or 17 years old and are undertaking a substantial caring role for an adult , direct payments might be an option for you . You can request a carer 's needs assessment by contacting us . <h> What can direct payments be used for ? <p> Direct payments must be used to meet the needs that have been agreed through your carer 's needs assessment so that you are supported in your caring role and helped to keep well and healthy . <p> Direct payments can be used to buy goods and services or to directly employ someone . There are some things you can not use direct payments for : <p> To pay yourself as a carer for the care you provide ; <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in the household the person you care for ( unless it is agreed this is necessary ) ; or <p> Services of an intimate nature ( e.g. bathing ) or respite care for the person you care for ( if we agree following their assessment that they need such support , they could have their own direct payments or have their services arranged by a social care co-ordinator ) . <h> Will I need to pay anything myself ? <p> We do not charge for services for carers . You will not be financially assessed . Direct payments do not affect any benefits you may be receiving . However they will affect the benefits of anybody you choose to employ . <h> Could the person I care for receive direct payments ? <p> Most people who have social care support at home from us could now receive direct payments : <p> Older people who have been assessed as needing community care services ; <p> Disabled people aged 16 and over , including those with short as well as long-term needs ; <p> Carers , in place of receiving carers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's services ; <p> Disabled parents for children 's services ; and <p> People receiving a direct payment on behalf of someone else who lacks capacity . <p> Sometimes a person who needs social care support is not able to make the necessary decisions about direct payments . This is described as lacking capacity . It is possible for someone to receive direct payments on their behalf and to use them to meet the person 's needs . If you are the carer of someone who would benefit from direct payments and either you or someone you know would be willing to act as the ' suitable person ' to receive the direct payments for them , please get in touch with the direct payment support service . <p> There are only very limited circumstances when direct payments could not be offered and the reasons would be explained . <p> If you choose to employ your own personal assistants , the person assisting you with drawing up your support plan and/or your direct payment advisor can help you be more specific about what you need to do to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you/your staff will need to undertake . <p> You need to make sure any staff you employ are able to carry out the tasks you expect of them and do not put you or themselves at risk of being injured . It is , therefore , particularly important that you and your staff understand the implications of any moving and handling tasks expected of them . <p> Insurance companies state that they will only pay out if the personal assistant is trained in moving and handling by an appropriate trainer . In the event of a claim it is important you understand the implications . <p> Employers are required to provide their staff with instruction , information , training and supervision . In particular , health and safety legislation applies to employers of five or more staff who are then legally required to provide training . We strongly recommend that you identify your own training needs so you can provide some formal guidance/training to your personal assistants . We may be able to advise on this and also provide information about suitable , available training . <p> We also recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This may mean attending some courses together . Some training is also available in the home . <p> If your personal assistant has not already undertaken training , and depending on the tasks they will be asked to undertake , the sorts of courses you may need to consider could be : <p> Moving and handling - if your personal assistant supports you with any moving and handling tasks , then they will need to have moving and handling training ; <p> First aid ; <p> Infection control ; <p> Food hygiene ; <p> Administration of medication ; or <p> Health and safety . <p> You may also want to consider other specialist courses , such as dementia awareness , autism , diabetes , etc . <p> Some useful information is also available from Skills for Care for the training of personal assistants : <p> Common induction standards - there are new standards being completed at this moment through Skills for Care and Skills for Health who are including personal assistants in the common induction standards and also they have completed a code of conduct for health and social care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocational qualifications - the QCF level 3 diploma in health and social care called " For those working as a personal assistant " replaces NVQs . There are standalone units that personal assistants can complete as they can now choose only units applicable to what they are doing . The direct payment support service or your social care co-ordinator will be able to advise you about access to this in your area ; <p> The workforce development fund can help with training costs . People who employ their own care and support staff will need to register some basic details about themselves and their personal assistants on to the National Minimum Data Set for Social Care to be able to access the funding . The fund can only be utilised by adult social care providers that employ social care staff within England . See accessing the workforce development fund for details ; and <p> When someone in receipt of a direct payment dies , we need to be informed so that we can stop the arrangements that are in place . <p> Please contact us on 01609 780780 . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person who will be dealing with the affairs of the deceased ( the executor will be named in the deceased 's will as the person who will deal with their affairs after their death ) . We will also ask you if there is a solicitor . If there is a solicitor involved please give their name and contact details , e.g. address and telephone number . We need this information so we know where to send correspondence . <p> We will contact the care management team who will close the direct payment and payments will cease . They will write to the executor/solicitor to explain and support you regarding the direct payment account and fulfilling all the legal requirements . <p> The direct payment support service will also be involved during this time to ensure all the employer responsibilities are completed correctly . <h> The direct payment account <p> The money has been provided to buy services for someone who needed social care support . It does not form part of the person 's estate and can not be used for any other purpose other than direct payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be used for such things as funeral expenses . <p> Any money left in the direct payment account once all the contractual and legally required sums have been paid must be returned to us . We will advise you on how this can be done . <h> If you are the executor of the will <p> You will need to find out if there are any contractual obligations or payments that need to be made from the dedicated direct payment account . For example , if the deceased had been employing a personal assistant , this person will need to be paid for the work that they have already completed and any redundancy/annual leave pay that is due to them . The direct payment support service can assist you to do this ( the redundancy payment due to each employee under the statutory redundancy payment scheme depends on the individual 's age and length of service ) . <h> If you are not the executor of the will <p> It is very important that you explain the direct payments scheme to the executor . They may not know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bank account is a dedicated direct payment account and that the remaining money in it , after all contractual and legally required sums have been paid out , needs to be returned to the council . <h> If there is no will <p> The individual is said to have died ' intestate ' . Usually a close relative like a spouse , child or parent will be able to apply for the legal right to sort out the estate of the person who has died . In order to be able to administer someone 's estate you ( or the friend or relative ) will need to apply to the Probate Registry for a ' Grant of letters of administration ' . See GOV.UK - wills , probate and inheritance for more guidance . <h> Access to the direct payment account <p> It is advisable that you obtain a solicitor to help you through the process . On receipt of the grant , you or the individual will become the ' administrator ' of the estate . The grant provides proof to banks , building societies and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were held in the deceased 's name . You will then be able to access the direct payment bank account and will be able to make any payments that need to be made . Once all payments have been made , you will need to return the remaining money to the council . <h> How can we meet the contractual responsibilities if we can not access the money ? <p> In the case where the account has been frozen or there is no access to the account , then we will , in certain circumstances , pay out some outstanding payments e.g. salaries on the individual 's behalf . This money will then be recovered once the account has been reactivated and closed . To enable you to fulfil all your legal requirements please contact the direct payment support service for more information . <p> The Care Act 2014 focuses on people having control , therefore employing personal assistants can be very empowering for many disabled and older people . To optimise a person 's control over their delivery of care and support , we offer direct payments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a provider . <p> Unless we are satisfied that it is necessary to meet a person 's or child 's needs , people are advised not use direct payments to secure services from self-employed personal assistants . <p> We will retain the discretion to make an exception which must be approved in writing . <p> Where a person wishes to pursue to pay a self-employed personal assistant from the direct payment , an exception application must be completed . <h> What is a self-employed personal assistant ? <p> The UK Government website clearly states where a person uses personal assistants , the user is an employer if they pay a personal assistant directly , even if you get money from your local council ( direct payments ) or the NHS ( personal health budget ) to pay for them . Your personal assistant is usually treated as an employee because in law there are certain conditions that must be met for someone to be viewed as self-employed . <p> You can not just choose a self-employed personal assistant if you want to avoid your responsibilities as an employer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems daunting . HM Revenue &amp; Customs decide upon the status of employment / self-employment based on various factors . <p> If your personal assistant is an employee , you have more control as you decide the working hours . You are also responsible to give the personal assistant pay slips , paid holiday , a contract of employment and sick pay . See the GOV.UK - employing someone to work in your home page for detailed advice on employment status for people you employ to work in your home . <h> What are the risks of paying a self-employed personal assistant ? <p> Whether someone is employed or self-employed is referred to as their status . You are responsible for ensuring your personal assistant 's status is correct . It is important that you check their status for tax , employment law and pension auto-enrolment purposes . <p> Remember , a personal assistant may be treated as self-employed by HM Revenue &amp; Customs for tax purposes but still be considered an employee in employment law , or for auto-enrolment into a workplace pension . <p> The final decision on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual choice . It will be decided according to case law by either HM Revenue &amp; Customs or an employment tribunal . If you get your personal assistant 's employment status wrong there could be serious consequences : <p> If HM Revenue &amp; Customs decide your personal assistant should have been treated as an employee , you may be liable for any tax , National Insurance contributions and possibly penalties due ; <p> If an employment tribunal decides your personal assistant should have been treated as an employee , you may have to pay the personal assistant for unfair dismissal , which could be many thousands of pounds ; and / or <p> If the Pensions Regulator decides your personal assistant should have come within the scope of auto-enrolment , they may also levy penalties on you as the employer . <p> It is important to remember that we will not pay these liabilities for you . <h> How can I check my personal assistant 's status ? <p> If your personal assistant claims to be self-employed , or you decide to treat your personal assistant as self-employed , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is acceptable : <p> See the HM Revenue &amp; Customs employment status indicator tool This can be completed anonymously and will produce a 14 digit employment status indicator reference number on the outcome screen and the result can be downloaded or printed out ; <p> Direct payments are not a benefit - the money comes from North Yorkshire County Council to meet your assessed social care needs and is an alternative to services which are organised for you . <p> Having direct payments will not affect your benefits or be counted as income . <p> Sometimes you may be able to employ someone who lives with you ( this could be a family member ) but you must talk to us about this first . There could be implications for any household benefits . Talk to your social care co-ordinator first . <p> You can take as long as you want to decide if you want to use direct payments . While you decide we will arrange interim services to meet your needs . <p> You can add your own money to top up a direct payment to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of work but do n't worry , there is a lot of support to help you manage the scheme and succeed . The most important thing is you are in control but this does n't mean doing everything on your own . <p> You can mix your care arrangements . For instance you could ask us to arrange some of your support and use a direct payment to arrange some of the support yourself - a mix and match of services that you choose . <p> You do not have to calculate tax and National Insurance if you employ someone - the direct payment support service will signpost you to a payroll service . <p> There are no difficult forms for you to fill in - on most occasions we only need a copy of your bank statements to check your fund is working properly . <p> If you are considering direct payments for someone who lacks capacity to consent to the direct payment please discuss with your social care co-ordinator . <p> If direct payments do not work for you we can arrange services for you instead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not choose to have services arranged for them again . The most important thing is to be in control of your own life . Direct payments mean that you have freedom , choice , control and flexibility in your life to have the help you need by making your own arrangements . <h> Direct payments - frequently asked questions <p> The money you receive through direct payments enables you to arrange and be in control of the services you choose to meet your needs . There are a wide range of options available for using the money but there are also certain limitations . <p> The available options and limitations are explained below . You must also only spend your direct payments on things that your assessment shows that you need and that are reflected in your support plan . <p> You could use the money received through direct payments to : <p> Employ your own staff to provide personal care ; <p> Set up a contract with an agency to provide staff and services for you ; <p> Arrange for relief from the stress and demands of caring by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carer a break ; <p> Purchase a holiday or short break , provided this has been agreed with your assessor and is considered an appropriate way to meet your assessed needs ; or <p> Get a practical service which will help you to stay living at home . <p> You can use the money to receive any combination of these options and any other services that are available . In this way you can create your own service that fits your choices and needs . <p> You can not use the money received through direct payments to : <p> Buy services provided by the local authority , i.e. North Yorkshire County Council ( but you can ask us to buy them on your behalf ) ; <p> Buy permanent residential or nursing care ; <p> Employ a spouse , partner or other close relative , if that person lives with you in the same household ( exceptions can be made to this but only in exceptional circumstances as authorised by us ) ; <p> Pay for a personal assistant 's expenses such as food and drink or entry fees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support workers and personal assistants a reduced entry fee or free entry and all these options must be explored prior to any agreement being sought for payment of entry fees ) ; <p> Buy health-related services or equipment that should be provided by the NHS ; <p> Pay household bills or buy clothes , food etc. ; or <p> Buy anything that does not meet your agreed needs . <p> Once your support plan has been agreed the direct payments can only be used in the way indicated in this plan . If you want to change how your direct payments are used then a new plan will have to be agreed with your social care assessor . <h> Reviewing direct payments <p> We recognise that each case will be different and that costs for services will differ but agreements for direct payments must be subject to regular review .

It is also a useful tool for providers to audit themselves and to make improvements . We are currently reviewing the quality assurance frameworks . <p> We work with providers to make improvements and to acknowledge good practice . This is done through baseline assessments , which involve visits to care providers to assess how they work on a day-to-day basis . These visits aim to compliment , rather than duplicate , other organisations such as the Care Quality Commission . <p> As a result of the baseline assessment , there will sometimes be situations where action needs to be taken and this will be made clear to providers .

@@23526517 @3526517/ <h> Important information to consider <p> We make the decisions about admissions to North Yorkshire community and voluntary-controlled schools .

You can get policies for these schools from the school concerned . We do , however , coordinate admissions on their behalf and will make the offer of a place . If you want to apply to a voluntary-aided , foundation , trust school or academy , you should name it as a preference on the online or paper common application form . <p> It is important to note that some voluntary aided schools require parents/carers to provide additional information by completing a supplementary information form . Failure to complete and submit this form to the school will mean that you application is considered after all other applications for which a form was submitted . Where the school is oversubscribed this could mean that a place can not be offered to your child . If you have any queries about this issue please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Government 's coordinated admission scheme , all applications for school places need to be made through your home authority .

You can get information on all Early Years Foundation Stage providers from the North Yorkshire Families Information Service website at www.nyfamilies.info or by calling 01609 533483 , our staff will be pleased to talk you through the options available to you . <p> You can access the 15 hours of free provision flexibly , within the following parameters : <p> To be taken over a minimum of two days . <p> Sessions can vary in length but the minimum length is 2+ hours . <p> The earliest a session can start is 7am and the latest it can finish is 7pm . <p> You do not have to take all the 15 hours with one early years provider but the maximum number of providers you can use is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the entitlement by taking fewer hours a week over more weeks of the year . <p> This flexibility is designed to enable you to plan provision that best suits you and your child .

Access to enhanced mainstream provision is shared across the wider local area . A child may access the provision when the local authority deems the child has special educational needs and the provision is appropriate to meet those needs . It is important to note the presence of enhanced mainstream provision at a school does not form part of the local authority 's admission policy and is not considered as a reason for applying for a place at that particular school unless a child has a final statement of special educational needs ( SEN ) or an education health and care plan ( EHCP ) which names that school . <p> reduction of fees for board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits . <p> Schools must provide , free of charge , any activities which take place out of school hours but relate to the national curriculum or form part of a public exam syllabus .

It is important to note the presence of enhanced mainstream provision at a school does not form part of the local authority 's admission policy and is not considered as a reason for applying for a place at that particular school unless a child has a final statement of special educational needs ( SEN ) or an education health and care plan ( EHCP ) which names that school . <p> reduction of fees for board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits . <p> Schools must provide , free of charge , any activities which take place out of school hours but relate to the national curriculum or form part of a public exam syllabus .

We will apply our normal admission arrangements as set out on the admissions policies page . <p> Please note if you apply for your child to transfer from infant school to a primary school at the end of year 2 , rather than to a junior school , your application will be processed during June and July . <p> You will not be offered as place on national offer day as year 3 is not the normal your of entry into a primary school . <p> Admission authorities must consider parental requests and make decisions based on the merits of each case . <p> Parents must make their request , in writing and well in advance of the closing date for the normal admissions round .

The new admission authority has the legal right to re-consider the request at the time of application . <p> If the request is agreed the parent will need to apply the following year . Where the request is not upheld , the child will be considered for a Reception place in the standard year of entry , provided the application form is received on time , otherwise it will be considered alongside other late applications .

Children reach compulsory school age on the prescribed day following their fifth birthday ( or on their fifth birthday if it falls on a prescribed day ) . The prescribed days are 31 August , 31 December and 31 March . <h> Summer born children ( deferred ) <p> Children born in the summer term are not required to start school until a full year after the point at which they could first have been admitted - the point at which other children in their age range are beginning year 1 .

You will be advised of the outcome of your request for delayed entry prior to the primary national offer date of 18 April 2017 . <p> ' It is reasonable for admission authorities to expect parents to provide them with information in support of their request - since without it they are unlikely to be able to make a decision on the basis of the circumstances of the case . This should demonstrate why it would be in the child 's interests to be admitted to reception rather than year one ; and <p> In some cases parents may have professional evidence that it would be appropriate for them to submit , for example , when a child receives support from a speech and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that parents will obtain professional evidence that they do not already have . Admission authorities must still consider requests that are not accompanied by professional evidence . In such cases the supporting information might simply be the parent 's statement as to why they have made their request . ' <p> If your request is agreed , your application for the normal age group may be withdrawn before a place is offered . If your request is refused , you must decide whether to accept the offer of a place for the normal age group , or to refuse it and make an in year application for admission to year one for the September following your child 's fifth birthday . Where your request is agreed , you must make a new application as part of the main admissions round the following year . <p> If you have not been offered any of your higher preferences , this is because there were more applications than there were places available at the school and other children had a higher priority under the published admission criteria . <h> Class size 30 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 class sizes to no more than 30 children per class . <p> If you have not been offered a place at a school due to class size 30 , further information will be sent to you in due course . <h> Statutory right of appeal <p> You have the statutory right of appeal to an independent admission appeal panel , should you wish to do so .

Finds may have become scattered since they were originally deposited in the ground . <p> Only the following groups of coins will normally be regarded as coming from the same find : <p> Hoards that have been deliberately hidden ; <p> Smaller groups of coins , such as the contents of purses , that may have been dropped or lost ; and <p> Votive or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trove <p> An object that would previously have been treasure trove , but does not fall within the specific categories given , must be made substantially of gold or silver and have been buried with the intention of recovery .

You should also keep the information confidential . <p> The person receiving the find will notify the Sites and Monuments Record as soon as possible ( if that has not already happened ) so archaeologists can investigate the site if necessary . <h> If you fail to report a find of treasure <p> If you fail to report a find of treasure you could be imprisoned for up to three months or receive a fine of up to 5,000 , or both .

If you are dissatisfied you can appeal to the Secretary of State . <h> Loss or damage to the find <p> The coroner or museum is required to take reasonable steps to ensure the find is not lost or damaged . In the unlikely event this happens , you should be compensated . <h> Receiving the reward <p> The person who receives the reward is set out in detail in a Code of Practice .

Many companies have faltered due to lack of customer insight and ignoring the voice of the customer . <p> I have always believed that the way customers can provide feedback should be simple , straightforward and quick . Yes you can gain great insight by long , in-depth surveys and these absolutely have their place but to capture an instant feeling from your customer is extremely powerful . Therefore when I learnt that there was a model out there that could do exactly this and was used by many of the largest organisations worldwide I jumped for joy . <p> This model is called NPS ( Net Promoter Score ) it is a simple model that asks only one question : <h> How likely are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> This is rated on a 0-10 scale with 0 being very unlikely and 10 to be extremely likely . <p> This was introduced to the world in 2003 to help companies evaluate customer advocacy in a clear and simple way , which allowed a standard benchmark which could be used by any organisation . <p> Some of you may have seen this in various formats such as buttons at airports , or feedback following online purchases . Apple , Amazon and First Direct and many other service providers use this model and rated as world class service providers . <p> Here at SmartSolutions we are starting to add this to our regular communications via telephone calls , emails and Account Manager visits . These will all be optional and is entirely up to customers whether or not they choose to rate us .

@@23526563 @3526563/ <h> Budget questions and answers <p> The County Council is halfway through a programme that will see it become smaller and more efficient as it works more closely with North Yorkshire communities . <p> This page provides a simple guide to the situation facing the County Council as a result of austerity , how we plan to address that situation , the progress we are making and the challenges we face . <h> Budget web chat <p> Council leader Cllr Carl Les and chief executive Richard Flinton held a live web chat on Tuesday 13 December 2016 . You can read the questions asked during the chat and the answers given below . <p> Live Blog Budget Live Chat 2017 <h> What is the situation ? <p> Funding provided by central government to local authorities to deliver services has been reduced significantly in recent years . The total savings requirement to meet the reductions in government funding as well as all our costs is estimated at about 174m over the nine years from 2011-12 to 2019-20 . This is equivalent to reducing our spending power by about 34 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for services . This presents a considerable challenge and we face difficult decisions on spending and service provision . <h> How do we plan to achieve this ? <p> We have drawn up the 2020 North Yorkshire programme , a long-term plan to make savings through change . This change involves working with communities to find ways in which they can provide services better and more cheaply , for example in running libraries . Our Stronger Communities programme is supporting this work . We are also working with communities , families and individuals to help older and vulnerable people live independently and well for longer . Through our Extra Care programme we are providing homes where people can live independently , but with care on hand when they need it . We also support people with the skills and equipment they need to live independently . People have told us that is what they want to do . <h> What have we achieved so far ? <p> Up to March 2017 we expect to have saved more than 130m . This has been done largely by improving the efficiency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cutting the cost of our contracts with suppliers and working with partners to avoid duplication . This has helped us to keep the impact on frontline services to a minimum . However , as further savings are required , it becomes increasingly difficult to protect frontline services , which is why we 're working with communities to find alternative ways of providing services . <h> What challenges do we face ? <p> To meet the challenge of substantially reduced government funding , we expect to need to save about a further 44m over the next three years . We have identified where some of this can be saved , but currently face a shortfall of 22m . Achieving the required savings becomes increasingly difficult , as there are fewer savings that can be made from just back office functions . We need to ensure that we can still invest in our priority areas , including roads , broadband , supporting the elderly and vulnerable and giving a good start to all young people . More than a quarter of the county 's adult population is over 65 . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the demand for care and support . <h> Where does the council 's money come from ? <p> Our funding comes broadly from three areas : central government funding , council tax and business rates . In 2016-17 the amounts received from these sources were : <p> This gave a total net budget of 361m . <p> In addition , there is a dedicated schools budget of about 400m . <h> Where is it spent ? <p> We spend the funds from these sources to provide and support a wide range of services . The larger areas of spending include : <p> Adult Social Care : 186m <p> Children and Families : 38m <p> Home to School Transport : 20m <p> Roads : 32m <p> Transport : 16m <p> Waste Management : 32m <p> Information about all council services can be found elsewhere on this website . <h> Will council tax rise ? <p> The government has indicated that it expects authorities with responsibility for adult social care , such as North Yorkshire County Council , to increase council tax by 3.99 per cent in April 2017 and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1.99 per cent general increase in council tax plus a further two per cent specifically to pay for the increasing costs of adult social care , notably the introduction of the National Living Wage , which will affect many care workers . Councillors will decide the county council 's council tax level for 2017-18 at their meeting on 15 February . Currently , the council tax charge for an average band D property is 1,143.86 , which is below the average for counties . A 3.99 per cent increase equates to just under 46 a year or 88p a week . <h> Why does my council tax bill include a separate line for adult social care ? <p> Lat year , the Government identified that councils that provide social care services are under increasing pressure for services at a time of reducing funding . <p> Therefore , the Chancellor of the Exchequer presented authorities across the country that deliver adult social care with the flexibility to raise an additional precept of up to two per cent without breaching the council tax referendum threshold . This must be used entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include helping people to live independently in their own homes or in residential care where necessary . Adults with physical and learning disabilities are also supported and funded by adult social care . A person 's care needs are determined by an assessment by a social care assessor . Once a person has been deemed eligible , a care and support package is agreed with the person and their family . Some people are required to contribute towards the cost of their care if they meet set criteria ( eg their level of savings and income ) . <p> This extra two per cent on the council tax is called the adult social care precept and can only be used to fund extra costs of adult social care . Demand for adult social care is increasing ; the costs of care packages are increasing ; and the government 's announcement to introduce the National Living Wage alone is estimated to cost almost all of the extra income due to be raised from the precept . <p> That is why North Yorkshire County Council , along with almost every eligible authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise this additional precept . Without this precept , the County Council would have to find additional savings of around 21m up to 2020 . <h> How is the adult social care precept calculated ? <p> The adult social care precept is calculated as a percentage of the total County Council council tax , as illustrated in the example below . <p> 2016/17 <p> North Yorkshire County Council - Band D <p> 1,121.86 <p> Adult Social Care Precept <p> 22.00 <p> NYCC Total <p> 1,143.86 <p> 2017/18 <p> North Yorkshire County Council - Band D <p> 1,144.62 <p> Adult Social Care Precept <p> 44.88 <p> NYCC Total <p> 1,189.50 <p> The precept percentage increase above is calculated based upon the total NYCC charge in 2016/17 ( ie 1,143.86 ) so : 1,143.86 x 2% = 22.88

Listing only 1 school or the same school more than once , will not increase your chances of obtaining a place at that school and may lead to you being allocated a place at a school you would prefer your child not to attend . <p> Parents who have expressed a preference for a school will be considered first . If you do not preference a school , we will allocate a place at the catchment school for your home address if there are places available .

Access to enhanced mainstream provision is shared across the wider local area . A child may access the provision when the local authority deems the child has special educational needs and the provision is appropriate to meet those needs . It is important to note the presence of enhanced mainstream provision at a school does not form part of the local authority 's admission policy and is not considered as a reason for applying for a place at that particular school unless a child has a final statement of special educational needs ( SEN ) or an education health and care plan ( EHCP ) which names that school . <p> reduction of fees for board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits . <p> Schools must provide , free of charge , any activities which take place out of school hours but relate to the national curriculum or form part of a public exam syllabus .

Schools may levy a charge for certain activities but only after the governors have agreed on a detailed policy for charging . <p> If you would like your child to attend a school which is state funded , the law states you must make an application for admission .

We can not guarantee your child a place at a North Yorkshire school therefore you should also name a school within your home local authority 's area . It is your local home authority which is responsible for providing an education for your child . <p> The local authority makes the decision about admissions to community and voluntary controlled schools . <p> Admission to voluntary-aided , foundation , trust schools and academies are controlled by the governing body or academy trust of the school , although we co-ordinate admissions and will make the offer on their behalf . <p> The local authority co-ordinates the admissions scheme and will offer you a place at your highest preference school with an available place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place or guarantee the availability of a place at their school . <p> Various options are available to help you establish whether or not a particular school is suitable for your child 's special educational needs .

Other information such as the school 's anti-bullying and anti-discrimination policies should also be available . <p> Visit the school - parents/carers are entitled to visit any school they are considering for their child . Many schools will host an open evening for prospective pupils ; you should contact the schools direct to find out the dates and times . <p> Speak to the school 's Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator ( SENCo ) - the SENCo has a role in ensuring provision meets the needs of pupils with special educational needs . <p> View the school 's Ofsted report - this will also be a good source of information . <p> The authority 's expectation is the majority of children with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of special educational needs ( SEN ) or education , health and care plan ( EHCP ) , will have their needs met in a mainstream setting . <p> In some cases a special school will provide the best setting to meet a child 's needs however to be considered your child will need a final statement of special educational needs ( SEN ) or education health and care plan ( EHCP ) . <p> If your child already has one of these , you should discuss your preference and concerns with the special educational needs co-ordinator ( SENCo ) in your child 's school or setting . An early review can be arranged , if necessary , to review your child 's progress and discuss whether he or she would benefit from a specialist placement or if additional support or provision can be made within the current setting .

We will apply our normal admission arrangements as set out on the admissions policies page . <p> Please note if you apply for your child to transfer from infant school to a primary school at the end of year 2 , rather than to a junior school , your application will be processed during June and July . <p> You will not be offered as place on national offer day as year 3 is not the normal your of entry into a primary school . <p> Admission authorities must consider parental requests and make decisions based on the merits of each case . <p> Parents must make their request , in writing and well in advance of the closing date for the normal admissions round .

The new admission authority has the legal right to re-consider the request at the time of application . <p> If the request is agreed the parent will need to apply the following year . Where the request is not upheld , the child will be considered for a Reception place in the standard year of entry , provided the application form is received on time , otherwise it will be considered alongside other late applications .

Children reach compulsory school age on the prescribed day following their fifth birthday ( or on their fifth birthday if it falls on a prescribed day ) . The prescribed days are 31 August , 31 December and 31 March . <h> Summer born children ( deferred ) <p> Children born in the summer term are not required to start school until a full year after the point at which they could first have been admitted - the point at which other children in their age range are beginning year 1 .

You will be advised of the outcome of your request for delayed entry prior to the primary national offer date of 18 April 2017 . <p> ' It is reasonable for admission authorities to expect parents to provide them with information in support of their request - since without it they are unlikely to be able to make a decision on the basis of the circumstances of the case . This should demonstrate why it would be in the child 's interests to be admitted to reception rather than year one ; and <p> In some cases parents may have professional evidence that it would be appropriate for them to submit , for example , when a child receives support from a speech and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that parents will obtain professional evidence that they do not already have . Admission authorities must still consider requests that are not accompanied by professional evidence . In such cases the supporting information might simply be the parent 's statement as to why they have made their request .

If your request is refused , you must decide whether to accept the offer of a place for the normal age group , or to refuse it and make an in year application for admission to year one for the September following your child 's fifth birthday . Where your request is agreed , you must make a new application as part of the main admissions round the following year . <p> If you have not been offered any of your higher preferences , this is because there were more applications than there were places available at the school and other children had a higher priority under the published admission criteria . <h> Class size 30 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 class sizes to no more than 30 children per class . <p> If you have not been offered a place at a school due to class size 30 , further information will be sent to you in due course . <h> Statutory right of appeal <p> You have the statutory right of appeal to an independent admission appeal panel , should you wish to do so .
