If you want the most from your employees then it is vital that all consideration and care is put into good labor management . Staff should feel valued and if you allow them to contribute their skills and experience they will often be able to give the company even more than what could normally be expected .

So any effective attempt at labor management will involve good two-way communication . <p> It is important that your staff know what is expected from them , and that these expectations are n't constantly changing . Of course there will be changes along the way , but these should be managed as effectively as possible and you should completely avoid change for change 's sake if you want labor management to be productive .

The time of your employee is just as valuable as yours and giving them time to take off of work when they need to goes a long way when it comes to promoting employee happiness in your business . <p> In fact , it has been proven that employees work better when they are encouraged to take vacations and use all of their allotted vacation time . As a manager , taking care of your employees and making sure that they are content as a part of your business is very important . Good managers should try to use their time off as well . Taking a vacation now and then helps you clear your head and rest so that you can be a better manager when the going gets tough . <p> Of course , there are going to be times when you are really busy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . It 's a given that this will happen at some point in time . If you need to refuse any request the staff member is likely going to be upset , but if they feel that you have been unfair about it they will become resentful . <p> If this happens often enough and employees feel as if they are not being respected by managers , it could lead to that person looking elsewhere for work or just not performing as well as they could . <p> Here are some tips for how managers can make sure that they are being fair about granting employees vacation time . <h> Create Policies <p> It is important that you have policies in regards to employee time off requests . Make sure that you have clearly defined the rules of your business when it comes to when people can take time off and how much in advance they need to request a vacation so that managers can prepare properly . <p> In your policies , you can define the exact rules for request time off so that everyone on your staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fairest way to nurture good relations between you and your staff , because no one is being left in the dark and everyone is clear on the vacation policies . <p> Being transparent and clear with your staff about all types of work policies , vacation policies included , shows that you respect your team and you respect their time . <h> Allow Shift Trades <p> There are many way of dealing with employee vacation time . One method is to allow shift trades . What happens here is that you allow staff to have time off if they can arrange for someone to cover their shift by swapping with this other staff member . <p> There are potential difficulties with handling employee time off requests ; it can get out of control and you can end up with shifts that are under or over staffed or have the wrong skill mix . If you are going to allow shift trades you should make it clear that these will all need to be approved by the management first of all , and that swaps can only occur between people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacing another person is not good enough ; this other person will need to be able to do the job for the member they are replacing . If these shift trades are managed correctly though , they can be a great way to deal with employee time off requests . <h> Give Staff More Independence <p> Self-scheduling is another way of dealing with employee time off requests . The employees take responsibility for choosing their time off providing they take into consideration the staffing levels and skill mix for any particular shift . <p> The staff member will have their contract hours that they need to work each month and self-scheduling will give them a lot of freedom ; it will most often be first come first served or negotiations between staff members for different shifts . <p> This can be an effective way of dealing with employee time off requests because the staff members have more control and there is less risk of unfairness . On the other hand , there is also the risk of chaos ensuing so a level of administration will be needed for the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff members will have sudden employee time off requests ; these are usually due to some emergency or important event . Depending on the severity of the reason , all efforts should be made to grant the request . <p> It should also be remembered that while a reason might not seem too important to the management ; it may be to the employee . If this employee time off requests is n't granted there is a good chance that the staff member will just take a sick day anyway . <p> This is why it pays to try and be reasonable . If there is just no way that you can afford to lose the staff member on the day , then you should try and give a full explanation as to why ; maybe the employee will be able to suggest a compromise . <h> Have a Backup Plan <p> There are going to be times of the year when you 're going to be getting a lot of vacation request submissions . This might be during the summer or the holiday season . Obviously , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requests , but at the same time , it 's hard for you as a manager to work short-handed . <p> That 's why it 's a great idea to always have a list of trusted , part-time workers in your pocket that you can reach out to and use as replacements when needed . Having a list of seasonal workers that you have worked with before , you trust and you know are reliable is a definite must in these times when you are probably going to be short on workers . <p> Being a great manager means being prepared for any situation that you are going to have to encounter and having the skills and the knowledge to solve these problems while being fair to your employees and making sure that your business is running without a hitch at all times .

Whether you are running a business that employs salaried or hourly staff , investing in employee development programs is worth it . <p> Being afraid of taking this step is completely understandable , however . It 's a tough time to be running your own business and you need to make every dollar count . But setting aside funds for employee development is something that needs to be a part of your budget , no matter what and here 's why . <h> It Helps with Retention <p> Want to talk about leaking money ? Employee turnover is one of the biggest ways small businesses are losing money every year . According to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of poorly trained employees end up leaving their companies within their first year on the job . <p> Most of these employees clearly state that poor training and general dissatisfaction with their status within the company are the main reasons behind their departures . What does this mean for you ? Well , the same study estimates that employee turnover costs U.S. business owners $11 billion every year . <p> All these statistics very strongly support the claim that investing in training and developing your employees pays off , because it 's a lot cheaper to train employees and keep them on the job than it is to replace them . <p> If you have a development program in place , most of your staff members will see that as a fantastic benefit one that most of your competitors might not offer . Making that a part of your hiring package will more than likely inspire workers to stay with you , because it shows them that you care about their professional development something a large majority of employees ( especially Millennials ) tend to find very important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bat , even while onboarding them , that you are willing to invest in their future with your company helps to build loyalty . <h> It Helps You Find Great Employees <p> Not only can investing in employee training help you keep your best employees , it can help you bring aboard great new people as well . When looking to hire people , you are usually trying to present all of the great benefits that you offer things that they might not be getting if they choose to join one of your competitors . <p> If your potential employee sees that you are offering them a chance to grow with you , they will immediately understand that your company is one that expects them to participate right from the get-go and grow professionally in stride with the company . <p> And once the word gets out in your industry circles ( and it will , very quickly ) that you are a company that promotes employee development and education , your reputation will skyrocket . <p> This not only impresses potential hires , customers love to hear about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company that is investing in their talent than one that is not . <h> It Helps You Promote from Within <p> According to a study by Matthew Bidwell , a management professor at Wharton University , promoting people from inside your company to managerial positions is a much safer move than making external hires . <p> He claims that employees who are hired from outside of the company perform significantly worse than people who have been promoted from within . On top of that , external hires are usually paid significantly higher wages and are up to 20 percent more likely to leave your company . So basically , hiring from outside of your company most likely leads to overpaying people to underperform and possibly leave your company within their first two years . <p> Educating and training your employees makes promoting people internally much easier . Think about it . Who better to take over a managerial role at your company than someone who has been with you for a while , is familiar with the ins-and-outs of your business and has received a steady stream of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs not only prepare your best and brightest for promotions , they also enable you to see which employees are management material . Giving your staff a chance to learn on the job makes it much easier to assess the strengths and weaknesses of all your employees . <h> It Ensures Longevity <p> When you are investing in the development of your staff , you are building a strong future for your company . You are working to create future leaders within your organization and you 're making sure that there will be people within your company who are going to be capable of growing your business , inspiring change and promoting innovation . <p> Continually training your team also enables you to keep up with all industry trends . Through constant development programs , your team will always be looking towards the future anticipating customer needs and industry innovations . <p> Providing training will also enable your employees to approach , learn and integrate new technologies constantly . <p> When you are putting training programs together , you are forcing yourself to think about the future and plan ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauging what type of education and programs work best for your team . <p> Providing these types of programs basically demands that you stay on your toes and refrain from being short-sighted when it comes to your company 's future . <h> It Increases Engagement and Productivity <p> Productivity seems to always be something that businesses are trying to improve upon within their ranks . And while there truly are tons of great productivity tools and methods out there right now , nothing is better for increasing team efficiency than keeping your employees engaged . <p> According to this infographic , having employees who are not engaged at work costs U.S. businesses more than $500 billion annually . When employees are not engaged , they do n't care about their work . This leads to a decrease in productivity , and even worse , sloppy habits and poor attitudes that can affect relationships with management and with customers . <p> By continually working on employee development , you can keep your employees engaged and productive .

@@20686924 @686924/ <h> Qualities to Look for When Hiring a Host or Hostess <p> The host or hostess is probably the least respected employee in the restaurant business because of the many misconceptions associated with the position . The main one is that these employees do n't really do much . All they do is greet people at the door and seat them , leaving the rest of the staff to take care of the grunt work . Right ? Wrong ! <p> Sure , hosts and hostesses might not be carrying dishes or preparing the food , but they are an integral part of the staff nevertheless , and whether or not you have- hired the right people to work the front of the house is something that can make or break your restaurant . <p> So when the time comes to hire for this position in your restaurant , you really need to make sure that you find the right person . These are some of the most important qualities that you need to be looking for when hiring hosts and hostesses . <h> Confidence <p> The thing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for the first impression that customers get of your restaurant . And the first impression is always the most important one in this business . That 's why confidence is so important . <p> Thankfully , the level of a potential employee 's confidence can be gauged pretty easily during the interview process . The way they handle themselves during the interview can immediately give you a good idea of whether or not they are confident in their abilities . <p> When a host or hostess is confident , this confidence become contagious . A good host or hostess is able to instill a sense of confidence in your customers , in the sense that they feel confident about the fact that they have chosen to eat at your restaurant . If the host or hostess makes a good impression on the customer as soon as he or she enters the door , the work the rest of your staff needs to do in order to maintain that impression immediately become a bit easier . <h> Composure <p> Next to exuding confidence , being able to maintain composure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host or hostess . As mentioned previously , many believe that hosts have it easy . Greet and seat that 's all it takes , right ? Not many realize how taxing the seating process can be , especially when it 's getting really busy in the restaurant . <p> There 's a lot of strategizing involved , which involves a lot of critical thinking and planning on the spot . Often times this process can become very stressful . A good host or hostess will be able to keep his or her cool even when the going gets tough . <p> Not only are you dealing with hungry and anxious guests waiting to be seated and served , you 're also dealing with a restaurant staff of waiters and servers that is probably just as stressed out and on edge . <p> It 's a balancing act that not everyone is built to handle , which makes finding a host or hostess that can calmly navigate such situations imperative . <h> Charm <p> A great host or hostess is charming and friendly , no matter what . Even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't allowed to show it . Having a terrible day ? Too bad . It 's your job to smile and be cordial to every guest , no matter how impossible it seems . Most importantly , you need to come off as sincere which is probably the hardest part of being friendly and charming even on the worst of days . <p> The hosts job is to make the guests not only feel comfortable , but also important . Another big part of this is the way in which a host or hostess speaks . A lot of the charm that good hosts or hostesses exude comes from two things their manners and their verbal skills . <p> A great host or hostess must be well-spoken and polite at all times . Whether they are talking to customers in person or taking reservations over the phone , a great host or hostess will speak clearly and collectedly , never rushing their conversations or showing any signs that can imply rudeness . <h> People Skills <p> There 's a lot to be said about establishing connections with your clientele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be incredibly likeable and should be leaving a lasting positive impression on your guests . Being able to immediately establish a connection at the front of the house is something that 's more likely to get you recurring customers and regulars than the actual food . <p> People respond to people . It 's as simply as that . If guests do n't feel comfortable entering your restaurant and being seated , you ca n't really expect them to come back no matter how great your food is . The perfect host or hostess is able to connect with guests on an emotional level and immediately establish some type of rapport with them that makes them feel at home in your establishment . <h> Team Spirit <p> A poor host or hostess views themselves as an isolated employee that does n't have much interaction with the rest of the staff . A good host or hostess understands that everyone on the restaurant staff is connected and needs to work together . If the restaurant is incredibly busy , hosts need to be ready to swallow their pride and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not have been hired to help serve or buss tables , but if the situation calls for it , a great host or hostess will be ready to lend a helping hand . <p> Situations can get heated in a restaurant especially a busy one . Hosts need to help to keep spirits high and defuse conflicts . If you 've hired someone who is able to maintain his or her composure with frustrated guests , he or she should be able to do the same within the team . <p> The bests hosts are willing to do whatever it takes for the restaurant to succeed , whether it 's rallying the troops , keeping everyone on the same page , resolving conflicts or rolling their sleeves up and washing dishes . Whatever it takes . <h> Conclusion <p> Remember , we 're talking about the first person that your guests see and meet when entering your restaurant . The person who is responsible for the all-important first impression that 's created when a guest enters your eatery . There 's a lot more to being a great host or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It takes a special type of personality and work ethic to get the job done right .

However , rumors can damage reputations , waste time , create division , promote anxiety , and negatively impact employee morale . <p> Rumors usually start when people try to fill in the blanks with their own interpretations of a given circumstance . This can quickly get out of hand , as new details are added to the facts , making it hard to tell apart the story from the truth . <p> Here are five rumors that employees discuss that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being Fired <p> Employee turnover exists in all workplace environments ; some more than others . Your employees may know ( or they may think they know ) something about the circumstances leading up to the firing of their colleague . <p> Or , based on past experiences and patterns , they may spread rumors about someone that they think is going to be on the chopping block in the near future . <p> These types of rumors can spread fear and anxiety . Your employees may begin to act more reserved , and they may become less outspoken than normal . If someone fears that they may be fired , their productivity is sure to plummet , along with their boldness and initiative . <p> Steps to take if you are dealing with this type of rumor : <p> Reassure your team by acknowledging their worries . Tell them honestly what you do know and what you do n't  know about a given situation . <p> Show support . If there are questions you ca n't answer right now , let your staff know that you will find out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If it seems like a couple of people are spending an inordinate amount of time together at work , it may appear to others that they are developing more than just a casual friendship .

In an ideal situation , this would never happen , but unfortunately no workplace is perfect . If rumors about interpersonal relationships spread , it can damage the reputation of the individuals involved , and can also reflect badly on the company . <p> Steps to take if you are dealing with this type of rumor : <p> Take some time to understand what the rumors are . Discern whether or not there is any truth to what is being said . <h> 3 . Rumors About The Company <p> There are a variety of different types of company rumors that can crop up . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds threatening to the future of the business . Even if their assumptions are not based in reality , this can quickly turn into a counterproductive rumor . <p> Rumors of this nature can cause anxiety and impact employee morale . Your employees may lose focus or not perform up to their usual standards . <p> Steps to take if you are dealing with this type of rumor : <p> Determine who is spreading rumors about your company . Regular gossipers are attention-seekers , and will continue to spread rumors if they go unchecked . <p> Confront the team members who are spreading the rumors individually , in private . <p> Reinforce or create a company policy that restricts employees from spreading rumors about the business . <h> 4 . Rumors About Budget Cuts <p> Most organizations have many moving parts , and departmental budget cuts may be a necessary part of keeping a business sustainable . <p> Employees may spread rumors about impending budget cuts based on previous experience or hearsay . This could stir up anxiety within an entire department , or create division among other segments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with this type of rumor : <p> First , discern the culprit of the gossip . Who is spreading rumors about budget cuts ? Speak with them privately and help them to understand why their behavior is not acceptable . <p> Address the entire department if appropriate . Speak honestly about what you know as well as what you do n't  know . <h> 5 . Rumors About Unannounced Promotions <p> You may be working on an upcoming promotion for your business , and your employees may know something about it . If they do n't  clearly understand the purpose behind the promotion , or they are still foggy on the details , they may end up spreading rumors about it . <p> For example , they may tell a customer about the promotion without really understanding it . Or they may end up passing on wrong information , creating false expectations with your customer base . <p> Rumors of this type can affect the reputation of your company , so beware . <p> Steps to take if you are dealing with this type of rumor : <p> Evaluate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any false information that has been passed along . <p> Speak in private with the employees who misunderstood the promotion . Clarify the details and the expectations you have for them . <p> Fulfill customer expectations to keep them happy . <h> Conclusion <p> Remember ; the primary antidote of unwanted rumors is clear communication . Leaving out important details in conversations can cause people to " fill in the blanks " without really understanding the situation . <p> While there may be information that is strictly on a need-to-know basis , if you want to curtail the spreading of rumors , make sure to make your expectations clear and communicate openly and plainly with your employees .

This benefit with this is that there will be continuity and it also means less complaints from those staff who hate going on nights . The drawback with excluding the night staff from shift rotation is that they can feel excluded from the rest of the organisation .

In many cases , even when an employee has proven to be toxic for your business , many business owners tend to hesitate before going through with the firing . <p> Why is this ? Firstly , many believe that bad employees can be reformed . They would rather offer second and third chances than have to look for a replacement . <p> Secondly , if you 're a small business owner , then you 're probably fretting about the money you 're going to lose to the turnover process . Also , you 're probably frightened that your team will not be able to handle the transition between the firing and arrival of a new hire while shorthanded . <p> Its completely normal to have all these fears . They are all common fears in today 's business environment . However , most of the time it 's better to let go of an underperforming employee as soon as possible . <p> Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can result from cutting ties with terrible employees as soon as possible . <h> You 'll Save Money <p> If you 're a small business owner , then you 're probably constantly hearing about the cost of turnover and how you 're leaking tons of money every time you 're looking to replace a worker that has left you . <p> All of this is true . However , you really cant compare the situations of losing a good worker and firing a bad one . They are two completely different beasts . In reality , letting go of a bad employee is actually the prudent financial decision to make for many reasons . <p> Firing an employee may end up costing you money , but it 's an expense that you need to eat if you want to do what 's best for the future of your business .

It really is unavoidable firings are stressful situations . But when you are firing someone who is not pulling their weight , there 's a good chance that such a move could potentially relieve stress , certainly in the long run . <p> If your only reason for keeping someone around is to not rattle the cage , you 're doing your employees and your entire business a disservice . Small business owners have to make a lot of tough decisions , often by themselves . Getting rid of an employee is always going to be tough , but if they are n't contributing to the betterment of your business , they are dead weight and need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you think your employees who really put in the effort and dedicate themselves to the job feel when they see someone who is doing the exact opposite getting equal treatment ? <p> It sends a message to all your employees that you are willing to tolerate mediocrity .

Win-win . <h> You 'll Improve Your Recruitment Process <p> If you 've had to fire an employee that just was n't working out , at least you now have a template of what you do n't want your workforce to look like . When it comes to running a small business , every learning experience is a good one and gives you the ability to grow and improve the way you run your operation . <p> Now that you 've experienced what it 's like to have an employee that is stifling your growth , you have a better idea of the warning signs that you need to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there is anything that you could have done better .

In fact , there 's a good chance that they might be able to thrive in another one . <p> Also , it 's important to remember that feedback from your best and trusted employees is imperative to collect .

It 's a billion dollar industry that has been steadily growing , especially since 2007 . Truthfully , this industry is most likely even bigger than the statistics can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to count . <p> When looking not only at food trucks , but all types of mobile food stands like carts and kiosks , the industry is truly a massive one with limitless growth potential . <p> One reason linked to the rise in popularity of food trucks is the slowing economy . In terms of costumers , it seems that more ad more people want quick and inexpensive food options . They want the ability to get great food on the go without having to leave tips every time they want to get some breakfast or lunch . <p> Entrepreneurs look at food trucks as a great way to gain some experience as restaurant owners and food servers without having to commit enormous amounts of money to opening up and running a more traditional eatery . <p> If you are a budding entrepreneur in the food industry and are considering whether or not you should try to open a restaurant or food truck first , here are some reasons why opting to start with a food truck could be the best option for you . <h> How Do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot cheaper than opening a full-fledged restaurant ; and it 's not even close . According to Forbes , you can open up a great food truck for in between $50,000 $80,000 . It would take in between $100,000 $300,000 to get going in the brick-and-mortar restaurant business . <p> In both situations , space is the biggest expense . And obviously , there 's a lot less space involved in owning a food truck . When you are crunching the numbers , you 're taking all of the same things into consideration : licences and permits , staffing , marketing , insurance , equipment , etc . But with food trucks , the funds needed for each of these categories are significantly smaller . <p> But remember , there is a cost associated with running a food truck operation that you might overlook at first : maintaining the truck itself mechanically . You are going to need to change the oil regularly , go in for tune ups , and pay for mechanical repairs every now and then . If you are a car guy or gal and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great . But that 's not the case with most would-be restauranteurs . <p> No matter how you slice it , getting your restaurant business going by way of a food truck is an significantly more frugal option . <h> Location Redefined <p> One of the best things about owning a food truck is that you are not tied down to a single location . If business is n't booming at one location , you can always find a new one . That means that the process of choosing a location for your restaurant is n't even close to as difficult as it is when you are deciding on a location for a regular restaurant . Because you simply do n't have to settle . <p> Your options are always open in terms of location . Heck , you can even move to a different city if you want . Sure , you 're going to have to resubmit for new permits whenever you move , but at least you have the option of moving if you are not happy with your current place on the map . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moving to another one is much more daunting . <p> However , let 's not pretend that moving your food truck around is the easiest of things to do . If you 're working in a big city , finding a good parking spot can be incredibly difficult . Parking laws are very strict in most cities , allowing you to park only in specified locations and for specified amounts of time . If you are constantly violating these laws , fines stacking up can eat away at your profits very quickly . <p> If one of your main problems when trying to figure out how to start your own restaurant is deciding on a location , then you might want to start out with a food truck . A food truck is also a good investment for funding your potential restaurant . Start with a food truck and save money to eventually open up a restaurant in that high-rent part of town that you 've been coveting . <h> Staffing <p> According to statistics , nearly 80 percent of food truck operators employ four or fewer workers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long hours . You have less people on your payroll but you are asked to contribute on a much more direct level . <p> The work day does n't start when the food truck opens . You and your staff usually need to be there a couple of hours before that to handle all of the preparation work . You do n't have to clean as much as you would if you owned a full-fledged restaurant . That basically means that you are going to cleaning yourself instead of hiring- someone to do the cleaning . <p> So while the obvious advantage is that you are spending a lot less money on staffing a food truck , you are also committing yourself to do be more hands-on with all of the unglamorous tasks that come with serving food to people . <h> Legal Issues <p> While there are many legal issues that you have to take care of when opening a brick-and-mortar eatery , at least they are clear cut . It 's an easier process to work through , but its still worth employing an experienced attorney to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to open your restaurant anyway . <p> And while the entire process might be cheaper when opening a food truck , the laws are a lot less concrete . You will need all of the regular business and health permits when opening a food truck , but you are also going to need parking permits . And if you want to move around regularly and switch cities a lot , you are going to have to adhere to a new set of rules every single time you cross new city lines . <p> There are city laws in places like Seattle and Boston that do n't allow food trucks to serve customers in direct proximity to their competitors and they also have limits on how long food trucks are allowed to serve food in various parts of the city where other restaurants operate . There 's definitely a lot more confusing red tape involved than there appears to be at first glance . <h> Why Not Both ? <p> There are many aspiring restaurant owners who start off with a food truck in order to get their feet wet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food trucks cost less to open and you get a chance to test out your branding and your food while building a customer base for yourself without having to take the huge risk of investing in a permanent residence for your restaurant . <p> Many restauranteurs have made that leap successfully . Operating a food truck business allows you to experiment and find yourself . You can change and tweak your menu constantly and play around with your restaurant image and style without having to commit to anything until you are completely sure of it . <p> And even if you do end up opening a restaurant after starting as a food truck owner , there 's no reason to close it down . A food truck can be great advertising for your brick-and-mortar restaurant . It 's basically a moving , interactive billboard . <p> On top of that , food trucks can supplement your restaurant financially , especially in off seasons . If you have less people coming to your restaurant during the summer when it 's nice outside , there 's a good chance that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Conclusion <p> If your dream is to own a restaurant , opening up a food truck to begin with might be the best possible business model . However , it really does depend on your dream and what type of restaurant you want to have . <p> The type of food you can offer from a truck is certainly a bit limited . If you have set your sights on serving complex gourmet dishes , having a brick-and-mortar establishment might be your only real option . <p> If nothing else , the increasing popularity of food trucks gives you a great alternative . It offers you another , less expensive option for getting your foot in the food industry door and chasing your dream of one day running a " real " eatery of your own .

In today 's business world , dating someone you work with is not at all uncommon . <p> Studies show that after online dating , the workplace is the second biggest place where people meet their significant others . It makes a lot of sense . You are sharing the same space for eight or more hours a day with people who tend to be like-minded and have similar life goals . <p> Also , the everyday stresses of work life tend to be an easy thing to relate and bond with an individual over . A study conducted by Payscale even showed that 20 percent of people who give office romance a shot end up marrying that colleague . <p> While it can be a great thing , office romances can also cause a lot of undesirable stress and tension . Surely , ending an office relationship can be uncomfortable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue to see each other every day , despite the fact that the relationship has dissolved . <p> here 's a list of dos and donts to take into consideration if you plan ton asking- a colleague to be your Valentine this year . <p> Do : <p> Know Your Companys Policy <p> Every company tends to have a bit of a different policy when it comes to dating among colleagues . There is n't one golden rule , so if you 're thinking about asking someone from work out , it might be best to make sure right away that you know where your company stands on this issue . <p> There are some organizations that make it a requirement for you to come forth with the relationship and let your higher-ups know about it . Others do n't . Romance is an important part of life , but you should n't allow it to negatively affect your career in any way . So do the research and check out your company 's policy before you set the ball rolling . <p> Try to Keep it a Secret <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the relationship , you should n't have to tell everyone . One of the best reasons for keeping it a secret is that it can be fun . Having a special relationship with someone while keeping it hidden from plain sight at work can be thrilling and fun for both of you . <p> You will need to avoid public displays of affection at work whatever you decide . Even if you do decide to tell coworkers about the relationship , you should still resist the PDA . The only thing it can lead to is making your other colleagues feel uncomfortable around you . <p> Take it Seriously <p> No matter how much you want it to be , an office romance is unlike any other romance . It comes with its own rules , and it 's something that you should take very seriously , not only to help make it a successful relationship , but to avoid issues if the relationship does end up going sour in the end . <p> The truth of the matter is that a workplace romance has the potential to impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasts or ends . And if the relationship does end , try to be as professional about it as possible . It might be incredibly hard to do , but making sure that no negativity enters the workplace as a result is something you need to do . It does n't only affect the two of you , it can affect coworkers and clients as well . <p> Do n't  : <p> Flaunt it <p> It was mentioned earlier , but it should be reiterated . Public displays of affection at work should be absolutely prohibited . No one in the office wants to see that , no matter how relaxed they seem about your relationship . It is something that has no place in the office . This includes not only kissing , but also hugging , hand-holding , and even winking and sending kisses to each other across the office . <p> These rules should not only apply to work hours , but to all work-related functions , including holiday parties and even trips to the bar with colleagues after work . <p> It 's also important not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office . If you 've been going to lunch with the same group of people all year , do n't suddenly abandon them because you all of a sudden only have eyes for your office flame . <p> Let it Affect Your Work <p> It 's important not to change the person and employee you are when your partner is present . This could make things really weird in meetings and when working with a group of people in which your partner is included . Be sure not to treat that person any differently than before . <p> If your partner has an idea which you do n't agree with , say something . Do n't let it slide just because of your relationship . Things should be the same way they were before you became an item . <p> Discuss it with Other Coworkers <p> Your coworkers are probably going to want to hear the juicy details about your relationship , but you must not give them any . Feeding the office gossip machine is the worst thing that you can possibly do for your relationship and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the office , no matter how bad you 'd like to talk about it . You must remember that you are not the only person affected by what is said . <p> Conclusion <p> An office romance can be very rewarding .

Just be smart about it and try to keep your romantic life and your business life as separate as possible in these circumstances .

@@20686994 @686994/ 16360 @qwx216360 <h> The 5 Donts of Performing Employee Evaluations <p> It seems that everyone hates performance reviews . Employers - and managers probably hate them just as much as employees do . But performance reviews have proven to yield results when done right and many still believe that they are an integral part of optimizing the way you do business . <p> Companies perform employee reviews because they can have positive effects on both the company and the staff if done correctly . But if done the wrong way , they can cause a lot of damage . Poorly conducted performance reviews can demotivate staff , instill fear and a sense of distrust in your workforce , and provide your management with incorrect and partial assessments that will make their jobs harder and more complicated in the end . <p> How can you be certain that you 're doing it the right way ? For starters , here are seven things not to do when performing - employee evaluations . <h> Do n't Make Them Annual Events <p> There are two big reasons why performance evaluations should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make it a once-a-year event , you are immediately adding stress to an already stressful situation . It becomes an event that both managers and employees dread . <p> Keeping a laundry list of mistakes and shortcomings for each of your employees and then confronting them with these issues once a year is , in reality , as horrible an idea as it sounds on paper . <p> Put yourself in their shoes . Would you like to have one dreaded day per year during which your higher ups are going to highlight all of your miscues or would you rather get immediate feedback whenever your supervisors notice that something you are doing could use some improvement ? <p> The latter option is obviously better . Which leads us to the second reason why annual evaluations go against best practices . <p> Ask yourself what the purpose of the review is . You are evaluating the performance of your employees so that you can improve their performance , right ? You are not doing it to shame them . <p> Employees need and thrive on regular feedback and open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple and effective process for meeting with your employees on a more regular basis and speaking openly about things they can do to improve the way they work . That 's the best route to take if you want to see real , palpable and positive results from the review process . <h> Do n't Make It About Personality <p> It 's impossible to give a fair assessment of an employee if you are focusing on their personality traits , simply because it 's a completely subjective criterion . If you believe that a person is demonstrating a negative attitude or displaying a personality type that does n't work well within your company , there is a more productive way to approach them about it than commenting directly on their behavior . <p> What you need to do is focus on the outcome of- their behavior and personality . How are these personality traits objectively manifesting themselves ? What are the concrete results of these behaviors ? <p> Be specific and give real examples . If their communication is n't up to snuff , show them how customers responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the desired one . If their sales performance is down as a direct result of their personality and behavior , show them the numbers . <p> Commenting on their personality traits directly will come off as a personal attack , which is the last thing you want . Use the hard facts and results to demonstrate what they are doing wrong and how it 's negatively affecting their performance . <h> Do n't Mix Development and Compensation Reviews <p> Never schedule one performance review for an employee that is going to act both as a developmental meeting and a talk about salary . They should never be combined . If you need to do both for one employee , make sure to separate them . <p> Many managers think that combining the two will save them time and effort . But if you are combining the two processes , you are going to be diminishing the effects of the developmental part of the process drastically . <p> If your main concern is developmental , then leave the talks of compensation out completely . And if you want to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your employee knows that this is what the review is going to be about . <p> Performance reviews are stressful enough for employees and complex enough for managers without making them about both development and money at the same time . Detach the two if you want to see real results . <h> Do n't Compare Employees to One Another <p> This rule is very similar to the one about involving personality traits in performance reviews . It 's something you simply should not- do under any circumstances . <p> What are you trying to achieve by comparing employees ? By comparing one employee to another during a performance review , you 're basically introducing conflict and contention into your workplace . <p> Instead , use real goals and targets to make your comparisons . Show your employees the goals that you have set for them to reach and then- grade their performance on how close or far they are from reaching these goals . <p> Always draw comparisons to business data and concrete goals , never make it about competition between employees . <h> Do n't Forget to Offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they fail to follow up with concrete plans and actions after the fact . Your employee evaluation is n't complete until you 've talked about what it is that both you and the employee can do to make improvements . <p> Let them know what steps they need to take to improve and ask them what help they will need from you or the rest of the team to make those improvements . Look at it as a cycle . One performance review has ended and now it 's time to move on to the next phase in your employees professional development . <p> Remember , the employee should not feel as if he or she is on trial . It should feel like a conversation . Set aside some time at the end of each evaluation for them to speak their minds . Is the employee truly inept or simply unmotivated ? If they lack motivation , what can you do to change that ? <p> More times than not , employees fail not because they do n't have the skills or knowledge needed , but because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervisors . <h> Conclusion <p> You 've probably heard a lot of talk about getting rid of performance reviews entirely . Microsoft claimed to do away with them in 2013 , and then- Accenture did the same in 2015 . But that does n't mean that they have gone the way of the dodo . <p> All it means is that many corporations have realized that their processes needed to be revamped . Performance reviews should not be thrown out , they should be refined and improved over time . <p> This is obvious even in the case of the aforementioned major corporations . They are not doing away with the entire process , they are simply throwing out the archaic annual review format and working to update the process and modernize it . And that 's exactly what company evaluations should be all about .

This is not a job that just anyone can do and creating schedules takes a lot of skill and knowledge . Anyone involved with schedule planning needs to know all the ins and outs of the business and how much work there will be on any given day . <p> When dealing with schedule planning you need to match the needs of the business with the availability of staff on any given day . This involves knowing the skill-mix that will be needed and the exact number of staff who will be required to successfully complete all the tasks that shift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nothing to do and this will be a waste of resources ; if too few staff are on a shift then this can mean that work does n't get completed and staff become too stressed and overworked . If the wrong skill-mix is on a shift then this too will have implication for getting the work done . As you can see schedule planning involves being able to juggle many balls . <p> It is recommended that your schedule planning should be complete at least a week before so that staff can make sure that they are available to work that shift . Changing things at the last minute can be a complete nightmare so if you give staff plenty of notice there should be plenty of time to rearrange things .

The change for days to nights or vice versa can be physically and mentally demanding for employees so it is important that there is a few days break in-between the change . It is also important that you avoid double-shifts wherever possible as this too can be stressful and unhealthy for staff . <p> The nightmare scenario for anyone involved in schedule planning is when they have a schedule conflict . This is usually as a result of accidentally scheduling the same member of staff to different locations at the same time . This can be a real headache to sort out and the way to avoid it is by double checking your schedule ; this is especially important if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schedule . <p> Schedule planning is often an unrewarding job because it is not possible to please everyone .

@@20687025 @687025/ <p> It 's not uncommon for companies these days to have distributed teams working on different sides of the globe towards the same goal . Many businesses opt for this type of arrangement because it helps to cut down costs , especially software companies who needs to hire bigger development teams to increase the speed at which their product is created . <p> However , mismanaging distributed teams could actually lead to losing money and missing deadlines . And while distributed teams have their advantages , their disadvantages are also numerous . <p> If you want your distributed team to be successful , you need to devise a good strategy that is going to maximize the potential of your workforce .

Also , learning about each other 's cultures in addition to languages is also a great idea for bringing your team together . <h> Promote Constant Communication <p> The importance of strong and constant communication can not be reiterated enough . The fact that your teams are operating in different time zones should make communication that much more important . <p> Use either dedicated business messaging services or popular everyday ones like Skype and Google Hangouts to keep your teams on the line at all times . And do n't be afraid to encourage non-formal communication either . <p> Set up chat rooms for sharing fun stories and pictures to lighten up the mood and allow your teams to have fun together and learn about each other on a personal level while working on projects . <h> - Respect Everyone 's Time <p> The fact that you are not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not handled correctly . In a best case scenario , your teams will have several hours of overlapping work time so that they can work together in real time . <p> But when it 's time for your foreign team to go home , you need to respect those boundaries . Sending them emails that they should respond to the next day is no big deal , but constantly asking them to work from home after they have worked an entire shift of their own can be very daunting and could create tension . <p> If you 're in a situation in which you are going to need to talk to someone on that team on a regular basis after work hours , it could be a good idea to divide the dsitributed team up into earlier and later shifts . <h> Delegate Headhunting Duties <p> This is a phase that should come a bit later in the process . Many people begin assembling distributed teams through online job sites and eventually expand to a point where they can open up an office in a foreign country . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let people at that location help you in recruiting new team members . Hopefully , you have already built trusting relationships with some of the senior members of your distributed team . Not only do they know what your product needs , they also know their own community a lot better than you do . <p> Of course , you should always screen new candidates yourself and have the last say , but putting the preliminary process in the hands of the most trusted people in your offshore office will certainly help you to get the best talent possible . <h> Conclusion <p> There really is no two ways about it ; running a successful team that is distributed around the world is a very complex and challenging proposition . But at the same time , it is one that will pay significant dividends if you manage to get it right . <p> Not only can you save a lot of money working this way , adding a multi-cultural spirit to your company can give your entire operation a new creative edge and unique prespective.

It is <p> Many businesses have a night shift which means that they are able to offer a service around the clock or that they are able to keep manufacturing goods twenty-four hours a day . A night shift is a good move for manufacturers because it reduces the need for expensive equipment being left idle overnight . It is also the case now that there are many services that customers expect to be available at all hours and the numbers of such services are on the increase ; for example customers now want to be able to do their supermarket shopping around the clock . There will also be certain services , such as nursing , where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night shift can be a problem for some businesses ; this shift can be unpopular with some employees . There are different ways of dealing with this issue . You may decide that you will have permanent night shift members of staff who will only ever do nights or you might decide that all your staff should take turns doing them and use a rotating shift system . There are pros can cons with each of these solutions and the final choice will depend on the demands of your business and your staff . <p> It is always a good idea to involve the employees in any decisions about how you are going to staff the night shift . This way there will be fewer reasons for contention , and at least some of the staff will get a system that they are happy with .

If you have a permanent night shift team this will be less of an issue . <p> It is often the case the employees on the permanent night shift get left out when it comes to staff training . Efforts should be made to ensure that this does not happen and that the night staff members are kept up to date . One way of dealing with this is to appoint a member of the night shift staff to be responsible for staff training . There will be some training that will be only available during the day , but it is probably not a good idea to be frequently demanding the night staff to attend these when they should be sleeping . It is also important that efforts are made to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the overall team and not view themselves as a separate team .

Your menu content is stored online.Hatchware- and- Mvix- are two examples of online menu and signage software applications for restaurants . <p> Type #2 : Apps for Reservations Reservations used to be complicated . The process involved the customer calling the restaurant and someone at the restaurant writing the customers name on a list for a specific date and time. - Naturally , the manual method left a lot of room for human errorsuch as the list getting lost or a customers name recorded for the wrong day or time .

Everyone likes to get a little reward every now and then . Most restaurant loyalty programs reward the customer with a discounted or free purchase after they 've paid for a certain number of meals . Some restaurants use a cardboard loyalty card to track customer purchases . Each time the customer comes in a restaurant employee punches a hole in or stamps the loyalty card . When the loyalty card fills up , the customer receives their reward . Other systems use plastic cards . It sounds simple , right ? Well , its not . Customers get upset when they forget their card .

@@20687053 @687053/ <h> How to Get Employees to Use Their Time Off <p> Too many hours at the office can make Jack ( and Jill ) depressed , anxious , exhausted and grumpy as well . <p> Burnout is hard to come back from , and will cost you dedicated , skilled people . Every employer has a " crunch time " during the year when all hands really need to be on deck . However , - making sure that all of your employees get a chance to take personal time off is of equal importance . <p> There are many reasons why this happens . Some are afraid that they will lose their jobs , others do n't  want to fall behind at work while on vacation . Some believe that if they work more , there will be a better chance that they will be rewarded with a pay raise . <p> That 's why your job as a responsible business owner should be to encourage your staff to use their vacation days in order to keep them happy , healthy and motivated . Not sure how to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More Rollovers <p> A great way to encourage people to at least take their paid time off is to stop allowing them to roll all of it over . Many workers who have rollover options operate under the premise that they are going to one day need all those free days , so its best to save them up . <p> In most cases , however , they never end up taking them . One way to encourage employees to use all of their days is to let them know that rollovers are no longer an option . <p> Give them plenty of lead time on this arrangement so nobody is blind-sided ; for folks with a lot of stored time , it will be hard to use it all and losing it can be very frustrating . <p> Another option is to give those with more hours than a certain threshold the chance to arrange a one time payout . After that , they have to use it or lose it , and this deadline will turn taking that time into one of their critical goals . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your workers the chance to cash out a portion of that time , but their vacation must be used . This can be a nice incentive for those workers that - you basically have to push out of the office to get them to take a break . <h> Relax the Rules <p> Workers need flexibility when arranging time off . Not everyones partner or family members have a lot of say when they can take time off , so forcing people to arrange things weeks or even months in advance can be off-putting . <p> If you are using an automated scheduling solution like ours , you could even let people put in requests for the next day . As long as they are able to find people to trade their shifts with on short notice , it really should n't affect your business in any way . <p> Why not offer partial day leave possibilities as well ? If two hours is all they need to take care of projects or personal errands , they should be able to take that time off paid without restrictions . Not everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every now and then can really do wonders for morale . <h> Promote Travel <p> If you offer a cash bonus during the holidays or a retirement account bonus , consider investing in your people in other ways . Travel incentives need not be expensive ; an overnight trip to a nearby city with a gift card for a great dinner or tickets to a local concert or sporting event wont break your bonus budget . <p> Travel gifts are also a great way to celebrate meeting professional and personal goals . For example , if a full-time hire has been working to finish his or her degree , help them celebrate with a weekend getaway . <p> Do you have an co-worker who 's a big fan of live music ? A weekend away and a couple of tickets to see their favorite artist could be a great way to reward excellent work , encourage workers to use up paid time off and and build loyalty . <h> Offer Flex Time <p> Another option to promote free time is to allow flex time . Most workers put in a standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 8 hours per day . However , if you have the staffing flexibility , consider allowing people to mix it up to better suit their needs . <p> Maybe someone needs Friday afternoon off , but would rather not take a full vacation day . Why not let them work four 10-hour days so that they can earn all their hours and have a day off at the end of the week ? <p> Of course , its hard to balance those types of schedule requests all the time , but once in a while should n't be difficult . <h> How to Manage Requests <p> A great way to encourage people to plan their paid time off is to discuss their scheduling needs . This can be done one on one , or with a simple ranking exercise . Encourage all of your workers to rank the following : <p> 1 ) Favorite time of year to take a week off . While you may not be able to honor all of these requests , once you have this information you can begin the discussion process . If two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to celebrate with a weekend getaway , they may collaborate and fix the conflict before you even see it ! <p> 2 ) Favorite day of the week to flex . Some people want to leave early Friday and start the weekend early . Others may want Thursday afternoon off to run errands so they do n't  have to do them on Saturday . People need free time to address issues like child care , helping aging parents to the doctor or just keeping their household running . A simple questionnaire can help you determine their scheduling needs and make plans to keep your organization fully staffed . <p> Figuring out staff availability is a big part of the picture . By asking your employees about their preferences , you are showing that you care . And by getting those preferences recorded , you 're making your life a lot easier as well especially when it comes to scheduling staff and always knowing who will be off and when . 
@@20687058 @687058/ <h> How Better Scheduling Can Keep Nurses Safe and Satisfied <p> It 's hard to deny that being a nurse is one of the most stressful and difficult occupations in America today . The obligations that come with this profession can be incredibly taxing on an individual . <p> Every day a nurse comes into work , he or she is responsible for the safety and well-being of others . And as if the amount of physical and mental stress that an average nurse has to endure is n't difficult enough , the demands of the job are further multiplied by the fact that a majority of nurses all over the country and world are required to work incredibly long , often rotating shifts . <p> Any job would be difficult to perform to the best of your abilities when you are entering the 12th hour of your shift , but for nurses , this is something that has unfortunately become the rule rather than the exception . <p> The biggest problem is , unfortunately , the lack of available nurses . The stress of the job coupled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unbreakable cycle in the healthcare industry that has led to nurses having to cover long and often unpredictable shifts with no clear solution in sight . <p> And while it 's going to take a lot more than good scheduling to fix the problems of the nursing industry , finding a way to create better and more efficient schedules is a good start for at least assuaging some of the difficulties that nurses encounter at their places of work . <p> Keeping nurses happier , safer and more satisfied should be the top priority for any healthcare manager looking to retain his or her best nurses . Here 's how creating and implementing a quality scheduling processes can help . <h> Avoiding Burnout <p> Burnout is a very legitimate concern for nurses all over the country . According to this recent study , more than 40 percent of staff nurses are on the verge of burnout and 25 percent of the nurses polled claimed that they expect to leave their jobs at the hospital within the year . <p> Nurses are often scheduled according to the time between their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at when the last scheduled shift ended for that nurse , and schedules the next one according . The problem is that nurses rarely end their shifts when they are supposed to . Working overtime is a very common , even expected , occurrence . <p> The result is that nurses very regularly do not have enough time in between shifts to recover . This is not only detrimental for them , but for their patients as well . <p> Unfortunately , simply avoiding overtime is an impossible mission . The lack of available nurses in hospitals and other care facilities around the country has even ushered in the need for mandatory overtime for nurses in some states . <p> What managers can do is make their scheduling processes more accurate . By having exact information on when their nurses are clocking in and out of shifts , they 'll be able to schedule the next shifts with a real idea of how long each nurse worked and then schedule the next shift enough in advance to give each nurse an ample amount of time to recover and get ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will have to endure . <p> Another important factor of nurse scheduling is giving staff a more balanced shift schedule when it comes to rotating shifts and the times during which they are scheduled to work . Studies have shown that 32 percent of nurses who are perpetually working night shifts and 26 percent of workers who have rotating shifts that are sometimes during the day and sometimes during the evening are prone to suffering from long-term insomnia and sleepiness . <p> This is another form of burnout that leads to performance and safety issues . While scheduling nurses to work overnight is unavoidable , being able to have a better and cleaner overview of your staff schedules can help you to make sure that there are no particular nurses who are getting the short end of the stick and working way more night hours than others . <h> Balancing Work and Personal Lives <p> The fact that nurses often have to work irregular hours , nights and weekends takes a real toll on their social lives and activities outside of work that are related to interactions with family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the weekends and even on holidays can seriously compromise any workers ability to maintain a normal and healthy social life outside of the office . Besides being overworked , this lack of balance between work and social activities is one of the main reasons why nurses tend to be so unhappy and why the turnover rate in hospitals is constantly on the rise . <p> According to this NSI Nursing Solutions report , the turnover rate for bedside registered nurses in 2015 was 17.2 percent and the turnover rate for certified nursing assistants was as high as 23.8 percent . The survey also estimates that hospitals lose in between $5-8 million a year on the turnover of registered nurses , adding that it costs in between $37,000-58,000 to replace one registered nurse . <p> The report also claims that 44 percent of nurses say that their heavy workload is what prevents them from achieving a healthy work/life balance . Once again , while there is no clear cut solution for remedying these problems , one way to help nurses out with this issue is by making sure that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-work-related activities more easily . <p> Nurses regularly receive their schedules less than two weeks in advance , which makes it incredibly hard to make plans of any kind . Not to mention that they are very regularly asked to work overtime on short or almost no notice , which makes it a struggle to plan- any types of activities that are not related to the workplace . <p> Hospitals that are able to create schedules a month or longer in advance and give nurses the luxury of knowing when they are working ahead of time will have an easier time both recruiting and retaining top talent . <h> Providing Better Patient Care <p> Decades of research and studies have shown that there is a real and palpable connection between job satisfaction and a nurse 's ability to provide proper care for his or her patients . <p> If you ask any nurse why he or she puts up with the long hours and everything else that makes the job so hard , most will probably tell you that it 's because they love helping people and they love the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Of course , being able to provide great care often becomes very difficult for nurses because of the overtime , lack of organization , lack of proper sleep , and all of the other contributing factors that result in high turnover rates in the healthcare industry . Nurses want to build real therapeutic relationships with patients and their ability to care for people and communicate with them makes all the difference when it comes to putting their level of job satisfaction into perspective . <p> For managers looking to enable their nurses to get the satisfaction they desire from their job and their relationships with patients , providing some semblance of care continuity works best . Whenever possible , healthcare managers should be keeping records of the relationships between nurses and patients and try to create schedules that will facilitate the ability for nurses to provide continual care or consecutive days to the same patients . <p> This gives nurses the ability to follow through on a patient 's care and establish a relationship . Not only is providing this type of continuity great for nurses , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond better to treatment and therapy when the staff members who are tending to them are not changing every single day .

@@20687078 @687078/ <p> In 2014 , the number of unused vacation days in the U.S. reached a 40-year high with $52.4 billion in benefits being lost . <p> Is it possible that Americans do n't need a vacation ? Are they running on some mysterious fuel that is not accessible to other countries in the world ? <p> Of course not . Yet , it seems that they are afraid to take their vacations , considering the fact that , on the average , each U.S. employee fails to use about five paid vacation days a year . <h> Why Are They Not Taking Breaks ? <p> The majority of American workers feel guilty about taking a break from work . This is mostly because they are afraid of being left out of important decisions and events during their time off . They are also afraid of the amount of work that will pile up in the meantime . Many are also afraid of being fired . <p> What could be the reason for this ? Some employers might feel that managing vacations can be a huge pain one that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right tools for managing employee leave requests , leaving them with a constant nagging fear that employee time off will inevitably lead to scheduling missteps , empty shifts and understaffing . Or , it might be that their vacation policy just is n't good enough . <p> In the end , these alarming statistics point out to the fact that the American workers are constantly close to burning out . They just never disengage , not on the weekends , not during their vacation , not ever , really . <p> Whether they are afraid of taking the time off or they feel like there is something they should be working on instead of lying on the beach , not taking a break from work can have serious consequences . Productivity and mental and physical health are the biggest victims of this harmful trend . <p> Here 's why getting rest is important and why you should be encouraging employees to take time off . <h> Vacation Policy And Better Productivity <p> Employees and employers who are not taking breaks from work every now and then tend to be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your workplace , the less productive you and your employees will be . With stress comes anxiety . When your employees are worried , anxious and generally unhappy , they tend to have a harder time focusing on their work . <p> This inevitably leads to a fall off in productivity . According to a report by Expedia on vacation deprivation , 85 percent of employees around the world say that they are happier at work once returning from a vacation . The happier your employees are , the more productive they are and the better they get at collaborating and working with others . <p> Taking vacations can also increase creativity at work , which can lead to innovation and new ideas being presented to you by your employees . When people take time off from work , they open themselves up to new experiences that deviate a bit from their everyday grind . <p> Seeing new things and simply thinking about things other than work from time to time can spark the imagination and lead to employees coming up with innovative work-related ideas that they might never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to disconnect from the workplace for a bit . <h> Improved Mental and Physical Health <p> You simply ca n't underestimate and take for granted the mental and physical health of your employees . Not only does work related stress result in unhappy and unproductive employees , it also costs you a lot of money as an employer . <p> According to this study by the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work , stress costs the average employer $2,770 per year , per employee . That 's a total of more than $300 billion a year for American companies . You are not only losing money because your employees are less productive when they are tired and unhappy , you 're also losing money because of absenteeism , employee turnover and medical and insurance fees . <p> Taking vacations allows employees to get more sleep , which leads to better brain function and improved performance once they return . The health of your employees should be of paramount concern to you . The better they feel mentally and physically , the better they perform , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and productive they will be . <p> If you 're not encouraging your employees to take time off because you wrongfully assume that you 're saving time and money when your staff is always available , it 's time to realize that that 's simply not true . <p> Having well-rested and content employees is better for both you and your staff in the long-run . <p> If the fact that your methods of tracking employee vacations are outdated and complicated is still your main reason for not encouraging them to take vacations , it 's time to find a better method and stop using that excuse for putting your business and your employees at risk !

The mission of the Children 's Museum of the Arts is to extend the benefits of the arts to all children and their communities and to secure the future of the arts by inspiring and championing the next generation of artists and art lovers. - They work to fulfill our mission by providing authentic hands-on art experiences for children with artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , and by collecting and exhibiting children 's art .

As the museum runs with multiple departments and their employees have multiple positions so it was hard to keep track of who is scheduled for which position in which department and also it was important to ensure that employees are not scheduled for overlapping shifts . It was not only hard to keep track of all these things with spreadsheet software but also inefficient and time consuming . The museum needed an intelligent employee schedule maker which is easy to use and can keep track of all the scheduling activities .

Humanity 's schedule maker is integrated with a- time clock system- so all the employees can clock in/out from the same system and the managers can easily monitor all the activity . The managers can approve , change employee shifts and clock in/out timings in real time . <p> When asked about the favourite thing about Humanity , Anna DuBose , Administrative Assistant at the museum said , <p> The ability to approve time clocks as soon as the shift has been completed .

@@20687124 @687124/ <h> Why Your Employees Should Love Clocking Into Shifts <p> Most employees believe that tracking systems are only meant for the employers benefit . Needless to say , it does help an organization keep a precise record of employee absence and attendance for accurate processing of payrolls and efficient management of the workforce . However , there are also plenty of benefits for the employees who dutifully clock in their presence at work . <p> Your staff almost always thinks that new attendance systems are an annoyance . This resistance can impact the implementation process of new systems and may even lead to its complete failure if your workforce is not onboard with the plan . <p> The dislike associated with a clock in system arise from the misconception that software like biometrics indicate that the company does n't  trust its employees . However , this is not true ; and this is the reason why your staff needs to know the benefits of accurate clocking practices , not just for the companys good , but their own . <p> Here are some reasons managers should make their staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process and duty of time tracking . <p> It is important for them to realize that time tracking systems may seem like an extra step at first , but it will help the organization in keeping a more accurate record of employee absence and allow them to efficiently process their payments at the end of the month . <p> Even a simple software upgrade can go a long way in automating the whole process and result in seamless management of employees and other systems . Using biometric solutions , or even terminal devices that simply take staff pictures upon clocking in and out , will record the exact start and stop times for more accurate processing of payrolls in the end . <p> By employing such a system , clerical errors can be eliminated , enabling the software to calculate workdays and work hours for flawless payroll reports . <h> Better Organization Across the Board <p> There may be some employees in your organization who work diligently for the number of hours they are supposed to , while other reckless ones spend hours taking long lunches and coffee breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be paid the same and to be treated equally , because they are employees who are clearly working harder and more honestly than others . <p> Installing automated clock in software will weed out such malpractices and create a fair work culture . It will also help ease the workload on people who have to work more because of some people who are not as committed to their jobs . <p> Many small businesses also have to deal with buddy clocking very often , a process in which one employee clocks in and out for another in an effort to cheat the system . The truth is that employees cheating on timesheets happens , even on the federal level . <p> Since it is practically impossible to monitor each and every employee absence without an automated system , implementing a time-in-time-out biometric or clock in software system will prevent the slackers from getting away with late arrivals , early departures , and long breaks . <h> Better Workplace Culture <p> Making sure that everyone is treated fairly and that no one is able to cheat your system even if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive workplace culture through time and attendance monitoring . <p> While some employees who like to take advantage of your lack of a time clocking system will at first surely not like the fact that they are not going to be able to cheat on their timesheets any longer , they certainly are n't the employees that you should be trying to accommodate . <p> Having a time and attendance system installed makes it easier to filter out the employees that do n't care about having a strong and positive workplace culture . Likewise , it gives your honest and hardworking employees more reason to stick with you , since it allows them to identify you as a business owner that cares about establishing a workplace culture that is built on trust and respect . <h> Increased Convenience <p> Many employees do n't realize at first that clocking in is a convenient process in this day and age . You 're not using an old mechanized time clock like your parents may have used . In fact , most time and attendance tracking methods can be accessed via smart phones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that allow your employees to accurately clock themselves in , no matter where they are . <p> Humanity , for example , allows employees to set up terminals at remote locations if they have employees who work outside of their set business locations . This makes it convenient for staff to check in wherever they are and it makes it even easier for managers to always know where their employees are clocking in and out , since most of these solutions use GPS technology to confirm staff locations . <p> Use the power of web-based app that makes it easier for you and your employees to adapt to the new software . <p> When you have mobile tracking methods , your employees will never be able to slack off their clocking in responsibility again . Even your off-site employees will be able to use the app for regular punch-ins and enjoy in the fact that clocking in only takes one tap on their smartphone of choice . <h> Greater Transparency <p> Payroll becomes much easier and manageable in the presence of transparent systems . No more erroneous calculations and clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . <p> For employees , having transparency in the time and attendance process also levels the playing field and ensures them that the same rules for clocking work time apply to everyone in the organization . <p> An automated system gives you accurate record of all the workdays to correspond with your paycheck in the end . Most importantly , with these tracking systems , your employees will know exactly how many extra hours they worked during the month . <p> Usually , the law makes it mandatory for employers to compensate for overtime . Your employees will be able to demand what is rightfully theirs if they are armed with this information . <p> With a time clock solution , transparency is guaranteed and employees know that they can demand overtime pay if the proof that they have worked extra hours is visible and available to everyone in the company . <h> Why Managers Love It <p> It is amazing how sophisticated time-tracking has become these days . Companies are incorporating all kinds of technologies , from mobile app time clocks to GPS , digital sheets to remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it easy for employees to track their attendance and see their timesheets in real time . <p> Give them the ability to see when their attendance is required and alerting them to shifts can prevent them from skipping day at work due to oversight . Employees can be notified on their mobile phones if they forget to punch in at work or come in late . <p> Furthermore , GPS-enabled tracking systems can help develop a clear mechanism for monitoring employees that work remotely . There are also geofencing options available to apply restrictions on where the employee can clock him or herself in or out . <p> Time tracking and clocking in practices help create transparency in the system and allow both employees and the employer to have greater power over their time and attendance information . While the company can cut massive costs by keeping tighter control over accurate payrolls , employees can also benefit by demanding exact salaries , including overtime . <p> Once your employees learn the benefits of working with the system , they will see how beneficial it is for them and their workplace happiness and growth .

Likewise , working to establish and improve one will positively influence the other . <p> As a business owner , there is no doubt that you would love to reach a level of brand and customer loyalty at which your brand stands for something positive something that your customers rally behind and are proud to champion . <p> But how do you go about building and maintaining that type of loyalty for your brand ? <h> Identifying Transaction vs . Relationship <p> Consumers are typically one of two categories ; relationship or transaction consumers . Transaction consumers are needed for your bottom line . They are typically attracted to your establishment because they are looking for the best value or the best deal . <p> These types of consumers base their purchase decisions on great features , convenience , and most importantly , price . While your profits depend on transaction consumers , you should not rely on them too heavily for building your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your competitors if they find a better deal with them . <p> This is not to say that transaction consumers will never fall into the relationship category , however . If a transaction-driven consumer finds value in your product beyond price , they can easily become a relationship consumer . <p> Relationship consumers are exactly the type of people you should be looking to target and nurture when trying to increase your customer and brand loyalty . They value the trust , loyalty , and commitment to a specific brand more so than finding a great deal . <p> These types of consumers are more likely to stick with a specific brand that they have been using and have built trust in and are exactly the kind of clientele every business wants to have . <h> Quality is King <p> One of the best ways to boost or build your brand and loyalty among consumers is by ensuring that your product or service is of the best quality , to ensure your consumers have a positive experience .

However , when it comes to building brand awareness and customer loyalty , it is even more important . Stay updated on what is happening in your industry and what new technologies are available that you can offer to potential and existing shoppers . <p> Analyze what your competition is doing on a regular basis .

Conversely , not updating your marketing strategies can make it appear as though you and your brand are outdated and content with the status quo . <h> Learn What Your Customers Think of You <p> The best way to find out if you have a quality brand is to go straight to the source , your customers . Asking the consumer to provide you with feedback can give you valuable insight on what areas you are doing great in and what areas you need to improve upon . Were they satisfied with the product or service ? If not , what was the reason ? <p> Polling your customers also allows you to see what aspect of your branding and business they are responding to best and what aspects are turning them off .

Let the consumer do some of the work for you by spreading the good work about you and helping you pull in new potential clients by word of mouth . By offering an incentive for referring their friends and family to your company , such as discounts , you are effectively building your bottom line and reinforcing loyalty at the same time . <p> Offering discounts for repeat customers is another great tactic for not only attracting relationship-driven consumers , it is also a great way to convert transaction-driven consumers into the relationship category . <p> By offering a discount or other incentives to repeat customers , you not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you appreciate their business .

@@20687144 @687144/ <h> 5 Benefits and Incentives Employees Actually Want <p> We all know that happy employees tend to be the most productive and loyal ones . When it comes to achieving employee happiness , the basics still ring true . Just about everyone responds well to praise , better salaries , more time off , positive company culture , and- other employee benefits . <p> In the end , it all comes down to making your employees feel appreciated . Providing them with benefits and incentives is a great way to show them that you care and that you want them with you for the long run . However , sometimes it 's hard to decide what benefits you should be offering . <p> When going through the process of determining what types of benefits you have to offer , the most important thing you need to do is narrow your choices down to incentives that you believe a large majority of your employees would enjoy having , regardless of their age or experience . For example , while Millennials tend to respond well to benefits such as company trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fridays , your older workers might not be too excited about these types of benefits . <p> Today , offering the right benefits is more critical than ever when it comes to keeping employees happy . According to a survey by the Society for Human Resource Management conducted last year , 63 percent of employees believe that quality benefits are very important when it comes to overall job satisfaction . <p> The trick is to evaluate your options and settle on benefits that are hard not to like . They do n't have to all be monetary , in fact , it 's better that you offer a variety of benefits that do n't just work towards improving your employee 's financial situation , but offer ones that positively influence other aspects of their work lives as well . <p> Here are five examples of incentives that you can offer that everyone on your staff can immediately benefit from and , in turn , welcome with open arms . <h> Greater Work Independence <p> Generally , employees seek guidance from management , but they do n't respond well to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees respond to greater independence with greater productivity . <p> Let them know what needs to be done and when it needs to be finished by , but then give them the independence to get the job done according to their preferences . Taking into consideration the work preferences of your staff is a huge part of giving them greater independence . If you have hourly workers , include them in the process of creating their work schedules by asking them what hours and days work best for them . <p> Let them tell you about their availability so that they can not only get the shifts they want , but management can also have the information it needs to create schedules that take everyone 's needs into consideration . <p> Independence is not about letting your staff run wild . It 's about avoiding micro-management and allowing them to get their tasks done in a way that works best for them . If you want to give your employees a meaningful level of independence , do it in two steps : first , involve them more in planning their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust them by giving them enough breathing room to complete their tasks without being micro-managed . <p> Studies have proven that autonomy not only breeds happier employees but also increases productivity . It 's a win-win situation . <h> Education and Development Opportunities <p> Your best employees are always looking to learn new things and move up in the ranks . It 's your job to facilitate the possibility of development within your company if you want to keep them . According to a survey conducted by Glassdoor in 2014 , more than 60 percent of employees believe that the best way for them to advance their careers is to receive special training and learn new skills on the job . <p> Development is , in fact , so important to employees that a majority rank it higher on their list of motivators than getting raises . Another great thing about providing educational opportunities for your employees is the fact that education assistance and sending your employees back to school is tax-exempt . <p> Offering your employees the chance to learn new skills and to grow professionally within your ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you believe in them . <h> Better Healthcare Options <p> Healthcare costs are always on the rise and now more than ever , employees really care about having quality health coverage . To help meet these needs as an employer , one route you can go is to introduce health savings accounts for your employees . <p> Again , it 's another win-win case . The contributions that you make to employee health savings accounts are tax-free and by taking this route , you are also maintaining better control of the healthcare plans you offer , which allows you to save even more money if you are willing to be diligent about it . <p> Employees also love health savings accounts because they can be transferred from company to company . Essentially , that means that if they leave your company and start working for another company that offers a similar program , the money they have accrued while working with you will remain in their accounts no matter what and continue to grow . <h> Benefits for Commuters <p> Employers sometimes forget that the work day starts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to their shifts . The commute to and from work is not only a big part of many people 's days , it also happens to be one of the most stressful parts of the workday for many . <p> Studies have shown that the commute has a very real effect on the well-being of your employees , especially if it is a stressful one . According to a study published in Transportation Research , people who commute to work via any mode of transportation tend to be more anxious and stressed out at the workplace as a result . <p> Because of this , there are many states that are now offering employees commuter benefits , which are once again excellent for both staff and employers . While the commute will inevitably remain an inconvenience for most , the fact that the money spent on getting to work and returning home is n't coming out of their pockets helps to make it all a bit easier for many employees to cope with . And since commuter benefits are tax-free transportation benefits , payroll taxes do not apply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Psychological Association shows that employees perform at a higher level when they feel as if they are appreciated and valued by management . Offering achievement awards and performance bonuses is a great way to not only motivate your staff , but also show your appreciation . <p> The bonuses or awards do n't always have to be monetary either . You can talk to your employees and ask them what types of awards they would prefer . Perhaps some would rather take extra vacation time over money . <p> That 's another important thing to think about when starting to brainstorm ideas for offering employee benefits . Poll your staff and ask them about it . Let them tell you what they find most important and what types of benefits they would most appreciate . Sure , you might not be able to reach a full consensus , but getting honest input from your staff throughout the process is the best way to start putting an effective benefit program together for your team .

@@20687148 @687148/ <h> Free Employee Schedule Template <p> If you 're still scheduling your employees using pen and paper and then calling them individually or making them come into work to learn when they are working , you are living in the past and need to modernize your process . <p> Using employee scheduling templates is one of the best ways to go about managing your staff more effectively . Both Excel spreadsheets and Google Sheets are a good option for putting your template together . <p> Why is it so important ? Because having the right employees scheduled to work at the right time is of paramount importance to the success of your business . Good scheduling saves you time and money and the best scheduling templates will allow you to do the following : <p> Quickly share the schedule with your staff so that everyone is on the same page <p> Give your staff the opportunity to make you aware of any shift preferences they may have <p> Allow you to easily create , but also change , your schedule and notify your staff when necessary <p> Make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all staff members in real time , from anywhere <h> Creating Great Employee Work Schedules Using Spreadsheets <p> Microsoft Excel can easily claim the title as one of the most useful computing tools for business that has ever been created . It can be used for so many things , one one thing that it 's very commonly used for is employee scheduling . <p> Anyone who has managed a team knows that creating work schedules is a difficult task during which you have to take many things into consideration.It 's especially difficult when you are scheduling a larger team or hourly workers who seem to never work the same shift twice . <p> Thankfully , you can make that process a bit easier on yourself by using Excel . Here are some tips to consider when using a scheduling template in Excel in order to make the process as intuitive and productive as possible . <h> Keep Employee Preferences In Mind <p> Before you start creating your schedule in Excel , you need to survey your staff and see if they have any work preferences that can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is especially true when scheduling restaurant , call center , retail or healthcare workers for example - employees who have constantly changing and irregular work schedules . <p> See if you have any employees with certain preferences . Do they prefer weekends or weekdays ? Days or nights ? If you have this information available to you ahead of time , you are going to be able to enter the process anticipating potential scheduling problems and conflicts . It 's basically going to allow you to make a schedule with less stress . <p> Of course , there are always going to be changes that you are going to have to make and you 'll hardly ever be able to create a perfect schedule with your first draft . But if you have this information ahead of time , there 's definitely going to be less headaches for you in the long run . <p> You 're not going to be able to accommodate everyone 's needs and preferences all of the time , but asking them about their preferences ahead of time helps to build trust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . Employees really appreciate it when they can have their say in the scheduling process . <h> Create the Schedule Well in Advance <p> As mentioned earlier , you 're never going to have a perfect schedule on your hands after your first effort . The first draft of your schedule is almost never your final one . That 's why it 's always a good idea to schedule in advance and to have schedule drafts ready at least a week or so before these shifts are actually going to happen . <p> By having a template schedule put together well in advance , you 're giving yourself some breathing room and getting rid of some of the pressure that comes with having to schedule quickly . You 're giving yourself time to make the necessary changes that are going to have to be made to your schedule so that you 're avoiding conflicts and not leaving shifts open or unfilled . <p> Your best bet would be to first schedule all of the shifts that are absolute priorities - shifts for which you already have a clear idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when that 's done , you can tackle the other shifts that are less clear and obvious . <h> Always Have a Plan B <p> Starting to put your schedule together well in advance also gives you the opportunity to experiment a little bit and create several different versions of the schedule before you settle on one . It might take a bit of extra effort , but it pays off in the end . You 'll be able to see what works best and identify trends that are going to help you get better at creating work schedules with every next effort . <p> It 's also a good idea to give your employees early access to the schedule or schedules , so that they can give their feedback on the process . <h> How Employee Scheduling Has Evolved <p> In today 's day and age , putting together work schedules for your employees is definitely not an easy task . Well , it never really was to begin with . As technology has made advancements , however , the process has become a bit less complex . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Managers had to create work schedules using pen and paper mostly , and then relay the schedules to employees individually - usually by phone . Sure , it 's not really a problem when you are dealing with a team that has fixed 9-5 hours that do n't change all that often . <p> But if you are working with hourly employees , then the job gets infinitely harder . If you 're running a healthcare facility , restaurant or retail store , for example , you have a lot of work ahead of you . These types of industries deal mostly with hourly workers who have constantly changing schedules . Employees tend to be part-time workers - like students who need to balance their workloads with their school work . You can imagine then how hard it used to be when the only way to communicate with your employees was either in person or by telephone . <p> What if an employee cancelled on your last minute ? What if you made a mistake and double-booked a shift ? How are you going to fix it ? It certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet <p> As personal computers began to be more readily available and people started using them more , many managers and schedulers started taking their schedules from notebooks to spreadsheets . Microsoft Excel was , of course , the most popular one for people to use . You had a nice place to start - a gridded sheet that was a lot easier to alter than before . But it was n't until the Internet arrived that it was easier to distribute the schedules and communicate with your staff . <p> Many businesses these days use Excel templates to create work schedules for their teams . They then send the templates out to employees so that they can see when they are working . Of course , this was n't the most convenient method either . For example , if you made a mistake in your spreadsheet , you would have to change it and then resend the work schedule all over again . <p> The next innovation that came was Google Sheets . Managers could now make changes that their employees could follow in real time and check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But regardless of the progress that has been made from pen and paper , to Excel and to online spreadsheets that live in the cloud , there 's still a lot left to be desired . Enter online employee scheduling software . <h> Online Employee Scheduling Software <p> The next revolution in employee scheduling - taking everything you do to the cloud . The rise of employee scheduling software has been a true revolution , even though there are still many businesses out there that have yet to switch to this method because they are n't aware that it exists , believe it 's too complicated , or believe that it 's too expensive - none of which is true . <p> Firstly , most employee scheduling software is incredibly intuitive and designed to make it incredibly easy to schedule your staff . Unlike with Excel or online spreadsheets , you do n't have to start from scratch . Everything is laid out for and highly customizable to fit your business needs . <p> And it 's certainly not very expensive , costing little more than a dollar a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so revolutionary ? Because employee scheduling and workforce management software makes the entire process much more intuitive and fluid . It saves managers incredible amounts of time and money when it comes to how they are running their businesses - not just in the scheduling facet , but in many other ones as well . <p> When using an employee scheduling application and working in the cloud , your employee scheduling process is so much easier . Here 's how : <h> There 's no human error <p> Employee scheduling software is smart enough to recognize your schedule mistakes and notify you so that you can make the necessary changes . For example , if you have forgotten to fill a shift or if you have double-booked a shift , the software will immediately notice that and inform you . Many have conflict checkers that analyze your schedules to make sure that you have not scheduled any conflicts between workers . If you have , the application will show the conflicts to you and even give you recommendations on how to fix it . <h> Communication is better <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to send your employees and email or call them on the phone to tell them that there is a new schedule for them to check out . The software will immediately notify all your employees of the new schedule , either by email or SMS , as soon as you publish the schedule . <p> Most employee scheduling apps also have internal communication options and chats that employees can use to communicate with each other online . <p> Using the software , employees can clock in and out from anywhere they want , and the software can also confirm their locations via GPS . <p> Most importantly , managers now have all this information available to them . They can easily keep track of who is coming in late or leaving early . They can simply turn this time and attendance data into reports and export the information into spreadsheets . <p> And now that managers have this time and attendance information that is easily compiled and always accurate , it makes taking the data to payroll a lot easier as well . And if you 're using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem either . Most of the best employee scheduling applications integrate with all of the most popular payroll software solutions on the market . <p> Bottom line : Using employee scheduling software saves you time and money by making every aspect of managing your employees much easier and more intuitive . This decrease the time managers need to spend on scheduling and bookkeeping so that they can have more time to lead their employees and focus on the success and development of their businesses . <h> Employee Happiness <p> Not only are managers and employers happier using employee scheduling software , employees love it as well . Using a cloud solution is much more convenient for employees and it gives them an added level of independence that was previously impossible to afford them . <p> Not only are employees notified whenever their schedules change , they can see their schedules in real time from anywhere , whether using a desktop computer or smartphone . Employee scheduling software also puts the employees in the driver 's seat and makes the scheduling process much more collaborative . <p> For example , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their availability , letting management know when they can and ca n't work in order to avoid conflicts and problems in the scheduling process . Using employees scheduling software , staff can also initiate shift trades and swaps on their own . If they want to drop a shift and ask someone else to pick it up , or if they want to trade shift with a co-worker , they can forward those requests to management directly . <p> Employees can also put in requests for leave and other types of personal time off and get notifications directly on their smartphones when management decides to either approve or reject the request .

Here 's how Humanity makes this drastic drop-off in time spent scheduling possible . <h> Personalize Your Process <p> Every retail business has its own set of needs , no matter what branch you are in . There are no two retail stores that are the same , even when you 're dealing with chain stores . Humanity realizes this and that 's why our software is made to be easily customizable . <p> Are you managing two retail locations at the same time ? No problem .

You can create custom fields , custom roles and even put together custom reports that specifically give you the data that you need most to manage your team better . <p> Often in retail , you are not sure of who is available for a particular shift . You might want to just create a shift and then ask your employees to take a look and see if they are able to pick it up . With Humanity , this process is easier than ever . You can simply create an empty shift and then allow anyone who wants to work it to claim it . Of course , only people who meet the specifications you set ( skills , positions , etc ) will be able to pick these shifts up . <p> All these features only scratch the surface when it comes to the number of ways in which Humanity is customizable .

Perhaps you are using point of sale software or a payroll application along with Humanity ? Humanity supports an ever-growing list of integrations with popular business tools so you can take vital business data from other software and sync it with Humanity so that you can optimize your scheduling process based on real business data and KPIs . <h> Boost Employee Morale and Happiness <p> The retail industry has a huge problem with turnover . It 's a problem in just about any industry that relies on hourly staff , but it 's a pronounced problem in retail because of the stress levels that often come with the job . The best way to keep your best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When employees have less stress at their jobs , they are more engaged and are less likely to leave you . Humanity can help you keep your best workers and keep your retail staff happy . Here 's how : <h> Avoid Confusion <p> One of the biggest problems that retail workers claim to have is not knowing exactly when they are working and getting notified of shift changes on short notice . These problems become problems of the past once you start using Humanity . <p> As soon as the retail manager creates a schedule using Humanity and publishes it , notifications go out to every staff member who is scheduled to work shifts . All employees will immediately receive emails and SMS messages telling them when they are scheduled to work . <p> And if the manager has to make any changes to the schedule at any moment , all retail employees who are affected by those changes will be notified immediately once again . On top of that , retail employees can use the Humanity mobile app to see their schedules at any time . Whenever they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal computers , they are always seeing a real time picture of their most recent schedule . <p> This not only helps employees by decreasing the amount of confusion they have regarding when and with whom they are working , it also helps managers by making it almost impossible for retail employees to miss shifts or arrive late to work them because they simply were not aware of them on time . <h> Boost Staff Independence <p> Another way to increase retail employee satisfaction and engagement is to give them more freedom and independence in the entire scheduling process . That 's yet another way in which Humanity can help both you and your staff . <p> Humanity has an availability system that let 's all your retail workers input their availability . This means that they can let management know when they can and ca n't work each week or at least let them know what their shift preferences are from week to week . Some of your retail workers might be students who have classes during the day and would prefer it if they could work afternoons . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children are in school . <p> With Humanity , all of these preferences can be communicated directly to management . This also helps management to make better schedules , because managers will then know when to schedule certain staff members and when not to . It saves everyone a lot of time and it gives your retail employees a voice throughout the process . <p> Retail workers are also able to request shift trades independently using Humanity . As you probably already know , something tends to come up a lot when you 're managing retail staff . It happens regularly that staff members find out about obligations a day or two before and need to scramble to find someone to fill in for them . This causes stress for everyone . It causes stress for the worker , you needs to find someone to cover for them , and it causes stress for managers who have to scramble last minute to find a suitable worker who is available to cover . <p> With Humanity , retail workers can figure it out among themselves , without ever having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacement , he or she can simply put in a shift trade request and all of the manager has to do is either reject or approve the trade once he or she has evaluated it . <h> Say goodbye to spreadsheets and hello to modern scheduling software today !

In a setting in which you are in close contact with the same people on an everyday basis , you tend to create relationships with these people . Still , is the friend and boss relationship possible ? <p> This often leads to not simply work relationships , but real friendships . Your coworkers talk to you about personal issues and these relationships often lead to friendships and contact outside of work . <p> While there 's certainly nothing wrong with employees developing close personal relationships with one another , the dynamic between the boss and employee is a bit different . <p> As a leader , managers and bosses have to be careful of the way they conduct themselves with their employees .

If you are a boss or manager , it 's all about balance when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand , you should avoid extremely close personal friendships with employees , but on the other , you need to let them know you care about them as individuals , not just as workers . <h> Why You Ca n't Be Best Friends <p> When you are leading a team , you have more responsibilities . Those responsibilities include making tough decisions and evaluating employees . <p> Imagine having to evaluate someone who is very close to you . Or imagine having to fire a person you became good friends with over the years . <p> Kim Scott , co-founder of Candor , Inc , says that good bosses need to show that they care on a personal level . However , she also says that good managers need to challenge their employees directly . According to Kim , employees need guidance , not close friendships from their managers . This balance is something she calls Radical Candor . <h> Fairness is Important <p> As a leader , you need to avoid any perception of favoritism , and helping out a buddy at work is the definition of favoritism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building up fast . If you are going out for drinks every night with one of your employees and hanging out with that person on the weekends , be certain that all of your other staff members will notice . <p> This can lead to the creation of a perception of favoritism and unfair treatment , even if it does not really exist . <p> Other will think that they have no chance at growth opportunities and that the employees you are closest with will end up being the ones who will most likely receive raises and promotions that are n't based on performance . <p> Career development opportunities should be strictly based on performance and skills . That 's why you need to make sure that everyone in your team knows that they share the same advancement opportunities that are strictly based on the merit and most importantly , you need to avoid creating the perception that there are certain employees who might have a leg up on the rest because of their close personal relationship with you . <h> Tough Decisions are Inevitable <p> When you 're friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing flaws or setting your personal feelings aside when necessary . For example , you may overlook their mistakes because you have an emotional connection with them . <p> Your friendship with an employee should never influence your decisions about raises , assignments and layoffs . Firing bad employees is an unavoidable part of your job and you ca n't hold someone to a different set of performance criteria just because you are friends . <h> Evaluations are Necessary <p> All managers evaluate and challenge their employees . It 's a part of the job . <p> If you befriend someone at work , they might get the impression that they are above evaluation and discipline . <p> Also , friends do n't really challenge each other at work . In business , challenging employees is necessary for any kind of progress .

Challenge them and show that you care about their careers and personal lives . There are lines that can and must be drawn . <p> Here are a few things you can do to find the perfect balance . <h> Be Supportive <p> Friends want the best for each other , right ? The same goes for your team . <p> If they are going through a difficult time , show them you are willing to help and give them advice . You can show empathy for their problems without getting involved in them personally . <p> You do n't have to be best buddies with your employees in order to know their strengths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best for them , invest in their knowledge and skills . Teach them how to succeed . After all , they are your most important asset at work . <h> Be Honest <p> All strong relationships are built on honesty . And just like a good friend would tell you when you are doing something wrong no matter how much it hurts , a good manager will use open communication to help employees become better at what they do . <p> Honesty is one of the best principles you can use to establish a healthy balance between caring your employees and leading them professionally . The closer you get to someone on a personal level , the harder it becomes to give them honest feedback as employees . <h> Be Trusting and Understanding <p> Trust builds friendships , but it also builds healthy and productive relationships between bosses and staff . <p> When you trust your employees , you inevitably give them more freedom .

If you 're going to have a Halloween party at work , keep it PG rated . <p> Hold Contests <p> Costume parties are usually fun , but costume contests might not always be . There are usually serious downsides to competitive activities within the office , and costume contests are no different . Firstly , it might make your employees overspend on elaborate costumes . <p> A contest could also lead to inappropriate and offensive costumes being inadvertently worn in order to get attention .

@@20687179 @687179/ <h> 6 Ways Small Business Owners Can Reduce Stress <p> Anyone running a small business knows that it can be overwhelming at times . Truthfully , if could feel overwhelming most of the time . The reason that owning and running your own business is so stressful is that everything , or just about everything , tends falls on your shoulders . <p> You are expected to wear a number of hats at once and there seems to always be an endless number of tasks and actions that await you day in and day out . <p> According to the 2012 Small Business Owner Report from the Bank of America , many small business owners claimed that twice as much stress in their lives comes from running their businesses compared to the stress involved in maintaining a healthy relationship with a partner . They also claimed that running a small business was much more stressful than both managing their personal finances and raising their children . <p> That 's a lot of stress ! <p> Ultimately , the stress tends to be worth it if you are living your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or product to people that you truly believe in . However , that does n't mean that there 's nothing you can do to relieve a bit of the everyday stress , or at least manage it a little better . <p> At the end of the day , your health needs to be prioritized above all else , and high levels of stress on a regular basis can have very negative effects on both your mental and physical health . <p> If you 're a small business owner that deals with high levels of work-related stress every day , here are some actions you can take to help reduce stress and stay healthy . <h> Automate <p> Technology is a beautiful thing . Modern small business owners are incredibly lucky that they live in a day and age in which new technologies that can help them manage their businesses more easily are popping up on a daily basis . <p> Online employee scheduling software is really just the tip of the iceberg . In fact , there 's probably a software solution that can help you simplify just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on social media to running your payroll . <p> While you might not have the budget to purchase every tool you 'd like to , picking up a few that you 've prioritized as being most important to your work could certainly make life a lot easier for you and , conversely , reduce the stress that many of your day-to-day activities create for you . <h> Delegate <p> Small business owners often believe that hiring help is n't a realistic option in the early phases , but usually , that 's not true at all . There are plenty of tasks that are taking up too much of your time that can be outsourced to part-timers for cheap . <p> For example , are you writing and curating social media content for your business by yourself ? You probably know a college student that 's willing to do that job for you for cheap and save you valuable hours each week . <p> The same goes for administrative tasks like scheduling meetings and calls or even bookkeeping . There are freelancers and part-timers out there who can perform these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of the time and money you are losing each week by performing these tasks yourself . <p> Delegating does n't only work for tasks , you can also ask other people to help you out when it comes to putting together strategies and answering some of the important questions you face as a business owner on a regular basis . <p> You no doubt know people who have started their own businesses before you and have become successful . Do n't be shy . Ask them questions , pick their brains and ask them for advice every now and then instead of trying to figure everything out on your own . <h> Exercise More <p> Studies have proven that increasing your daily physical activity is a great way to reduce stress . This does n't mean that you need to be in the gym two hours a day . Just about any type of physical activity can help in reducing your stress levels . <p> Do you have 30 minutes to kill before your next meeting ? Do n't sit around looking at your smartphone , go out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from work and perform five minutes of stretching every other hour to get your blood flowing . <p> Another myth about exercise is that if you 're already tired , sweating it out at the gym is going to make you even more tired . That could n't be farther from the truth . Physical activity increases your endorphin levels . These are the neurotransmitters that your brain produces that help you to feel better . The greater your endorphin levels , the more relaxed and satisfied you are generally . And the more energy you will have as well . <p> Exercise also improves your mood and gives you more self-confidence to conquer your everyday tasks . <h> Take a Break <p> Studies have shown that your employees are more productive and happier at work when they use all of their vacation time . It should then be no surprise that the same goes for business owners and managers . <p> The fact that you 're never taking time off is completely understandable . You 've invested everything in your business and it is literally the most important thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more tired and stressed out you are , the less value you are providing to your business . <p> It 's important to step off the gas pedal every now and again to recharge your batteries . Get away with your family or friends for at least a week , and while you are away , try not to think about work at all no matter how impossible that sounds . <p> Taking a break does n't even have to mean going on vacation . Going out for lunch every day and taking an hour to eat in peace and enjoy a walk around town without checking your emails can do wonders for your stress levels . Another good idea is designating one day each week to spend outside the office with your loved ones and to make a rule that you wo n't be taking any work-related calls or engaging in any business-related tasks during that day . <p> Any tasks you have lined up are going to be completed more effectively after you 've refreshed your perspective a bit and taken a break from the daily grind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things about being constantly buried in work is that you tend to stop paying attention to your diet . Many small business owners fall into this trap . They believe that they do n't have time to eat properly , which leads to their diets consisting of nothing but coffee and fast food . <p> The truth of the matter is that eating healthy does not take that much time . It simply takes a little more attention . There are certain foods that you should eat if you want to decrease stress levels , such as foods that are high in fiber . Healthy foods not only fight stress , they also lower the levels of hormones in your body that are most commonly tied to triggering an increase in stress . <p> Try to seek out foods that are low in fat , high in fiber and make sure that you are eating lots of fruits and vegetables . <p> And it 's not just what you eat , it 's how you eat . On your most stressful days , you are better off eating smaller meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your energy levels so that there are less energy peaks and valleys during the day . <p> Most importantly , starting the day off with a healthy and balanced breakfast is one of the best ways to make sure that your that your body is getting what it needs , especially in the crucial morning hours . Trying to make it to lunch on nothing but coffee is not the way to go . <h> Prioritize Sleep <p> Business owners are often chronically tired because they just do n't get enough sleep every night . Whether you like it or not , getting enough sleep is an absolute necessity , not just for business owners but human beings in general . <p> Take a look at exceptional athletes , for example . Their work regimes are crazy . They work on making their bodies stronger for hours every day , they keep diligent records of what they eat , they study tape of their performances every day , yet they always make sure to account for getting enough sleep . <p> Why ? Because no matter what other steps they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to matter if their bodies and minds do not get the rest they need to recover . Sleep deprivation affects not only your judgment and memory , but your mood as well . In fact , research has shown that a majority of people would be happier , healthier and safer if they prioritized sleep and got an additional 60 to 90 minutes of it every night . <p> A good night 's sleep can truly do wonders when it comes to reducing stress levels . Not only does more sleep equate to less stress , it 's also helps you to better manage the unavoidable stresses of running a small business . Tired people tend to lack the patience and clarity of mind needed to properly function in high-stress work environments . <p> The bottom line ? Make sure you 're doing everything you can to secure for yourself at least seven hours or quality sleep every night .

Using excel can take hours while if you are using paper it can almost double the time . This is a task the few employers enjoy and it is one they are only too happy to pass on to somebody else when they can . There are however a few ways of dealing with problems with your current scheduling method that will at least make thing a bit easier . The normal reasons for issues arising include the following ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have effective policies for shift changes , or you are n't making use of available technology . We will look at each of these below . <h> Problems with scheduling method and the human factor <p> One of the main causes for problems with schedules is having the wrong person doing the job . This is not something that anyone can do ; it involves a lot of skill and knowledge . The person in charge of scheduling should know the business inside-out and understand the demands for each shift ; they should also understand computers if they are going to be using excel . This person will also need to fully understand the skill mix that will be required for each work period and be able to match this with the available staff . This person will need to be able to handle constant change and be competent enough to alter the schedule while managing the knock on effects of any change . One of the main causes of problems with scheduling method is that people make changes without making the necessary alterations elsewhere on the schedule ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent employee B but forget to replace employee A in the shift they were moved from . <h> Problems with scheduling method and business policies <p> Another cause of problems is not having correct policies in regards to booking holidays and sick leave . If the person responsible for schedules does not have enough notice then it will be practically impossible to manage changes effectively . It should be company policy that except in dire emergencies that people should give at least a month 's notice for any holiday requests . It should also be policy that staff try and give at least 8 hours notice before going off sick . <h> Problems with scheduling method and new technologies <p> If you are still using paper schedules then you really are n't doing yourself any favours ; unless you only have a handful of staff on a more or less constant schedule . Making changes to a paper schedule can make things messy , and you might end up wasting many hours rewriting schedules . It is also easier to make mistakes with this old fashioned method . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it will still take a bit of time to make changes . Nowadays there are online scheduling options that are probably the easiest and most cost effective way of dealing with the problem .

In order to reach this younger group to grow your sales , there are a few things you should know about them . <p> The following article is a guest post by Tim Sunderland and our friends at NetWaiter . <p> Between 18-34 years of age , millennials make up a large part of the customer base for most restaurants . In order to reach this younger group to grow your sales , there are a few things you should know about them . <p> They 're a group who tend to favor quick and easy meals over high-end dining , choosing restaurants with lots of options and lower price points . And they view eating out as an opportunity to connect with their friends and family . <p> But the one thing you absolutely must know about millennials ? You need to learn how to reach them if you want to bring them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a tech-savvy group , with many of them not even remembering a time without the Internet . Use this to your advantage by being visible online . Your marketing efforts should absolutely include social media . Millennials are active on a variety of today 's platforms , including Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram . <p> However , it 's not enough to just post updates on these platforms . You need to actually take the time to build a connection with them . Ask your restaurant 's customers to follow you on social media and then encourage them to start a conversation . <p> Ask questions or request feedback ! Share content that will get them talking . And when they do respond , be sure to write back to them .

Be warm and friendly to everyone who comes into your restaurant . Start a conversation and make them feel welcome . <p> When your customers have a great experience in your restaurant , they are sure to tell their friends about it . <h> Create a Rewards Program <p> While customers of any age would appreciate a good rewards program , it 's an especially great incentive for millennials . <p> Give your young customers a reason to keep coming back by creating a rewards program that gives them something in return for their loyalty . <p> Your rewards program could offer a free menu item , a discount , or something else .

Highlight those details on your menu so your millennial customers can make an informed choice . <p> One of the biggest differences between these younger patrons and the older generations is their sincere interest in these types of things . <p> If they really care about things like organic and free-range , make sure they know about it .

There are much better motivators for improving employee retention than a raise . <p> And even though the wage being offered is certainly one of the main things would-be employees consider before taking a job and raises can definitely help to keep them around , offering them more money every year or so to stay with you is absolutely not the only way to retain your best staff members . <p> In fact , some studies conducted on this particular topic have shown that most employees believe that having great work relationships is a lot more important than how high their salaries are going to be . So can it be said that money ca n't buy happiness in the workplace ? It appears to be that way for the majority of workers . <p> What can you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue working with you outside of throwing more money at them periodically ? <p> Here are some ideas . <h> Hire Better Leaders <p> Here 's a stat you need to consider . A recent study shows that 65 percent of American workers would rather have a new boss than a pay raise . That 's a lot of disgruntled workers who do n't like their leadership . <p> You hear a lot about managers needing to have the ability to find the weakest links in the team and to get rid of the people who are making the workplace a negative and unenjoyable place to be . But you rarely here about the importance of weeding out the bad managers . And according to the aforementioned study , it 's obvious that there are millions of workers in America who are not very fond of the people they are work under . <p> How do bad bosses get to leadership positions then ? There are many companies that promote people based strictly on ability and technical know-how without considering their people skills and ability to be positive forces within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happier your employees will be working for them . And there 's probably no amount of money that is going to convince someone to keep working for a manager they loathe . Having good leadership is one of the best employee retention strategies . <h> Offer Development and Advancement Opportunities <p> Money is certainly a motivator when it comes to the amount of effort employees are putting into their jobs every day , but it 's not the only factor . Instead of simply offering them more money to continue doing the same exact jobs they have been doing the entire time they have been with your company , why not give them a chance to learn new things and develop professionally ? <p> If you are dedicated to investing in your workforce , why not invest in expanding their skill sets ? Not only will you be getting more knowledgeable and skillful employees who will be able to help your business in ways they have n't been able to previously , you 'll also get motivated and happy employees who feel fulfilled by the fact that they are learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the time comes to give an employee a raise , you can include more responsibilities and a fresh new position along with that added money . This way you 're getting more bang for your buck as well . You are giving employees a raise not because they have been doing the same job for you for a long time , but because they are now capable of doing much more than they were able to do for you previously . It 's a win-win situation . <h> Offer Better Benefits <p> There are much better ways to show that you care about your employees than simply giving them more money . Offering better and more substantial benefits is a good alternative . Giving employees better health benefits and offering free education are both good examples . <p> A study conducted by Bright Horizons , a company that provides company-sponsored child care and other benefits , showed that almost 90 percent of employees that have a high level of well-being at their jobs experience greater job satisfaction as well . <p> Employees who feel that their companies care about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal and would rather stay with a company that offers a wide range of those types of benefits than work elsewhere for a higher wage without the benefits . <p> Another good thing for you is that many of these health benefits are tax deductible . So not only are you paying less in income taxes , you 're also getting some money coming back to you . <h> Make Work Fun <p> It has been confirmed time and time again that happier workers are more productive . Providing a positive workplace culture that allows people to be themselves , have fun and form stronger relationships within the company through organized activities has been proven to be a great employee retention strategy . <p> Your best workers are usually interested in more than the bottom line and they are not going to stick around in a boring , cold and impersonal work culture , no matter how much you 're willing to pay them . <p> Keeping the atmosphere at work light-hearted and positive really makes a difference . Taking time out to have fun at work decreases stress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work/life experience by getting employees to see your company as more of a family than a business . <p> Not only does this type of approach make employees happier , it also makes your job a lot more fun and exciting- in the process . <h> Provide More Frequent Mini-Rewards <p> It 's not the size of the reward that 's important , it 's the frequency . Periodic positive feedback can go a long way in keeping your employees happy . It 's even more financially prudent to offer your employees small bonuses on a more regular basis than to promise them raises every year . <p> These rewards do n't even have to be financial either . You can reward great work by giving people afternoons off or more paid vacation days during the holiday season . <p> Employees respond better to small and frequent rewards than to large and infrequent ones . Reminding your employees on a regular basis that you appreciate their work and what they bring to your team will keep them motivated and happier in the long run much better than allowing them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one day earning a pay raise . <h> Conclusion <p> More than ever before , retaining your best workers is more about culture than money . This is especially true for millennials . Today 's workers seek personal fulfillment , a better work/life balance and more engaging experiences at the workplace . <p> It 's important to remember that getting out your checkbook wont fix problems that could be ingrained in your company culture . <p> You need to look at your company from a new perspective and work towards making it a place in which employees feel so comfortable that they would prefer staying with you in order to maintain that level of satisfaction rather than going to work for more money at another company and risk losing that sense of contentment and gratification that they already have found within your organization .

You will need to make decisions in regards to assigning tasks , ensuring implementation , and evaluation of the work done . The way you approach managing employee tasks will very much depend on the type of business you run , and the make-up of your staff . In the rest of this article we will examine some of the possible options that you could consider . <p> The first thing to think about when managing employee tasks is how you are going to assign them . You might decide to allocate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the job , or you could assign a collection of tasks to different teams of employees . There are advantages and disadvantages with each approach . If you assign tasks to individual people then you are more likely to get the best person doing the job , but the problem will be that you will be completely reliant on that one person getting the task done ; if they are absent or too busy then the task wo n't be completed . The other option when managing employee tasks is to assign them to a team ; the benefit of this approach is that there is more likelihood of the job being done because more people are responsible for it . The main drawback with assigning tasks to teams is that it can mean that the best person for the task might not be doing it . <p> When managing employee tasks it will be important to ensure that the work is actually being done . If you are using a team approach then you can assign one member of the team to be responsible for ensuring every task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check up on them regularly to see that the work is being completed as assigned . <p> The final part of managing employee tasks involves evaluating any work that has been done to ensure that it has been completed . With the team approach you can have the team leader report back to you , while with individual employees you will need them to report back to you individually . It is important that you regularly check on what tasks have been completed to ensure that the work is satisfactory . <p> The choice between teams and individual assignment will often depend on the complexity of the task , and the skill mix of your staff . There can be many benefits in regards to team building and once groups of workers become familiar with working as part of a team they can be really effective . All the members of the team know that they are responsible for the tasks that have been assigned so there is a large element of self-monitoring . If the tasks are very complex though , you will likely be best to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may find that experimenting with the different approaches will be the best way to go before deciding on just one . Of course , you do n't have to stick to just one method and it would be equally feasible to have a mixed approach where you use teams for some tasks and individuals for others .

A new generation of workers ? Already ? What happened to the Millennials ? <p> While Millennials are still a very important part of the workforce today , it 's never too early to look ahead to the future . In no time at all , the ever-ambitious Millennials will be heading up businesses and taking on managerial and executive roles in companies , leaving room to welcome in a new fleet of workers the Generation Zers . <p> Every new generation of workers is different . They all have their own complexities , goals , skills and needs . And if you plan on being a successful business owner for a longer period of time , being able to recognize these nuances and manage a cross-generation staff is going to be essential to your success . <p> The good news is that the Generation Z workforce is very similar to the Millennials that have come before them . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be that difficult if you 've already gotten the hang of working with Millennials . <p> Let 's take a closer look at who Generation Z are and what they are going to be bringing to the table as employees in the years to come . <h> Who Are They ? <p> Generation Z workers that are joining the workforce right now are fresh out of college . Right now , they make up slightly less than ten percent of the workforce , but that 's going to change quickly . It is estimated that there will be more than 30 million employed Generation Zers by 2019 . <p> One interesting aspect of Generation Z is that trends show that this generation wants to get to work right away , many even forgoing college or trying to balance a serious career with going to school . <p> They also show a tendency to be more entrepreneurial , so do n't be surprised if you start having to work with Generation Zers not just as their employer , but as a partner . <h> Technology is Second Nature to Them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in a world without the Internet , there 's a good chance that they have n't even used a dial-up connection in their lives . They 've probably only seen people use payphones in movies . <p> They have had smartphones and social media accounts practically since middle school . Simply put , Generation Z will be the most technology proficient generation yet . They are very much in tune with all of the latest trends and the general evolution of technology , which means that you are going to have to show a similar interest in these areas if you want to keep up with them . <p> This might sound like a burden to some business owners , but it 's also a blessing . The best thing about having workers who are hyper-literate when it comes to technology is that they can easily adapt to any new gadgets or processes you might throw at them in the workplace . <p> So if you are making technological changes within your business , not only will your Generation Z workers be able to adapt to them easily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectiveness of these changes and even offer up better solutions and plans for further developing your business on this end . <p> Generation Z is going to bring innovation and development to the workplace , whether you like it or not . <h> What Makes Them Tick ? <p> We 've hopefully already established that Generation Z shows signs of being a great workforce ready to be challenged , excited about working on complex projects , interested in leading . <p> As a business owner , it should be in your best interest to understand them further in order to both attract them to your business and retain them . <h> They Desire Strong Leadership <p> Some might wrongly assume that the fact that Generation Z tends to have an entrepreneurial spirit automatically means that they ca n't be managed . Generation Zers will follow if they have a strong leader . <p> As an employer , you need to show this generation of workers that you take them seriously and that you do n't look down on them because of their age or lack of work experience . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their year of birth . <p> They respect employers who have strong opinions , have proven to be successful and are willing to help pave the way to mutual success and growth . In comparison to Millennials , it appears that Generation Z craves more structure and guidance . But that does n't come from a fear of making mistakes , rather from an appreciation for form and direction . <h> They Respond to Rewards <p> You know when you see an angry middle-aged man ranting on Facebook about how kids these days receive participation awards for being on a losing recreational sports team ? That guy is complaining about Generation Z. <p> This generation has grown up in a society that has praised and rewarded them for every little thing they 've done throughout life . They respond well to frequent praise and rewards because of this . Generation Z does n't want to be left wondering whether or not they have done a good job . They expect their managers and bosses to tell them directly . <p> The same goes with criticism . Generation Z thrives off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loop with bosses at all times motivates and inspires them to work harder . They want attention and want to know that their contributions are not going unnoticed . <h> What Do They Want ? <p> Now that you have an idea of where Generation Z is coming from , the next step is to understand where they want to go . What do they want out of their careers ? <p> It 's interesting to note that Generation Zers are a lot more interested in achieving financial stability than Millennials . While they are just as interested as Millennials in doing work that fulfills them and participating in something that 's going to change the world for the better , they are less willing to sacrifice financial stability to achieve these goals . <h> Career Development Opportunities <p> One of the main differences between Millennials and Generation Z is that the latter are much more realistic and do n't operate with such an optimistic , Utopian mindset . Both generations are very ambitious and want to move up in the world quickly , but early indicators show that Generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed , but they are willing to work harder towards that goal they do n't feel that they deserve success , they want to earn it . <p> Generation Z does n't just want to advance , they want to learn and better themselves every step of the way . They respond well to training , mentorship , guidance and getting the opportunity to continue learning new things and expanding on skills that they already possess . <p> If you want to retain a Generation Z worker , you should n't be offering them raises or promotions out of courtesy they want to earn everything through their ability to make valuable contributions and grow as professionals . <h> Flexibility <p> As mentioned earlier , Generation Z has practically grown up on the Internet . You ca n't expect them to work in cubicles you need to set them free . This new generation of young workers knows how to manage life on the go . They quickly respond to emails from the bar on their phones . They take their laptops with them for the weekend when they visit their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus and get work done from anywhere they need to . <p> This flexibility extends further than to just where they can and ca n't get work done from . It- extends into a blurring of the lines between personal and work time , which Generation Z workers are able to achieve and manage quite seamlessly . <p> Most importantly , business owners should know that Generation Z does n't simply prefer to have flexibility and autonomy in the way they work they demand it . So if you want to attract and retain the best workers of this generation , you are going to have to learn to adapt and strike a balance between your work structure expectations and theirs .

Moreover , making a habit of keeping sloppy and inefficient inventory records can literally cripple your business . <p> Remember 15 years ago when Nike 's poor inventory management cost the company nearly $100 million in losses ? It just goes to show that no one is immune to such problems . If a multi-billion dollar international retail giant can fall victim to this problem , - so can you . <p> Here are some common pitfalls that often lead to poor and costly inventory management in retail . <h> Your Process Is n't Automated <p> If there 's one thing that is really worth the money in retail , then it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to automate the entire process . <p> It does n't have to be that expensive either . You 'll notice that there are complete point-of-sale software solutions that include inventory management options , which are a bit more expensive . But there are also stand-alone inventory management tools that do n't cost as much . <p> If you 're still using Excel to track your inventory manually , there 's a good chance that you 're making mistakes and losing money . Using spreadsheets to track inventory is just as ineffective as using spreadsheets to schedule employee shifts . It 's inefficient , takes far too much time and energy , and is prone to human error . <p> Invest in a quality inventory control system that 's based on barcode technology and automate the process so that you do n't get left behind . Many retailers assume that small businesses do n't need software to monitor their inventory , but that could n't be farther from the truth . In fact , making the investment right off the bat gives your retail store a better chance of not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly , when you are using some type of automated inventory management software , the learning curve is not as big and you can easily train members of your team to use it . However , you still need to have people in the team with specific expertise who are going to be decision makers . <p> Retail managers need to determine whether they are going to take the time to develop the skills and knowledge needed to run the inventory process or if it would be a better option to hire someone who already possess experience and expertise . <p> While automated and mistake free inventory records are a good first step , wasteful inventory can still pile up if you are making bad decisions when it comes how you are buying merchandise and stocking your store . <p> Keeping good records helps you to avoid losses and confusion . But retail stores need to take that one step further and designate a knowledgeable team member to make proactive decisions that are going to bring about real benefits , like cutting costs and increasing profits . <h> Your Checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day or two to perform an inventory check seems to be a very common procedure in retail . But is it really necessary ? Apparently , many believe that it is . Otherwise , why else would you shut down your store for an entire day and lose profits if it was n't absolutely necessary ? <p> The fact is that it is not an unavoidable event . It is an outdated method that needs to be thrown out entirely . What you should be doing is dividing up your inventory checks into several smaller ones and performing them more frequently . <p> Of course , automated inventory management systems give you real time data about your inventory , but taking time out for planning and double-checking is always a necessity . Divide your merchandise into logical groups of products and perform more regular checks on each group individually instead of trying to tackling your entire inventory at once . <p> It 's much better to pay your workers an hour or two of overtime every few weeks to stay late and do inventory checks on smaller groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a day or two in order to perform these checks all at once . <h> You Have Too Much Inventory <p> If you think that you can never have too much inventory , then you 're wrong . You ca n't look at all of your inventory as a sale just waiting to happen , because you could be waiting a while . The longer your merchandise sits on the shelf , the more it 's subject to damage and deprecation . <p> Overstocking is an issue that can be avoided by better planning and forecasting . It 's one of those issues that might not seem like that big a deal at first , but as you continue to accumulate unnecessary merchandise , the negatives become very clear . <p> Its a problem that creeps up on you slowly and the longer you ignore it , the bigger it grows . As mentioned previously , expert analysis , better forecasting and more efficient planning will enable you to avoid this issue and buy more accurately . <h> You Have No Backup Plan <p> There 's always something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inventory . The thing about inventory is that it 's not an aspect of the job that is completely in your hands . It 's not as if you are producing all of your merchandise in the back room and then simply selling it out front . <p> You are dealing with third parties all of the time , and they may not all be equally reliable . This part of the inventory planning process is not about expert knowledge and analysis , it 's about common sense . You need to have backup plans in place for numerous situations . <p> Always have multiple sources from where you can purchase your merchandise , especially when it comes to your most popular items . <p> If the power goes out in your store , make sure that you have your inventory management software installed on a tablet , and in a worst case scenario , have a backup inventory spreadsheet on a USB stick . <h> Conclusion <p> Bringing down inventory costs is an ongoing goal that every serious retail business should have . It is , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important is that your retail store is actively working to reach optimal inventory levels . <p> It 's something that requires constant attention and daily work , but the advantages of making your inventory management as cost efficient as possible are- well worth it .

It 's about getting them comfortable and confident in their new roles right off the bat . <p> Here are some things that you and your human resources staff can do to make sure that you are providing successful onboarding experiences and decreasing the chances of experiencing costly turnover that almost inevitably comes with poor onboarding practices . <h> Onboarding Starts Before Day One <p> Many employers seem to forget about that incredibly important period of time in between the new employee 's agreement to join the company and his or her actual first day in the office . It 's often an incredibly nerve-racking time . <p> Remember your first day of school ? It was usually all you could think about over the last week of summer vacation . What should I wear ? Will my teachers be nice ? Will I be able to make friends ? All of these thoughts were racing through your young mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of that exact same process . You are eager and jittery to start working at your new job . You want to immediately make a good impression and fit in . You are the outsider , joining a team that already enjoys a fair amount of familiarity among themselves . <p> If no one from the company is contacting you in between the time you 've accepted their offer and the first day of work , you 're not going to feel as if they are excited about your arrival , are you ? Plus , this time is perfect for getting some of the annoying paperwork taken care of so that your first day can be more about getting acquainted with the company and less about signing documents . <h> Introduce Them to the Team and Company <p> Many of these things might sound like second nature , but you wo n't believe how many companies skip crucial steps in the onboarding process . Of course , getting the new employee to meet everyone who they are going to be working with is a given . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be stressful for some . Most people have an easier time introducing themselves through an email and then getting to know everyone on a personal level at a slower pace as time goes by . It 's best to use a combination of both . Walk them through the office and introduce them to everyone , but do n't put them on the spot and ask them to give a speech about themselves . Then you can gather some personal information about them , in their words , and send that out as an email introduction to everyone . <p> And while it 's important for new employees to get familiar with the team , it 's just as important for them to familiarize themselves with your company . While you have probably already told them about the company during the interview process , there 's a good chance that they do n't remember much of what was said . Surely , memorizing facts about your company 's history and values was far from a priority for them at the time . <p> Be sure you reintroduce all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about your company 's mission and strategic goals . Give them some stats on sales levels and stock prices as well . It 's important to let employees know where the company stands currently and where it wants to go . <p> As far as personal aspirations go , introduce these right away as well . Ask the employees what they want to achieve with your company . Tell them about any expectations management might have and any performance reviews they should expect to encounter . <p> All this will set the stage for a productive relationship that coincides with your company 's business goals . <h> Connect Them With Mentors <p> Providing mentors for your new employees is one of the best ways to increase their chances of being successful at your company . A mentor is not only someone who is able to tell them directly about what their responsibilities will be and what is expected of them , this person should also be able to offer great insights into the company culture and the way things get done in your company . <p> When new employees have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to increase and your turnover will almost certainly decrease as well . The mentor is supposed to be someone who is- more approachable than anyone in management . Mentors should be able to field any questions about company culture and work expectations . <p> They should also be the people who will be able to get the new employee comfortable with their new tasks and responsibilities very easily by providing the necessary guidance for assimilating into the company with as little stress as possible . <p> How do you decide who is going to a mentor ? A mentor should be well-respected within the company and knowledgeable of both the company as a whole and the specific projects that the new team member is being assigned to work on . <h> Line Up Real Projects From the Start <p> There 's nothing more unnerving for new employees than being unsure of what they should be doing during their first days and weeks at a new company . While there should be some room given to them to ease them into their roles , you need to give them something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that new hires need some time to get acclimated before working on serious assignments , so they give them small , usually unimportant- things to do in order for them to get settled in , believing that this will make the transition less stressful . <p> In reality , doing this can only lead to more stress and employees feeling as if management does not trust them with serious work . When employees start working on important projects immediately and complete them successfully- -this is- the ultimate confidence-builder . <h> Create a 90-Day Plan <p> It 's important to remember that onboarding is an ongoing process that does n't end after the first week . HR needs to lay out a plan of at least 90 days to make sure that the employee is fully integrated into the team and meeting expectations along the way . <p> It 's a process that involves constant contact with the new hire , not just a monitoring of their work from afar . You should be very upfront with new employees about what is expected of them and you should be giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in the first three months . <p> Not only that , you should be also staying in constant contact to make sure that the employee has all of the resources needed to reach these goals . These 90-day plans also allow you to evaluate an employee better over time , giving you insights into the areas in which they are strongest and where they might need some work . <h> Conclusion <p> With a high quality onboarding program , both you and your new employees win big . They are able to transition into your company with little stress , while you reap the benefits of having an immediately productive new member on your team . <p> And in the long run , a better onboarding program gives your company a higher level of worker retention , a more stable team and less costly turnover to deal with , ultimately .

You probably do n't  interview job candidates every day . So , setting up interviews can be an uncomfortable chore . However , its important to make the most of this opportunity to select the best employees for your business . <p> In this post , well take through the interview process and share some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Process <p> If your interview techniques are rusty , here are nine tips to help you through the interview process . <p> Screen candidates. - It takes too much time to interview every single person who applies for an open position ( and in some cases , there could be hundreds ) . Instead , screen the candidates before setting up interviews . If candidates submit resumes , a quick review of the resumes will tell you which candidates are the most qualified . If you have a lot of candidates , you can save time by further narrowing the selection with phone interviews . <p> Schedule for your convenience. - But be flexible . Choose interview times that will not interfere with your business operation . For example , if you run a restaurant , you would not interview candidates during a mealtime . At the same time , give the candidates several options for an interview time . The best candidates may be in school or looking to move up from a part-time job . <p> Be prepared. - Have a list of interview questions ready . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells you about the candidate . Use the same basic questions for each candidate , although you should be prepared to ask follow up questions depending on the candidates response . <p> Observe. - Does the candidate seem prepared for the interview ? Is he or she dressed appropriately for your business environment ? Can you imagine how the candidate will interact with your customers ? <p> Start light. - Most job applicants are nervous when they are called in to an interview . You can make them feel more comfortable by starting the interview with non-threatening questions like " did you have any trouble finding us ? " Once the candidate has relaxed , move into questions that require more effort on part of the interviewee . <p> Stay legal. - It is illegal to discriminate based on age , race , creed , color , religion , national origin , gender , and other categories protected by the laws in your state . Avoid asking any questions about these areas . Louise Kursmark has written a helpful article covering illegal questions on the hiring site Monster.com titled- Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may be anticipating answers or trying to hurry the interview along , but be sure to give the candidate a chance to voice their thoughtseven if they go off-topic . Its also a good practice to close the interview by giving the interviewee a chance to ask any questions they have . <p> Take notes. - It may seem obvious , but remembering what happened in each candidates interview can be difficult . This is especially true if you are interviewing a large number of candidates . You need notes to refer to when you make the final hiring decision . <p> Follow up. - Do n't  leave your candidates sitting on the fence for too long . Its likely that they are interviewing with multiple companies . The best candidates will probably receive other offers . Once you have selected a desired candidate for your open position , make the offer as quickly as you possibly can . <p> Involving Your Team <p> If your small business is large enough to have team leads or assistant managers , it is common to allow them to participate in interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your team in the interview process . Their involvement can help ease the new hire into your business . Plus , having another observer at the interview can help you to see different perspectives about a candidate . <p> However , be careful not to make it seem like you are " ganging up " on the interviewee . Also , make sure that any employees who participate in the interview process understand the legal restrictions on interview questions . <p> New Trends in Interviewing <p> There are several new interview trends you should understand : <p> Video Interviews. - Some companies now use video interviews to screen candidates and sometimes even to make a final selection . A video interview is conducted online through tools such as Skype . <p> Tests and Assignments. - Another current interviewing trend involves the use of tests and assignments to determine whether a candidate is truly qualified . <p> Speed Interviews. - Finally , speed interviewsinterviews that are scheduled to last no more than 15 minuteshave caught on . The speed interview compresses the traditional interview process . <p> Once you 've selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use . Humanity can help .

It 's a perfected platform that simplifies something almost every one of us does " order takeout . <p> Whether it 's a lazy weekend on the couch or a busy day in the office , Americans love the ability to eat what they want , when they want and where they want .

Making sure that your finances are in order and your spending is as efficient as possible could be said to even be absolutely vital to the survival of a new business trying to get off the ground on a shoestring budget . <p> But keeping your books perfect is easier said than done . Running a small business is hectic . As a small business owner , you are forced to wear several different hats day in and day out . In such a situation , it 's not uncommon for small business owners to completely overlook a variety of holes in the process that could be causing your business to leak a lot of money . <p> The biggest problem is that many of these lost funds seems to be rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things , but in reality , they are anything but . If you 're leaking money constantly and not doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add up . And this is something that could spell big trouble for small businesses if the problems persist and remain unchecked . <p> Here are a few of the most likely ways that your business could be losing money month over month . <h> Lack of Organization <p> Not being organized as a business will not only decrease your productivity , it will also cause you to leak money at an alarming rate . A survey conducted by Brother International in 2010 concluded that a week 's worth of hours is lost every year by employees trying to locate things they have misplaced either in their physical offices or cloud storage and email . According to the study , almost $177 million in lost productivity annually because of disorganization . <p> Keeping yourself organized can pay off big time . If you 're having a slow day at work , take that time to organize yourself . Look through your work folders , make sure that everything is being stored logically so that you 'll know where to look when you need something . Be meticulous about your paperwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take the time to organize your work habits as well . It pays off to spend the first hour of your work day going through a checklist of your work priorities and what it is that you need to accomplish on a daily , weekly and even monthly basis . <h> Employee Turnover <p> You 've probably heard it a million times , but if you 're still not convinced that losing employees and having to hire new ones to replace them can cost you serious amounts of money , here are some statistics to take a gander at . <p> According to a study by the Center for American Progress , depending on the education and qualifications of your workers , you can stand to lose anywhere in between 16% and more than 200% of a worker 's annual salary . <p> Other studies show that the average price of employee turnover is about six to nine monthly salaries of the worker you are replacing . So if you are losing a manager who made $50,000 a year , it will probably take you $25,000 $37,500 to replace that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the cost of finding the candidate , recruiting him or her and onboarding/training . <p> It 's also important to remember that keeping substandard employees who waste time and make your team generally less productive is a habit- that is just as wasteful financially as constantly firing and hiring new employees as replacements . <h> Service Fees Going Unnoticed <p> In this age of technology there are so many tools out there that can help you run your business . At the same time , many of them are incredibly affordable , or at least appear to be when you are only looking at their monthly costs . As a business owner , it 's sometimes hard to resist buying a new tool or paying for a new service . <p> Trying out and using these services is fine , but you need to be keeping tabs on them regularly and analyzing whether or not you are using them enough to justify the cost . It 's very easy to simply forget about the charges coming in every month . <p> Take one day every few months to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your company credit cards and assess whether or not you need to continue paying for these services . Are you using them regularly ? What 's the ROI ? Is it worth it ? If not , cancel the subscription . Even if you do end up needing any of them again , re-introducing them certainly wo n't be a problem . <h> Poor Accounting <p> When working with a tight budget , small business owners are often inclined to try and do all of the accounting themselves . Sure , there 's lots of information available to you online and plenty of accounting resources and checklists you can use to streamline the process . <p> But at the same time , it 's hard to deny that keeping all your books in order is a complex process . That 's why hiring a professional to help you is one of the best investments that you can make . Having a tax professional do your accounting can save you thousands of dollars each year . <p> A professional will know all of the deductions you can get back when filing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type and can potentially implement dozens of other money-saving processes that you might not be all too familiar with . Even on the tightest of budgets , it 's a good investment to get professional accounting help . <h> Poor Employee Scheduling <p> Here 's something we can help you with ! Remember when we talked about cutting down on paying for services that might not be absolutely vital to your business ? Well , making sure that you are paying for services that you use every day and can truly help you run a tighter ship is equally important . <p> Having a great employee scheduling solution like Humanity on your side is one business expense that 's worth signing up for . If you are constantly understaffed or overstaffed , if your employees are coming in late or abusing your lack of time and attendance monitoring , you 're losing lots of money on a weekly basis . <p> Scheduling your employees more effectively allows you to take better control of your labor costs and stop losing money to poor employee management . <h> Conclusion <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are losing you money regularly , you need to get serious about it . Approach the problem analytically . Keep better records of your expenses , analyze them to see whether the return on investment makes senses , and make cuts when the ROI just does n't add up . <p> This is especially important for newly-opened small businesses , where every penny counts and a lack of financial diligence can literally sink your company before it even has a chance to succeed .

If you still have n't figured out what the best route is to take during the seasonal downtime , here are some options to consider . <p> Seasonal businesses are unique in the fact that they are both easier and harder to run , depending on what angle you are looking at it . They are most common in areas that rely heavily on tourism areas that have peak periods during the year during which more people visit and spend money . <p> If you have a seasonal business , then you probably already spend a good portion of the year contemplating what your best options are during the off-season . Are there ways to make some money on the side with your business even when it 's not peak season ? Should you maybe focus on another job entirely during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> If you still have n't figured out what the best route is to take during the seasonal downtime , here are some options to consider . <h> Prepare for High Season <p> What you do during the offseason depends a lot on how well your business performs in season . Do you make enough money during your peak season that you do n't have to worry about additional sources of income during the rest of the year ? Can your seasonal business sustain you for a full calendar year financially ? <p> If so , then you have the luxury of being able to focus yourself full-time on your part-time gig , which is a pretty awesome spot to be in . If that 's the case , you should be performing research during the offseason and carrying out maintenance that is going to enable your seasonal business to continue to thrive and grow once peak periods hit again . <p> Your goal should be to use this quiet period to make sure that your business is going to be running on all cylinders during the peak period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get a fresh coat of paint on the walls , make some adjustments to the interior design , brainstorm ideas for possible innovations that you can potentially add to your offer in the coming high season . <p> You can also take the time to analyze what your competitors are doing and how your market is changing . Keeping in contact with your seasonal staff is also a good idea ; that is , if you have the luxury of having seasonal employees that return to you every year . If that is the case and you have some room in your budget for it , offer training sessions and even organize team building activities to keep the team positive and ready to perform at a high level in the coming peak season . <p> Whatever you do , the goal is to make sure that your seasonal business is going to be better in every way this year than it was at the end of your last peak period . <h> Adapt Your Offer <p> If you want to find a way to keep your business open even during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapt your business . Be careful though . It 's important to maintain your original identity so that you are n't confusing people . If you 're a restaurant during the summer and a retail store in the winter , that 's probably not going to work . <p> But if you 're selling ice cream during the summer , try selling something similar during the winter without leaving your niche . For example , you can sell some different types of sweets during the winter . People will then identify your business as a place where they can satisfy their sweet tooth at any time of the year . <p> Certainly , there is n't one solution that you can implement on every type of business . You 're going to have to do some research and some trial and error is definitely going to be involved . What is important , however , is that you try to stay within your original niche as much as possible . The worst thing you can do is confuse your customers . <p> And if your new offer works well during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to expand your peak season offer in a way that is going to be able to incorporate and merge both offers seamlessly . It 's hard work , no doubt , but definitely worth it if successfully implemented . <h> Work Reduced Hours <p> As mentioned previously , many businesses do not have the option to close down completely during the offseason . Working reduced hours is a good compromise . And if you are able to combine this with the above mentioned strategy of adapting your offer , that 's even better . <p> To use the same example as above , you can add other sweets to the offer of your ice cream parlor during the winter . But if your location is a tourist hotspot that is only busy during the summer , the fact of the matter is that there is not going to be an equal amount of customers entering your establishment no matter what you 're selling . A good compromise in this case would be to both diversify your offer and work reduced hours . <p> That way , you are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running your operation to coincide with the reduced number of customers available to you during the offseason . <p> The best way to decide on your reduced work hours is to take a look at other local businesses and see when their peak hours are during the offseason . You 're better doing that than experimenting all season long in an effort to find an optimal set of work hours . Once again , it 's important to avoid confusing people . Pick optimal reduced work hours based on your initial observations and stick to them . It 's all about being reliable . <h> Focus on Marketing Strategies <p> This option ties in with the first one about preparing for the coming high season . But really , - you can focus on marketing strategies even if you have n't closed down for the offseason . Even if you 're working during the offseason , you still have more time to focus on developing your business plan and improving your offer and the way you do business . <p> Brainstorm new strategies and start working on ways to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Start getting the word out about your business before the peak season . Try to get a step ahead of your competition while you have the time to think about these types of things . <p> As anyone with a seasonal business knows , the peak season is always hectic and does n't give you enough time to plot new promotions and ways to advance your business . Take this valuable offseason free time to take care of these marketing strategies while you can . <h> Conclusion <p> The great thing about all of these suggestions is that they can be mixed and matched according to the profile of your business and what best suits your needs . There are many different factors that go into achieving success for a seasonal business and all of them depend on your niche . <p> If there 's one thing you should learn from this article is that your offseason should not be wasted . Sure , everyone needs time to relax and take a break from their business . This is especially true for seasonal businesses . They are like running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's much more intense than running a- long , slower race . <p> Take some time off to reflect on a successful season , but remember to work on improving your business in the offseason so that this success can continue .

Recruiters should n't be using the same methods and avenues they use for finding managers when searching for hourly workers . The employee profile is completely different . <p> We know that many of them are under the age of 30 and students . A large percentage , up to 80 percent , prefer to work within a five mile radius of where they live . Close to 60 percent , consider their jobs to be full-time careers , not part-time engagements for making some extra money on the side . However , almost 75 percent prefer to work no more than 30 hours a week . <p> When you are hiring for a management position , it 's much more of a process , and rightfully so . There are always several rounds of interviews and tests involved . However , hourly workers do n't want to have to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important thing they look for is finding a business that wants to hire them quickly . They do n't want it to be a long , drawn-out process . <p> Another misconception about hourly workers is that they are not very educated . A- more recent TLNT study showed different results . According to this study , more than 30 percent of American hourly workers have one to three years of college under their belts and one in four have either some college credits or a full degree . <p> So the first task , is defining the type of people you are aiming to hire . Once you have a good idea of that and you have a feel for what they are looking for out of an employment opportunity , it 's time to figure out where to look for them and where not to . <h> Where Not to Look <p> If you want to catch trout , do n't go fishing in saltwater . If you want to hire hourly employees , you 're not going to go about it the same way you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect place to hire managers and get the all your salaried positions filled , but it 's terrible for hourly employees . Most hourly employees do n't even have a LinkedIn profile . <p> The same goes for places like Monster and other paid job boards . These options cost money , but are n't really teaming with hourly employees . One other thing you have to consider is that even if your business runs on hourly employees , the recruitment budget for managers and salaried positions is probably bigger than the one you get to find the right hourly staff . That 's why you need to be smart and cost-effective when searching for them . <h> Go Grassroots <p> Sometimes low-tech and retro is the best way to go when trying to find hourly employees . Just because everything is migrating to the online world these days does n't mean that vintage methods are becoming any less effective . Why spend money on technology when you 're looking to hire people who are making under $20 an hour especially if these technologies are n't really getting your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a digital world , but that certainly does n't mean that retro recruiting techniques ca n't work for you ; especially if you 're implementing these strategies properly . <h> Referrals <p> Finding people through current employees and friends that you already trust is still the best way to go when looking for new hourly workers . You can even offer small bonuses to your staff members if they are willing to refer someone they know and trust . <p> By seeking out referrals , you are basically skipping a round of recruitment . If an hourly employee is recommended by someone you trust , you are not only forgoing one step of the search process , you 're also making the interview process a bit easier , since you already have some indications that you could be getting a trustworthy and skilled worker . <p> If you are asking trusted friends , business connections and workers to refer new employees , you are already on the right track . The fact is that successful and trusted people are not going to vouch for people who they do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonuses are in play . <p> Referrals are a win-win any way you look at them . The chances of these employees working out for you are much higher , and even if they do n't work out , you 've still saved a lot of money and time in the process . <h> Job Fairs <p> Here 's yet another great route to take if you want to shorten the process and make it more direct . If you 're attending job fairs , you are meeting potential candidates in person first . That means that you 're skipping the phase in which you find a way to get your job ads out , ask for resumes and then read a bunch of resumes before reaching out . <p> Job fairs are plentiful- and they also tend to be very specific , so there 's no doubt there should be a least a couple being held in your area each year that are going to be tailored to your industry . <p> There is a bit of preparation involved in presenting your business at a job fair , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairs enable you to get out there , reach your target demographic and talk to potential candidates in the flesh , but you 're also able to work on your business branding , getting the word out about your company and also networking and seeking out new business connections within your industry . <h> Local Colleges <p> Remember the statistic we mentioned earlier about hourly employees wanting to work close to where they live ? That 's why college campuses are great for recruiting . At local college campuses , you have a huge choice of high school graduates who want hourly jobs . Not only that , but you also have a huge demographic of people who are n't sure what kind of career they want yet and simply want to get a job that is close and enables them to make money . <p> Get in contact with the career centers at your local colleges and talk to the people who work there .

Most colleges also have job boards where people can come to post flyers when looking for employees . There are tons of opportunities on campus for you . Make sure that you 're staying on top of this option and putting in the legwork to get your business noticed by the student body . <h> Job Hotline <p> Hourly employees are looking for convenience in the job application process above all else . People who are looking for hourly employment are usually very busy and do n't necessarily have the time to go through complex processes when it comes to getting their applications in to you . <p> Also , many have classes and other tasks to take care of during the day , which might make it hard for them to apply for a job or come to your establishment seeking information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good way to make it incredibly easy for people to apply is to install a 24/7 job hotline .

As mentioned earlier , LinkedIn might not be the best place to look for hourly workers , but that does n't mean that other social networks and online job boards are n't fantastic starting points . <p> Your website and social media channels are also great places to spark interest from potential candidates .

It 's a high traffic website , especially for younger demographics . While you might be getting a lot of bad candidates , it 's still a better plan to use a free service that 's going to give you tons of prospects to wade through than using a paid service that 's going to give you minimal results . <p> Using Craigslist is easy , it gets your job ad out to hundreds of locals and it does n't require you to go through some type of recruitment service .

But that does n't mean that you ca n't write a great brand story if you are n't coming from a- similar background . It just means that you need to learn how to adapt . <p> Here are five tips that will help you to engage consumers and connect them to your brand emotionally by integrating brand storytelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There 's probably nothing more important when it comes to good brand storytelling than being completely honest with your audience and keeping your message consistent . The greatest potential killer of any brand storytelling strategy is confusing your audience . <p> That is why your brand storytelling needs to be transparent . It should also be able to realistically tell the story of your brand and your products or services . This certainly does not mean that you need to hold back the creativity . <p> Do n't be afraid to experiment with the ways in which you tell your story , just be sure that your core message and values are always being represented consistently . If there 's anything that consumers negatively respond to , it 's mixed messages and confusion . <h> Create Likeable Characters <p> Creating characters to tell your brand 's story does not necessarily mean that you need to invent some type of mascot . While that approach does work for many brands , it is n't the most effective method for most . <p> Your characters do n't have to be inherently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much rooted in reality . For example , you can tell stories from the point of view of one of your employees . Or you can develop a customer personality and tell his or her story . Talk about their pain points or their desires and then show how your company is tending to them . <p> Characters are important because your audience needs something or someone to connect to . Having characters allows you to create story arcs that will engage your audience narratives that they will want to continue to follow through time . <h> Define Your Intentions <p> A lot of marketers make the mistake of talking about how great their products are without ever giving a story about the products origins . What made you want to create this product or service ? What sparked your mission ? <p> This is one of the most important brand stories that you can possibly tell . Let your audience know what made you want to create your great products . The story should show consumers what problem you recognized that needed to be fixed , and how your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on emotions , not on actions . For example , here at Humanity , we are creating employee scheduling software . Not just to help you schedule your team , but to help you- focus on what you love to do while letting us handle all of the tedium that comes with running a business . <p> We want to help you to love what you do and focus on the aspects of your that are most important to you . That 's our brand story , that 's the origin of our product . What 's yours ? <h> Collect Feedback <p> It 's not enough to trust your intuition , you need to support your decisions with real data . Initial research should be able to give you a good idea of where your story needs to start , but the reactions of your audience will decide where your story needs to go . <p> Find out what engages your audience and adjust your brand storytelling to cover those topics . It 's a good idea to follow social media very closely and search keywords and hashtags that are related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to really understand what your audience loves to talk about and then develop a plan that will help you to join that conversation . <p> Monitor reactions to your content in order to better understand the direction you need to go so that you will be able to engage your audience and interact with- them . <h> Evolve the Story <p> As we 've touched upon earlier , where your brand 's story is going is more important than where it began . A successful brand story is one that has legs . And in order to achieve this longevity in your storytelling , you need to continue your story and iterate . <p> Never stop sharing success stories and real-life applications of your products and services that are helping real people solve real problems . Show your audience how your product is constantly evolving and how you and your team are changing your product or service based on customer feedback and requests . <p> It 's not enough to say that your product is new and improved , explain the reasoning behind these new features and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it has the appearance of a fairly daunting mission , telling a good brand story does not have to be that difficult . <p> The best way to keep your story moving along effectively without repeating itself and becoming predictable is to make sure you are focusing on the people who are affected by the product or service and not on the product or service itself .

Since there are no signs that this trend will be slowing down , managers are trying to find the best ways to adjust to this new way of doing business . <p> Studies show that the percentage of part-time workers in the United States is continuing to grow even post-recession . <p> Since there are no signs that this trend will be slowing down , managers are trying to find the best ways to adjust to this new way of doing business . <p> One of the most common myths is that part-time workers are not as effective as full-time employees . In fact , they are just as valuable in today 's workforce , if not more so . And just as you would like to retain all of your best full-time workers , you should also be thinking about how to keep your part-time employees content enough to stay with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how you can go about doing just that . <h> Pay Them Fairly <p> Many employers wrongfully assume that hiring part-time workers provides them a perfect opportunity to save some money on salaries . But that 's not the way that you should be entering this situation . <p> Part-time employees deserve to be paid hourly wages that are equal to the ones your full-time workers are receiving . They are just as important to your operation and should not be treated as second-class employees . <p> And remember , you will be saving money anyway . Part-time employees usually do n't get all of the benefits that are offered to full-timers , so you 'll definitely be saving some money in the end , it just wo n't be on salaries . <h> Promote Advancement <p> The best way to retain your part-time workers is to not only let them know that they will be able to advance within your company , but to also encourage them to do so . <p> If you are telling these employees that they do n't have any chance of moving up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves and will probably always be looking for a better job to move on to . <p> Instead of having apathetic workers who are sifting through online job ads during their lunch breaks , let them know that they will be able to advance and get rewarded if they work hard . <h> Treat Them Equally <p> When we are talking about treating part-time employees equally , we are not just talking about wages . They should feel like they are a part of the team at all times . <p> If you offer your full-time employees free lunch and beverages , be sure to do the same for part-time workers . And if you are having a company Christmas party , be sure to invite everyone , part-timers included . <p> They should also be involved in team meetings . Leaving them out of these types of corporate events can lead to them feeling underappreciated and unimportant . <h> Recognize Their Unique Situations <p> In most cases , people who work part-time jobs are working them because they have to , not because they want to . You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs they might have . <p> Many part-time workers might have another job to go to before or after they enter your office . There 's a good chance that they are struggling financially more than your full-time employees . <p> Perhaps they can only work part-time because they need to take care of an elderly family member or a young child . <p> Recognize that they might have special circumstances that they are dealing with , and try to find ways to help them out whenever possible and accomodate their special needs . <h> Give Them Their Own Workspace <p> Be sure to make room in your office for your part-time workers . Give them their own cubicles or desks where they can keep their things and work from everyday . <p> There 's nothing worse for the employee than having to drift from desk to desk everyday and look to see which cubicle is open before starting to work . Once again , this makes them feel as if they are not part of the team . <p> Be sure to provice them with a sense of continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you are already encouraging your part-time employers to succeed and advance in your company , you should also be giving them the tools they need to do so . <p> It 's important to offer training to your entire staff and keep them learning . Of course , an introductory course before they start working would be beneficial as well . Let them understand what their duties are and what is expected of them . <p> And once they are fully integrated into your team , keep encouraging them to learn new skills and gain new knowledge through training courses and personal instruction . <h> Schedule Them Fairly <p> As mentioned previously , part-time workers tend to have a lot of other things on their plates . So if it is at all possible , try to give them a consistent work schedule . It might not always be possible , but whenever it is , your part-time employees should have a stable work schedule so that they can organize the rest of their lives around it . <p> It 's best to ask them during the interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as you can about them . <p> Ask them if they have children that they need to pick up from school or if they have another job that they need to get to . And if you do need to switch up their schedules , be sure to give them enough notice so that they can do what they need to do in order to prepare for working a different shift .

With our broad platform we have clients in all different types of industries and its exciting to see how this filter is being applied across different industries . Here are a few examples that we 've seen from our clients . <p> Food &amp; Beverage / Catering Secondary locations are being used to assign locations , or jobs to shift times . With the new location filter you can now quickly group these shifts together . <p> Job Sites / Projects Another unique use we 've seen for our secondary locations is assigning them as job sites &amp; projects to then assign different staff against them .

How do you keep the leaders of your nursing staff happy , fulfilled and excited about coming to work every day ? It 's difficult , no doubt , but not impossible . <p> Being a nurse is not easy . The stress levels in this profession are through the roof . The hours are long and you are in constant contact with people who are sick and need your help to get better . There 's a lot of pressure involved in nursing and it seemingly never gets easier . <p> You need to be committed to the job in every way , physically and mentally . The profession is so grueling , in fact , that according to a survey performed by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , one in five nurses will leave the profession within their first year on the job . <p> That 's why managers in the nursing industry , and the healthcare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nurses are hard to come by as is , but finding and retaining great nurses is an even harder task . <p> How can you make sure that your best nurses want to stay with you ? How do you keep the leaders of your nursing staff happy , fulfilled and excited about coming to work every day ? <p> It 's difficult , no doubt , but not impossible . <h> Getting Your Culture Right <p> Developing a caring and positive culture for your nursing staff is probably the most important aspect of keeping them happy . To do this , you need to know what the issues are that matter most to nurses . Generally , nurses want to work at a medical institution that stresses positivity , safety for nurses and patients , open communication and commitment to great service . <p> It 's not only important to nurture these cornerstones of your culture once they have been agreed upon . You need to hire nurses with these values in mind . The reason for this is the simple fact that these values are not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are coming exclusively from the management . <p> Your best nurses , all of which should believe strongly in these values , need to be instilling them into the rest of the staff every day . Providing your best nurses with a culture that suits them well and allowing them to become promoters of this positive culture gives them no reason to want to leave . <h> Restricting Overtime <p> Making sure that your nurses are working less overtime than usual is actually easier said than done . Overtime is something that simply comes with the territory in this profession . However , studies have shown that nurses who work less overtime enjoy a higher level of workplace satisfaction . <p> While you probably wo n't be able to completely put an end to nurses working overtime , you can surely do a better job of regulating it . It 's sometimes very easy to simply let your best nurses take a lot of overtime , simply because it 's tempting to always have your best people out there helping patients . But overworking your best nurses could easily lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a much better practice to distribute shifts as equally as possible so that your best nurses do n't feel overworked or taken advantage of at any moment . Make overtime the exception , not the rule . <h> Empowering Your Staff <p> If you want to keep your best nurses , you are going to have to start giving them more independence . This process starts with allowing them to be part of the process when it comes to creating work schedules . Many nurses are unhappy about the lack of say they have when it comes to putting together the work schedule . <p> One of the best ways to end this dissatisfaction is to allow your nurses to set up their own availability and then create work shifts based on their preferences . Not only should you be allowing all of your nurses to have their voices heard about their availability preferences , but you should also give more control to your head nurses when it comes to scheduling in general . <p> Your best nurses should be able to own the scheduling process for their teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : firstly , they know the needs and abilities of their teams better than managers do , and secondly , giving them more control in general will lead to greater job satisfaction . Your best nurses will not only never shy away from added responsibility , they 'll most likely welcome it . Showing them that you trust them with scheduling their teams can go a long way when it comes to job satisfaction and loyalty . <h> Listening to and Implementing Recommendations <p> Hospitals and nursing centers that listen to their nurses ' suggestions tend to have the happiest nurses and the best staff . Nurses know better than anyone what your medical institution needs to improve . <p> Ask for their input regularly through surveys and implement some of their recommendations . Make sure that your nurses have everything they need to work effectively , especially when it comes to equipment and supplies . <p> The medical facilities with the best retention rates address the concerns of their nurses and even allow the nursing staff to not only recommend , but also collaborate in the processes of putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs in order to perform their everyday tasks at a higher level . <h> Facilitating Leadership <p> Your best nurses want to advance their careers . As a manager , you should be facilitating these needs . It 's a good idea to have some type of a career development program in place that can help your best nurses meet their career goals without having to leave your establishment . <p> These types of programs also help to breed better relationships between staff and management . When nurses see that the management values them and wants to see them stay and fulfill their career goals within the same facility , they will be more likely to stay . <p> Residency programs can also go a long way in improving retention . Having a good residency program enables you to not only develop and keep your best nursing students , it also gives the perceptors more incentive to stay . If the experienced nurses see that the novice nurses are satisfied enough to stay within them after they have finished their studies , they too will have a greater sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurses is important for the obvious reason of maintaining the quality of the care that you are offering to your patients . It 's also important for financial reasons . <p> According to the Journal of Nursing Administration , when taking in all of the costs ( training , orientations , recruiting , advertising , decreased productivity , etc. ) , you 'll spend an average of $82,000 to replace a single nurse . <p> That figure alone should give managers an idea of why retaining your best employees in this industry is absolutely crucial .

We then want to be able to automatically notify all staff that there is the ability for them to work on these shifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to work " .

" <p> Definitely ! This topic falls right between the two different shift formats that are within Humanity : Open &amp; Closed . The fastest way to describe open and closed shift types is to say that Closed shifts(default) , are shifts where you assign employees as desired to the individual shift . This is a completely manual process. - Open Shifts- on the other hand allow you to define the number of employees needed , allowing them to be notified of the available shift slots , and have the ability to opt-in to work . You can set whether or Manager approval is needed for opt-in requests , among other settings to help streamline this process . <p> So to solve the above problem with having some assigned staff , some wildcard positions , we can simply use a combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what it looks like : <p> 1. - I Create a Saturday shift with 1 employee : <p> 2. - I then convert the shift type to open and set the limit to 2 , which will essentially be the one employee Ive already scheduled , plus one available slot : <p> 3. - Once this is saved , its now available to all employees online through their dashboard/calendar . They can view the shifts available , and then request to work . And like I mentioned depending on your settings , you can either have the final approval or not . This is the employee view : <p> <p> Depending on your business settings you can either allow for the auto-approval of shift requests for all staff , or for individual employees . Assuming you do n't  have the auto-approve option set , you will be able to see the requests through-out your account with the ability to approve/reject them .

Here is a guide to help you jump-start that process . <h> General Communication Tips <p> First , let 's go over some general rules of conduct that will help you communicate well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to have proper business communication etiquette when managing projects . <h> Do n't Overcomplicate the Intended Message <p> Understand why over-complication happens so that you can avoid it . You 're constantly hearing buzzwords within your industry and listening to the advice of consultants and experts , which is a good thing it means you 're educating yourself . <p> The unfortunate result is , all too often , starting to use language that confuses people . If you are inclined to use a trendy or fancy word , but a common word will work , use the common word . Keep it simple . <h> Avoid Ambiguity in Project Communications <p> The English language is tricky and has all too many words with multiple meanings . When writing a memo , be sure that you avoid any words that could imply something different than what you want the reader to understand . This ensures clarity , and you wo n't have to go back and explain later . You can say it once and be done . <p> When you 're giving instructions , be sure that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything up to chance . If you read your instructions and you feel that there is something there that has been left up to interpretation , try to make it more direct and clear so that there is no guesswork involved . <h> Dismiss Jargon From Your Vocabulary <p> The use of jargon special words or expressions that are used by a particular profession or group and are difficult for others to understand is a classic mistake made by professionals . Freelancers , assistants , and consultants that may be helping with projects wo n't know what you 're talking about in most cases if you use words that are specific to your industry . <p> Cut jargon words out of emails , memos , and presentations to save someone you are working with the time and energy it takes to try and figure out what you 're talking about " especially when working with outsourced help and people that are not familiar with the ins and outs of your industry . <h> Make Use of Everyday Mobile Technology <p> You 're almost certainly using emails and phones to connect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting overlooked and employees are checking their voicemail hours too late . Of course , these methods have their advantages , but there is one more convenient solution that you may have overlooked . <p> Text messaging is a practical , easy solution for internal communication that will be seen in real time , requiring no complicated system for delivery . Managerial Communication : Strategies and Applications , by Geraldine E. Hynes , states that text messaging is one of the most handy methods of internal communication in business . She uses the example of an employee who needs to deliver a message to a boss while in a meeting . Sending a text is a non-intrusive method of delivery ( unlike a phone call ) while remaining personal ( unlike an email ) . Her explanation illustrates the benefits perfectly . <p> Loomion AG used text messaging to help them solve an internal communication problem for the companies they serve . When important documents were uploaded for their clients ' board meetings , they needed a system for delivery , besides just email , to notify participants of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flexible approach for communicating internally with board meeting participants . These participants are now up-to-date faster with the latest information . <p> Another good thing with messaging is that you have so many options these days " Viber , WhatsApp , Intercom , even Facebook Messenger " all of which can be used as great text messaging services . The important thing you need to worry about is setting them up in a way that keeps your personal and business-related messaging separate . <h> Communication is- Not a One-Way Street <p> Not only does communication involve the delivery of your intended message to others within your company , it also requires that you actively listen . Active listening is a skill that needs to be honed in order to improve interactions between staff members . We listen to obtain information , to understand , to enjoy , and to learn . Here are some tips to improve your active listening in a small business environment . <p> Pay attention to the speaker <p> Repeat the information collected to ensure understanding <p> Show that you are listening by acknowledging received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read <p> This advice will help you retain more information and to be certain that the person delivering the message knows that they have been heard and understood . Both are important facets of achieving a desired level of high quality workplace communication .

They are great for storing , archiving and calculating data , especially when you are dealing with numbers . But scheduling is an entirely different story , it 's a very dynamic process and formulas can only do so much . <p> If you are a manager still using spreadsheets to schedule your team , or an employee getting shifts assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun . <p> In case you have n't figured it out by now , spreadsheets are not an optimal solution for employee scheduling , and this is why . <p> It 's Too Time Consuming <p> This is , essentially , the biggest problem that comes with scheduling your team using spreadsheets it takes too long ! Shifts are rarely set in stone and are usually changing on a daily basis . So managers are constantly editing their spreadsheets and sending out new ones to staff . <p> The whole point of creating schedules is to save time and avoid confusion . Scheduling with spreadsheets can sometimes have the exact opposite effect . <p> It Ca n't Be Automated <p> Spreadsheets are great for calculating data because you can enter formulas that allow you to perform calculations automatically .

Everything needs to be entered manually , which slows down the process and does n't help make your job any easier . <p> It 's Error-Prone <p> Spreadsheets are all subject to human error . You can use formulas to calculate some things , but if you make a mistake writing your formula , all of your data will be wrong . And when you have lots of information and tons of formula 's throughout your spreadsheet , locating the problem can be a huge hassle as well . <p> And the fact that you need to enter everything manually and constantly update your spreadsheets makes the likelihood of making an error even greater . <p> It 's Not Intuitive <p> Spreadsheets will not notify you if you have shift conflicts . They wo n't tell you if you have an open shift that you have n't assigned to anyone . They ca n't help you do your job because there is simply no way to make your spreadsheets more dynamic and proactive . <p> Basically , all of the responsibility is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your spreadsheets. - - It Lacks Serious Analytical Capabilities <p> While you can make some basic graphs and charts out of your data when using Excel spreadsheets , it 's not exactly a robust analytical tool . Essentially , you have a lot of data about your business within the spreadsheet , but you are n't using it to its full potential . <p> This information can be used to forecast labor costs , track your expenses , and generally help you run your business better . But it 's hard to harness this data if you are still using spreadsheets to schedule . <p> Conclusion : <p> All of these shortcomings of scheduling employees with spreadsheets can be overcome by switching to a workforce management software like ours . <p> Humanity allows you to cut the time it takes you to schedule drastically , automate all your processes , receive automatic notifications when you 've made scheduling errors , avoid shift conflicts , and analyze all of your business data using just one tool .

New employees do not like being surprised . Finding out after a couple weeks that they are required to perform tasks that they were unaware of at the start of their employment could easily sour their opinion of your company and decrease their desire to work for you long term . <p> Adding trial periods to the process is also a good idea .

Good employees naturally seek out good companies , which is why you need to make their transition into your company as inviting , cordial , and painless as possible . <p> The first step towards achieving this is providing a well-rounded and friendly orientation experience . Demonstrate to your new hires that their personal success is just as important as the success of your business . <p> Its also a good idea to bring the employee into his or her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks on them immediately , let them ease into the position .

Its as simple as that . Studies have shown that giving regular raises to decrease your turnover rate will actually cost you less than the money you lose when an employee leaves your company . <p> Every time you hire someone new , there is a learning curve involved during which productivity will surely decrease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for these learning periods and keep your productivity levels high . <p> Benefits like free lunch and beverages are always appreciated by staff as well .

One of the best ways to do that is to give your team an added level of autonomy when it comes to scheduling their shifts and determining when they work . <p> A workforce management platform like Humanity could help you with this . Let your employees coordinate among themselves when they need to trade or drop shifts . Of course , you as the manager will have to confirm all schedule changes , but allowing employees to be involved in the process let 's them know that they have a say and that they are respected . <p> Its also a good idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their schedules are being planned according to when they can work , instead of when you want them to work . <p> Many employees might have children they need to take care of or classes that they need to attend , so asking them about their personal schedules in advance can be helpful to both you and them . <p> And once you implement this process , you 'll more than likely find out that their availability is very similar to when you expect them to be available . The difference is that by using this approach , you are scheduling them collaboratively and including them in the process , which means a lot and wont be taken for granted . <h> Communicate Better <p> Open communication is another huge part of maintaining high morale throughout your staff . Always be open , responsive and supportive with your team . <p> A good idea is to set up one-on-one sessions during which employees can come in and openly speak to you about issues they might have .

Burbank and our friends at- BizzMarkBlog . <p> Baywatch might be a - silly show in its essence . Its a- show about lifeguards on a beach in California ; - not exactly Emmy-worthy programming . <p> Yet behind all of the silliness , there are lessons to be learned from it . The way the team of lifeguards functions together gives a lot of insight into best practices when it comes to working closely with a team of people who have very important responsibilities . <p> Lifeguards are much like nurses or doctors , in the sense that their job is to keep people safe- and out of harms way . Their job is essentially to make sure that no one enjoying themselves at their beach is going to need any kind of medical assistance . <p> The team at Baywatch was a very structured one . There was certainly a clear chain of command , but at the same time , everyone was treated as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what enabled the team to be successful . <p> Here are some lessons that you can learn from taking a deeper look at the show . Its more than just hairy chests and blondes in bikinis , we swear . <h> Teamwork is Everything <p> There is no concept that is more of a theme in Baywatch than teamwork . If someone did a supercut of all the times the word " teamwork " is uttered on Baywatch , the video would probably last over half an hour . <p> Yet still , they always showed you why teamwork is important ; why it is essential that everyone pulls their own weight . <p> The theme of equality is not the only one . In Baywatch , - those who are better at something always go out of their way to help their less skilled colleagues . <p> This emphasis on teamwork is something every business could learn a thing or two from . The whole is always greater than the sum of its parts and your team is only as strong as your weakest link . Cliches yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they work together and learn from each other . As someone who manages a business , you need to promote teamwork at all times and nurture an atmosphere in which people are always ready to offer their coworkers helping hands . <h> You Are n't  Always- the Smartest Person in the Room <p> Usually , Lieutenant ( later Captain ) Mitch Buchannon was the man who sorted everything out at Baywatch . He had the expertise , the skills , the analytical mind . He usually had the ability and knowledge to lead the team through the- toughest of obstacles and came up with the best solutions for any given situation . <p> Whether it was - a terrorist attack on the LA County waste disposal infrastructure or a dispute between two lifeguards , Mitch was the man with the solutions . It was understandable why he was the leader . <p> However , every now and then Lt. Buchannon would realize that he and his team would benefit from the expertise of other people . <p> Usually , it was Stephanie Holden , who was Mitchs rock on many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Newmie " Newman , who often had great expertise to offer on more- technical aspects of the professional that Buchannon was n't as well versed in . <p> Business owners and managers can learn a great deal from this . Sometimes you simply have to acknowledge your shortcomings and the fact that someone else might have a better idea that will improve your business . <p> If you have team members who are more knowledgeable than you about a particular topic , get them involved and take a backseat. - It takes quite a bit of humility , but it pays off . <h> People Deserve Second Chances <p> Its a- dog-eat-dog business world today and many business owners and managers are ruthless when it comes to employees who are n't  working up to expectations . Quite often , a single mistake means that a person is going to lose their job . <p> That is not the way things operated in Baywatch . Did you ever notice that the turnover rate at Baywatch was minimal ? Mistakes were acknowledged and people who made mistakes learned their lessons and became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be learned here . Sometimes it pays off to listen to the person who has made a mistake and react as a caring manager , not as a iron-fist dictator . Maybe it was something they could n't help or a mistake that was easy to make . Maybe the employee is dealing with something outside of work that 's affecting their performance . Sometimes people truly deserve second chances . More than that , all of your employees deserve to be treated with care and respect . <p> Talk to your staff members who are under-performing and try to help them improve . Not only will they become better at what they do , they will appreciate their workplace and their managers more . Become a- mentor to them- and help them to be the best that they can be . <h> Technology Is Your Friend <p> The folks at Baywatch were always ready and willing to implement the latest in life-saving technology , because they knew it would help them to their jobs more efficiently .

@@20687292 @687292/ <p> Employees are the most important asset that a company possesses and keeping your best staff members happy is absolutely vital to the success of your business . Happy employees are not only more productive , they are also more likely to remain with you for the long haul . <p> But in today 's employment climate , where uncertainty often exists concerning wages , healthcare benefits , job security and numerous other factors , employers are looking more than ever for ways to solidify relationships with productive workers in order to retain their services . <p> Individuals who are happy at work tend to be the ones who are more dedicated and productive . These are the staff members who will put in extra hours when a project is on a deadline and everyone needs to be dedicated to the cause . They are the ones who want the company to be successful and make an extra effort to help owners and managers reach their goals . So , how do you keep these top-notch workers with you ? <p> In an office setting , there are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your staff that they are appreciated . This may be something as basic as maintaining a generous coffee/tea bar in the break room so individuals can refuel during those long hours each day . Throw in doughnuts mid-week and an occasional tray of deli sandwiches after a particularly difficult day and now those individuals realize that their efforts have been recognized . <p> Many business owners wrongfully assume that giving their employees more money is the only way to show appreciation , but that couldnt be farther from the truth . Not only are there better ways to show appreciation to employees than handing out raises , but there are also numerous ways to increase staff satisfaction that work better than doling out more money to them . <h> Create a Positive Culture of Attendance <p> Although you have developed specific attendance policies , there may be ways to tweak those policies to create a positive culture of attendance . If an employee knows in advance that they are going to be out for a non-medical reason , encourage them to notify managers ahead of time of their availability preferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a half day by staying late or coming in early . This allows your workers to take responsibility for their absenteeism without necessarily losing pay . <p> Encourage individuals to swap shifts with each other when appropriate . This enables everyone to be responsible for managing their planned absences , lowering the headache for you or your office managers . This serves to create a higher sense of loyalty and responsibility in that team member , which they need to have in order to feel as if they are participating in the success of the business . <h> Flexibility in Scheduling <p> Part of the creation of a positive culture of attendance involves integrating flexibility in scheduling hours . This includes incorporating flexible hours in order to accommodate those times when someone needs to take time off to take care of family obligations , allowing employees with similar skills and duties to swap shifts if possible , and even , under some circumstances , operate temporarily from home . <p> According to the US Department of Labor , Women 's Bureau , it is small businesses that are most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees who have access to a more flexible workplace report higher job satisfaction and loyalty to their employer . Flexibility in scheduling is a positive step that is easy to incorporate into your mode of operation . <h> Create Positive Morale <p> Enhancing employee morale involves creating an environment where your team members feel that they are a positive part of the success of the enterprise itself . This means sharing some of your goals and aspirations with them so that they feel informed and involved . One easy way to accomplish this may be giving them information about particular project goals so they understand that they will be asked to focus harder on a particular task at times , because they are playing an important role in helping the business achieve success . <p> Another simple way to boost morale is to have open lines of communication between management and team members . Although there must be distinct lines of responsibility so that respect is maintained between management and team members , it is imperative that individuals feel comfortable speaking with management about their concerns . And managers must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues . <p> Finding ways to boost morale in the workplace will create a positive environment where individuals can flourish . Anything you can do to keep the morale of your team members high will ultimately end in a benefit to your company . Happy team members tend to be productive , loyal and responsible . <h> On-the-Job Training <p> Any time you have the opportunity to provide training for workers is time well spent . By increasing their skill sets , you are motivating them to remain engaged in the enterprise while also helping them become more efficient in their duties . They can improve their individual skills , enhancing their sense of self worth . <p> Investing in the education and training of your employees is one of the best ways to show that you want to keep them around for a while . By training your employees to take on other responsibilities , you are also setting your business up for being able to hire managers from within instead of looking for external help when the time comes to hire new people to lead your teams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value as a team member when they receive additional training on site to improve their skills . This is yet another way to build a sense of loyalty in some of your more dedicated individuals , and your endeavor will benefit highly as a result . Individuals who improve their skills also gain confidence in their ability to perform their daily tasks . <h> Financial Incentives <p> And while raises might not be the biggest motivator when it comes to retaining your best workers , it is still very much an important one . As an employer , it is your duty to stay informed as to the pay scale and financial incentives that are offered by competing businesses in your geographic area . <p> No matter how wonderful the environment is that is present at your workplace , if a similar employer down the street is paying individuals several dollars more per hour , you may end up losing some of your best talent if you do not pay attention . It is highly desirable for your workers to be happy with their salaries and benefits . <p> Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rewarding your best individuals . At times you may need to give an employee an unexpected raise as a reward for going beyond what is required on a project . Look for ways to give your team members bonuses , especially when they can be tied in with extra effort they gave on a project that yielded a high financial result to your business . <p> Another way to provide a financial benefit to your workers is through paid leave . You can provide a reward to individuals without costing your business extra expenses by granting them an additional paid day off when it 's been earned . The individuals who receive this special compensation will feel that they have received a financial benefit , but it wo n't cost you any money on the bottom line . This type of incentive can also work to encourage other individuals to devote more time and energy to various projects in the hope that they may receive the same type of reward .

It 's an important piece of data that you need to strive to obtain from the start . Having this knowledge enables you to guide your business in the right direction ; it 's the most important insight you need to navigate your retail store into successful waters . <p> Not only does this information show you what direction to head into , it also gives you a compass to follow when it comes to future needs . The biggest part of the process is being able to obtain this information in a comfortable and unobtrusive way . You need to be able to make your customers offer this information to you willingly . Trying to pry it out by using deceitful , or downright annoying , methods will only be counterproductive in the end . <p> The first step you need to take , however , is a step back . Take a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try to see what they see first . <h> Perception vs . Reality <p> One of the greatest truths in business is that no matter how good of a job you are doing , there is probably still a significant gap between how you perceive your business to be performing and how customers view your performance and services . <p> One survey on this topic shows that 60 percent of businesses surveyed believed that there customer service response is fast enough , while a majority of customers disagreed . <p> Here are a few harsh truths that you need to come to terms with if you want to really understand customer needs and build your retail company into one that truly understands its customer base . <p> A Lack of Complaints Does n't Equate to Customer Satisfaction <p> Many retailers blindly believe that quiet customers are happy customers . This is almost never the case . According to Desk.com , most customers tend not to complain , even if they are upset with the products or services that they are receiving . <p> Why are n't they complaining if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that it 's too much of a hassle and that it 's not worth it . You 'd be surprised at how many consumers believe that there 's no use complaining because they figure that businesses do n't care enough to fix the problem or address their issue . <p> And in most cases , these silently disgruntled are anything but silent . While they wo n't forward their complaints to you , these types of unhappy customers are most likely to talk negatively about you to their peers . <p> Your Perception is Probably Skewed <p> Speaking of gaps between business and customer perception , you wo n't believe how big it is when it comes to assessing the general in-store experience of a customer . <p> This recently study shows most retail business owners and customers are not even close to being on the same page on this topic . <p> When asked what makes a great in-store experience , retailers most commonly mentioned things like having advanced technology available for customers . However , that 's not what most customers care about . Customers believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees , a smart store layout and a quality selection of products . <p> That 's definitely something worth thinking about the next time you want to justify the purchase of expensive interactive technology in an effort to improve your in-store experience . While having all of these lovely gadgets might be able to lure customers into your store , that 's not going to be enough to keep them there , and most importantly , ensure that they are going to open up their wallets and buy something from you . <h> Make It Easy for Customers to Voice Their Opinions <p> If there is anything you should have taken away from the last couple of paragraphs is that you might have to investigate your customers needs and wants a little more thoroughly . Hopefully , you now understand that the fact that you 're not getting hate mail and angry phone calls every day from customers does n't necessarily mean that all of your customers are really happy with your products and services . <p> One of the most important traits that retailers need to have is a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know everything and that you should be constantly working to improve the way you interact with your customers . <p> Be proactive and accept your shortcomings so that you can work on improving them . The best way to start is to listen to what your customers are saying . And if they are not saying anything on their own , it 's your responsibility to ask them and get them to open up about their experiences with your store . <p> Encourage Reviews <p> The best way to get honest customer feedback is through reviews . This is due in big part to the fact that customers can remain anonymous when giving feedback , most of the time . The veil of anonymity allows customers to be more honest and direct in their assessment of your establishment . <p> Leaving a box in your store and some pen and paper for anyone who wants to provide feedback is a good idea . Remember when he talked about technology in stores ? One good idea is to have a tablet in your store that allows customers to leave quick reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be active on sites like Yelp as well and continuously check the feedback and tips that are being left about your store . Do n't be afraid to respond to them either , that shows that you are listening and taking the customer 's criticism to heart . <p> If you really want to increase the rate and quantity of reviews , you can do a promotion that allowing customers to enter a sweepstakes by reviewing your store or by offering discounts on future purchases if they leave comments after making initial ones . <p> Use Social Media <p> Social media is a great tool for gauging customer reactions to your store . It 's also a great way to interact with them . If you are getting questions on your Facebook or Twitter account , field them , learn from them and act on them . <p> There 's no better platform these days for showing your customers that you care than social media . It 's also a great place to show your expertise . Do n't be afraid to engage in active discussions that are related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential business partners that you are actively involved in your industry and that you know what you are talking about . <p> Do n't be afraid to dig deep , either . Not all people commenting on your store will mention you directly . Search your store name regularly and check to see what people are saying . And do n't be hesitant in responding to them either . There 's a good chance that they 'll appreciate your response , even if they were n't expecting it . <h> Address Needs Before Desires <p> To really get to the heart of customer satisfaction , you need to simplify the process and get back to basics . Forget about the fancy gadgets and the latest trends for a while and focus on your customers ' fundamental needs first . <p> The best way to enhance the shopper experience in your store is by focusing on people , not technology . It 's nice to see a great display or a technology-filled store front . But as mentioned previously , what gets people into your door is not what gets them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people instead . <p> Are all of your salespeople well trained , knowledgeable and polite ? Are you keeping track of your inventory and always making sure that you have all the merchandise you need ? Does your store layout make it easy for people to find their way around and shop ? <p> These are the types of questions that need to be considered first . And before you do anything on that end , you need to understand what your customers want from their in-store experience . <p> Perform Surveys <p> Here 's a very important rule of thumb that you must keep in mind when trying to get your customers to take surveys ; feedback is not a right . If your customers are willing to perform a survey and give you some feedback , they are doing you a solid . <p> To show them respect and appreciation , the least you can do is make the survey easy to respond to . With surveys , you can get more in-depth responses than you would by asking them to simply give quick some quick feedback as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they feel about the customer service , store design , technology , products , and just about anything you 'd like to get more feedback on . It 's a good idea to give them multiple choice questions or a grading system enabling them to rate aspects- of the store on a scale of 1-5 if you want to make it easy for them and get substantial feedback at the same time . <p> Feel free to leave a section at the end as well that can be open-ended to allow them to comment on any other aspects of the store that they might be inclined to speak on . <p> Organize Events <p> Organizing in-store events is another great way to get to know your customers better and pick their brains . If you 're going to organize an event , however , you need to do it right . Pulling off a great in-store event takes a lot of hard work and planning if you want to achieve your goals . The better the event is , the more customers will talk to you and , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event experience is , the greater the chances are that the people who attend are going to tell their friends about it . <p> Plan presentations , hold open discussions and field questions from attendees . Get some music pumping in the store and serve some food and drinks as well . Do n't be afraid to offer discounts or promotions during the event either . It 's all about showing your customers that you care about them and about your store more than your competition does . <p> Events enable you to increase the level of interaction between you and your customers and show them that there are real , caring people standing behind the brand and the store .

Its a tough business , everyone knows this . <p> We 've all heard the statistics before , but they are worth repeating . The fact is that 60 percent of restaurants go under in their first year and 80 percent wont survive five years . <p> Here a few words of wisdom that any restaurant owner , past or present , would agree are good to know when starting your own restaurant . <h> Success Is n't Guaranteed <p> The restaurant industry is n't for the weak of heart . It takes determination and passion . If you 're looking for fast cash , you wo n't find it here . Becoming one of the few food-service operations that succeeds requires planning and hard work . <p> Ignoring these facts is the reason many restaurants fail within the first year . Do n't get into the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion it 'll be hard to survive . <h> Do n't Overlook What 's Important <p> The pyramid of restaurant success is made up of your concept , chef and location . Do n't assume you can skate by without one of these three . If any of these elements are missing , your restaurant will come crumbling down . <p> Your concept should include the restaurant style ( quick-service , midscale or upscale ) , your menu and pricing . It should be a well-developed idea that clearly explains the unique aspects of your restaurant . Your chef should be inspirational while also complementing your vision and strategy . <p> If the two are not aligned , it 's a recipe for disaster . As far as location , look for a space that offers a nice flow of retail traffic , affordable rent , and a layout that meets your kitchen and dining needs . When all three of these elements are secure and strong , your restaurant can come to life . <h> Never Skimp on Customer Service <p> When you 're first starting a restaurant , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . Being smart with your money is commendable but never at the expense of customers . <p> Maintaining value in your guests ' eyes is imperative . Always allot funds to enhance their time with you . Whether it 's valet parking or passing around appetizers when on a wait . Any little gesture that confirms their importance is money well spent . <h> Structure Does n't Kill Concept <p> Flying by the seat of your pants is not a good strategy for starting a restaurant . The more systems and organizational methods you can implement , the smoother your business will run . <p> Many small business owners think that by enforcing structure they are selling out to corporate culture and killing the creativity behind their concept . In reality , the reason chains and large corporations succeed is because of the clear systems they have in place . <p> Organization relieves anxiety and stress so you can scramble less and spend more creative time enhancing your restaurant . <h> You 're Not Always Right <p> As a business owner , it 's important to be open-minded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Focus on your strengths and delegate your weaknesses to others . Simple tasks like payroll and data entry can be outsourced to a virtual assistant , while complex projects such as interior design and website development should be left to the professionals . <p> When you try to do it all , you set yourself up for failure . Be comfortable asking for help and accept that micromanaging only leads to exhaustion . <h> Overestimate Funding- Needs <p> Even if you 're sure you 've considered every factor that could affect your finances , you 'll still need more money . Realistically you should have nine months of working capital to keep your business running . <p> In the first year you 'll experience ups and down and unexpected expenses . Having enough funding to fall back on will get you through that hard first year while you build a loyal customer base and market your restaurant to the community . <h> Do n't Get Stuck In your Ways <p> Change is good " and in the restaurant industry it 's necessary . Be ready to let your idea evolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see your restaurant come to life . <p> If something is n't working , adjust it .

A recent study by Edelman found that one in three employees do n't trust their employer . Another study by EY found that number to be even lower , with only 46% having trust in their organization , and 49% in their boss/team . <p> Trust is one of the most important things you need in the workplace . Without it you wo n't have the environment you need for an effective feedback culture to grow . So how can you help close the trust gap between employees and managers ? <h> Honesty is the Best Policy <p> It may be hard to share difficult news sometimes . We naturally have a tendency to believe that delivering bad news will impact other people 's opinion of ourselves . In fact , a recent article by Forbes addressed a reader 's question about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering difficult questions from employees . <p> Being honest , even during tough times , is something the most trustworthy leaders learn how to do . Whether your company has n't met its goals and is unable to award bonuses this year , or you 've decided to let go of a member of your team . Rather than putting off the difficult talk , employees will respect a manager who is able to openly explain the situation , take questions and give them the facts . <h> Admit Mistakes <p> While being transparent about bad news is difficult , admitting when it 's you who 's made a mistake can be even more difficult . You may be surprised to find that employees will like you more for it . Admitting mistakes actually makes you more human and thereby more likeable to others . <p> Psychologists call this the Pratfall effect . Being able to admit to and take responsibility for your mistakes is a major part of being a great leader . <h> Treat Employees like People , Not Numbers <p> It 's easy to get lost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain performance metrics , managers can often get in the habit of seeing their employees in terms of output achieved . <p> Managers do n't have to be their employee 's best friend , but they should be conscious of maintaining a healthy work environment . Managers who encourage extreme competition between peers and late hours are going to end up creating a toxic work culture in which employees do n't trust their manager or each other . <p> You do n't have to know all the details of your employees ' personal lives , but managers should have a good understanding of what their employees enjoy about their job most . If you 're able to pick up on what your employee 's need to do their best , they 'll go the extra mile for you . <h> Give Credit to Your Employees <p> As the team leader , you will often receive recognition from your peers and upper management for your team 's efforts . Make sure you share appreciation and acknowledge your team members for their hard work . <p> A recent study by Globoforce showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly more likely to trust them ( 82% vs 48% ) . <h> Put Yourself On the Line for Your Team <p> To gain trust , managers must be their team 's best advocate . While inwardly you may have constructive feedback for your team about the way they approached an assignment , outwardly you must be willing to praise , advocate and take responsibility for your team 's actions . <p> When team members make a mistake it may seem common sense to distance one 's self . This may maintain your reputation , but it wo n't win you your team 's trust . This is a difficult balance that each manager will have to maintain on their own , but having a team that is highly committed to you will help you achieve the results you want in the long run . <h> Teach your Managers How to Overcome Bias <p> It 's not that managers are inherently biased , as people we have a natural tendency to make assumptions about others . This can result in managers unintentionally favoring some employees over others , known by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributes to a major loss in trust between managers and employees , especially when it affects performance reviews . Help managers learn how to identify and avoid bias in the workplace . <h> Make Yourself Vulnerable , Ask for Feedback <p> Trust is n't the magic key to workplace bliss . Issues will always arise at work , but closing the trust gap means employees will be more likely to really take on and reflect on feedback from their managers and be more honest when they give upward feedback . As more and more employees are publicizing their complaints about their employer on Glassdoor , you want a workforce that feels free and comfortable to express concerns before they boil over onto the internet . <p> But to gain this type of trust , managers must first demonstrate they 're willing to open themselves up to criticism . If they truly start to put themselves out there and ask for employee feedback , their reports will recognize this and start to follow their example .

@@20687333 @687333/ <h> What the New Overtime Rules Mean for Your Small Business <p> If you 're a U.S. business owner , then you 've probably already heard about the new overtime rules that have recently been passed by the state administration and are set to take effect by the end of the year . You 're probably also eager to understand how and if these changes are going to impact the way in which you run your business . <p> Thankfully , they do n't take effect until December 1 , 2016 , giving you some time to understand them and see if you need to make any changes to the way you pay your employees , especially those working overtime. - Here 's a rundown of the most important changes . <h> What 's Changed ? <p> According to the current overtime rules , workers who make more than $455 a week ( $23,660 a year ) , do n't qualify for overtime . Once the new rules take effect , these thresholds will be more than doubled ( $913 a week , $47,476 a year ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American workers who are qualified to earn extra money if they work more than 40 hours a week . <h> Why ? <p> The percentage of U.S. workers who qualify for overtime is at an all time low , falling from 62% percent in 1975 to only seven percent today . These new regulations hope to bring that percentage back up to at least 35% in order to provide middle class workers with more opportunities to be fairly compensated for overtime work . Millions of American workers will be effected positively by these changes . <h> What Does it Mean for Small Businesses ? <p> It might sound pretty confusing , but- here 's an easy-to follow example that should help you to- understand the basic concept : <p> Say you have an employee that you are paying $45,000 a year someone who very regularly works more than 40 hours a week . Under the new rules , that employee will now be entitled to overtime compensation at a rate of time-and-a-half for every extra hour he or she works above the weekly 40-hour threshold . <p> However , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within this salary bracket out of the equation , namely those who perform administrative or executive duties . <h> Defining Job Descriptions <p> You are going to want to look at the job descriptions that apply for every position in your business in order to see which workers will be affected by the new rules . <p> The government has already provided a duties test that will enable you to define which employees could potentially qualify for exemption . <p> So if you 're a manager of a coffee shop that sometimes pitches in as a server when your cafe gets really busy , you may not be able to do so anymore . Conversely , your position could be redefined so that these types of roles are included as part of your everyday tasks . <p> Additionally , you might also want to look into how these new rules will affect white collar workers- as well so that all your bases are covered . <h> How to Comply to the New Overtime Rules <p> There are many new rules that you are going to have to be aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what type of business you are running . Here we have compiled some tips on how to comply with the new rules , depending on what 's best for your business . <h> Raise Salaries to Enable Exemption <p> If you have managers , administrators or executives that are on the verge of being exempt according to the new overtime rules , you might want to increase their wages in order to obtain exemption . If you choose to do so , you need to make sure that the the duties of those employees are in line with the duties prescribed to executive , professional and administrative workers . <h> Pay Overtime When Necessary <p> If you have employees that are now overtime-eligible thanks to the new rules , but you do n't require them to work overtime that often , the best thing to do is to pay them the same salary and give them overtime pay when they earn it . This is a good approach for workers who do not work more than 40 hours a week every week employees who see a spike in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every now and then , but not very regularly . <h> Distribute Hours More Effectively <p> The best thing you can probably do is streamline your employee scheduling process in an effort to create work schedules that do not require anyone to work overtime shifts . You can use an employee scheduling software ( like ours ) to get a better overview of your distributed shifts and put more effort into creating balanced and more evenly distributed work shifts for all your employees to decrease the chances of needing one or several employees to work a lot of overtime hours on a regular basis . <h> There 's Still Much to Learn <p> While many business experts- have already started dissecting these new rules and are trying to figure them out and offer tips to U.S. business owners on how to deal with them , there is still a lot of work to be done . <p> There are still a lot of gray areas that need to be better defined in order to clearly understand who the workers in your company are that will be affected by these changes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes and if so , how exactly . <p> And while we have tried to give you expert opinions and links to government resources on these matters , speaking to a legal professional about these changes and how they will affect your organization is definitely the smartest route to take- right . <h> How Humanity Can Help <p> If you 're already using Humanity to schedule your employees and manage your business today , you 're probably breathing a sigh of relief while reading this . Why ? Because using Humanity can really help you a lot when it comes to managing these new overtime rules and how they affect you and your staff . <h> Keeping Better Records <p> Another important thing to know about these new overtime rules is that the Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) demands that employers keep very good records of how they are paying their staff . <p> There are no requirements when it comes to what methods you use to keep track of all this . Then why not use a tool that has been helping thousands business of all sizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? <p> Humanity helps you to not only create and organize your team 's work schedules , it does so much more . You can keep perfectly accurate records of all the shifts you create and even export them for bookkeeping and archiving purposes . <h> Better Time Tracking <p> If you 're a small business that has remote employees working for you , you 're going to need a more accurate way to keep track of their work hours now . This especially goes for- - remote employees who were previously exempt from these rules but will no longer be . <p> Humanity 's TimeClock feature is the perfect employee time and attendance tracking solution for this . You need to implement a system that is going to make sure that you are paying accurate overtime wages to your remote workers based on their hours worked , which is why you need a reliable tool like Humanity especially if your current system is an out-dated , error-prone method like using Excel spreadsheets or pen and paper . <p> Our TimeClock tool allows your regular employees to clock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks and enables you to keep perfect time and attendance records .

It 's a pretty rough experience . <p> So what do you do ? First , you need to take inventory and create a very detailed list of what it is that you exactly need , categorizing every item on your list by priority . <p> Yes , were going to talk about deciding whether or not you are going to purchase or lease equipment , but before we get into that , let 's talk a little about determining what equipment you are going to want to procure . <h> What 's Absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really need to think long and hard about what equipment is absolutely necessary for the first phase of your business venture . It obviously ca n't be stressed enough how important this first step is and how seriously it needs to be taken . <p> A good idea for compiling this type of list is to create two columns : Need and Want . This is how you will be able to get a much clearer idea of what pieces of equipment are absolutely necessary from the get-go . <p> There are other aspects that you need to take into consideration as well . Of course , price is a big one . You also need to think about your office and how all this equipment will fit into your workspace . <p> Do you really need a copy machine or do you have a place close to the office where you can get copies made when necessary ? Do you really need a cappuccino machine at this phase ? <p> Be sure to ask yourself all these questions and answer them honestly before you start spending a single penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once you 've decided on what you need to buy , it 's time to start thinking about the exact models you want to get . Of course , price tends to be the determining factor when you 've entered this phase of the procurement process . <p> And sure , price is important , but it 's not everything . Quality should really be your number one focus . This is especially true for more sophisticated equipment . If you are unfamiliar with certain equipment , it 's always a good idea to do some research online , read some users reviews and educate yourself . <p> If you know what you want and you find a good deal that fits into your budget , then snap it up . But if you have to decide between a cheaper model that is prone to problems and a more expensive model that is stable and wo n't require maintenance that often , go for the more expensive model because it will pay off in the long run . <p> Decide on how critical the equipment is first . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to your business right now , then you might be able to get away with getting the bargain model . But if it 's a critical piece of equipment , then spending more to get the best possible model is the way to go . <p> Got all that ? Now let 's look at the pros and cons of leasing and buying equipment . <p> Note : It 's also important to remember that you do n't have to commit to exclusively buying or leasing . You can make that decision on an case-by-case basis . <h> Why You Should Lease <p> 1 . Your Equipment Will Always Be Up-To-Date <p> If the equipment in question always need to be state-of-the-art and your business depends on this , then leasing is probably a better option . <p> Any equipment that needs to be updated on a very regular basis is better off being leased . When you are leasing , it 's much easier and faster to get that equipment updated . <p> Constantly buying new models can cost a ton and sometimes you just wo n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with outdated equipment . <p> 2 . You 'll Spend Less Up Front <p> It 's much easier to integrate leasing into your budget , especially if you are a company that is just starting out . <p> You know what your payments are going to add up to on a monthly or yearly basis , which means that you can prepare your finances to anticipate these costs . If you are buying , you are going to need a lot more money up front to get going , which sometimes just is n't realistic for budding businesses . <p> It 's much easier to budget leased equipment over time than to find a big chunk of money to buy immediately . <p> 3 . The Tax Deductions are Great <p> One of the best things about leasing is that it is usually 100 percent tax-deductible . <p> Leasing equipment falls under the operational expense category of the 179 IRS Tax Code , making all of your renting costs deductible in full . <p> 4 . No Maintenance Fees <p> The absolute best thing about leasing equipment is that fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the lease , the company that you are leasing the equipment from is obligated to fix it for you free of charge . <p> Most office equipment is subjected to its fair share of wear and tear , which is much easier to live with when you know that you are not going to have to fix it on your own . <p> Maintenance costs are included in your lease , so it 's not your responsibility to get things repaired when they break down . <h> Why You Should n't Lease <p> 1 . It 's More Expensive In the Long Run <p> This should n't be news to anyone who has ever leased a vehicle or has a mortgage on their home . It 's all about the interest . Whenever you are leasing anything , there will be some type of interest rate included . <p> This means that you will pay more over time than you would have if you had purchased the equipment right away . Even if you lease the equipment long enough to where you now own it , you will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of course , much more than its current value . <p> 2 . No Chance of Making Money Back <p> When you buy your equipment in full , you can always sell it and make some of your money back if you do n't need it anymore . But when you are leasing , you have no equity . <p> That really is one of the biggest issues . It 's not necessarily money that 's poorly spent , but it 's money that you have no way of getting back if it turns out that you do n't need that particular piece of equipment any longer . <p> 3 . Lease Terms Can Be Problematic <p> Frankly , signing a lease agreement can be a pretty annoying process . Many lease agreements come with a pre-determined period of time that the lease will last for , which is usually non-negotiable . <p> What does this mean ? It means that if you 're done using a piece of equipment , you might not be able to send it back right away . Instead , you will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its course . <p> This can also lead to space issues , especially when it 's a big piece of equipment . You might have to hang on to something even if you do n't need it any longer , which can make it seem like you are piling up equipment in your limited amount of office space and becoming a borderline horder . <p> 4 . Maintenance Can Be a Hassle <p> When it comes to leasing , maintenance is really a double-edged sword . On one hand , you do n't have to pay for it . But on the other hand , it 's completely out of your control . That means that you have to rely on your leasing company to get the job done , which is not always optimal . <p> This basically means that you could be in for a wait if you need something repaired . Sure , you 're not paying for it , but sometimes time is a factor and you would rather pay for the repair yourself to get it fixed quickly . And if you have signed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 5 . You Ca n't Always Choose <p> If you are leasing equipment , then your options are limited to what the leasing company you 've signed with has in stock at the moment . That is why you should really take a close look at what equipment and brands the leasing company offers before signing on with them . <p> There 's a good chance that the company might not have the exact brand or model that you want in stock , which means that you will have to settle for a piece of equipment that might not be your top choice every now and then . <h> Why You Should Buy <p> 1 . You 're the Owner <p> This is pretty self-explanatory . If you buy all your equipment , you own it . This means that you can do anything you want with it . You can fix it when you want and need to , and you can sell it if you do n't need it anymore . <p> There is no one telling you what you can and ca n't do with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in complete control . <p> 2 . No Contracts Involved <p> Another great thing about buying is that you never have to deal with laborious leasing contracts . It 's just easier . Taking out a lease usually involves tons of paperwork , because every leasing company will ask for you to provide detailed financial information about your company before signing anything . <p> When buying , all you have to do is pick what you need and pay for it . There are no negotiations and very little paperwork is involved in the process . <p> 3 . You Can Always Choose <p> As mentioned earlier , leasing limits your choices . When you are under contract , you are only able to lease equipment that the company you are leasing from currently has in stock . When you are buying , there are no restrictions , besides budget . <p> You can simply find the model and brand that you want and purchase it if you have the money for it . <p> 4 . Maintenance Is Less of a Hassle <p> One of the downsides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flip the bill whenever you need to get something repaired . But there is an upside to that . <p> When you are paying for maintenance , you do n't have to rely on anyone else to get it done . When you are leasing , you have to wait for the leasing company to get your equipment fixed . Sure , it wo n't cost you anything , but it could take a while . And there really is nothing that you can do to speed up the process when you are renting . Since the leasing company is paying for it , they make the rules . <p> But when you have purchased the equipment , you do n't have to wait for anyone and can get the repairs done immediately . <p> 5 . Everything is Deductible <p> Here 's where you really ca n't lose . Whether you are purchasing equipment or leasing it , pretty much everything is completely deductible . <p> According to Section 179 of the IRS code , all of the equipment that you either purchase or lease for your company in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why You Should n't Buy <p> 1 . It Costs More Up-Front <p> If money is tight , then buying might just not be an option at this point in your business plan . Surely , it 's much easier to budget leasing , since you only have to worry about making smaller monthly payments instead of forking over large amounts of money all at once . <p> If you want to buy all of your equipment at once , you might then have to make sacrifices elsewhere and pool all of the money you have that might have been meant for marketing or advertising into buying equipment . <p> Trying to buy more than you can initially afford often leads to choosing cheaper equipment and settling on equipment of lower quality that fits into your budget better . This can obviously backfire , since you will then be stuck with outdated or lower-quality equipment that you 've already paid for and ca n't simply give back . <p> 2 . Maintenance Depends on You <p> This is why one of the most important things that you have to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have purchased the equipment , you are responsible for maintaining it . This can get really expensive if you 're having bad luck and your equipment is constantly breaking down . <p> The good thing is that you do n't have to depend on anyone else to get the repairs done , but the bad thing is that you are paying for everything , which can really eat away at your budget . <p> 3 . Keeping Up-to-Date is Harder <p> If you 're buying everything , you are eventually going to be left with some outdated equipment that you might not have the money to upgrade right away . This is especially true for computer-related technology . <p> That 's why a combination of buying and leasing is probably the best scenario . Buy the stuff you know you wo n't have to upgrade any time soon , and lease the technology that needs to be always up-to-date . <h> Conclusion <p> It can not be stressed enough what an involved process procuring equipment for your business is . There are so many things to take into consideration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at prices , lease contracts , warranties , tax deductions and resale values , you are also going to have to take into consideration how long every piece of equipment will be needed , how quickly it will become obsolete , the potential revenue that will come from using the equipment , how it fits into your office physically , and so much more . <p> If there is one final takeaway from this all , it 's that this is a process that requires patience , critical thinking and meticulous planning above all else .

Every phase of the employee lifecycle in equally important . <p> We 've talked earlier about employee engagement and ways to keep your staff motivated . Now let 's talk a little bit about the end of the employee lifecycle the exit interview . <p> Losing employees for one reason or another is a hard but very real fact of today 's business world . Retention continues to be one of the most difficult aspects of running a business and employees leaving your company is a simple fact of life . <p> When they do leave , it 's important that you are making the most out of that process as well . Conducting exit interviews is a must ; it 's a process that can give your organization a lot of valuable information that could help with improving your employee retention program in the long run . <p> Exit interviews should be performed in order to garner information about the experience that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What went wrong ? Why did they choose to leave ? What could have you done differently ? <p> Here are some tips to think about when performing exit interviews and trying and get the most out of them . <h> Laying the Groundwork <p> Before you start asking questions , you need to prepare the ground . You need to make sure that you are doing everything possible to ensure that the conditions under which the exit interview is being conducted will facilitate the former employee 's ability to provide you with relevant information and , most importantly , honest feedback . <p> Firstly , the former employee needs to be contacted cordially and informed about the process . It 's important to remember that exit interviews should always be optional . The only way you are going to get quality feedback is if the former employee is comfortable and actually wants to provide you with it . Making the exit interview mandatory and trying to pry information from someone who is not interested in cooperating in this process will lead you to nothing but a dead end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree to the interview , he or she should also be allowed to refrain from answering any questions he or she does not feel comfortable answering . <p> Explain the process fully via email or a phone call first and then ask them if they would be willing to participate . You should let them know who will be performing the interview and what type of questions they can expect . <p> Be very upfront about confidentiality as well . Let the former employee know who in your organization will have access to the information that they are going to provide to you . <p> Be very clear about the purpose of the interview . <h> Why are You Doing This ? <p> The reason for performing exit interviews is to dig deeper into the process behind your former employees decision to leave . You do n't need to perform an exit interview to understand some of the fundamental reasons . <p> Sure , leaving to take a job that pays more is not uncommon . But that might not be the whole story . According to industry surveys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important than money- to many people . <p> More money , better benefits , proximity , more manageable work schedules ; those are all very real reasons for taking another job . But the purpose of the exit interview is to dig deeper . You want to find out what spurred this person to begin the process of looking for a new job . <p> There must be an underlying reason behind that person 's realization that he or she no longer wants to work for you . Performing a good exit interview will help you to better understand those initial reasons behind the decision to start their job search . <h> When Should They Be Performed ? <p> They best thing to do is to wait a while . Exit interviews should not be rushed into . If the person has announced that he or she is resigning from their position at your company , give it a couple of weeks before contacting them about the possibility of participating in the exit interview . <p> No matter how long that employee has been with you or the circumstances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of emotions involved . Give them a few weeks to get those emotions under control and gain some perspective on the situation . <p> Whether the employee is leaving upset or content , they are going to need some time to reflect on their time with you . <p> When employees leave disgruntled , chances are that they are still not going to be very positive about their experience with your company , even a couple of weeks later. - But there 's a much better chance that they are going to be able to give you more constructive criticism rather than just dwelling on what they do n't like about you if a few weeks have passed and the emotions have had a chance to simmer down . <p> Whatever the case is , providing the former employee with a couple weeks to reflect on their experience with your company will most likely provide you with a better foundation for getting relevant responses from them . <h> Who Is Asking the Questions ? <p> There are various schools of thought when it comes to who should be conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing it . But there 's a good chance that the reason for leaving could be directly related to disagreements with someone who was directly responsible for that employee . This usually means that employees wo n't feel comfortable enough to open up to someone about issues that they might have had with them directly . <p> The second option is to talk with HR . This does make the most sense , since the HR staff is directly responsible for many processes within the employee lifecycle . <p> Others believe that it might be better to seek out a third party to perform the interviews . Someone within the company who is not a part of HR but also not from the same department as the departing employee . Chances are that employees might be most comfortable with giving someone with that description the most honest feedback . <p> Certainly , it 's not an exact science and any one of these options could work . The best option would probably be to conduct some trial and error experiments to see what shows the best results for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ( and should ) vary from organization to organization , here are several staples that should not be ignored . <p> What are your main reasons for leaving ? What would you have needed to consider staying ? Did you receive adequate support and training ? Did you receive adequate feedback and guidance ? What did you enjoy most about working here ? What aspects could use some improvement ? Did you dislike any of our policies ?

Sometimes you might forget to take a look in the mirror to see whether they are things that you can change about yourself that can directly lead to making both your staff and business better . <p> That 's what Self Improvement Month is all about analyzing yourself and setting goals that are going to make you better at what you do . <p> Becoming the best manager that you can be is an ongoing process. - It 's something that you need to constantly work at , because there 's an ever-changing and evolving skill set that is required of a good manager , dictated by the fast-changing landscape of the modern workplace . <p> Not sure where to start ? Here are a ideas to consider if you are looking to become a better manager for the sake of your business and your employees . <h> Improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's criticism or praise , has practically become an art form . It 's something that just about any manager can stand to improve on , simply because there are many fine lines that need to be tiptoed in the process . <p> No matter how you go about offering feedback , you need to make sure that it 's constructive above all else . This is where you probably come to the finest line of all the line between being overly critical and constructive . Tempers may flair in the workplace , employees might be underachieving , but that 's something that every manager has to figure out how to deal with the right way . <p> And while you might believe that you are going about it the correct way , you 'd be surprised at how many times the employee 's perception of your approach is much different from yours . You could be trying to be fair and critical , but actually coming across as angry and insulting to your staff . It happens a lot . <p> Even if you think you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a step back and access the way you evaluate your employees to see if there is any room for improvements , because there usually is . <p> Whether you are criticizing the shortcomings of your team or specific employees or offering employees praise to motivate them to continue working hard for you , these are processes that you need to continually analyze , define and strive to improve upon if you want to grow as a manager and leader . <h> Be More Open to New Ideas <p> How open are you to trying new ideas and listening to people outside of management for tips and fresh directions ? Probably not enough . As a manager , it is n't unusual to be a bit afraid of taking risks and trying new things , because you are always aware of the bottom line and how costly any type of mistake can be to your business . <p> But taking risks is the only way your business is going to grow . The best managers understand that . That 's why you 'll usually find that the best and most successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on a limb , adaptable to changes and always interested in hearing about new ideas no matter where they are coming from . <p> If you want to try opening yourself up to new ideas , start with being a better listener . Some of the best ideas you 'll get will come directly from your staff . And it makes perfect sense . They are the people who are working in the trenches day in and day out . It should n't be surprising that they have a few ideas on what could be done to make various facets of the business run better , especially those parts that they are directly responsible for on a daily basis . <p> The role of a leader is to encourage creativity and constantly work to find new ways to inspire creative thinking on all levels of your organization . Employees appreciate being able to have some input in the process as well . In fact , it has been proven that employees who are not encouraged to think creatively and offer solutions on a regular basis often feel- unmotivated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Including them in the process not only gives you a great source of fresh new ideas to consider , it also helps you retain your best and brightest staff members . <h> Do n't Be Afraid to Get Personal <p> Many managers fear getting too close to their staff on a personal level , because they are afraid that being a nice guy can often be perceived as a weakness . That 's not the case at all . In fact , employees love it when managers take an interest in them and their lives outside of the workplace . <p> It 's important to remember that at the end of the day , all of your employees are people who have lives of their own . Taking an interest in these lives shows that you care for them on a deeper level , which gives breeds- a greater sense of engagement and inclusion . <p> Getting to know your employees on a more personal level does n't just mean talking to them about their personal lives . It also means getting to know what their work lives are like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivates them to be better employees ? Where do they see themselves professionally in five years ? Do you do enough to facilitate their professional aspirations ? <p> The best managers are able to connect their visions for the business with the visions of their employees . If you want to achieve more meaningful employee engagement and are intent on keeping your best employees around and allowing them to grow professionally within your company , you need to listen to their personal experiences and aspirations and try to align their goals with your own . <h> Set Clearer Goals for Your Team <p> Before you can start aligning your goals with employee goals , you need to be able to define both . Most managers put a lot of time into defining well-conceived and detailed business strategies , but they often fail to do the same for their employees . <p> This is another crucial part of doing employee evaluations the right way . The best way to encourage employees to do better work is to give them very clear , measurable goals that are easy to follow and gauge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier . <p> In order to create realistic and achievable goals for your employees , you need to include them in the process from the start . Collaborate with them and talk openly about what you expect from them and what they expect from themselves . <h> Work On Your Personal Brand <p> You 've spent a lot of time focusing on your business and , hopefully , you 're going to be spending more time focusing on your employees . But do n't forget about setting some time aside to focus on yourself . <p> Book time on your schedule during which you 're going to analyze your shortcomings as a manager and brainstorm to find ways in which you can improve yourself . It 's really is n't a bad idea to include your staff in this process either . Create a survey for your staff asking them questions about yourself and the job you do ( make sure it 's anonymous so they do n't hold back ) and let them guide you in the right direction . <p> It 's always good to have more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're analyzing yourself . By allowing your staff members to make comments on the work that you do , you are opening yourself to criticism and showing your team that you not only value their opinions , but that you do n't consider yourself to be superior or untouchable in the grand scheme of things . You are part of the team , just like they are . <p> Humility is a great characteristic for managers to have , because you 're letting staff know that you are trying to create an atmosphere at work in which everyone can stand to improve , management included .

If you 're not having much success through all of the regular channels , turning to social media could be a great option . Kickstarter has helped many business ideas become realities and has helped many small businesses get off the ground since its inception in 2009 . <p> No matter what type of business you have , raising funds and securing financing for your idea never- comes easily . If you 're not having much success through all of the regular channels , turning to social media could be a great option . <p> Kickstarter has helped many business ideas become realities- and has helped many small businesses get off the ground since its inception in 2009 . One of the best things about Kickstarter is that there is not much risk involved at all . You might spend some money to make your presentation stand out , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money if your campaign does not succeed . <p> If a Kickstarter campaign sounds like something you would like to try in order to raise money for your entrepreneurial venture , here are five tips to keep in mind during the process . <h> Invest in Your Presentation <p> Your presentation is what makes or breaks you . More specifically , your Kickstarter page video is going to be what gets people excited about your idea and gets them to donate to the cause . <p> That 's why you are going to have to invest some money into the video , unless your business is a video production company and it probably is not . Hire video professionals to put your pitch together . You should hire creatives to help you come up with a concept and make sure that your idea has an impact with viewers . <p> You should also hire a video staff that includes a director , videographer and editor to really polish up your video and make it stand out . <p> The copy on your Kickstarter page also needs to be clear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a good idea to look at businesses within your niche that have succeeded and take some pointers from them . <h> Do n't Put All Your Eggs in One Basket <p> There 's nothing wrong with continuing to seek other sources of funding while you are running a Kickstarter campaign . The people who are interested in donating to your cause do not care whether you are going to finance the project through just Kickstarter or with the help of other investors . <p> They just want to see you succeed so that they can get what they signed up for from you . So for example , you can keep trying to obtain a loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration , even if you have n't had success earlier . <p> And if you do succeed with your Kickstarter campain in the end , make sure that you are promoting something that you can live up to . If your backers feel as if you are not working hard enough to turn your business into what was promised , they could potentially take legal action against you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . Kickstarter makes you sign a document that releases them from all liability related to your personal campaign . <h> Promote the Campaign Tirelessly <p> Creating a great video and pitch for your company might be the most important aspect of running a successful Kickstarter campaign , but getting the word out about it is certainly the second most important . <p> You really need to go all out to promote your campaign , especially on social media . Remember , your video and presentation ca n't get people interested if not enough people are seeing it and sharing it . <p> Engaging your potential backers is of crucial importance , and it would n't hurt to spend some money on Facebook ads and Twitter promotions either . Frankly , the only way to be a success on Kickstarter is to get viral , at least within your niche and community . You need to not only attract backers , but also get them to help you spread the word about your idea . <h> Take Advantage of the Momentum <p> If your Kickstarter campaign does succeed , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure more investments outside of the world of social media . <p> Kickstarter can be used as leverage to make your next big move and keep the funds coming in . If you did n't have success drumming up interest before the campaign , a near-successful run at Kickstarter should get a lot more people interested . <p> Drumming up support via- Kickstarter shows potential investors that an actual market does exist for your vision , which is why you need to take advantage of it . <h> Do n't Give Up If You Come Up Short <p> Not every Kickstarter campaign is going to end up being successful . And that 's completely alright . But there 's no reason to stop trying . <p> Your Kickstarter campaign , even if you did n't reach your goal , gave you a good amount of promotion . Use that buzz to continue pitching your ideas and continuing your search for funding . <p> Kickstarter is a good way to see what kind of interest exists for your business . Use everything you have learned from your experience to make your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Kickstarter presents a safe and potentially very beneficial route for getting your business ideas out to a larger audience. - Remember , it 's does n't have to be a campaign that encompasses your entire business . It can be a campaign for a great new feature or aspect of your business that helps improve the overall picture of your original idea . <p> It 's a low risk/high potential reward way to promote your business ideas that you should n't be hesitant about trying out .

They should also provide an expert to train employees on how to use the software . The application developer should guarantee future upgrades which are usually meant to enhance the service and accommodate future changes in the establishment . <p> Benefits <p> There are several benefits of rotating shift schedules . These benefits are even further made possible by using efficient software to develop acceptable , reasonable , safe and practical schedules . Some of the advantages of using such software include ; <p> Convenience " since the software will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shifts from anywhere .

It also cuts down the time and resources spent in developing a functional rotating shift working schedule . Additionally , there is room for future upgrades and modifications to suite your business ' requirements . <p> How it works <p> Software applications for rotating shift schedules have the same working characteristic of all online packages .

The software is simply installed into the company 's computers and then relevant data and information is fed-in/uploaded . This is usually the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data entry is through , integration with other software and databases is only a way to further simplify tasks and improve efficiency . This involves uploading information from other databases , sharing the scheduling information with other systems and basically enhancing information flow .

The reason for this should be obvious . If you have too many staff on any given shift they will not have enough work to keep them productive , while if you do n't have enough staff on a shift then it will mean that they are overstretched and unable to do all the jobs that need to be done on that shift . If you are missing somebody from a shift and the staff can still manage to get the work done then it was overstaffed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / under booked shifts you will need to becomes skilled at scheduling and know the demands of the business inside out . <p> One of the most common reasons for staffing problems is poor planning by the person responsible for the scheduling . If you want to reduce over booked/ under booked shifts then you must know what work demands are going to exist for that particular shift . Simply reproducing the schedule based on what you had on the schedule is not going to be an effective way to reduce over booked/ under booked shifts . In almost every business you will have work demands that are constantly changing so the staffing should reflect this . <p> One big factor that can seriously interfere with your ability to reduce over booked/ under booked shifts will be staff holidays and sick days . Staff sick days can be particularly problematic because you do n't tend to get much notice for them ; you might only learn that somebody is n't coming in a few hours before the shift starts . Of course you will be concerned with the well-being of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big problem to sort out at short notice . It is a good idea to have some type of contingency plan for sudden absences ; maybe have a telephone list of workers who might consider overtime or the numbers for some reliable freelancers . When it comes to holidays it is important that you have some rules about how much notice the staff must give you . If you plan for all of these events then you should improve your ability to reduce over booked / under booked shifts . <p> If you realise that you have too many or too few workers on a shift , what should you do ? If you are serious in your efforts to reduce over booked/ under booked shifts then you might want to take action . If you have too many bodies on the day then it might be worth offering to allow somebody take it as a vacation day or half-day . If there are too few workers then you might want to consider calling more people in because otherwise you could be left with unfinished work or overstressed staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifts is never easy , but it is important for your business that you get this right .

It 's a full-time job that demands your undivided attention . To most restaurant owners , even very successful ones , opening up a second location sounds like science fiction . <p> Running more than one restaurant is a huge challenge , there 's no doubt about it . But in the right situation and with a right moves being made , it is not an impossible feat . <p> Perhaps you 're a successful restauranteur . Your eatery is running on all cylinders and has been for some time . In this situation , you might be asking yourself what 's next ? Opening up a second location might be the answer . <p> But how do you know if you are ready to move on from being a successful restaurant owner to potentially becoming the successful owner of a restaurant chain ? Here are a few questions to ask yourself if you 've been considering such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Unless your original restaurant is making a killing , there really is no reason to even consider expanding your operation . That 's the first and most important sign you need to see in order to get the ball rolling . Is your main location generating enough money to sustain your business and cover at least some of the costs of opening a second location ? If so , you have a good place to start . <p> Having a restaurant that 's very profitable is not only a good starting point , financially , it 's also gives you a fantastic place to begin in terms of developing a business plan for your second location . Take a look at what has worked for your first location and then perform an analysis on whether these winning business ideas can be implemented at your second location as well . <p> How important was the neighborhood to the success of your first location ? Will you be able to find a location that has just as much potential for success as the previous one ? How much competition did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition to battle at the potential second location ? <p> Use your successful location as a benchmark that is going to help you plan your next move . And while the exact conditions that allowed your first restaurant to succeed can rarely be mirrored at your next location , you can still gain tremendous insights by analyzing what worked at your first location and what did n't . <p> And of course , if your second location ends up taking longer to get going , it 's good to know that your first location is going to be able to handle some of the financial burden that is sure to come in the early phases of your expansion . <h> Can One Location Succeed Without You ? <p> How critical is your presence to the success of your restaurant ? Do you need to micromanage your business or do you have a team that you can trust to keep the eatery purring along even when you 're not around ? <p> If you do n't believe that the success of the first restaurant can be duplicated of you are n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not worth attempting . There 's no way to devote all of your attention to two restaurants it 's physically impossible . And if that 's the situation , no matter how dedicated you are , one location is bound to suffer . Either your first location will flounder without you or your second will never get off the ground . <p> Many restauranteurs do not realize how important it is to create a strong team of trusted business partners to surround them . Many are prone to trying to participate in every facet of running their business , and sometimes they end up spreading themselves too thin as a result . <p> Do you have someone on your team that you can trust to run your first location while you 're tending to the new one ? Do you have someone that you can trust to develop the second location while you keep the old one profitable ? <p> If you do n't , then you should hold off on opening a second location . What you should then focus on is working to assemble a team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reins over to every now and then . <h> Is The Market Big Enough ? <p> When speaking about opening up a new location , it 's already assumed that you have thought about it some and that you at least have an idea of where you 'd like the new location to be . Obviously , researching that planned location is one of the most important aspects of this undertaking . If you 're already running one successful establishment , picking the right location was already one of the most important steps to opening up your first restaurant . <p> Thankfully , the process should be a little easier this time around since you already know what to look for you know what works for you . Most of the time , it 's not just about the food , it 's about the clientele . What are your top demographics ? If your best customers are business people who work in the vicinity of your original restaurant , do n't assume that you 'll be able to duplicate your success without them . <p> If the concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of your first restaurant , make sure that your next location is not trying to capitalize on the same exact group of people . Make sure that it 's far enough away from your first location , but at the same time , try to find a consistent demographic . <p> If your target audience is college students , do n't open up your second restaurant near the same campus . Try to find a location that allows you to cater to a different group of the same demographic . <h> Do You Have the Needed Capital ? <p> As you already know , being that you 've already done it , opening a new restaurant is not cheap . Even if your first location is doing very well , that certainly does n't mean that it 's generating enough income to support your plans to open a second one . <p> The good thing is that you already have an idea of what it costs and you are aware of the type of expenses that go into it . You 're going to need to pay rent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area that 's cheaper than your current one ? How much new equipment do you need ? How many employees are you planning to hire ? How much is renovating and furnishing your new location going to run you ? <p> There 's a good chance that you might have to end up taking out a loan for the new location . Thankfully , there are plenty of options for getting restaurant loans . If you need to go that route , and you are probably going to , make sure to take a long hard look at your options to decide what 's best for your restaurant . Do n't be afraid to mix and match loan types to get the best results . <h> Conclusion <p> The bottom line is that opening a second restaurant is not easy . There are many prerequisite circumstances that needs to be in place before you can even start thinking in that direction . <p> But once you have checked off most of those requirements , the good news is that this is going to be somewhat familiar territory for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that you have already beaten the odds . You 've been through it and you know what it takes to succeed in this very crowded vertical . <p> However , it 's important to remember that running one successful eatery does n't guarantee the success of another one . Take your time and make sure that you are n't cutting any corners the second time around and above all , do your homework before taking the leap .

This can be a huge headache for those handling employee sick days when it comes to scheduling . It could mean a morning frantically phoning around looking for cover or leaving an understaffed shift to struggle along and trying to do the best they can . Handling employee sick days can mean completely rearranging a schedule that has taken hours to produce , and upsetting other staff because their shifts need to be changed . Of course , the important thing is that the staff member has the time to recuperate from their illness , but it is still not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When handling employee sick days it is important to always try and get the staff member replaced for the shifts they were working . The only exception to this will be when the shift was overstaffed anyway , but this should n't really happen if scheduling has been done effectively . It is not a good idea to just leave a shift understaffed because this can mean staff becoming overworked and stressed and likely lead to more work handling employee sick days as more fall by the wayside . Finding replacement staff can be a real nightmare , but it has to be done . If the staff member is a key-working with important skills that are needed for the shift then finding a replacement is going to be even more difficult . <p> When you are handling employee sick days and looking for replacements you will probably want to first ring around those members of staff who have the day-off to see if any are willing to come into work ; if you are able to offer overtime money then this will likely encourage some to volunteer . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover because if the person is going to be off for a few days you will likely be able to juggle around with the schedule to fill the gaps . Sometimes handling employee sick days will involve brining in agency staff or freelancers . This is not always ideal because it can be expensive and showing somebody new the ropes can mean a bit of extra work . <p> It is almost certain that your business will have its own sick leave policy and other rules about handling employee sick days . We wo n't go into these in too much detail here only to mention that employees usually have certain legal rights in regards to these days off for illness . You may require them to produce a medical certificate for this , but this will depend on your company policy .

If it is happening too often with the same employee then it would be recommended that they have their case reviewed by your occupational health department . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days to recuperate and will soon be back on their feet . 
@@20687480 @687480/ <p> With our latest release , Humanity now supports Secure Assertion Markup Language ( SAML ) , which allows us to provide Single Sign-on ( SSO ) . Single Sign On can improve security through centralizing access and removing the need for individual users to manage multiple individual passwords . Single Sign On also reduces costs related to user administration in both the cases of onboarding and offboarding . <p> Some Key benefits to using SAML in Your Organization <p> Directory integration- Since SAML does not use passwords to sign users in , it makes it easy to integrate with an enterprise 's directory and let users sign in with their network password . Directory integration is achieved indirectly through the identity provider who typically offers extensive functionality in this area. - <p> Elimination of user passwords- Security is increased since users do not have to remember multiple passwords and also prevents unwanted entities from stealing passwords and gaining unauthorized access. - <p> Centralizing access control- SAML forces users to always authenticate in one place " at the identity provider " which makes it possible to enforce multi-factor authentication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Increased productivity- SAML provides users one-click access via single sign-on which saves times and energy on behalf of each user and for the enterprise as a whole. - <p> Configuring Single Sign-on ( SSO ) in Humanity <p> Users with access to the admin tab of the application will see " Single Sign-On " in the left navigation under Integration . <p> To get started with configuration , make sure the " SAML Enabled " checkbox is clicked . To enable SSO for Humanity , the administrator will need a SAML Issuer URL and a X.509 Certificate found from their SAML server . These two pieces of information will need to be entered in their respective fields and are required for Humanity to communicate with your SAML server . ( *Some SAML servers may also request a Consumer Service URL ( ACS ) which is found on the right-hand side of the single sign-on section of the admin tab ) . <p> Once SSO is configured , users will be redirected to the SAML server for authentication upon login . Users identities can be stored either on the SAML server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or LDAP . After authentication , users will be redirected to Humanity for application use . <p> Humanity &amp; OneLogin Partnership <p> Though a partnership with OneLogin , Humanity has joined top notch cloud services like Zendesk , Yammer , and Salesforce who already have a place in its directory. - A SAML server can either be built in-house or offered from a service provider . OneLogin is a leading provider of identity &amp; access management for enterprise web apps . As part of our relationship with OneLogin , their team has extended a special offer to Humanity customers : <p> If you 're not already a OneLogin subscriber , you can use OneLogin for free with Humanity plus directory integration .
