@@109157010 @4557010/ <h> Interview : Kirk Pysher , president , International Launch Services <p> International Launch Services President Kirk Pysher views the engine-quality issues that have grounded Russia 's Proton rocket since June as a sign that Russia 's government and industry sector are serious about quality control . He 's hopeful of a return to flight by April or May . <p> For Reston , Virginia-based ILS , which is responsible for Proton 's commercial sales , the past eight months have not been easy . First there was a second-stage anomaly in June 2016 during the mission carrying Intelsat 's IS-31 telecommunications satellite . <p> The problem , attributed to a loss of material strength properties that was likely the result of an improper propellant line attachment , did not result in a failure but grounded Proton for several months . <p> Proton 's planned December return to flight , with EchoStar Corp . ' s EchoStar 21 S-band satellite for European mobile services , was scrapped and a full-scale investigation was begun . <p> The continued grounding of Russia 's workhorse rocket has come at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following a September failure . That has put two of the three principal commercial launch service providers " the third is Europe 's Arianespace " on the sidelines . <p> The global commercial launch market being what it is , very few of the affected customers of SpaceX or ILS have been able to move elsewhere . <p> In a Feb. 15 interview , Pysher said ILS is cautiously optimistic of being able to return to flight , with the EchoStar 21 , in April or May . Two further commercial launches , of Hispasat and AsiaSat satellites , are planned before the end of the year . <p> Pysher is asking customers to look beyond the pain of the launch delay to see just how seriously the Russian government and Russia 's industry takes the issue of engine quality . <p> What can you tell customers about the Proton rocket 's status ? <p> Pysher : Let me start by saying that this is actually a quality- control success story . <p> As part of the standard quality process , and this may be unique to Russia , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test program , where they will pull an engine from the production line once a year and do an extended duration test on it , typically at higher thrust levels than what is needed for flight . <p> The purpose is to validate the quality and production stability . They conducted that test on one of Proton 's second-stage engines in early December . The engine survived the test , typically run at twice the flight duration and at higher thrust value for at least part of the duration . <p> Following that test , they do a destructive inspection of the engine . They cut it open and do visual and metallurgical inspections . On one component , they found the brazing did not have the proper bonding characteristics . <p> Roscosmos organized an investigation and they determined that the solder used in that brazing operation had a higher melt point than what they expected . <p> But that solder issue did not affect the test firing ? <p> Pysher : That 's right , the engine had survived the test . With the soldering , they lay sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oven and bake it . The solder then melts and flows throughout the engine . At a lower melt point , when it bakes in the oven at a set temperature it will flow better than a solder that has a higher melt point . <p> That leads to a decision point . Do they continue flying these engines or do they stop because of the uncertainties ? <p> So the first point is the quality process did catch this before it got on a flight vehicle . It was found on the ground . <p> Second , from an engineering standpoint there was a decision to make . <p> You demonstrated the capability even with the higher-melt solder , but do you really want to take that risk ? If you take the risk , how do you explain it to your customers ? <p> Grounding Russia 's work horse <p> So the decision was made : Let 's ground the work horse of the Russian launch business and replace these engines with a component with the expected bonding characteristics . <p> This is part of the renewed emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director-general of Proton prime contractor Khrunichev Space Center to ensure 100 percent mission success . <p> All this had no relation to the Proton anomaly in June ? <p> Pysher : Correct . In fact , the paperwork has verified that the engines that had this higher-melt-point solder were not among the engines that were on the Intelsat IS-31 launch . There 's no relationship between the two . <p> What was the root cause of the IS-31 launch issue ? <p> ILS Chief Operating Officer John L. Palme : That was traced to a likely quality lapse in an attachment point on a line heading to the gas generator on the engine . That line was subjected to higher-than-expected vibrations that led to a fatigue failure and eventually a failure of the line to the gas generator , leading to an earlier-than-planned shutdown of the engine . <p> Khrunichev was able to duplicate that exact scenario on the ground and traced it to a mechanical attachment that did not meet the specifications for tightening , or may not have been present . <p> And that accounted for the vibration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the degrees of freedom that would have been taken out by that attachment was not adequately taken out and that led to higher vibrations in the line and a leakage of the oxydizer . <p> When was this issue resolved ? <p> Palme : In August , and we had a final briefing with customers in early September . <p> What happened between September and December , when the solder issue was discovered ? <p> Pysher : We had to implement the corrective actions from that anomaly investigation , which led us to the start of the launch campaign in mid-November . <p> Palme : We basically had to pause the EchoStar hardware at the factory until the investigation by the Russian committee was completed . That took time as they wanted to see evidence of testing to duplicate the exact situation . So that ended up to being an investigation of three months or so . Then we had to out-brief it and then the corrective actions on that engine on the vehicle meant the vehicle itself had to be system tested . <p> So we started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in late December . <p> Then came the test of the engine with the solder issue . <p> Pysher : Yes . You may remember in 1999 , a Delta 3 flight failed with an issue with the RL-10 engine that was linked to brazing operations . It was a very similar thing . You lay in this cold solder , put it in an oven and bake it and you did n't  get the proper flow characteristics . The difference was that the RL10 issue was discovered after a launch anomaly , whereas this was discovered on the ground before it found its way into a flight . <p> Was the soldering issue at the Voronezh manufacturing plant due to someone wanting to save money by using below-spec components ? <p> Pysher : The investigation is ongoing . They are at the point where they understand that the melt point was higher than expected . But how this found its way into the engine is not yet determined . <p> My impression is that this is not a case of a guy going to Home Depot and buyingsolder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be a purchase order that was issued , someone had to have engineering behind the order , it 's pretty complex . We 'll probably find out over time what the story is . <p> I am guessing here , but the solder may be used on some other engine in the facility and there may have been some engineering which allowed that to be substituted . There have been reports that the technical documentation was confusing . But I do n't  think we 're at the point where we can say how it found its way into the engine . <p> What happens in the next couple of months ? <p> Pysher : There is a launch opportunity in April or May . We 're not 100 percent there yet , but we understand there is a viable opportunity for that to occur . Komarov has said there were seven planned launches for Proton this year and they expect to conduct all of them . We plan three commercial missions . <p> So the return to flight in April or May will be the ILS mission for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Proton 's uneven record in recent years gives an impression of quality-control breakdowns . But for the engines , quality assurance seems extensive " and costly . <p> Pysher : Here 's the engine test process for our third-stage engines , just to take an example . Each production lot is six engines . Two go into lot-acceptance testing . They pull out two of the six and do an extended-duration , extended-thrust level test firing . It 's not the same as the periodic test , which is more severe . <p> Then they cut up those engines and evaluate the quality and only then are the other four allowed to be put on the vehicle . That 's a very expensive process . And then you add the periodic-test engine , which is typically on an annual basis but is linked to time and the number of engines produced . So it could be conducted more or less frequently . But typically it 's an annual basis . <p> It 's a pretty extensive qualification test when it comes to engines . There has been discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of pressure on everybody to cut costs . But I do n't  think that 's going to happen . <h> Share this : <h> Related <p> Peter de Selding is a Co-Founder and editor for SpaceIntelReport.com .

@@109157032 @4557032/ <h> Interview : Eduardo Bonini , CEO , Visiona Tecnologia Espacial <p> Eduardo Bonini , chief executive of Visiona of Brazil , says the Brazilian government needs a coordinated space program to take full advantage of the technology transfer from Thales Alenia Space that was part of the contract to build the large SGDC telecommunications satellite . Credit : Visiona <p> RIO DE JANEIRO " The big question hanging over Brazil 's Visiona Tecnologia Espacial has always been : What 's next after the 2-billion-real ( $614-million ) SGDC civil/military telecommunications project ? Four years after the company was created , the answer remains unchanged : No one knows . <p> The joint venture between aircraft builder Embraer ( 51% ) and national telecommunications network operator Telebras is managing Brazil 's SGDC satellite under a contract with French-Italian satellite builder Thales Alenia Space that includes what may be the most elaborate technology-transfer package ever undertaken in the space industry . <p> The to develop a sustainable domestic space work force , in keeping with Brazil 's long-standing goal of space autonomy . <p> The satellite carries a large Ka-band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an X-band payload for Brazil 's Defense Ministry . The defense forces paid 27.5% of the cost of the program . <p> SGDC is now at Europe 's spaceport in French Guiana , next door to Brazil , waiting out a long work-stoppage by a wide swath of the Guiana population . <p> In an April 5 interview here during the Latin American Aerospace &amp; Defense exhibition ( LAAD ) , Visiona Chief Executive Eduardo Bonini did not seem overly worried about the launch delay . But he was concerned about the lack of focus in Brazil 's space program . <p> Brazil 's space program is long on ambition ; achievement is another matter . <p> What we need is for someone to take the leadership . Because we really do n't  have a space program yet . You see here at LAAD several countries , like Russia and India , bringing space technology offers inside their big defense programs . <p> What can India sell Brazil in space ? <p> Well , 30 years ago they were behind us . Now they are years ahead . They kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lack of investment . <p> Are you involved in developing the SGDC satellite ground network ? <p> The ground involvement we had was the two antennas for the satellite control centers . The main control center in Brasilia and the backup center in Rio . This was part of our contract and we delivered on time and on schedule . <p> What 's your role once the satellite is in orbit and declared operational ? <p> We have a responsibility for the end-to-end testing , and this will be possible to do early with the X-band , which will be available in operations as soon as the satellite is cleared for use . <p> For the Ka-band , Telebras is investing in having it available one or two months later . We are not involved in the commercialization of the Ka-band payload . <p> The first customer for the X-band is the Brazilian Air Force . For a satellite of this size , it will take more than six months or so to complete in orbit operations in the other band before commercialization . It will be a gradual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one or two months later " we 'll be able to have the end-to-end test in the X-band . We are supporting Telebras as part of our contract , in terms of technical issues and the operations of the satellite . But in terms of their business plans and how the will manage it , we are not involved . <p> Given where Telebras is with the ground network " lots of work to be done " it may not be such a bad thing that the launch is delayed . <p> No , if you look at the schedule , the real delay is based on the situation in French Guiana . As soon as the satellite is operational in geostationary orbit the X-band payload will begin operations . <p> How do you evaluate the contract with Thales Alenia Space as far as technology transfer and training ? <p> I do n't want to seem like I 'm on a merchandizing campaign here , but the partnership with TAS has been perfect . We had a contract with these guys and we were allowed to absorb technology working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and we got the satellite ready at the end of November last year . <p> Everything was prepared for launch then and on Dec 5 we had a visit from our minister of defense to receive the satellite in Cannes , because it was ready . <p> We had 40 or 50 Brazilian guys working side by side with TAS from the beginning . In terms of how it was carried out with the milestones and so forth , I would say it was perfect . <p> There are two separate technology programs . Ours is the Technology Absorption Plan , TAP . <p> TAP was managed by the Brazilian Space Agency and coordinated by us at Visiona . It was not not a matter of sending people to Cannes so they could just sit there and saying they were part of a huge contract . The guys had tasks and evaluations of their performance . We received their evaluations here in Brazil to assess their performance against the targets we had set . <p> We had people from INPE Brazil 's space research institute , from the Brazilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was an impressive way to manage the program with us . We had a lot of help from the top management of TAS in increasing the partnership with the engineers . <p> And not only Cannes , there was Toulouse also . We worked very tightly with these guys . It was impressive . <p> What happens to these newly trained people ? What can you offer them for the future ? <p> We are working on certain developments , internally . We are developing software for satellite attitude and orbit control systems . We will start bench-testing of these with our computers at the end of this year . Our intention is then to try to build a nanosat or a microsat with our software and then test it in orbit . <p> We hope we can do that toward the end of next year with a dedicated satellite with a small camera to move 30 degrees side to side . <p> Did this expertise directly from the TAP with TAS ? <p> Not directly from it , but in parallel . The contract with TAS includes six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects we do not have anything specific . <p> If I 'm an engineer trained on the SGDC program , what do I do next ? <p> As for new projects , we do not have anything specific . Our challenge now is to find a new contract with an observation satellite that we could produce with much more Brazilian content than for a geostationary satellite that would succeed SGDC-1 . <p> The idea for a second SGDC satellite is to have the integration being done in Brazil . <p> No SGDC-2 satellite has been funded . <p> When and if it happens . <p> Do you have the needed installations to assemble and test a geo telecoms satellite ? <p> If we decided on an all-electric satellite it could reduce the volume needed at INPE . INPE has a thermal vacuum chamber for up to 2 tonnes . They did CBERS China-Brazil Earth observation satellite there . <p> INPE has a project to enhance their capacity and expand their testing facilities . It 's a proposal they have made . <p> Would Brazil 's space agency , AEB , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could be . So could be the Brazilian Air Force , or the Ministry of Environment , or the Ministry of Agriculture . Why not try to join these organizations in a single program to save on the budget ? It would be a multiple use of payloads on behalf of doing something sooner than we could do otherwise . <p> Is this the direction the government wants to move in ? <p> There is an effort to merge the national space program with the military program . They match up well . But it takes time . We are outside the discussion because it 's a matter of government policy . We are waiting for a direction and I hope to have some conclusion of this analysis by the end of this year so that we can start offering solutions . <p> Brazil is a continental country . The demand for satellites is huge . We do n't  have a metrological satellite , we do n't  have an observation satellite , we have an old , outdated SCD data-collection satellite . We do n't  have a tactical communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multipurpose platform . <p> And this depends on <p> Policy and budget and a clear direction of where the space program goes . <p> There is no backup for the X-band on SGDC . <p> They are using Star One today . <p> But that 's only a couple of channels in X-band , far less than SGDC . <p> True , but as a backup it can work . If you look at the national space program document there is an SGDC 1 , 2 and 3 that are part of the total sovereignty in terms of space communications for security and defense that is the objective . <p> Brazil has become a popular place for commercial Ka-band " Hughes , ViaSat , Yahsat , ViaSat and Eutelsat are all looking at commercial business . <p> Yes , but these commercial operations are proposing coverage of 80 percent of the population , where people can afford it " in the middle and and south part of the country . Where is the digital inclusion there ? SGDC is 100 percent of the territory covered by Ka-band . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program that Telebras is preparing . <p> Assume a successful SGDC launch , then testing , with full service by the end of the year . Then what for you ? <p> We then start discussions about SGDC 2 . <p> For X-band only ? <p> Both X- and Ka-band , and if Ka-band is not enough , possibly Q/V band , which some Telebras guys are interested in . The fact is we do not have mission requirements yet and we have no defined orbital slot . <p> Why not co-locate with SGDC-1 at 75 degrees west ? <p> Not necessarily . 75 west is not ideal for Brazil , it 's better for the Pacific , like Chile . There are other positions available that people are evaluating . <p> Future development should not depend on the economy improving . We have huge need for satellites in this country , and we will have a space policy at some point . In my opinion what we need is agreement among all the government organizations about space policy so that we all move in one direction . Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Several Latin American nations have purchased Earth observation satellites , but not Brazil . <p> If we are moving forward with border control and the Sisfron program , it 's 17,000 kilometers of border that needs to be controlled , starting with local communications and small radars . The next step is UAVs and then satellite communicationsfor them . There is a huge demand for observation . In the Air Force program there is a constellation called Carponis . It is not dead yet . <p> But here to , we need to see how such an investment can serve other areas in the government . There are a lot of applications . It all comes back to a single strategy for space , civil and military " agricultural , environmental , hydraulic operations . <h> Share this : <h> Related <p> Peter de Selding is a Co-Founder and editor for SpaceIntelReport.com .

@@109157052 @4557052/ <h> Interview : Mike Lawton , chief executive , Oxford Space Systems <p> LONDON " Oxford Space Systems has been on everyone 's Most Likely to Succeed list of European space startups for a couple of years now . The specialist in satellite deployable booms and antennas using proprietary materials dreams of the day it competes directly with Harris Corp . and Northrop Grumman . <p> That day will not be for a couple of years yet . In the meantime , OSS has flight-proven its first boom and is readying the launch later this year of a second . After that , Chief Executive Mike Lawton says , an in-orbit demonstration through the European Space Agency should be the next step . <p> Lawton made his remarks during the Satellite Finance Network Conference on March 20 . <p> Your early financing has been a mix of public and private . What can the UK government do to further help ? <p> A venture capital-backed business can never move fast enough when you have VCs investing in your business . What makes the UK attractive is that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of that co-funding available to SMEs is funneled by the European Space Agency . <p> If you 're working on genuinely disruptive technology or businesses we have to get ESA in their comfort zone to agree to the scope of work and to release that money . I find it considerably easier to access money at a national level from the UK Space Agency and Innovate UK than I do going through ESA . <p> As an example , I started a negotiation with ESA , which is still running " it 's in month 16 " and in that time we designed , developed and flew a product in space . All we 've managed to do with the agency in that time is trade documents . <p> So the biggest thing we can do to help SMEs is to unshackle the bureaucratic burden of releasing the money from the ESA . <p> Your first launch , in September 2016 , was a boom on an Algerian government satellite , developed with the UK , on an Indian rocket . What 's its status ? <p> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that mission . We have deployed and retracted the world 's longest cubesat boom a number of times under hot and cold conditions . We are validating our material and proving some of the claims we have made for it . <p> When is your next flight ? <p> Our next launch is September or October of this year , on the Indian rocket , for the Kazakh Institute of Technology . We are designing and developing a new range of deployable structures and what sets us apart and the reason we 've been able to attract VC money is that we do use conventional materials but we 're designing and developing our own proprietary materials , which means our structures are lighter and less complex and more stowage efficient than what is out there . <p> We 're very much targeting commercial applications and NewSpace , where competition and price is the eternal concern . To our knowledge we set a world record in going from a design to a product , the deployable boom , and getting that into orbit in less than 30 months . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 and the one to fly next autumn ? <p> The one currently in orbit is materials demonstration . The one we are going to be launching is commercial and is going to be deploying a payload for the customer and doing something that is going to earn them money . The one that is launching in September is a 3u three-unit cubesat . <p> They are collecting data from an instrument they are going to deploy and they have a customer for that data . <p> What will it take to get traction in the commercial market ? <p> Developing space technology is not for the fainthearted . It 's incredibly expensive and there are lots of technical challenges . <p> There 's a reason there 's only Harris Corp . and Northrop Grumman out there . This is incredibly tough technology to get right . We operate in the UK and we 're VC backed but access to the level of funding we need means we can only have a piecemeal approach . We can only apply for a certain chunk of funding to get us to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just allowing engineers to solve tough problems . <p> We 've got to go through this application stage . It 's a stepping-stone approach . That slows us down . The other barrier to proving technology in such a risk-averse industry is getting someone to risk a mission on a huge deployable antenna , which is the primary payload on this mission . That means we need a smart way of validating this technology in space . So we need hosted payload opportunity to prove it in a noncritical application before the risk-averse telecoms market will adopt it . <p> Earth observation satellites use deployable antennas too . <p> Absolutely . But I can not get investors excited about purely Earth observation opportunities . It 's about where the volume is , and that 's in telecoms . But telecoms is a risk-averse sector . <p> So you have the 20 million in the bank ? <p> I 'd like to . We could go and access it believe it or not . In fact we have been in the privileged position of turning away offers of investment from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built enough value in the business to avoid the level of dilution that I can be comfortable with . <p> You 've done a Series A fundraising . What 's next ? <p> We 've done Series A and we 're coming up toward Series B towards the end of the year . And what we 're currently negotiating is a bridging round . There are significant contracts we are negotiating . I just need a little bit of money to get us through the next six to nine months to increase the value of the business and then we 'll go out and raise the big money . <p> You 're in the various ESA ARTES telecoms research programs ? <p> We are in the early-stage ARTES programs . Then we 'll come into the zone what the ESA ATLAS program where we can talk about an IOD in-orbit demonstration possibility . We 're still about three years away from deploying a large unfurlable on orbit . <p> Besides the two Americans , who are your direct competitors in deployable booms and unfurlable antenna structures ? <p> In Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic market but they are solely dependent on ESA funding . They are not VC backed , which means we can move a lot quicker . And their architecture is really more of a replica of what you see from Harris , whereas we are pushing the envelope by using our novel proprietary materials . <p> Who are they ? <p> A company in Germany called Large Space Structures , LSS . They have been working on their design for nearly 12 years and we are in some areas ahead of what they 're doing . <p> Peter B. de Selding <h> Subscribe <p> Sign up with your email address to receive news and updates . <p> Email Address <p> We respect your privacy . <p> Thank you ! <h> Share this : <h> Related <p> Peter de Selding is a Co-Founder and editor for SpaceIntelReport.com .

The satellite operators are aware of the potential danger that brings . Theoretically ViaSat 's right about the synergy between the ground segment and the space segment . We 're talking about physical layer synergies . An extremely capable company will get the best out of that synergy . <p> Where I do n't  agree with ViaSat is on selling the system . As a vertically integrated company they want to sell services . They are not selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newtec Dialog systems last year . <p> ViaSat has a joint venture with Eutelsat . In 2011 they tried to sell to Yahsat , and Yahsat then blocked the contract and gave it to HNS . They want to do service provision , worldwide , through ViaSat-3 and have distributors on the Inmarsat model and not selling systems to anybody except to DoD . That 's what I think . <p> So we are not competing with ViaSat , we have no deals where we compete with ViaSat . ViaSat is a great company and has proven you can do things on the value chain with vertical integration and it 's great for the industry that they exist . From their market valuation over the past couple of years , it 's clear they 're doing things right . <p> But you do compete with Hughes . <p> Yes , because Hughes is selling systems internationally , still . Less and less , but they still do . <p> And other competitors ? <p> Our competitors are iDirect , Gilat , Comtech and HNS are the main ones . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think so . <p> They have made inroads there . <p> Yes , they have been working a lot in China and they are doing well . China also has a lot of HTS programs " another example of why HTS is a principal driver of Newtec 's growth . <p> The China market remains open to you ? <p> To a certain extent , yes . It 's never completely open and you have to have the right partnerships to achieve something . They are willing to partner up . <p> That would mean co-production in China ? <p> We 're open to do co-production in different countries . We believe one of the enablers is low-cost terminals for the consumer or SME market , and we 're not necessarily making money out of selling low-cost terminals . <p> We should always be concerned about the IPR . But local production should be possible while protecting IPR . <p> Do you see HTS broadening out beyond consumer broadband ? <p> Operators are launching satellites for more than consumer broadband , which is good for us , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be used for mobility , such as with Panasonic ; for cellular backhaul , WiFi hotspots and SMEs and consumer broadband as well . <p> The mistakes made in the past have launching HTS platforms purely for consumer reasons . They have all failed at a certain point in time . Everybody failed at least once . <p> ViaSat and Hughes combined have more than 1 million subscribers in the US . The business appear healthy . <p> It 's healthy at the current ARPUs of $50 or so . But people elsewhere are still trying to do it for $10 as well , and that 's very difficult . <p> The reason people are investing in our platform is because what you think is the best business case s today may not be the best business in three years ' time . With Newtec , people are allowed to change their minds on where the opportunity lies under their footprint . <p> And with the next generation of HTS people will be able to change their minds on the platform itself more or less with beam hopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change your mind and more ways to ramp up or choose the type of service you want . <p> Where in Asia do you see HTS opportunities for Newtec ? <p> 14 : Chinasat 16 , 17 and 18 are pretty solid . Indonesia for sure . But not everything is a national satellite . KT Sat or Measat or APT do n't have just national satellites in mind . They have Asia-wide satellites in mind . <p> I think 2019 is a key year . Most of the HTS satellites coming over Asia are coming in 2019 . <p> How about Africa ? You saw the announcement between Global IP and Hughes . And there is Eutelsat 's Ka-band satellite . <p> We have a good relationship with Eutelsat for Africa . One of the things we do with them is deploy WiFi hotspots to their service providers . You put a hotspot in a village or a town and they 're powered from wherever there is electricity and you create a vast amount of users that do not have to pay $250 to get a modem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a great business and it 's very viable for HTS . This is the model that Avanti 's Hylas-4 has adopted . You can deliver as little or as much bandwidth as you want to a hotspot . <p> In Africa you do n't  have a lot of consumers providing an ARPU of $50 . We have a lot of good SMEs in Africa , and for the consumer you can get to a profitable model . <p> In Latin America you are working with YahSat . <p> Yes , on the Al-Yah 3 payload over Brazil . They had a contract with HNS for everything having to do with YahClick and now for Brazil they have contracted with Newtec . <p> How much work are you doing with Avanti ? <p> With Avanti we have a program for Hylas-4 . And we do some work on Hylas-1 and Hylas-2 as well . In fact if you start going down the list of satellites , you will find that Newtec is on most of them . <p> Our market share is growing very fast . You have to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platforms are with Newtec . For emerging markets , maritime and cellular backhaul , which only two years ago we did n't  do , we had to launch a new platform like Newtec Dialog to cater to that . So back in 2011-2012 we made a strategic decision in the company to orient ourselves toward what we thought were the best-growing markets . <p> Fast growth expected in maritime , cellular backhaul <p> I think we were right : HTS is a driver , cellular backhaul is a driver , mobility is a driver . We are a new entrant in cellular backhaul and maritime and I think we have a good chance to get to a 30% market share in both of them . <p> Maritime too ? <p> We 're not there yet but we can get there . We have the mobility reference now with Panasonic , first with aviation and we hope with maritime later . If you can do it for planes you can do it for ships as well . <p> For the moment we have some very nice reference contracts , like Petrobras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil rigs . The service providers work working in maritime look at Newtec as a platform with enough processing power and enough speed to cater to yachts and cruise ships and higher broadband connectivity in a mobility environment . <p> They do hate it . But they hate having poor options as well . So a 30% share is what we can get in the maritime market . <p> Same thing in aviation ? <p> Aviation is whatever Panasonic can get . We are currently married to Panasonic . We can do only one of these things at the same time . <p> They have exclusive use of your technology for the aero market ? <p> Yes , for a short period of time . At a certain point we had to choose who to engage with , and Panasonic is the biggest one . They have the most capacity and the most predominant satellite component . They are a great partner for Newtec . We 're launching with them after this summer , so soon . <h> Share this : <h> Related <p> Peter de Selding is a Co-Founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 26 years as the Paris Bureau Chief for SpaceNews where he covered the commercial satellite , launch and the international space businesses .
