Oh - and do n't worry about cleaning anything up , the housekeeper comes on Monday . When a person 's generosity is so unyielding , it can almost be too convincing . No matter how insistent or genuine a friend 's generosity may be , never fall victim to mi casa es su casa syndrome .

Ah , yes , the easy breezy summer months when everybody has a fresh new attitude in preparation for reintroducing themselves to the sunlight and extra-long days . To make this most of your summer , we 're here to provide you with 10 reasons you either need to quickly befriend somebody with a BBQ-friendly house or start considering taking matters into your own hands by offering up your digs to lead the very necessary BBQ fiesta train . So without further ado , we give you 10 Reasons To Have A Summer BBQ : <p> 1 . Taking Off Amateur Night <p> While pretty much any day is a good day for a BBQ , a Saturday afternoon/evening BBQ provides you and your friends a much needed alternative to going out and hitting up that tragic nightclub on Amateur Night you spent way too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White Trash About It <p> It 's time to let your inner trailer park run free and sip that Bud Light ( or PBR if you 're really hip ) straight from the can while standing on the lawn and snacking on Cheetos . Revel in eating off of paper plates , drinking cocktails out of Solo cups and all the while wearing flip flops . <p> - <p> 3 . Mix &amp; Mingle <p> Like a much less formal dinner party , BBQs are places to meet new people you otherwise would n't . And since it 's not a dinner party you 're free to mingle about instead of being relegated to conversation with those directly to your right and left. - Bring your friends and tell your friends to brings friends , but only if they 're DTF . Oh c'm on I 'm only half-kidding . <p> 4 . Day Drinking <p> Drink in hand at a cool 3pm ? Do n't mind if we do ! Jell-O shot ? Sure , we love a good college throwback . Summer BBQs were made for shameless day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's always fun to get a little buzz going in broad daylight and catch some rays . <p> 5 . Hot Dogs <p> When else do you ever truly get to revert to your five-year-old self and enjoy a delicious grilled hot dog unless you have no shame in ordering off of the kids menu ? No , we 're not talking about last week when you stumbled out of **27;102;TOOLONG and your friend forced one down your throat to prevent you from yakking all over yourself . <p> 6 . " Manliness " <p> BBQs give the male species a chance to get in touch with their masculine sides , or so they think . How manliness is derived from flipping meat over a flame and sprinkling in some seasoning , we are not sure , but let them keep thinking that manning the grill is a really macho activity ; it makes them feel good about themselves and saves the ladies the work. - Girls , you 're benefiting from this notion , so run with it and let the men serve you , they rarely disappoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> 7 . Drinking Games <p> Nothing brings a group of individuals together better than some good ol ' interactive drinking games ( beer pong , flip cup ) . A little healthy competition and booze is the recipe for some true bonding and gives everyone an opportunity to get real loud and talk shit to each other . And who knows , you could walk away a hero of the BBQ after a particularly impressive performance . <p> 8 . Free Parking <p> Thoughts like " wait , do we have any cash for valet ? " or " $20 for the night ? ! But I 'm only staying for an hour ! " wo n't ever come into play at a BBQ like they would on a typical outing . BBQs are about residential parking , meaning no valet or parking structures . FREE . Got that ? FREE PARKING . <p> 9 . Casual Dress <p> Cutoffs ? Keds ? Mandals ? Whatever you 're comfortable wearing is acceptable in the laid-back BBQ setting . No one is expecting you to look particularly nice or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did , so leave the eyeliner and button-down/loafers at home , k ? <p> 10 . It 's Always The Right Time For BBQ Time <p> There is no bad time for a BBQ ! LIKE EVER ! Start at noon and end at 6pm . Start at 6pm and end at midnight . You really ca n't ever BBQ too late or too early , just make sure it lasts for a 4-hour minimum so everyone can work it into their schedule and hopefully have enough time to stick around and get trashy with you .

@@1094642 <h> Under 21 ? Where To Get A Fake I 'd &amp; Where To Use It <p> NYC Nightlife is hot , but you could be left in the cold if you 're underage . Luckily , - there are ways to get around the law . All you need are the essentials : a convincing fake I 'd , the right bar , and the right attitude . As an " underager , " I 've done- my fair share of sleuthing . <p> First off , you 'll need a fake . I 've tried slipping a bouncer a twenty underneath my real state I 'd , only to receive a raised eyebrow and a wave of the hand . I decided I 'd have to try a little harder and put some cold cash toward the cause . There are many places to gain fakes and some things you should avoid : <p> If you have an older sibling , you 're in luck ( have the person call the DMV , say he or she lost his I 'd , and for $15 you 'll have another copy ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . Most of them are rip offs , poorly laminated , and they do n't scan . Use an out-of-state or international I 'd . I 've been using my Turkish I 'd for around two years and I 've never had a problem ( I have n't even faked a thick , sexy accent ! ) <p> A hot spot to get your fake I 'd is Toronto . The cheapest ones are $40 . You 'll cop those in places labeled " Souvenir I 'd 's . " <p> The web provides another alternative . One of the top websites that will transform you into a British citizen is a site called Fake Identification ( blunt much ? ) . - You 'll have to send cash in an envelope ( this makes it untraceable ) to the site . After receiving this they 'll ask you to fill in your information ( name , address , etc. ) and within two to three weeks you should be bar hopping in no time . <p> It 's not only the I 'd that matters , but also your attitude and dress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouncer will know something 's up . They 're trained for this business . <p> Dress the part- ladies , if you have a baby face , doll it up with some crimson lipstick and strap on some killer heels . <p> Gentleman , you 're in lukewarm territory as it is , so look sharp and trendy . <p> From my experience , I 've gathered a short list of places that will help you get silly , and have an awesome time- on any night of the week . <p> After passing through Lit 's gates with ease , you 'll enter into a cavern like basement with dim lanterns , invaded by scenesters and hipsters all who worship this creation by the street-style influential Vice Magazine . Bring some bills , or pregame a little bit before . Drinks are moderately priced , but not cheap . <p> Ready to be unbelievably drunk , with zero expectations , and hands-on fun ? Come to The Levee . You do n't have to worry about running up a tab here . Shots are as cheap as $2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intoxication . The best features of this bar are the games- Apples to Apples , darts , Buck Hunter , a pool table , pinball games , Jenga , and a " Buy Your Friend a Drink " chalkboard make this place hella fun . If you excel at drinking and dueling , head on over . <p> If you 're exhausted from the Manhattan gay club scene , Sugarland 's the place for you . This seductive newcomer sizzles the most on Monday 's ( Karaoke ) , Thursday 's ( Rebel Cupcake Burlesque Drag Competition ) and Sunday 's ( Girl 's Night ) , but I promise you 'll be floored every night of the week . Whether packed or not , the eclectic music selection and $5 cover will have you smiling silly in no time . Tip : Once you 're drunk , push your way through the bar and check out the rooftop patiodecked in graffiti ( a relic from the former dive Capone 's ) for a smoke break and a breather . <p> Empire Rooftop Hotel , W. 63rd St. <p> Bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel .
