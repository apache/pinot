@@43885391 @3885391/ <h> Boolean Expressions <p> FileLocator Pro 's Boolean expression engine supports Web style search expressions using the AND , OR , NOT , NEAR , REGEX , and LIKE operators . FileLocator Pro can be configured to match the expression across the whole file ( default ) or on a line by line basis in the Options Tab . <p> Line by Line example <p> The expression work AND document searches for lines that include the words work and document . Since FileLocator Pro implicity assumes an AND the expression can alternatively be written as work document . <p> The expression work OR document searches for lines that include either ' work ' or ' document ' . <p> The expression work NOT document searches for lines that include ' work ' but not ' document ' . <p> Whole file example <p> The expression work AND document searches for files that include the words work and document . The words can occur on the same line or on different lines throughout the file . <p> The expression work NOT document searches for files that include work but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators AND , OR , and NOT must be written in capital letters otherwise they are assumed to be search terms . <p> Quotes can be used to search for literal phrases , e.g. <p> " work document " searches for the exact phrase work document . <p> Brackets can be used to specify phrase grouping , e.g. <p> The expression work AND ( document OR letter ) searches for lines that include work and either document or letter . <p> LIKE Operator <p> If the spelling of the search term is unsure , or possibly misspelled in the search text , the LIKE operator can be used to specify an approximate search term . For example , <p> LIKE necessary <p> will find necessary but also slight variations such as neccessary . The scale of the approximation can be changed in the Configuration settings . <p> NEAR Operator <p> To specify that two search terms should be near to each other in the search text use the NEAR operator . For example , <p> work NEAR document <p> will only match the two terms if they are within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum character distance is specified in the Configuration settings ) . The maximum distance can be specified as part of the expression , e.g. <p> work NEAR:20 document <p> would search change the default maximum distance to 20 characters . <p> REGEX Operator <p> To specify that a term is a regular expression use the REGEX operator . For example , <p> work AND REGEX " d5,6 " <p> will match any document that has the term work and the regex d5,6 ( ie. a number with 5-6 digits ) in it . To specify that terms should always be treated as regular expressions , ie without the need to use the REGEX operator , use the Boolean RegEx expression type ( see below ) . <p> LINES Operator <p> The LINES operator limits the lines that are searched for the following expression . For example , <p> LINES:3-5 ( tower AND london ) <p> searches only lines 3 , 4 , and 5 for the expression tower AND london . <p> LINES:10+ ( tower AND london ) <p> searches all lines from line 10 and higher . <p> FILELIST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a File List . For example , <p> work AND FILELIST " C : TermList.txt " <p> Note : Since the use of the FILELIST operator is explicit the functionality will work regardless of the File Lists settings . <p> Boolean Sub Expressions <p> Boolean expressions are comprised of sub expressions . The sub expression type will depend on the Expression Type chosen <p> Boolean ( no wildcards1 ) <p> Each phrase is matched exactly as typed but will match against partial words . <p> e.g. <p> fish will match against the words fish , fishing and selfish . <p> Boolean ( with wildcards1 ) <p> Allows wildcard characters ' * ' and ' ? ' . ' ? ' will match any single character and ' * ' will match zero or more characters until the end of the word . <p> e.g. <p> fish* will match against the words fish , fishing , and selfish . <p> The wildcard setting also allows word boundary matching using the ' &lt; ' and ' &gt; ' characters to specify the beginning or end of the word , e.g. <p> &lt;fish&gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing or selfish . Similarily fish&gt; would match both fish and selfish but not fishing since the word must end with fish . <p> To search for the literal text fish* or fish&gt; put the search term in quotes , e.g. " fish* " or " fish&gt; " <p> Boolean RegEx <p> Each phrase is treated as a regular expression . If the regular expression includes spaces or parenthesis use quotes to group the expression together . <p> e.g. <p> trout. * OR " fish(esing) " <p> Whole Word <p> Each phrase is matched exactly as typed . <p> e.g. <p> fish will match against only the word fish and not fishing or selfish . <p> 1 The wildcard setting is specified in the Options tab ( the default is to allow wildcards ) . <p> Example : Boolean RegEx <p> By using the Boolean RegEx expression type regular expression searches can be combined using the operators AND , OR , and NOT . The regular expressions are evaluated on each line but the behaviour of the Boolean combination of those regex results , ie line by line or across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Options Tab . <p> Line by Line example <p> The expression 0-9+ AND document searches for lines that include both a number and the word document . <p> The expression " a-z+@a-z+ " NOT " . ( comnet ) " searches for lines with email like text but not including . com or . net . Note the use of quotes to show the regular expression grouping ( otherwise the brackets would have been treated as a boolean grouping ) . <p> Whole file example <p> The expression " ( 0-9+. ) 30-9+ " AND error searches for files with an IP address and the word error somewhere in the file but not necessarily on the same line . <p> Quotes are used to identify parts of the expression that are regular expressions . <p> Note : Due to the complex nature of the Boolean RegEx expression type searches using it are usually slower than with the other expression types . Therefore use of Boolean RegEx is only recommended when its specific capabilities are required .

@@43885404 @3885404/ <h> Quick Start <p> Agent Ransack includes a regular expression engine as one of its Expression Types . Regular expressions ( some times shortened to regexp ) provide a concise language to describe exactly what to search for . In very basic terms you can split an expression into two parts : <p> - what you are looking for <p> - the number of occurrences you want to find of it . <p> So let 's take an example : <p> 1 . I want to find all files named abc , abbc , abbbc , abbbbc etc . So basically I want to find all files that begin with ' a ' followed by one or more ' b ' then followed by ' c ' . The expression would be : <p> ab+c <p> Breaking that apart we read : <p> - find one occurrence of ' a ' <p> - find at least one occurrence of ' b ' ( the ' + ' indicates ' one or more ' ) <p> - find one occurrence of ' c ' <p> The characters that specify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> * zero or more <p> ? zero or one <p> So ab ? c would find any file named abc or ac ( i.e. there can be zero or one ' b ' ) . <p> A very important regexp character is the period ' . ' ( the wildcard character ) because it matches to ANY character . So a.c would match to aac , abc , acc , adc , aec , afc , a1c , a6c etc . And if we combine that with an occurrence character we can start producing some useful expressions :

@@43885454 @3885454/ <p> " No FileLocator Pro does not use file or content indexes and for very good reasons . While indexing can certainly improve the speed of searches in certain circumstances there are many drawbacks . These drawbacks include " <p> and I go on to list resource issues , syncing issues , security issues and more . So it might seem surprising that I 'm now announcing that FileLocator Pro v.8- supports indexing . Yes , I know , I 'm still a little surprised myself . <p> However , and this is a really important point , its not the type of indexing component that 's always running in the background . If you do n't  use the feature then you wo n't notice it because its effectively disabled by default . It wont be running in the background consuming valuable CPU cycles and it wont be building secret indexes consuming valuable disk space . It wo n't do anything until you ask it to . <p> That 's because it 's not intended as a Desktop Search replacement instead it 's more for searching large repositories of fairly static data . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the index is n't loaded unless you try and search it , so there is no performance impact to people- who never need to use the indexing functionality . <p> You can create multiple indexes and indexes can be shared over network drives with other people ( searched concurrently ) and , most importantly , the searches are sub-second Search-as-you-type ' speed operations . <p> Personally I 've been using the indexing feature for searching an archive of over 15 years of emails . I have a scheduled task that runs once a day updating the index and I now use it more than the Outlook search . <p> I still use the classic ' FileLocator Pro interface more frequently because it 's more suitable for source code searching , which is exactly how it was planned . The index feature is just another search method you can use when it 's appropriate for you . <p> Other changes <p> There are plenty of other changes that , while not as radical , are hard to let go once you 've got used to them . Here 's a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier reading of results keywords can now be highlighted in separate colors . <p> The colors and font adjustments can be customized- or even switched off in the- Color Settings . <p> Multi-line regex <p> A highly requested feature multi-line regex , ie regular expressions that can span multiple lines , is now possible with a new expression type Multi-line Regex ' . <p> Search threads <p> When searches take a long time its not always obvious why . Version 8 adds a new window into the search engine with the Search Threads pane . <p> It displays which files are being searched and how long the search is taking , and it even let 's you- cancel individual searches . <p> Multi-phase change <p> FileLocator Pro has always defaulted to a two phase search process , step 1 collect the file list , step 2 search the file list . This has the advantage of being able to show accurate search progress for step 2 , and works well for smaller searches . However , on larger searches it can be confusing because it appears to show the search going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching method immediately searches files as soon they are discovered without waiting for the initial collection phase to finish . When the collection phase finishes the UI then starts displaying accurate progress information , just like it used to . <p> The effect is to make all searches , including small searches , just that little bit faster . <p> Custom EXE interpreters <p> I 'm not sure how many file formats exist in the world but there 's more than we can possibly code for . But now if you know how to convert a format into text you can do so with you own custom EXE interpreter . As long as you can specify a conversion command in the form : <p> SomeCommand input.file output.file <p> you can add it to FileLocator Pro . <p> Others <p> Then of course there are the smaller changes , such as : <p> Run reports from the command line . <p> Additional warnings for common search mistakes . <p> Sticky sort order . <p> Stability improvements for Word and Excel searching . <p> Fuzzy search option , using the LIKE functionality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , of course , theyll be other improvements driven by your feedback . <p> Thank You <p> I hope you like the new changes , some of this work was started over four years ago . As always my thanks go out to you , our customers . Your enthusiastic requests , bug reports , and general support keep making FileLocator Pro better and better . <p> If you use FileLocator Pro for source code searching or some other text format that 's constantly changing or hard to index you probably wont use the indexing feature . However , if you imagine the scenario of 20 telephone- reps each searching a 10GB data repository sitting on a network drive , multiple times every hour , you can see that if you 're not careful the network is going to be swamped with traffic . <p> Or that if you were a- lawyer searching through 50GB of case files looking for relevant references , wanting to quickly drill down on searches with sub-second response times , a traditional FLP content search- might be cumbersome . <p> You can think of the indexing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light weight cordless drill that 's good for many tasks but not if what you need is the power of a corded hammer action drill . <p> I also want to say that this a v1.0 when it comes to the indexing component . There is much more we can do with it and this will be driven by customer feedback . <p> Update 12 April 2016 : There have been a number of people unable to find the indexing functionality . In our aim of keeping UI changes to a minimum it- looks like we 've made it too hard to discover . Please accept my apologies if this has been frustrating , hopefully this should help <p> The first step is to switch FileLocator Pro to Index Search : <p> The next step is to create an index using either the- Create New Index drop-down option or by launching the Index Manager using the button next to it : <p> We have a new colour settings to set the colours of various things , which is all very nice but where is the option to turn OFF the syntax colouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I really do n't  want to be distracted by the different colours used for syntax colouring . Maybe next version ? <p> Switching off " Highlight keywords " does not appear to switch of syntax colouring ie displaying text in different colours depending on that texts meaning in the context of the source language indicated by the file extension as described at LONG ... <p> Eg I search for the word " length " in *. c , and regardless of the Color Settings , or how the word " length " is displayed , C key words like " while " , " do " are always in blue , numbers are always in orange etc . I understand that syntax highlighting can be useful , but I find the extra colouring to be a distraction , and suggest that it should be optional . <p> Ah , sorry . I thought you were referring to the keyword coloring . You can switch off the syntax coloring by renaming/deleting the syntax coloring file , which is normally installed in:C : Program **26;352;TOOLONG Proconfigflpstyle.xml <p> It was getting harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supporting XP we still werent getting 100% compatibility . Its unfortunate but with Microsoft dropping support for XP and the very lower number of customers using the OS it just does n't  make financial sense spending valuable resources working on XP compatibility . <p> OK , its understandable for sure , I 'd just prefer that as long as there are n't  hard incompatibilities in the core of the software or of the installer you allow the installation , maybe after a big warning that its unsupported and any support requests will be denied . <p> How do you use this feature exactly ? ? ? The help mentions the index manager but does n't  mention how to to get to it . I went through every option in the app and cant find this feature . This blog starts with step 1 , create an index . How do you create an index ? ? Start from there please . I am feeling stupid now and I hate it when an app does this to me . Please improve the documentation and present a step by step instructions starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improve this features discoverability <p> This is great ! However , I have a workflow suggestion : there should be no separate indexing mode , just a button to build/update an index , which will then speed up subsequent searches if present . <p> If any files have been added/removed/changed since the index was built , the engine falls back to normal search for those files . This would work great for searching code ; in any given week you only touch a tiny fraction of a large codebase . And if too many files have been changed you could display an " index outdated ! " warning . <p> Nice idea but the trouble is that to know the change would require either scanning the folders in the first place , reducing the efficacy of the index , or by having a background process detecting and recording changes . The latter is the standard index way and well look into at least having the option but not as an always-on type process . <p> I 've just downloaded v8 and paid for another five years . I use FileLocatorPro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use Outlook for work e-mail , but I choose to use Thunderbird for personal e-mail , and have a large archive of Thunderbird messages , so I 'm interested in any further support for Thunderbird that you may add . <p> Just started using Version 8 . Indexing worked fine , and very fast . Is there an update index feature , or does it have to reindex the entire machine ? In future , will their be an option to leave index feature on so that changes to index are made as you go ? <p> If you update the index itll only re-index changed files but it does scan all the folders looking for changes . We will have an auto-update feature in future but we need to be careful because this is just the type of indexing that many people do n't  like . <p> The new indexing feature is great ! We archive projects on a web-server , and access the files using a browser or webDAV . With webDAV we can mount the web-servers file-space as a drive , e.g. , z : . Using File @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An indexed search takes less than a second . It takes less than 3 minutes to build the index . I 've used File Locator Pro for years , and its a great tool .

I forgot to mention that what makes having an index so useful for us is that the webDAV connection is so slow . The archive is n't big ( e.g. , less than 10GB ) . Searches without the index take forever due to the slow access over webDAV.

@@43885484 @3885484/ <h> Rummage through <h> Managed C++ Destructors and Finalizers <p> I spend a lot of time moving between C++ and C# . Fortunately the languages are different enough that it 's not too difficult switching between using concepts such as stack allocated objects in C++ and garbage collected objects in C# . However , if I 'm not concentrating I do run into trouble when coding in Managed C++ since I expect it to generally behave just like C++ , just with access to . NET classes . <p> Managed C++ is really cool but it has a couple of gotchas . The one that has bitten me more than once is the difference between destructors and finalizers . To make sure that I do n't fall into the trap again I 'm going to elaborate on what is a very long comment in one of our source code files . <p> And be confident that all memory would be freed . However in Managed C++ this is not necessarily true . You see Managed C++ treats the destructor as if it was , what they call , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Dispose method for the class . Therefore to make sure that the class is properly destructed a C# user of the class would need to code something like : <p> using ( MyClass objClass = new MyClass() ) // use the class <p> That 's a bit much to ask all users of the class to remember . Therefore Managed C++ introduces something called a Finalizer using the exclamation mark ! ' instead of the tilde ' , which will be called when the Garbage Collector gets around to destroying any instances of MyClass if they were n't already explicitly disposed . So we can instead write our class like this : <p> This time if the user does n't Dispose of MyClass the Garbage Collector will call the finalizer when it destroys the instance . End of story ? Sadly not . If MyClass was left like this it would n't free the memory if the user DID dispose of the instance since the Managed C++ Dispose method actually calls SupressFinalize before calling the classes destructor ( i.e. the method marked with the ' ) . Therefore for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finalizer from the destructor : <p> So , do you always just free everything in the finalizer and simply call the finalizer from the destructor ? If only life were so simple . You need to think about the fundamental differences between the two methods . Since the finalizer is non-deterministic , i.e. you do n't know when it will be called , you should only free objects that would otherwise never be freed , i.e. unmanaged objects . You do n't  need to worry about managed objects since they will be , or may have already been , handled by the Garbage Collector . Therefore you should only free ( ie dispose ) managed objects in your destructor since that is the deterministic finalizer , which will only be called when your class is being specifically disposed of rather than left for the Garbage Collector to cleanup up .

@@43885496 @3885496/ <h> Rummage through <h> FileLocator Pro and Large Searches <p> During August 2012 we quietly added a new crash reporting module to FileLocator Pro . Based on CrashRpt ( an open source product hosted on Google Code ) it 's one of the most useful quality control features we 've ever added , although we hope it 's a feature ' most of our users will never have cause to see . <p> Since then you may have noticed an increase in memory management related upgrades to FileLocator Pro . It 's not a co-incidence . <p> We 've had a slow trickle of crash reports over the last few months and while most were odd , quick to fix , edge-case samples the majority have been related to memory management issues . It did n't take long to see that FileLocator Pro had a problem on low spec 'd machines performing searches where the data was in the gigabyte range and involved millions of files . We found a few problems that were simply bugs in the code , e.g. algorithms that reserved more memory than was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related issues . <p> By default FileLocator Pro will record up to 10,000 lines of text per file and each line can be up to around 20,000 characters . That 's not usually a problem when searching in a limited set of files . Rarely will a file have 10,000 hits or a line have 20,000 characters . However , when searching over a very large data set with criteria that might not be very selective ( e.g. searching for the letter a ' " which was the actual search phrase in one of the crash reports we received ) it can be a problem . It can be compounded by searching through file types that may not have EOL ( End Of Line ) markers , such as EXE or DLLs . Finally to make the whole thing just a little bit trickier , what might be a problem on a scrawny 512MB laptop is not necessarily a problem on sturdy 16GB PC . <p> The trouble is that FileLocator Pro does n't know at the beginning of the search if it 'll find a few hundred files with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of files with hits on 10,000 lines ( not a problem ) or a million files with each one reporting hits on 10,000 lines ( problem probably ) . <p> FileLocator Pro 6.5 introduces a pre-emptive based solution . Based on the amount of memory installed on the machine FileLocator Pro sets an upper limit for un-restricted results per search ( from 20MB up to around 200MB ) . If during a search that limit is reached FileLocator Pro starts restricting the search . Results for each file are reduced to around 20 lines , with a maximum of 256 characters per line , and the restriction is retained until the search finishes . If the search still runs out of memory then rather than crashing , as it did previously , it terminates the search . <p> Our tests on very low powered machines with just 512MB have shown a huge improvement in stability for very large searches and so far we have n't received any memory related crash reports .

@@43885500 @3885500/ <h> What is a regular expression ? <p> A regular expression is a way of describing a group of words ( referred to as a ' string ' ) . It allows a user to build a complex set of rules to describe exactly what characteristics the string should have . While this documentation uses the word string you can think of a string as either a filename when searching for a filename using regular expressions , or as text in a document when using a regular expression to search the contents of files . <p> The simplest regular expression is a sequence of letters , numbers , or both . Such a regular expression matches any string that contains that sequence . For example : <p> The regular expression foo ' matches any string containing foo ' . So if you wanted to find a file with the letters ' fred ' in it the regular expression would simply be ' fred ' . <p> This is obviously a very simple example but you can express complicated rules . For example : <p> To find a file that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some point by ' Document ' or ' Documents ' followed at some point by a number and has a ' . doc ' extension the expression would be : ' ( JulyAugust ) . *Documents ? . *0-9+. *. doc$ ' <p> This expression would find : <p> JulysPrivDocuments23.doc <p> August Documents Num5a.doc <p> etc . <p> Do n't worry if the expression above looks confusing because it is .

Also , since FileLocator Pro ' understands ' the actual underlying file format it does n't require Outlook to be installed and can also bypass the password protection and encryption present on most PST files . However , since FileLocator Pro is not dedicated to searching only PST files it can appear a little confusing as to how PST searching works . The overwhelming temptation is to use the file name field to identify the PST archive , e.g. *. pst , instead of the item within the PST archive , such as an email , that you are looking for . <p> FileLocator Pro basically treats each individual Outlook item , ie an email , contact , calendar item etc. , within a PST file as a separate file . The ' file name ' for each item is dependant on the item type , e.g. for email messages the email 's subject is used as the file name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 . Specify the location of the PST files ( or a specific PST file ) in the ' Look in ' field <p> The location can include Outlook folders within the PST files . <p> 2 . Switch on PST Searching in the Options Tab <p> Without the PST format switched on the PST archive is treated as a normal file and simply searched using its binary content . If the ' Search attachments ' option is checked then the attachments for each email are also searched , otherwise only the main email body is searched . <p> 3 . Use the ' File name ' field to search by email subject and ' Containing text ' to search by email content . <p> Each result is shown as a text file , which can be copied or dragged to another location .

FileLocator Network can be configured to match the expression across the whole file ( default ) or on a line by line basis in the Expression Tab . <p> Line by Line example <p> The expression work AND document searches for lines that include the words work and document . Since FileLocator Network implicity assumes an AND the expression can alternatively be written as work document . <p> The expression work OR document searches for lines that include either ' work ' or ' document ' . <p> The expression work NOT document searches for lines that include ' work ' but not ' document ' . <p> Whole file example <p> The expression work AND document searches for files that include the words work and document . The words can occur on the same line or on different lines throughout the file . <p> The expression work NOT document searches for files that include work but not document anywhere in the file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and NOT must be written in capital letters otherwise they are assumed to be search terms . <p> Quotes can be used to search for literal phrases , e.g. <p> " work document " searches for the exact phrase work document . <p> Brackets can be used to specify phrase grouping , e.g. <p> The expression work AND ( document OR letter ) searches for lines that include work and either document or letter . <p> LIKE Operator <p> If the spelling of the search term is unsure , or possibly misspelled in the search text , the LIKE operator can be used to specify an approximate search term . For example , <p> LIKE necessary <p> will find necessary but also slight variations such as neccessary . <p> NEAR Operator <p> To specify that two search terms should be near to each other in the search text use the NEAR operator . For example , <p> work NEAR document <p> will only match the two terms if they are within a certain number of characters of each other . <p> Boolean Sub Expressions <p> Boolean expressions are comprised of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression type chosen <p> Boolean ( no wildcards1 ) <p> Each phrase is matched exactly as typed but will match against partial words . <p> e.g. <p> fish will match against the words fish , fishing and selfish . <p> Boolean ( with wildcards1 ) <p> Allows wildcard characters ' * ' and ' ? ' . ' ? ' will match any single character and ' * ' will match zero or more characters until the end of the word . <p> e.g. <p> fish* will match against the words fish , fishing , and selfish . <p> Boolean RegEx <p> Each phrase is treated as a regular expression . If the regular expression includes spaces or parenthesis use quotes to group the expression together . <p> e.g. <p> trout. * OR " fish(esing) " <p> Whole Word <p> Each phrase is matched exactly as typed . <p> e.g. <p> fish will match against only the word fish and not fishing or selfish . <p> 1 The wildcard setting is specified in the Boolean Expressions ( the default is to allow wildcards ) . <p> Example : Boolean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression searches can be combined using the operators AND , OR , and NOT . The regular expressions are evaluated on each line but the behaviour of the Boolean combination of those regex results , ie line by line or across whole file , is defined by the Boolean Expression settings in the Boolean Expressions . <p> Line by Line example <p> The expression 0-9+ AND document searches for lines that include both a number and the word document . <p> The expression " a-z+@a-z+ " NOT " .

( All your competitors are named things like GoogleYahooWindows Desktop Search . ) <p> Hope this little tip will help you and your users ! <p> Its really nice to receive comments like this , people WANT us to be found , but I 've never really thought about FileLocator Pro or Agent Ransack- as Desktop Search products . So , what is- Desktop Search ? A quick search of the Internet highlights a large number of different uses : <p> Desktop Search vs Mobile Search : Distinguishing between Internet searches that are performed by- someone sitting at a traditional Desktop computer as opposed to someone searching the Internet using a mobile device such as a smart phone . <p> Desktop Search vs Internet Search : Distinguishing between someone searching files on a local computer as opposed to someone searching the Internet . <p> Other : And then you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Microsoft desktop app that allows people to quickly search the Internet , via their desktop . Google Desktop Search is ( was ) a desktop app written by Google for searching files on their local computer . <p> So , what do I think Desktop Search is ? Well , let 's break it down <h> What 's the Desktop ? <p> " the main screen area that you see after you turn on your computer and log on to Windows " <p> but the concept of the desktop is quite fundamental in the Windows API since- its the root of the Shells namespace . To work with objects- in the shell you normally get hold of the desktop with a call to SHGetDesktopFolder- and use that to to get hold of an objects interfaces for manipulating the object . <p> That root concept of a Desktop is what I take for my definition , thus I consider a Desktop Search is one that searches ALL local files- on a computer . <h> What 's Search ? <p> Although this seems obvious , I think there 's an important constraint of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a Desktop Search should be a near instant search . The only way to achieve this sort of search speed is by using an indexed search . I wont go into the pros and cons of indexed searching but it is an important constraint . <h> What does Wikipedia say ? <p> Wikipedia has a definition I think is fairly accurate : <p> Desktop search tools search within a users own computer files as opposed to searching the Internet . These tools are designed to find information on the users PC , including web browser history , e-mail archives , text documents , sound files , images , and video . <p> One of the main advantages of desktop search programs is that search results are displayed quickly due to the use of proper indexes . <h> Conclusion <p> So while FileLocator Pro and Agent Ransack can search ALL files on the Desktop and FileLocator Pro v8 will be able to search using indexes I do n't  think we can really label the products as Desktop Search . I- prefer the term Data Discovery , which I really do- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FileLocator Pro v8 is mentioned I feel compelled to reassure customers that anyone- who buys or has bought FileLocator Pro in 2015 will be eligible for a free upgrade to FileLocator Pro v8.

@@43885540 @3885540/ <p> I 'm using FileLocator Pro 8 because it has support for multi-line Regex searches . Unfortunately , the Keyword Summary Report for multi-line Regex search is hard to scan/interpret because there is no visual separation or separator between the results . I 've attached a brief example ( image ) .

@@43885544 @3885544/ <p> I have a simple text file with two words in it . The words are on different , but adjacent lines as below : <p> test this <p> However , if I enter ' test this ' ( without apostrophes ) into the ' Containing Text ' search bar , and I select Multi-Line Regex , FLP 8 fails to find the text . Restricting the search for just one word or the other works fine , but I thought the purpose of Multi-Line Regex was to search for content on adjacent lines ... <h> 1 Answer <p> Text on adjacent lines is not the same as being space separated . A multi-line regex works by spanning lines , so in your case you 'd need to search for the expression ( or something similar ) : <p> testrnthis <p> This is the intended functionality . <p> Normal Regex vs Multi-line Regex <p> The underlying regex engine that performs the match comparison is exactly the same for both expression types , the difference is that the normal regex engine matches lines on a line-by-line basis . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the regular expression , and kept if a match is found . Each line is searched like that , so the match is independent of any other line . <p> Multi-line regex works by reading the whole file ( or at least a large chunk of lines if the file is very large ) and then matching the expression over the whole text . This is most often useful when a search expression might be split over several lines . <p> Since a multi-line expression is searched over a much larger chunk of text it will normally be slower than the normal regex . Therefore if the search term ( e.g. email address pattern ) is not expected to span line boundaries it is recommended that you use the normal regular expression option . <p> I think I see .. But to help me , and possibly others ( since there is not much documentation about Multi-Line Regex ) , can you share a classic case where Multi-Line Regex is a better or simpler way to find content than normal Regex ? That may ( or may not ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regex find content that normal Regex does not ? <p> Imagine that you were searching over a log file where you might want to search for two concurrent log entries . The CR LF tells you that they 're separate entries . Or you want to find a line of source code that 's within 5 lines of another line . I can see how a text document might be different because the concept of a line does n't really apply , ie you 'd work in sentences and paragraphs . In that case a Boolean NEAR expression might make more sense .

The search term itself may not appear at all in the parent document , but as this is shown first in the list of results , the inclination is to look at that first .

They require a separate install , can often get confused by complicated formatting , and do n't  provide text in a format intended for display . Therefore FileLocator Pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved text accuracy and formatting . <p> BEFORE <p> AFTER <p> As you can see in this simple Excel example it makes quite a difference . However , if you decide you prefer the IFilter format you can revert to it in the Configuration settings . <p> Document Cache Settings <p> Document Caching <p> While FileLocator Pros multi-thread searching algorithms are lightning fast they can still be slowed by the need to convert large documents into text every time they 're searched . Version 7 introduces a new Document Caching functionality that allows FileLocator Pro to store converted text in a caching database for use in subsequent searches . <p> This worked so well for one our beta testers , where search times over 26,000 PDFs went from over 5 minutes down to just 10 seconds , that they were able to use cached searches instead of going with an indexed search solution ( avoiding with all the headaches associated with indexing ) . <p> Reporting <p> Reporting has long been a feature we 've been looking to add to FileLocator Pro . Although its always had the ability to print the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customization required quite a strong technical ability . Not anymore , FileLocator Pro now includes a dedicated Reporting tab , with reports for Files , Contents , and Keywords . Each report can be customized and is available in numerous styles and formats , e.g. CSV , HTML , Text etc . <p> Keyword Summary Report <p> Report Options <p> There 's much more we would like to do with Reporting but as always well be guided by your feedback . <p> Column Filters <p> If Im honest this was a self-indulgent feature . Something I really wanted , and actually delayed the release date for . Its a simple idea , following a search you can filter the files listed by entering filters in the column heading . <p> Column Filters <p> Every column can be filtered on the text within the column but date-time and numeric columns can also be filtered on ranges , e.g. &gt; 20KB &lt; 100KB . Try it out , I think you 'll like it . <p> Saving Workspace <p> Sessions and Workspaces <p> Working with large result sets can take time , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can save your search results and then re-load them back into FileLocator Pro at a future time . <p> It allows you to save just a single search tab ( a Session ) or all the open search tabs ( a Workspace ) . <p> Other features <p> Its not always the big features that make the biggest difference , sometimes the small features can punch well above their weight . Here are some of my favourite new small features : <p> Search Again <p> Ever found yourself copying text from the Text tab and pasting back into the Containing Text field to do another search ? Well now you can simply right-click on the word and click the new Search Again menu option . The search will be re-run with the new word replacing what was in the Containing text field . <p> LINES Operator <p> If you find yourself only wanting to search the first X lines of each file you 'll love the LINES operator . It can be used to limit the lines a following expression can appear in , e.g.LINES:3-10 " ERROR " <p> Include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only searched the contents of a file for the term in the Containing Text field . This new option adds the file name to the contents when evaluating the search . <p> File name presets <p> Filename presets <p> Rather than having to type in *. png ; *. bmp ; *. jpg ; *. tif every time you want to search pictures FileLocator Pro now includes presets for : <p> Folders Only <p> Files Only <p> Music <p> Pictures <p> Videos <p> Note : With a preset selected the file name field is treated as a Boolean expression . <p> Thank you <p> Over the last ten years FileLocator Pro has morphed and grown through great continuous feedback from you , our customers , to the fantastic product it is today . But in some ways weve only just started . We 've literally hundreds of features were going to be adding over the NEXT ten years . All of them focused on one thing , helping you work better by finding your data faster and easier ! <p> Update : After this was sent out we had a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  do anything to slow it down .

In all aspects of performance from application start-up and core search times to memory foot print we regularly compare the latest version to old versions just to make sure we have n't inadvertently introduced any issues . <p> The improved accuracy and layout with the dedicated Word and Excel processing can occasionally result in slightly slower times than with Office IFilters but in our tests it was n't significant and was worth the small performance penalty . However , if you want the same Excel/Word processing as v6 just set the IFilter Search Priority to Primary in the IFilter Settings . <p> While were talking about performance , during this v7 release were going to be doing some profile guided optimization work to see if we can squeeze out another 5-10% speed improvement .

It 's not a co-incidence . <p> We 've had a slow trickle of crash reports over the last few months and while most were odd , quick to fix , edge-case samples the majority have been related to memory management issues . It did n't take long to see that FileLocator Pro had a problem on low spec 'd machines performing searches where the data was in the gigabyte range and involved millions of files . We found a few problems that were simply bugs in the code , e.g. algorithms that reserved more memory than was necessary , but some of the problems were more subtle function related issues . <p> By default FileLocator Pro will record up to 10,000 lines of text per file and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not usually a problem when searching in a limited set of files . Rarely will a file have 10,000 hits or a line have 20,000 characters . However , when searching over a very large data set with criteria that might not be very selective ( e.g. searching for the letter a ' " which was the actual search phrase in one of the crash reports we received ) it can be a problem . It can be compounded by searching through file types that may not have EOL ( End Of Line ) markers , such as EXE or DLLs . Finally to make the whole thing just a little bit trickier , what might be a problem on a scrawny 512MB laptop is not necessarily a problem on sturdy 16GB PC . <p> The trouble is that FileLocator Pro does n't know at the beginning of the search if it 'll find a few hundred files with hits on a few lines ( easy ) , a couple of files with hits on 10,000 lines ( not a problem ) or a million files with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> FileLocator Pro 6.5 introduces a pre-emptive based solution . Based on the amount of memory installed on the machine FileLocator Pro sets an upper limit for un-restricted results per search ( from 20MB up to around 200MB ) . If during a search that limit is reached FileLocator Pro starts restricting the search . Results for each file are reduced to around 20 lines , with a maximum of 256 characters per line , and the restriction is retained until the search finishes . If the search still runs out of memory then rather than crashing , as it did previously , it terminates the search . <p> Our tests on very low powered machines with just 512MB have shown a huge improvement in stability for very large searches and so far we have n't received any memory related crash reports . Job done ? Not quite but its one more step in cementing FileLocator Pros place as the ultimate super fast , rock solid , search and data analysis tool .

@@43885555 @3885555/ <h> Rummage through <h> Automated Testing <p> Our automated test system has discovered bugs , often just before a big release , more times than I 'd care to admit . It 's an invaluable tool and one recommended by most modern development methodologies . However , I 'm not a fan of methodologies in general . Let me preface that with a little bit of personal history <p> Back in 1994 , while working for a bank in London , I was asked to come up with a specification standard that could be given to any old monkey ' and would produce reliable results . Management were fed up with the code quality and productivity disparities through-out the development teams . <p> In my naivety I thought it could be done . If I could take out the hard bit of the problem , my thinking went , then surely the easy ' bit could be given to anyone with even half a brain cell .

It 's why I 'm cynical of many development methodologies that attempt to remove the essential ' difficulties of software design and dumb down the art of software development . <p> There 's much common sense in modern methodologies but each project/team needs to take a pragmatic approach to picking the best bits that remove as much of the accidental ' difficulties as possible without stifling creativity and productivity . This Goldilocks philosophy ( not too little or too much but just enough ) does n't always go down well because it 's very intangible and changeable . Software developers intrinsically like to complete lists and an unchecked box on a Methodology check list feels uncomfortable . The trouble is software development is not a science that can be reduced to check lists but rather a highly creative art form . But that 's for another post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an automated test system . Invaluable but our system maybe not quite what you 'd imagine when talking about automated testing . We do n't have test plans for every piece of code . We do n't write test cases before writing code . So what do we have ? <p> Instead we maintain a library of search criteria that 's applied against a library of test data . Search tests exist for all the common cases but equally importantly for the edge ' cases which 90% of our customers will never hit . Whenever we 're adding a new feature or find a bug we add a new test to the library to test for that feature/bug in the future . <p> When the test process is run for the first time a master ' result is produced and a developer checks that the master result is correct . From then on any future runs are compared against the master . The results are summarised in a single file and we have an in-house utility to diagnose any discrepancies . <p> It works a treat and requires very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence of the product . The product as the customer experiences it . It 's invaluable in our pursuit of product excellence and reliability . <p> Okay , I admit that not every application has such convenient and concrete input/output requirements . However , if you can find an unobtrusive way to add even the smallest amount of useful automated testing to your development cycle I guarantee you 'll wonder why you never had something like this before .

The more control you can offer in the query the better it would be .

What 's the difference between - and ! when excluding folders <p> A. Any Look In entry prefixed with ! must relate to a specific file or folder ( or group of files/folders if using expressions ) . So if you put <p> Look In : C : usr ; !

Do " Look in " and " Persistent Search Filters " only apply to folders and not files <p> Dave , Thanks for explaining this . I 'm setting-up a complex search that will be used periodically against several data collections . Getting the search to work as I intended has been a more challenging than I expected it to be . If I may make some suggestions for improvements , based on my experience : The feature you described above is contrary to what I " naturally expected " . I 'd prefer the " naturally expected " operation , but I 'm ok with it working differently , if it 's documented . In general , some additional documentation for search-criteria specification would really help , e.g. , * To specify exclusion , how are " !

It took a while to figure that out . * Is there a way to exclude a specific file from a search ? For example , there 's one huge log file I want to always exclude from my search . * A " Persistent Search Filters " for file names would be really nice . BTW : I found your post about how to edit the config file filepreset.xml , and I 'm using that . <p> The above is a wish list . I realize you 're not Santa Clause , i.e. , not all wishes can be granted , and granted without cost . : = ) <p> Dave , I understand what you 're saying about " Look in " being specified explicitly vs. non-explicitly .

I 'm finding that sometimes files in z : dataTrash are excluded , and sometimes they are not excluded . I 'm wondering if the inconsistent results are due to the z drive being network-attached via WebDav ? In the past , I 've had other unrelated goofy stuff happen when using WebDav.

The report only outputs file information , ie it does not output any of the found content . <p> Contents Report <p> The Contents Report is for reporting on the found content . In the Standard style the output looks similar to the output displayed in the Hits tab . <p> The report can also display information in a Tabulated style , which is better suited if you need to export the information to a spreadsheet application . <p> Keyword Summary Report <p> Keyword statistics are displayed in the Keyword Summary Report . Each keyword is displayed along with the total number of occurrences of that keyword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters then the statistics are broken down into each separate keyword the keyword pattern matches . The keyword breakdown can be disabled by removing the Keyword Hit column . <p> Keyword by File Report <p> While the Keyword Summary Report displays combined keyword hit statistics across the whole search the Keyword by File Report breaks down the keyword statistics on a file by file basis . <p> Report Options <p> To customize the information shown in each report click the Options button ( shown highlighted below ) . <p> The Report Options lists the available columns for each report and which headers to display for the report .

@@43885569 @3885569/ <h> Rummage through <h> FileLocator Pro version 7.0 <p> Its hard to believe but its ten years since the first version of FileLocator Pro was released back in April 2003 . Looking back at the old versions its quite amazing to see how much the product has improved over the years and we hope you 'll agree with us that version 7 is another great improvement . But , are the new features compelling enough for you to upgrade again ? Well , here are the highlights : <p> Dedicated Word and Excel Filters <p> While IFilters work pretty well they do n't  always work perfectly . They require a separate install , can often get confused by complicated formatting , and do n't  provide text in a format intended for display . Therefore FileLocator Pro now has bespoke filters for Word and Excel files for improved text accuracy and formatting . <p> BEFORE <p> AFTER <p> As you can see in this simple Excel example it makes quite a difference . However , if you decide you prefer the IFilter format you can revert to it in the Configuration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While FileLocator Pros multi-thread searching algorithms are lightning fast they can still be slowed by the need to convert large documents into text every time they 're searched . Version 7 introduces a new Document Caching functionality that allows FileLocator Pro to store converted text in a caching database for use in subsequent searches . <p> This worked so well for one our beta testers , where search times over 26,000 PDFs went from over 5 minutes down to just 10 seconds , that they were able to use cached searches instead of going with an indexed search solution ( avoiding with all the headaches associated with indexing ) . <p> Reporting <p> Reporting has long been a feature we 've been looking to add to FileLocator Pro . Although its always had the ability to print the Hits tab or export to a file any form of customization required quite a strong technical ability . Not anymore , FileLocator Pro now includes a dedicated Reporting tab , with reports for Files , Contents , and Keywords . Each report can be customized and is available in numerous styles and formats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summary Report <p> Report Options <p> There 's much more we would like to do with Reporting but as always well be guided by your feedback . <p> Column Filters <p> If Im honest this was a self-indulgent feature . Something I really wanted , and actually delayed the release date for . Its a simple idea , following a search you can filter the files listed by entering filters in the column heading . <p> Column Filters <p> Every column can be filtered on the text within the column but date-time and numeric columns can also be filtered on ranges , e.g. &gt; 20KB &lt; 100KB . Try it out , I think you 'll like it . <p> Saving Workspace <p> Sessions and Workspaces <p> Working with large result sets can take time , sometimes days . Version 7 adds a new Session/Workspace feature so you can save your search results and then re-load them back into FileLocator Pro at a future time . <p> It allows you to save just a single search tab ( a Session ) or all the open search tabs ( a Workspace ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features that make the biggest difference , sometimes the small features can punch well above their weight . Here are some of my favourite new small features : <p> Search Again <p> Ever found yourself copying text from the Text tab and pasting back into the Containing Text field to do another search ? Well now you can simply right-click on the word and click the new Search Again menu option . The search will be re-run with the new word replacing what was in the Containing text field . <p> LINES Operator <p> If you find yourself only wanting to search the first X lines of each file you 'll love the LINES operator . It can be used to limit the lines a following expression can appear in , e.g.LINES:3-10 " ERROR " <p> Include filename in search <p> Prior to version 7.0 FileLocator Pro only searched the contents of a file for the term in the Containing Text field . This new option adds the file name to the contents when evaluating the search . <p> File name presets <p> Filename presets <p> Rather than having to type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *. tif every time you want to search pictures FileLocator Pro now includes presets for : <p> Folders Only <p> Files Only <p> Music <p> Pictures <p> Videos <p> Note : With a preset selected the file name field is treated as a Boolean expression . <p> Thank you <p> Over the last ten years FileLocator Pro has morphed and grown through great continuous feedback from you , our customers , to the fantastic product it is today . But in some ways weve only just started . We 've literally hundreds of features were going to be adding over the NEXT ten years . All of them focused on one thing , helping you work better by finding your data faster and easier ! <p> Update : After this was sent out we had a great question : <p> " Just please tell me you did n't  do anything to slow it down . FL is bar none the fastest grep utility for Win . Please do n't  do anything to bloat it up or slow it down . " . <p> Its a good point and one we take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling points . In all aspects of performance from application start-up and core search times to memory foot print we regularly compare the latest version to old versions just to make sure we have n't inadvertently introduced any issues . <p> The improved accuracy and layout with the dedicated Word and Excel processing can occasionally result in slightly slower times than with Office IFilters but in our tests it was n't significant and was worth the small performance penalty . However , if you want the same Excel/Word processing as v6 just set the IFilter Search Priority to Primary in the IFilter Settings . <p> While were talking about performance , during this v7 release were going to be doing some profile guided optimization work to see if we can squeeze out another 5-10% speed improvement . I 'll keep you posted on that work . <p> Avast Win32:Evo-gen Susp : Some customers have been reporting issues with Avast anti-virus flagging the FileLocator Pro download EXE as Suspicious and deleting it , and then blocking any subsequent links to the download . Apart from how this makes us look we can only imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of experience you want for your sparkling new product update . <p> Unlike Norton , Kaspersky , and AVG Avast do n't  have an ISV white-listing program for ISVs to clear their software before publishing and Avasts support has been painfully slow in responding to our ( numerous ) requests . For now we can only apologize and thank you for your patience . <p> 30 Sep 2013 : We received an email from Avast this morning " False positive detection . We are sorry .

Just download the . exe and install . It went very smooth . Minor issue during install whereby it could not kill Explorer and the FLP Hotkey Monitor , but I was able to Task Manager and kill them allowing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it installed , I was n't prompted for a reboot , but I did one anyway . <p> I REALLY like that the columns in a search can be resequenced via drag and drop , and that sticks . <p> Tags feature looks interesting . Is that new in Version 7 ? I shall have to experiment with that as I can see value there in ordering my Favorites . <p> Hits displayed before truncation has now gone from 20 to 10,001 . Wow ! Most impressive . As a Cobologist I often deal in large result sets returned when searching code . I can routinely exceed 20 hits , but I likely would not exceed 10,001 unless it were something really unusual and infrequentlike gathering line counts for functional lines of code . <p> I use FLP daily , so I will be trying out the new features . My initial reaction is job very well done . <p> Ive upgraded , not because I really need the features , but mainly to support the product ( and because of the tempting upgrade price ) . Excellent product and excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . <p> Some of the new features are nice . However , I am disappointed because I requested two things over a year ago that would help reduce the time it takes to complete a search , and it seems no attempt has been made to implement them . <p> 1 . Provide an option to search top level folders first , before going into sub-folders . I call this going wide . Instead , your software wastes a lot of time going deep , searching to the bottom of the sub-folders before going to the next top-level folder . There should be a setting to tell it how many sub-folders to go down on each pass , and eventually get to the bottom . <p> 2 . Provide a way to index contents in a way that does not disturb system resources while we are actively using the machine . <p> I 'm sorry if we could n't fit your top features into this release but we have to make a call on which features will benefit the most customers . Both of the features youve listed are good candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for more feedback until we can finalize the roadmap . Thanks for the feedback . <p> I 'm sure Ill upgrade , especially at this price . A quibble : the download page still puts a link to Office 2010 filter packs just below the main flpro download link ( " for best results we recommend " ) . That 's a bit confusing if the truly best results are now built into Flpro 7 with its bespoke office filters . And btw , that page has always been a bit confusing as to whether a PC with current or recent Microsoft Office installed even needs a separate installation of Microsofts filter packs . <p> Good point . Its always useful to have the latest IFilters installed for two reasons . The bespoke Word/Excel filters wo n't handle the other Office formats such as PowerPoint and OneNote but also if , for some reason , the bespoke filters fail FileLocator Pro can try with the Microsoft IFilters . <p> Thanks for a fantastic product that I use nearly every day . As a software developer , I highly value the lightning-like speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I just purchased upgrades for my two existing registered copies , as well as purchased a third copy I 'm not even sure what I 'm gon na do with all these copies , but I 'm proud to support such a valuable product . Keep it up ! <p> When searching for text in documents , it would be nice if we had the option to show X number of characters before and/or after the text for when the surrounding lines is set to 0 ( before and/or after ) . Also , when a keyword appears on the same line more than once , I would like to see each hit on a separate line . Currently , I do see the multiple hits per line . In addition , it would be great to show the page number where the hit occured . <p> Yes it does . However , it would be nice if the Regular Expression builder had the capability to build N characters before and/or after . I was able to get around that with Perl using " . 20team. 20 " .

@@43885570 @3885570/ <p> My new question is : what is the easiest way to locate and export files that were ignored due to open/convert/etc errors . We need to have a folder containing all these files . <p> What we have been doing is exporting the error log , editing it using regex to only include the file names ( it would be nice if there was a way to just export the file names , by the way ) . We then use this list file to search for the files . We are currently getting an error referring to closing parenthesis not being included . All the list contains is the file names as expoted by File Locator Pro . We only get this error on certain document lists . <p> One thing that 's also concerning me is the sheer amount of errors it is running across on things like Word documents , where searching should be easy . The most common error is : " Unable to copy open file to a temp location failed . 0x80004005 ( 0x3 ) - 31 " . What would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not open ? <h> 1 Answer <p> +1 vote <p> During the searching of a file FileLocator Pro first tries to open the file using the full path . If it ca n't open the file it assumes that the file is ' locked ' , this can happen if you try and read a document that is open in Word . With a locked file it tries to copy the file to a temporary location and open it there . However , the error code you 're showing is : <p> 0x03 - The system can not find the path specified . <p> which would imply the file is no longer there ( ie it has moved since the first pass ) or the path is wrong . <p> To your first point , the file was definitely not open/locked . The only thing running was the single search within File Locator Pro . <p> Secondly , I chose one of the . doc files that triggered that error and followed the path in the error log . The file is there and I can open it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is of Microsoft Word 97 - 2003 type . But even so , should n't the first pass work as it can be opened and read ? <p> If I " Look in " that location , FLP finds the file , but as soon as I add " containing text " criteria the error triggers again . <p> Thanks ! Is there any way we can export all error files ? Or is the way we are doing it the best way ? ( i.e. editing the Error List file and feeding the list of files to the " File name " text field . ) <p> 291 characters including the file name . Also - we still have the problem with feeding the path list to the search so we can find the error files and export them to be safe . Maybe this is also due to path length ... though the error message about missing closing parenthesis is odd ( seems odd at least ) . <p> Ah that 's very helpful - thanks ! We 've noticed another container for excluded items . Ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which files it ignored ? Or will we just need to uncheck ALL exclusion filters for extensions prior to doing the search ?

Basically as it stands you 're instructing FileLocator Pro to look for . zip and . rar files and not . pdf files inside ZIP files . <p> When compressed file types are switched ON FileLocator Pro treats the compressed files , e.g. ZIP files , as sub folders within the folder . So if you just want to search for PDF files then you specify it just as you would if you were searching a normal folder , e.g. <p> File name : *. pdf Containing text : Look in : C : MyArchives <p> FileLocator Pro will search though the zip files as if they are subfolders of their parent directory . <p> If you wish to limit which ZIP files are searched you specify that using the Look In field , again just as you would if you wanted to limit a search to the sub folder of a parent folder . So , for example , to search inside ONLY zip files you would use a location filter like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Only search paths with . zip in them ' . If you wanted to expand the search to include RAR files you 'd change the filter to be a Boolean expression and combine the two , e.g. <p> Look In : C : MyArchives ; +:bool : . zip OR . rar <p> If you just wanted to search inside a single zip file you would put the whole path in the Look In field , e.g. <p> Look In : C : MyArchivesDocs2012.zip <p> Note : The different compressed file types can be switched on in the Compressed Files tab , e.g. to switch ON zip searching check the ZIP box

Other formats , such as . dotx , are only supported by the premium version of the product FileLocator Pro . <p> Agent Ransack will still try and search all file types but it 's only those listed that have the ' special ' processing applied .

On some Microsoft Office installs Word takes ownership of the . rtf file format but does n't actually accept the file format when used in IFilter mode . You can verify this is the problem by opening Configuration and looking in the IFilter list . If the ' Microsoft Office Persistent Handler ' is registered for RTF files then you have an incorrect setup : <p> To fix this you 'll need to re-register the RTF IFilter . From an Administrator command prompt type : <p> regsvr32 C : **26;852;TOOLONG <p> If successful you should get a message saying ' DllRegisterServer in C : **26;880;TOOLONG succeeded . ' . Re-open FileLocator Pro and look at the IFilter configuration .

To take that sort of risk you need to know that the organization ultimately responsible for the ecosystem in which you want to live cares about your success and survival . <p> Which leads me back to the topic on writing software for the Mac .

I 'm a software developer myself using both , Windows ( with FileLocator Pro ) and Mac OS X.

They *have* the best development environment available ( compared to Visual Studio , Apples Xcode appears like software engineering from the last century ) and their completely free ( ! ) documentation/education offers *are* world class . <p> Conclusion : I 'd stay on Windows with FileLocator and concentrate on making it better = mainly faster , in my eyes .

Agent Ransack will get this auto-detect feature in the next major release .

Any features like this available on FileLocator Pro ? <h> 1 Answer <p> 0 votes <p> No FileLocator Pro does not include replace features . Notepad++ has some nice replace functionality .

@@43885723 @3885723/ <h> 1 Answer <p> 0 votes <p> Agent Ransack does not contain any FTP functionality and so the core program is not trying to connect . The Check For Updates code uses WinINet functionality to connect to www.mythicsoft.com but that should be on port 80 . Any other network code will be via Windows APIs for enumerating or reading network drives . <p> However , since Agent Ransack uses Windows Shell functionality for context menus and other file related functionality it is possible a 3rd party shell extension you have installed is loading inside the Agent Ransack process space and trying to connect to port 21 . <p> You can test this out by installing Agent Ransack on a clean system and then monitoring the network traffic again .
