And yet when I told her how we handle signup parties in SchoolAuction.net , she told me her school had never tried selling signup parties . <p> I was a little surprised , but only a little ; about 35% of the auction chairs we work with say something similar . If you 've never sold these at your event , here 's the basic idea : a parent in your community offers to host a fun event on a set date , for a limited number of guests . You sell the " slots " to this party at your auction , for a fixed price . Guests just write their name in on the Signup Sheet ( and yes , you can print ready-to-go signup sheets for each party from SchoolAuction.net ) ; you enter them using the " Sell A Bulk Item " tool , and after the event you print the Signup Report and let each host know who is coming . 
@@99164715 @3364715/ 24414 @qwx884414 <h> Online Fundraising Auctions for School Groups <p> by Roger Devine <p> Should you replace your gala auction fundraiser with an online auction ? Should you do both ? <p> I love incorporating an online auction into my school fundraising event , and I 'm going to share my ideas and thoughts herein . There are many many ways to do so ; if I do n't  cover your favorite , or if you have questions , please use the comments box at the bottom of this page , to turn this into a community discussion . ( Whoops ! In the transition to our new website design , we lost the comments box on this page well get it restored soon . ) <p> First , let 's get the obvious out of the way : online auctions do not require renting a venue , and they do n't  require hiring an auctioneer or caterer . If those line items on your budget ( and task list ) make you break out in hives , then perhaps an online auction might be a good idea for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundraising auction world , online auctions do n't  raise anywhere near as much money than galas . Sad , but true . <p> And here 's why : gala fundraising auctions are philanthropy as spectator sport bids go higher because there is a crowd cheering on the bidders ( especially in the live auction , but also in the silent ) ; because there is head-to-head competition within a short time frame , and because the guests at your event are feeling relaxed and happy about being at a fun party . And at most of the ones I go to , there are alcoholic beverages being served . Which definitely helps your guests decide to make one more bid on that class project , or signed basketball , or bottle of rare Pinot Noir . <p> Online auctions have a very different feel for the guest its very easy to get distracted away from the auction ; its NOT a very social event ( although see the tips below ) , and the guests are as likely to be drinking a Diet Dr Pepper as a microbrewed beer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to take advantage of what online auctions can offer , and avoid some of their pitfalls . <p> My first suggestion : do n't  do either alone , do both . <p> I know , that sounds like a lot of work . But if you are using our software , it really is n't . You enter the items you procure into the same database , and you have the choice of making the item available in the gala auction , in an online auction , or in both places . The same event website you use to manage the gala is also used as the " venue " for your online auction once you select the admin setting to " enable online bidding " then guests can go register and bid on any items you have made available to them . <p> My second suggestion : run the online auction either before the event , or after it . But not during it . <p> If you want to start the bidding momentum on a few selected items before the event , open up the online auction a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selected items available for online auction to the evening of the gala , and then on the morning of the gala , suspend the online bidding . Go into the Admin settings ( Admin &gt; Live Auction &gt; General ) and select the option to " Update min bids so they match the maximum online bid received " . Print bid sheets for these items , and take them to the gala auction , where your guests can continue the bidding from there on out . <p> Or do a " clean-up " auction . This is my absolute favorite online auction method . Start by talking to your auction team and telling them that you are going to do an online auction after the gala , but they should n't tell anyone about it you do n't  want any guest to have an excuse to not buy a ticket for the gala . <p> Then close procurement on three days before the gala , and give yourself plenty of time to relax and print bid sheets and sleep a little before the big day . I know , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OUR auction we get people who bring us stuff right up until an hour before the event , no matter what we tell them ! " You 're not alone . <p> But now , you do not have to break your neck getting everything in you 're doing an online auction after the event , and that is the perfect place to sell those " **26;28;TOOLONG " items . Smile , take the items , and stick them in the back room . You 'll get to them next week . <p> Similarly , on the night of the gala , if you have items that do not get a minimum bid , do n't  get upset and slash the minimum bid . Just smile , take the unsold items home , and do n't  worry about them . You have a plan for them . <p> Then , a couple of weeks after the gala , when you have recovered fully and are once again a well-rested , well-composed human at the height of your powers , enter those few late items in your database , make them ( and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and compose an email to your parent group email list that goes something like this : <p> Hi Everyone , If you were with us at our fabulous school auction a few weeks ago , you know we had a great time , and raised a lot of money $XX , 000 to be exact ! Woo hoo ! We could n't have done it without you , and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts . But if you could n't make it , or want one more taste of the bidding action , have I got news for you . Because we had a few items that came in late , and a few items that somehow got overlooked at the event , and we 've decided to make them all available in an online auction that will open tomorrow , and run for the next ten days . <p> Add a link to your online auction browse page ( our support team can help you with this just email support ( at ) schoolauction.net ) and encourage everyone to forward the email on to Grandmas and Grandpas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to their Facebook page . <p> This is a great way to leverage the ability of an online auction to expand the reach of your event , without handicapping the money-raising potential of the gala . 
@@99164716 @3364716/ 24414 @qwx884414 <h> Tips For First-Time Auction Chairs <p> by Kathryn Schwartz <p> First of all , congratulations ! Your new job may look daunting , but it can be incredibly fulfilling . And you have help available to you there 's a lot of good information and advice available on the web ( including , I hope , these articles ! ) This first article is a collection of some deceptively simple actions and choices you make ahead of time can save your sanity the night of the auction . <h> Attend Other Auctions ! <p> Once you know you 're in charge of an auction , your experience as a guest at other auctions will never be quite the same . And that 's a good thing . Attending auctions of other organizations will help you get new ideas for items to procure , ways to decorate , procedures for check-in or check-out and room setup arrangements . If you can , attend at least one auction being held at the same venue as the one you 're planning , this is the best way to see the flow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auctions is another way to get ideas . Some of my favorite ideas for oganizing volunteers the night of the auction came from my experience as a volunteer at large auctions organized by very experienced auction planners . <h> Number Your Items <p> SchoolAuction.net assigns each item a tracking number as soon as it is entered , and an item number when the final order of items is set . Once you have set the final item numbers , ( using the Tables feature ) , use small stickers ( I like white , 1 ? circles ) to mark every item with the item number . The removable stickers are less likely to leave their mark on items , but if you use them be sure to press hard so they stay on . <p> Label everything you can not have too many items numbered . For example , an auction item that is a single bottle of wine will have one sticker with one number , an auction item that is a case of wine will have 12 bottles each with a sticker that has the same number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auction tables to quickly match the right item with the correct bid sheet . Even more important , at the end of the evening when everyone is working quickly and people are connecting items with winning bidders , volunteers will have an easier time making sure people are given what they bought " not something that looks a lot like it . I have volunteered at several auctions where items intended to be part of a package werent included when delivered to the guest . While that may still happen with the labels , those numbers will let your volunteers match up orphaned items with the correct person . <h> Print Gift Certificates <p> Imagine one of your volunteers has donated to make a pie a month for a lucky buyer . The donor did not give you a gift certificate and there is nothing tangible to hand the buyer . Fast forward to check-out time , the guest is at the cashier table collecting their items and one of your volunteer is searching at will-call for a gift certificate that does n't exist . Also , unless the winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangible in their hand , guests feel as though they 're paying for something they are not receiving . <p> Preventing this is easy . Every single auction item should have something to hand the buyer even if that something is a piece of paper that says to call you ( or , even better , the generous donor of those pies ) for more information . Even when a gift certificate is n't required to redeem an item , an informational gift certificate can save a lot of headache and hassle later . You can print gift certificates easily from within SchoolAuction.net go to Reports &gt; Printouts to find the link . <h> Do n't  Give Yourself an Auction-Night Job <p> The Auction Chair should not be the person overseeing check-in , check-out , setting up the auction items or managing volunteers . In fact , on the night of the auction , the Chair should have no assigned responsibilities . There will be more than enough last minute details and questions to deal with , keep yourself available for that . <h> More Auction-Night Tips <p> If your set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's probably a good thing . When those dozen bodies have a couple hundred people added , it wont be cold any more . Suggest volunteers bring a sweater . <p> Have a volunteer lined up to take home any unclaimed items . Yes , your catalog will tell people they have to pick up their items that night , and youd never leave an auction without getting your stuff " but others will . Some people will leave without realizing they placed the winning bid , some wo n't wait in line , and others will have to leave early . Whatever the reason , you will have unclaimed items at the end of the evening . A volunteer with a large vehicle who has a secure garage where they can park ( no one wants to unload items late at night ) can be a lifesaver . <p> Have food available for your volunteers and schedule time to eat " this includes you . I recently attended an auction as a guest ( that was different and fun ! ) and was seated at a table with the auction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food that she never had a chance to sit down and eat . <p> If the auctioneer can not be clearly and easily heard by all of the guests , you will not raise as much money . If the location you 've chosen to have the auction has a sound system , check it out , make sure it is powerful enough " and that there are enough speakers properly placed " to be heard by your guests . Whatever sound system you are using , you need someone who knows the system who will be at the event and handle any sound issues that arise . The sound system used for your auction can make or break the entire event . This is not the place to cut corners . <h> Last But Not Least <p> Good planning and organization saves you time , eliminates problems before they happen , and creates an event attendees want to participate in ( and volunteer to help at ) . Be business-like in planning the auction and managing your meetings . Delegate responsibilities , make sure everyone knows what is expected of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On auction-day , have people who can focus on set-up , check-in and check-out and at the end of the night maybe you wont be saying " if I had a dollar for every time someone said my name today I 'd be rich ! .

@@99164718 @3364718/ <p> When I worked as an event planner , I would have been mortified to inadvertently overlook a detail which could have shut down my event . With so many rules to follow from municipal , state , and federal bodies , it can be hard to stay on top of details . <p> Licensing varies greatly from location to location , but here are three common licensing issues I see in the four areas I most often work : Florida , Virginia , Maryland , and the District of Columbia . I 'm not an expert in licensing , so always check with your local and state government to learn what is applicable for your situation . <h> #1 : A License for the Raffle Many states have regulations around raffles , sweepstakes , and contests . <p> My Washington , D.C. charity auction clients have debates as to whether they want to involve themselves in the raffle licensing laws . When an organization secures a raffle license , it must follow rules affecting advertising , the number of tickets sold , and even the time of the draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw ) . In contrast , a sweepstakes like a raffle allows for a drawing and for prizes to be awarded , but there is no requirement that a guest pay for the ticket . <p> I know of one school fundraiser which conducts a sweepstakes to avoid the hassle of raffle rules . They ask guests to enter the sweepstakes , but since they cant sell the tickets , they encourage donations . Most guests do make at least a $5 donation , but a donation is n't required to win a prize . <h> #2 : A License to Serve Alcohol Are you paying a company to manage the alcohol ? Or was the wine donated and your volunteers are serving it ? Are underage students handing out glasses of champagne ? Is there a difference between serving hard alcohol versus wine and beer ? <p> There are so many variations on this single area . I suggest you call your local authorities and check on the rules . <h> #3 : A Licensed Auctioneer At this point , some of you are thinking , " Are you kidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> The answer : Yes , no and sometimes . It varies by area . <p> In Virginia and Florida , a license is required . If a person accepts any sort of payment for calling a benefit auction ( " payment " could be as simple as a meal ) , an individual is required to have an auctioneers license . The penalty for conducting an auction without a license is a $2000 fine . <p> To secure my license , I had to attend an approved school ( I attended a course in Missouri ) , pass a state-administered test , and secure a bond . Now I must keep up with continuing education requirements . The process is similar to that of getting a real estate license . <p> In Washington , D.C. , the laws are relaxed . Virtually anyone can walk into the municipal building and about $800 later walk away with an auctioneers license . <p> A potential caveat : If you are holding your auction in an embassy , you are on " foreign soil . " You would then abide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , licensing varies by city . When I work an auction in Anne Arundel County ( such as Annapolis ) , I must pay a $250 fee . The City of Baltimore has a similar law . <p> Ill be honest : Its confusing , complex , and costly . I will spend several thousand dollars this year in licensing , but its important to your event . here 's an example why : <p> A colleague of mine was working a benefit auction in a museum in Washington , D.C. Shortly before he was to perform , he was approached by the police . They asked to see his auctioneers license . If he had not produced it , they would have escorted him out . Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been to the non-profit , if hed not been licensed ? The entire fundraiser 9 months worth of work could have been in jeopardy . <p> Keep these points in mind as you plan your event . Because laws change , its worth a phone call or two to ensure you 've covered your bases . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherry Truhlars free Auction Item Guide .

It can be such a cash cow that one of my clients has no live auction and only conducts an appeal ! <p> The appeal goes by various names : gift from the heart cash call raise the paddle / paddle raiser community gift fund a need or even as one of my clients says ( tongue-in-cheek ) " the shakedown . " Whatever you call it , there is a strict protocol to follow if you want to be successful . Here are seven pointers . <p> Select a single item or cause to fund . You will confuse your audience if you have a laundry list of activities or items . I saw an appeal flop at one school because they insisted on raising money for three items . Some members of the ( tipsy ) audience became confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund . Ugh ! Keep it simple by keeping it singular . <p> Advertise the appeal . Just as you would advertise a silent or live auction item , you should advertise the appeal . Talk it up prior to the gala put it in your catalog highlight it in your program ensure it has its own display table in the silent auction ( see photo ) . Showcase it ! <p> Describe the need . This can be conveyed in a heart-wrenching video , a heart-warming live testimonial , or via a short plea from someone close to the need who can succinctly describe its impact . Guests need to understand where the money is going , and how it will help the cause . <p> Offer several different pledge levels so everyone can participate . The appeal is the " group gift " of the gala , but not everyone is going to be able to give at the same level . By offering four to six different levels of pledges , you ensure everyone in your crowd can give and feels good about it . <p> Begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest giving level ) , and end by asking for the least amount of money ( your lowest giving level ) . This is simple psychology . Asking a guest to pledge $100 seems a modest request after they have just witnessed other guests pledging $1000 . <p> Ask guests to raise their bid card to make their pledge public . With few exceptions , public pledging will raise more money than silent pledging . Pledges written on notecards and collected by volunteers just is n't as effective . When a guest watches a neighbor raise his bid card , there is subtle pressure to do the same . <p> Announce the total of what was raised . Guests are always curious about the total , and my experience has been that even when the money raised has n't  been as spectacular as privately had been hoped , guests do n't  know it . " Wow , we raised $25,000 ! " a guest will tell me ( even though we hoped for $35,000 ) , " Thats WONDERFUL ! " Announcing the total inspires guests ; they feel good about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donations as guests check-out . <p> If you 'd like more free benefit auction ideas , get Sherry Truhlars free " What Sold Great in 2008 " Auction Item Guide and weekly Ezine .

@@99164722 @3364722/ 24414 @qwx884414 <h> Getting the Highest Bids on Live Auction Items <h> Need More Auction Ideas ? <p> The article below- is an excerpt from " The SchoolAuction.net Guide to Running a Fundraising Auctionwhile maintaining your sanity " download your copy for FREE right now . <h> 1 ) Hire a professional auctioneer with a focus on charity auctions <p> Many years ago I helped organize an auction that raised $2,800 . This seemingly low dollar amount actually exceeded our goal of $2,500 . We had about ten items in the live auction and a volunteer stepped up to play auctioneer . Not having a real auctioneer probably did n't  have a significant dollar impact on the amount raised , although I 'm sure that on a percentage basis we could have brought in a lot more . If you 're goal is to raise less than $5,000 you can probably get by without a professional . Otherwise , I can not stress enough how much a professional charity auctioneer will add to your auction . <p> Unfortunately , that small auction is n't the only one I was involved with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a group that includes performers or outgoing community leaders , it can be hard to make a planning committee understand that a sparkling personality and lack of stage fright are far from the only requirements in an auctioneer . <p> But sit in the audience and its painfully obvious when the personality pretending to be an auctioneer is making inappropriate jokes , raising bids by excruciatingly small dollar amounts , or taking forever to get through each item . <p> It might sound like a marketing slogan when the professional charity auctioneers say that using a novice " or fake auctioneer as some say can actually cost you money . But Ive come to believe its true and here are some of the reasons why : <p> Planning - - From sequencing the live auction item to hints on acquiring items , setting up the room to ideas for revenue enhancers , and even advice on sound systems , todays charity auctioneer is a treasure trove of ideas that will help both planning and the event run smoothly . <p> Reading the Audience- An expert charity auctioneer figures out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bidders are . They know how to move the bidding increments up appropriately " not so fast that it scares off bidding and not so slow that it takes to long to reach highest potential . A professional knows how to stimulate stagnant bidding . The professional charity auctioneer has a likable personality , but keeps the focus on the items and the point of the evening " raising money for your cause . <p> Timing- Live auctions can be fun and exciting , or long and boring . Every time someone has told me they never want to sit through a live auction again , I have asked and found that theyve never attended an auction with a real professional charity auctioneer . A professional takes about two minutes to auction each item and five to ten minutes for a direct ask ( a.k.a. paddle raise , special appeal ) . An hour of poor auctioning can seem like forever " and only get through 10 items with no direct ask . While an hour with an experienced charity auctioneer will leave your guests energized , and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Presentation- For guests to feel safe bidding , they have to know where the bidding level is and what they 're committing to when they raise that bid number . I attended one auction where the auctioneer was an expert in cattle or car auctions , not in charity events . My $150 bid cost me $200 because of the way he was calling the bids . No one at my table bid on anything else at that event , we were afraid of how much it would cost us ! <h> 2 ) Select the right items , and package them into lots when appropriate <p> Your professional charity auctioneer should be a huge help in selecting the specific items for the live auction , but here are some general ideas : <p> Save some good stuff for the silent auction " you want quality throughout the event ( and remember this because that 's what you 'll tell the person who donated or procured an item they thought should be in the live but you put in the silent ) . <p> I recommend a couple of fun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the beginning and end of the live auction so that all of the guests at least have a sense there is something they can bid on . <p> Think about any question someone might have about a live auction item and then make sure your auction catalog clearly answers it . Explain any limitations , restrictions or expiration dates , give locations , whatever is appropriate . The auctioneer will know how much of this information to explain as part of the auctioning process , and some truly motivated guests will get the attention of the auctioneer and ask if they have a question but most will simply not bid if they have a question about an item . <h> 3 ) Arrange your live-auction lots carefully <p> Your auctioneer will play an invaluable role helping you put your live auction items in order , but here are some general ideas : <p> Make the first item something tangible , popular with many people ( wine , chocolate , coffee ) and not too expensive ( relative to the rest of your live items ) . The idea is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having fun with it . At one auction I attended , the auctioneer started off by auctioning off a $20 bill " he started the bidding at $5 and it did take the audience a moment to bid even that . When the $20 ended up going for $25 " that set a good message for the event and that auction was quite successful . <p> Auction item values are usually arranged in a bell curve , with a steady climb in the first half of the live auction to the item with the highest value . Do n't  group like items , and do n't let the item values bounce up and down too much . As much as possible , have a steady , graceful arc in the rise and fall of the bell which will allow bidders to gently increase their bids toward the middle of the catalog and then slowly decrease their bids afterwards . <p> Often auctions will have one-of-a-kind items ( student created art , dinner with a local celebrity , walk on role in a movie , etc. ) in the second half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to keep your guests there . <h> 4 ) Control the amount of time your guests are expected to sit and pay attention <p> There is a limited amount of time that your guests will be enthusiastic about participating in the live auction , before they want to go back to socializing . Most groups will do well with limiting their live auction to 45 to 60 minutes , and it is the very rare group that will still be paying attention or even present longer than 90 minutes . And this time limit includes all talking and presentations before the live auction actually starts . <p> If you have hired a professional charity auctioneer , you can estimate an average of 2.5 minutes per live-auction lot ( this includes describing the item and the bidding ) . <p> With 60 minutes , take out 5 minutes for pre-auction speeches and 10 minutes for the special appeal/direct ask , and you have 45 minutes of actual live auction time or time enough for 18 items/lots . <p> Note : Time spent listening to long speeches about your organization is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening ( or not listening ) to people talk is time spent NOT spending money . The purpose of every speech made at your event should be to inspire the fundraising opportunities to come later in the evening you will handicap that effort if the speeches go on too long or there are too many of them . <h> 5 ) Schedule the live auction carefully <p> Most charity auctions follow a common formula " one to two hours of silent auction , 20 to 40 minutes to eat and socialize with fellow guests , 60 to 90 minutes of live auction and then check out . I 've heard of events that have post-auction entertainment ( live music and/or dancing ) , but usually people are ready to leave by the time the live auction is over so do n't invest too much time or money in planning something for after the live auction . <p> Also incorporated into that formula is that on weekends , you can start the event as early as 5:00 and have two hours of silent auction time . For weekday events , I start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from work or 6:00 if they will be going home first . Friday and Saturday you can end as late as 10:00 , but if there is work the next day it is a good idea to be done by 9:00 or 9:30 at the latest . <p> The format and timing of the silent auction gives guests flexibility in when they arrive because they can join in as long as they arrive any time before it ends . When it comes to the live auction , however , you want it to start at a time when everyone will have arrived but before the earliest arrivals start getting tired " and a maximum of two and a half hours after the doors opened is a good guideline . <p> Do n't  stuff your guests at dinner and use sugar and caffeine to your advantage . Even if your budget does n't  allow for a full dinner , I strongly recommend dessert and coffee be served . A slice of cheesecake finished as the live auction is starting will give a needed lift to your guests energy level . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  use this time for speeches and long presentations . The auction is the entertainment and raising money for your cause is the evenings purpose . While you might include statistics and details in your auction catalog or information you hope guests will take home , the moments before the live auction is not the time for a detailed review of your organization . You can have a very short reminder of why you are raising money and a FEW words from a volunteer or beneficiary of the organization , but I do n't  recommend more that that . <p> A note for groups with paid staff . I have heard from many people , and experienced it as a guest myself , that having staff speak at the auction can easily backfire . Whenever possible , stick with volunteers and beneficiaries " and , again , even then only let them speak for a few minutes . <p> This is also the time when your guests thoughts will most likely turn toward food . As they socialize with the other guests , guide their attention to the dining tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the salad and dessert plates are already set out . Budget too tight for a full sit-down dinner ? Consider serving only fancy desserts or finger food " just make sure your invitation clearly explains what people can expect for food . You might be tempted to offer a buffet , but I 'd recommend against it it will take significantly more time to feed everyone that way , and time spent standing in line at a buffet line is time not spent bidding . <h> 6 ) Market each item effectively <p> A slideshow that let 's your guests see the auction items is a great way to market live auction items . Use slides creatively ! For example , if there is a beach house , show photos inside as well as the view from the house , get pictures of the sunset and people having fun playing on the beach . If your auction is for a school and you have student-created art , include photos of the kids creating the items as well as the finished product . <p> If you personally know many of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live auction , having an outgoing volunteer wear the item and draw attention to it or even encourage people to try it on before the live auction starts can drive up interest and bids . Ive been to auctions where they 've tried to show such as jewelry to the seated guests during the live auction . I do n't  recommend this because its too time consuming to show a small item to all of your guests . You 'll either slow down the pace of the auction ( and lose the attention of the people who are n't  interested in that particular item ) or end up with part of the audience feeling left out . Having that piece of jewelry bigger-than-life on a screen will let everyone see it . <h> 7 ) Include a Paddle Raise ( a.k.a . Special Appeal , Direct Ask ) <p> As you reach the highest ticket items in your catalog , you may wish to include a direct request for a cash donation . A direct ask , also called a paddle raise or special appeal , is an opportunity for everyone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can donate to raise their bid number . The amounts start at the highest dollar and work down . The starting and finishing dollar amount depends entirely on your crowd . One auction may have a starting point of $10,000 , while others start at $100 . Your auctioneer will help you set the ladder for gift amounts , moving down from , for example , $500 to $250 to $100 to $50 and finally asking for pledges of $25 . <p> In the ideal situation , your top dollar is a stretch for your audience and you 've already arranged for someone in the audience to raise their paddle for that amount . This gets the crowd excited and the next dollar amount request will almost sound like a bargain to many bidders ! <p> Paddle raises work best for specific purchases rather than general or undesignated funds . For example , let 's say your school would like to purchase ten new computers for the computer lab and youve determined theyll cost $1,500 each . You share with the audience that you are hoping to raise $15,000 and that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great type of project for a paddle raise because even if you do n't  make the full amount , you 'll still be able to use the funds raised for the promised project . <p> If you do n't  have a project with a budget that works neatly for a paddle raise " do n't  let that stop you from doing one .

Its an important piece , if not THE most important piece , of an auction that requires some attention and care . Because there- are so many moving parts to a successful auction , its easy to forget that there would n't even be an event without our guests !

These sponsors will also get a more formal thank you letter once the event is completed . The formal- thank you ( on letterhead ) will be used for their tax records and is an additional opportunity to hand-write a specific thank you on the bottom of the letter . <p> When it comes to thanking guests , the more detail the better ! Personalizing each letter to include the correct dollar amount they donated , what that money is going towards ( the more specific the better ) and most importantly the correct spelling of their name .

After all , it 's much more natural to make conversation with a friend-of-a-friend than a stranger because of the common ground . <p> Before the auction , it 's important that you reach out to all of your key players to find out who they know and who they 're bringing . <p> The point is that you can leverage personal connections to build a deeper relationship with donors , quicker . <p> But first , you have to know what those connections are . Then , you can request that your common connection " whoever they may be " can introduce you to the potential donors that they know . <p> In line with the tip above , it 's important that you pay special attention to business affiliations when it comes to planning your auction . <p> For one thing , business affiliations can give you insight into opportunities for corporate philanthropy , such as matching gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by paying special attention to business rivalries . <p> For example , creating a seating chart that sits two ( friendly ) business competitors right next to each other can be a great way to stir up excitement during a live auction .

Why ? <p> Because doing so allows your bidders to support your school in a multitude of ways . It sets the stage for further cultivation and stewardship ( Need a refresher ? This Qgiv resource can help ) . <p> You can promote engagement by : <p> Making a live appeal . Asking for donations directly gives donors the opportunity to come forward . <p> Enhancing an item . Let 's say you have a student painting up for auction . Have the student give a short speech about what the painting means and why donating to his/her school is important . Like a live appeal , this direct ask adds character to an item while opening the floor for more donations . <p> Offering incentive . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone who gives a certain amount will have their name engraved on plaque that 's hung in the school atrium . <p> Previous donations are one of the strongest indicators of future donations . Enticing bidders to give more during your auction sets the stage for building a relationship with them . <p> A positive event experience at your auction can help you retain these donors so that you have the opportunity to learn more about them . <p> Knowing your donors before the auction can help you craft your event strategy . But once the auction is over , you 'll need to use the information you 've gleaned to create an effective follow-up strategy . <p> One of the biggest indicators of top prospect behavior is large bids . <p> Bidders who bid on multiple items will likely be invested in your school 's future fundraising events . Likewise , those who won top dollar items need to be stewarded appropriately with highly personal thank-you phone calls or notes . <p> Another means of gauging your donors ' interests is by paying attention to the items that garnered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items in your next school auction , but you can also use them to target your supporters ' areas of interest . <p> If for example , travel packages served as the most popular items , then perhaps you should host travel-themed fundraising events in the future . A night in Paris ? A tropical gala ? <p> The possibilities are endless , but knowing what you donors want can help you meet their preferences . <p> One of the best ways to know what your bidders think is to , well , ask them what they think . <p> Send out post-auction surveys to gather insight into your attendees and the success of your event . <p> You can ask them : <p> How they would rate the auction . <p> What they enjoyed the most . <p> What they enjoyed the least . <p> Their favorite auction items . <p> If they plan to attend more events for your school . <p> How they 'd like to support your school in the future . <p> The key is to gather the information that can help you craft your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , in turn , can result in more bids and donations for your school ! <p> Auctions are a top school fundraising idea , and for good reason .

@@99164732 @3364732/ 24414 @qwx884414 <h> More on Wine Walls <p> Last time , I passed on a description of one way a customer of ours ran the Wine Wall at her auction . This time , let 's talk about three decisions to make when designing the Wine Wall item for your auction . Because what works for one group may not work for another <p> First , how many bottles of wine should you have in the wall ? <p> There 's all sorts of considerations here : the size of your guest list , the number of avid wine drinkers in the audience , the amount of wine you can procure . So any answer I give you will need to be adjusted a bit . But I wo n't let that stop me from giving you this answer : <p> If it is the first year you are including a Wine Wall at your event , do n't  start with more than 25 bottles . If you can procure 50 or 100 bottles of wine , wrap and number them all , and set the quantity for 50 or 100 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you set up the room , and hide the others . <p> Wine Walls often need a bit of explaining to a crowd that has never seen them before . And they do depend more than a little on a perception of popularity if you have only sold 15 or 16 out of 100 displayed bottles in the first hour of your event , those other 85 bottles are going to look an awful lot like unwanted goods . Whereas if there are only 10 left , you can build a sense of urgency around the need to grab the remaining few before they are gone . <p> Once you 've established the Wine Wall as a fun , successful item at your school auction , and more of your guests know what to do when they see it , you can increase the number of bottles to better match the size of your crowd . That said , I seldom see a Wine Wall with more than 100 bottles it really becomes a challenge for the crew you have collating and distributing the auction items at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of your catalog . <p> Next , how do you price each bottle ? <p> You have a few choices here the most common are to price it at the- average- value for the actual bottles you have procured , or at the- minimum- value of any of the bottles you have procured . The latter is more guest-friendly , and easier to sell you tell the guests that the bottle they get is worth at least what theyve paid for it . The former is more lucrative for your event , and let 's you spin it as more of a game of chance pay your $15 , and you might get a $60 bottle of really high-end Pinot Noir from the Willamette Valley , or a $6 bottle of Undifferentiated Red from the Cash-n-Carry . <p> To open , or not to open ? <p> Depending on state law , the policies at your auction venue , and your insurance coverage , you may be able to offer your guests the opportunity to open and drink the bottle they purchase at the event ( the guest may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance before you even begin procurement . By the way , if you have n't read- Sherry Truhlars article on avoiding licensing mistakes in our auction guide , you should . <p> Wine Walls are a lot of fun , and excellent money-makers at most school auctions . I encourage you to consider adding one to yours , and in the weeks to come , I 'll be looking for fun twists on the concept to tell you about . 
@@99164733 @3364733/ 24414 @qwx884414 <h> Ticket Pricing For School Auctions <p> Ticket pricing is- a common topic when I talk with school auction chairs . Whether its for- a private or public school , our customers want- to make sure that their school auction is inclusive and respectful of differences in socioeconomic status within their school community . - We all know that an auction can be a lot of fun to attend when you can bid freely on whatever catches your eye . - But we also know that they can be perceived- as exclusive and elitist . <p> Over the years , I 've collected a lot of great ideas from customers on how to combat this perception . The volunteer auction chairs we work with are respectful , inclusive , and also quite brilliant . - - Well divide these up into two parts : here , well deal with making sure everyone can attend your event , and in Part 2 , well talk about making sure there are ways for all of your guests to participate once the event starts . <p> There is a temptation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for most schools , you 'll need that pre-event revenue to help cover the hard costs of your auction . You really want the parents who can pay for a full-price ticket to do so . - So here are two key strategies that work well : <p> Early-Bird Pricing start your ticket sales a month earlier than you would normally , and advertise that for the first 4 weeks , all tickets will be sold at a discounted price . ( If you are using the online ticket-sales feature built into the SchoolAuction.net software , this is easy to set up just create a ticket type for the discounted ticket , and set the date range that that ticket type will be available . ) <p> Free Tickets For Volunteers At the same time , announce that the auction team is looking for volunteers to help plan and run the event , and will make free tickets available to anyone who wants to help out . - Do n't  worry about limiting this , at least initially ; almost every auction chair Ive ever spoken to could use more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Volunteers : the Volunteer Swap <p> The problem with giving free tickets to your volunteers may be obvious : anyone who is working on event night ( setting up the silent auction , checking guests in and out , etc. ) does n't  exactly have time to enjoy the event that free ticket is n't a terribly valuable reward if they cant sit down for dinner or check out the silent auction . <p> The solution ? - - Swap your auction-night volunteer crew with one from another schools auction team . Find another school in your district that is holding their auction on a different weekend , and offer to send 10-12 volunteers to their event to help run the event , in exchange for the same number of volunteers from their team coming to your auction to help you . - That way , those 10-12 volunteers get to attend their own schools auction as guests and enjoy the evening . <p> Where should you look for a school to establish a volunteer-swap with ? - Start in your cluster if you 're at a high-school , talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school ; if you 're at an elementary , talk to preschools in your area . - If you 're a SchoolAuction.net customer , you can also contact us- we probably have other customers in your city that are asking the same question .

Today , well talk tactics for optimizing check-in ; well talk about check-out and item pickup in subsequent installments . Please feel free to contribute your opinions in the comments section below . And if this discussion is useful to you , you can sign up to be notified every time I put up a new installment in this series by signing up with the form on the left . <p> I 'm going to start by defining what happens during a standard , on-site check-in process at most of the school fundraising auctions Ive worked or attended . ( You may do more or less at yours ; if so , please let us know in the comments section , along with questions or suggestions on how to modify the answers below for other schools who do things the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option that can make an enormous difference an option- you may not have experienced before . <p> The Standard , On-Site Check-In <p> An on-site check-in consists of greeting the guests , checking to see if they have a valid ticket for the event ( and selling them a ticket if they have n't ) , asking the guests if they would let us swipe a credit-card to speed payment later on , assigning a bidder number and giving them a paddle with that number , and possibly handing them a program or a packet with name labels , catalog , bid paddle , pledge card and the like . <p> That 's a lot . If the check-in area is not well-organized , and adequately staffed with trained volunteers , you can find yourself with long line of guests waiting to get their number , rather than using it to bid on your auction items . How can you keep that wait to the bare minimum , and speed your guests on their way to the silent auction tables ? Let 's start by asking a key question : <p> How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For customers using - standard , on-site check-in process with SchoolAuction.net ( or a comparable product ) with well-trained volunteers , the list above generally takes 35-50 seconds per couple ( 30-45 for a single guest ) . If you have opened the doors at 5 , you 'll have a crunch time from 5:15 to 5:40 or so when half your guests arrive ; the time on either side will see fewer guests coming through the doors . <p> For auctions that are run without software to help with guest management , the list above can be handled almost as quickly ; I have run a manual check-in where we averaged 55-65 seconds per couple ; the bottleneck in a manual process is usually in selling tickets to guests who arrive without them , especially if they want to write you a check for the ticket . <p> So how many check-in stations should I have ? <p> Obviously , the answer is partly determined by how many guests you have , but also by your system . We recommend 4 stations to our customers who are running events with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each 50 guests thereafter . If you are running the process manually , you want to think about how many cash-boxes you are willing to put at the check-in area for your volunteers , and how to manage their access to those . With a manual system it is almost imperative to ask your guests to segregate themselves alphabetically by last name and divide themselves into appropriate check-in lines ; this pretty much limits you to 5 or 6 stations maximum , covering 4-6 letters each . <p> If you are using a software package other than SchoolAuction.net , be sure you check to see how many stations you can setup without incurring additional " seat fees " . <p> The Alternative Advance Check-In <p> If you 've flown on a commercial airline in the past few years , youve probably taken advantage of the ability to check yourself in from home the night before your flight , and print your boarding pass from your home computer . - We love this particular innovation , and have adapted it for fundraising auctions . - If you are using our software , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check-in line entirely . They can key in their own credit-card number , and even print a bid number to bring with them to the event . <p> I am using SchoolAuction.net ( or a different software product to help me with check-in ) ! Can I use my own computers , or should I rent them ? <p> Ive been known to recommend both options here , based on the customers situation . here 's the pros and cons to renting computers for your event : <p> Pros : Rented hardware usually works without any tinkering ; borrowed computers and printers almost never talk to each other without someone spending 20-30 minutes installing drivers and testing connections and the like . Rented hardware also usually comes with an IT expert , who will set the computers up before the event starts , pack them up after the event ends , and stay at the check-in area to troubleshoot any issues quickly . These guys also usually bring backup supplies ( paper , toner cartridges , etc. ) and stay sober all night . Many of them also know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch in and help during crunch time . <p> Cons : Cost . It can cost you $500-$800 to rent equipment for the night ; and there 's often someone on your committee who ca n't see the point of spending that money when there 's some perfectly nice dad you should be able to wrangle into taking care of that for you . Point out that having him babysit the computers means that he ca n't be out on the auction floor drinking and bidding on classroom projects . <p> Should we assign bid numbers ahead of time ? <p> You can , and there are some advantages . It let 's you distribute bidder packets ahead of time , and that can save some time for the guests who remember to bring them on auction night . It also let 's you make fancy bid paddles printed with the guests names in addition to their bid number . <p> But if you are n't  going to distribute these ahead of time , the process of finding a customized bid packet or a pre-assigned bid number can- increase- the wait for your guests . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assign a bid number as I check the guest in , based on the bid number or bidder packet that is on top of the stack next to them . You can have ballpoint pens or Sharpies there to have the volunteer write the guests last name on the back of the bid number or the outside of the bidder packet ; this is still faster than rooting around in a file box for the pre-assigned number . <p> How hard should we push to get guests to swipe their credit cards ? <p> This affects check-out more than check-in , but I 'll discuss it here anyway . I have my volunteers ask every guest , but never push back if a guest does n't  feel comfortable handing over their card number at check-in . If you get card numbers in your system for 60-70% of your guests , you 'll have done enough to help speed up your check-out process , and pushing to drive that number higher , at the expense of making even one guest nervous or resentful , just is n't worth it .

@@99164759 @3364759/ 24414 @qwx884414 <h> Credit-Card Processing with SchoolAuction.net <p> One of the most common questions I get from prospective customers of our auction software is " what is the rate you charge for credit-card processing ? " I 'm going to answer that question here , but I need to set the answer up first . <p> If you start researching fundraising-auction software , you will quickly figure out that just about every company in the space has set their business up to steer its customers toward a specific company for credit-card processing . By doing so , they can control the rate you pay to process credit-card transactions and set things up so that the software company gets a little piece of each transaction , in addition to the fees and rate charged by the processor . This little piece is either an extra charge ( a " service fee " ) , or is built into the rate the processor charges the processor sends the software company a check after the event , and the auction customer never knows about it . <p> We do n't  do things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow you to use ( almost ) any company you want for credit-card processing . - Really . - You choose shop around for a company you want to do business with and whose rates are acceptable . - That and that alone will determine what you pay to process a card transaction . <p> So : what rate will you be charged ? - Thats up to you . <h> More FAQ About Credit-Card Processing <p> " But wait that 's not an answer ! - I need to figure out what this event is going to cost me ! " - <p> I get that . So , here 's an estimate : most of our customers wind up averaging about 2.48%. - If you want to be conservative in your budgeting , use 3% . <p> " Alright , so I get to pick . - But I do n't  know anything about credit-card processors . - Do you have any recommendations ? " <p> Sure . - I am not going to dictate who you use , but I 'm happy to make referrals. - Take a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there because many of our customers have had good experiences with them . - None of them pay us to be included on that list . <p> " Can I just use my bank , where we have our checking account ? " <p> Sure most retail banks resell credit-card processing services from one of the major processors , and can set you up with a compatible account . - Please be aware that going down this road usually entails a lot of conversations with the banks rep on how auctions work , and how your monthly limits should be set ( its not as straightforward as setting up an account for the dry cleaner on the corner ) . Using one of the companies on our Partners page means you get to sidestep all of that Ive already educated them for you . <p> " Can I just use PayPal or Square ? " <p> Sure but those are- not integrated with our software , since they- do n't  store guest card numbers so you can automatically charge them later . - You can use them alongside our software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend it . <p> " Can we use our iPads , and the readers we have for those ? " <p> The answer here is the same as for the question about Square above . Any credit-card readers that plug into the headphone jack or power connector on your iPad are not open systems our software cant talk to them . So you can use them alongside our software , but they are not integrated , and wo n't store card numbers , etc . <p> If you want to use iPads to check in or check out guests who have used the Advance Check-In feature to store their credit card number in the system before the auction , that works just fine . - Just launch the web browser , login to your site , and go to the Auction Night page to get started .

End of sales pitch . ) <p> Okay , I know software will help , but were not going to use it this year . How do I speed up check-out without software ? <p> With a manual process , you 'll need to have a good filing system , centrally placed so that all of your volunteers can get to the guest files ( breaking up check-out alphabetically , like you did with check-in , is much less feasible with guests who are tired and may have been drinking ) , and this likely limits you to 4 or 5 check-out stations ; otherwise there are too many collisions at the file box . You 'll also need printing calculators ( with extra paper tape and ribbons stored under the table ) , plenty of pens , and a cash box for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerks , I 'd consider including two people whose sole job is to pull guest files on your check-out team , if you are running the auction manually , plus one or two personable , chatty people to " work the line " talk with your guests while they wait , encourage them to have their credit-cards or checkbooks ready ( they can fill out everything but the amount before they get up to the clerks station ) , and direct them to open clerks quickly . <p> If I am using SchoolAuction.net ( or other software ) how many check-in stations should I have ? <p> The same number as you had for check-in , at least . Its a great idea to set up an extra station just for troubleshooting tricky check-out situations ( i.e. a guest who disputes whether he or she actually wrote down that bid you see on the sheet , or a guest who spent more than the limit available on their credit card ) staff that station with an experienced member of the team or even the chair . This way , your other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolve to the troubleshooting station , and keep the lines moving for the rest of the guests . <p> If you are using a software package other than SchoolAuction.net , be sure you check to see how many stations you can setup without incurring additional " seat fees " . <p> Should I check out guests before they come out of the auction room , and just have receipts available for them ? <p> Maybe . There 's no doubt that this does speed the process up , at least for 75% of your guests . They can just take their receipts and go to item pickup . <p> The downside it that you do n't  catch mistakes before you have processed their order ; your guests may become more irritated with having to work with you to process returns and refunds , and the goodwill you engender because of the time gained will be squandered . At my auctions , I do n't  do this . <p> What about leaving check-out for the next day ? <p> Several of our customers do this they say good night at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions the next day , or over the next week . It does completely sidestep the issue of asking tired guests to do anything else at the end of the auction they can go straight home , pay the babysitter and go to sleep . The downside is that you either have to let the guests pick up their items before they 've paid for them , or haul all of the items out of the auction venue and over to a separate pick-up point which you then have to staff .

@@99164770 @3364770/ 24414 @qwx884414 <h> The Hidden Cost of Donated Food <p> by Kathryn Schwartz <p> Early in my auction life , I chaired an event where we got all of the food and beverages donated . No one restaurant would donate the entire meal but we were able to get a contribution from several different locations " appetizers from a tex-mex restaurant , bread from a local bakery , entrees from Greek and Italian restaurants , and desserts from a cheesecake maker and a cookie company . We purchased vegetables from the grocery store and had a volunteer prepare trays to serve with the appetizers . The food was tasty even if it was n't cohesive . We had volunteers who displayed and served the food as attractively as possible . We also had volunteers who acted as bartenders with a keg of beer donated by a local microbrewery and cases of wine from a member of the organization who was also a wine distributor . We purchased soda and bottles of water at a warehouse store . The line item for our food budget was really low and it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year , with me again chairing this organizations auction , the committee decided to move to a ballroom that required using their in-house catering . We were concerned about the food budget " which did skyrocket " but in reviewing the overall expenses , I was surprised to see we had n't  spent that much more . <p> This is because when we had all of the food donated , we had to buy paper plates and napkins , and plastic cups and cutlery . We had also paid a room charge for the venue and had to purchase a permit to serve the beer and wine ( as required by the ballroom ) . Additionally , we had volunteers procure , pick-up , garnish and serve the food and , at the end of the evening , we were responsible for all of the clean-up . Years later I still remember folding up tables and taking out the garbage well after midnight . <p> It was very different with the catering provided in-house by the business that owned the ballroom space . The first change I noticed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procuring food to procuring items to auction . At the event , the all of the tableware ( real china , glass and flatware ! ) , linens , wait staff and bartenders were included , saving us money and giving our event a more elegant feel . The venue waived the room charge because we were a nonprofit organization , and with their professional bartenders we did n't  need to get a liquor permit . And at the end of the evening the venue staff swept the floors , put the tables away and emptied the garbage while auction team loaded their cars . <p> Having a caterer was worth what it cost " and looking at the big picture , it did n't  cost that much more . Ive come to believe that it is better to save money by being direct when talking to your caterer about your budget , and to ask for ideas to help keep costs down . <p> One place you can save money without a lot of extra work is get donated wine and/or beer to serve .

@@99164772 @3364772/ 24414 @qwx884414 <h> Bid Sheets Printing Bid Increments School Auction 101 , Issue #1 <p> Silent auction bid sheet formatting is one of those topics on which auction chairs hold a wide range of deeply-held opinions . I talk to school auction chairs across the country on a daily basis , and bid sheets are easily one of the most frequent topics . <p> So , for the first three or four installments in this series of tips and tricks , I want to explore some of the common bid-sheet choices that auction chairs hold diverging opinions on , and present the arguments I hear on each side of the fence for each . Please feel free to contribute your opinions in the comments section below . And if this discussion is useful to you , you can sign up to be notified every time I put up a new installment in this series by signing up with the form on the left . <p> Choice#1 : Print Bid Increments , or Not ? <p> Everyone seems to agree on this much : each bid sheet should have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have the Minimum Bid printed again in on the top line of the bid list , in the Bid column. - The question is : should you have the rest of the bid increments calculated and printed down the Bid column , so that your guests only have to write their bidder number and name on the appropiate line ? <p> The argument for printing every bid increment is that it keeps guests from writing down bids for less than the next qualifying bid they do n't  have to think , they do n't  have to add , they just have to write their name ( and , we hope , their bidder number ) . Few guests get too distracted ( or drunk ) to be able to manage writing their name . <p> On the other hand , printing all of the bid increments establishes a psychological " ceiling " for the bidding on that item. - That bid on the last line is likely to be read by your guests that you do n't  really expect anyone to bid any higher even if you hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher ! And , just as your guests are not going to put in a bid that is lower than the next qualifying bid if you print the increments for them , they 're also not likely to put in a bid that is HIGHER than the next qualifying bid they may skip a few lines occasionally , but more often than not , we see the bids go line-by-line . <p> The key to making the right decision for your school auction is to know your audience is this your schools first auction , or has there been a tendency for your guests to ignore minimum-raise numbers in the past ? If so , print the increments . Or is your audience used to auctions , and generally willing to take the second or two to do the addition in their heads ? Then you can take a chance , and shouldnt give them that " bid ceiling " for each item . <p> Factor in the environment if you 're going to have loud music , a lot of items and a lot of people crowding the tables , and/or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increments . If its a black-tie affair and a little less raucous , then printing the increments may hurt more than it helps . <p> -Roger <p> Like this School Auction 101 tip ? - Use the form below to sign up for more well only use this list to send you School Auction 101 tips , and will never sell or give away your address to anyone .

@@99164808 @3364808/ <h> Mobile Bidding 101 <p> No doubt about it , Mobile Bidding has been the topic of the past couple of years around here . We spent a lot of time thinking about whether it made sense for our core customers and if so , how we should implement it . We rolled out a version of it quietly last fall , learned a lot , and revised the feature over the summer . Then we revamped our subscription plans , with the goal of making it affordable for the types of organizations we tend to work with , and BOOM a whole lot of you decided to try it at this years auction . <p> - <p> For those of you who are still trying to figure out whether its right for your event , we 've written this post to explain what Mobile Bidding is , and how our implementation of it works . Call it Mobile Bidding 101 . <p> - <p> What is Mobile Bidding ? <p> Its a system that allows guests at your gala auction to bid on silent auction items using their smartphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on paper sheets . <p> - <p> How Does It Work ? <p> You ( the auction chair or procurement captain ) adds an item to your SchoolAuction.net database , and checks the " Mobile Bidding " box on the Item Edit screen , adding an opening and closing time for the item . At your event , your guests follow a link that the software will have already emailed to them . This logs them into the site under their account , shows them a list of the items available for mobile bidding , at which point they select the ones they would like to bid on , and enter either a straight bid , or a " max bid " . - <p> - <p> Do the Guests Have to Download an App ? - <p> No , it uses the web browser on their smartphone . <p> - <p> What If the Guest Gets Outbid ? <p> They get notified three ways in the browser , by email , and on the Display Screens that you can choose to project in the room . <p> - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to their account , and they can pay for it along with their other winnings at check-out . <p> - <p> What About the Live Auction ? The Paddle Raise ? <p> The auctioneers who we approached to consult with us on the development of this feature were united on this point mobile bidding undermines the auctioneers ability to influence the guests through peer pressure and psychology . Were smart enough to listen to these fundraising gurus , and to pass their wisdom along . <p> - <p> How Is This Different from an Online Auction ? <p> Mobile Bidding is an enhanced version of our online auction system the additional features are the invitation system ( i.e. guests do n't  have to sign up for an account and remember yet another password ) , the Display Screens , and the single , integrated cart for Mobile and Gala purchases . <p> - <p> What If a Guest Has Problems , or Forgot Their Phone ? <p> Ideally , you will have a couple of volunteers walking around with iPad minis ( or another small tablet ) if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bid on any Mobile Bidding item on behalf of any guest . <p> - <p> Can I Use This for Proxy Bidding ? <p> Yes just make sure that any guest who can not attend the event but who wants to participate in the bidding has a ticket for your event it can be a free or low-priced " Mobile-Bidding-Only " ticket , but they do need to be entered as a ticket-holding guest in your SchoolAuction.net database . <p> - <p> Does SchoolAuction.net Provide Staff , or Devices for Us to Hand Out to Guests ? <p> No this is the main way we keep our costs so much lower than the competition . We are pretty confident that your guests have smartphones , and are likely to bring them to your event. - And we know we can train your volunteers to be bidding assistants , at a much lower cost than putting people on planes to travel to your event ( and put them up in a hotel room afterwards ) . <p> - <p> Thoughts ?

Please feel free to contribute your opinions in the comments section below . And if this discussion is useful to you , you can sign up to be notified every time I put up a new installment in this series by signing up with the form on the left . <p> Choice#2 : Should we display the FMV ? <p> Fair Market Value is what a person could expect to pay for an item if they bought it at retail . Its important to know the FMV for each item in your auction , because it determines the potential tax deduction your guests can take . But during the bidding period , should your guests know the FMV for each item in front of them ? <p> The argument AGAINST printing the FMV on your bid sheets is easy it represents another psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will accept the FMV as a " true " value , rather than doing the work to figure out what it is worth to them. - Do n't  tell them the FMV , and youll force them to decide for themselves and what they decide might be much higher . This strategy is almost always used for classroom projects ; the FMV for most kindergarten projects is often a tiny fraction of what they are worth to the parents of those kindergarteners. - So why not use it with the silent auction items , too ? <p> The argument FOR printing FMV is that it will encourage skittish or shy guests to make bids . <p> It is quite common that 15-20% of the guests will be responsible for 85% of the money spent at your school auction . These guests are likely to be willing to bid above the FMV for an item. - Guests who wont spend above FMV are " bargain hunters " and the conventional wisdom is that you really do n't  want to encourage bargain hunting , since you want your guests attitude to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . <p> But in order to get those final bids up above the FMV , you 're going to need to get those first few bidding lines filled in and if the bargain hunters in the room can see that their is still room for them to add a qualifying bid below the FMV , they are likely to do so . If they win , that 's great ( for them ) ; if someone outbids them , well , there 's another item on the next table where the bidding is still only 75% of the FMV , and theyll go bid on that one . <p> Our recommendation ? The SchoolAuction.net software allows both options , but the default is to print the FMV on bid sheets . But again , the key is to know your audience are you likely to get a lot of complaints that people wanted to buy , but did n't  feel comfortable doing so without knowing the FMV ? Or do you have a wide base of benefit-savvy guests who are less concerned with finding a deal than contributing to your school ?

@@99164829 @3364829/ <h> Case Study : Portland Public Schools Foundation <h> Last year Portland Public Schools parents raised over 3 million dollars through fundraisers . <p> Considering these are dollars raised by numerous volunteer hours and unquantifiable energy costs , that number is staggering . Fortunately , these schools ( 44 of them ) have the support of the Portland Public Schools Foundation ( PPSF ) under the nonprofit umbrella of All Hands Raised . In this atypical partnership of public school and nonprofit , PPSF provides strategic support to these schools . In doing so , not only do schools have an easier time planning and executing a successful auction , the foundation receives access to quality data , providing both parties with set , measured and achieved development goals . SchoolAuction.net has been providing the auction software services for this partnership , offering- the schools even more support and more savings . <p> In this third installment of Case Study , we sat down with Rosemary Schwimmer , Manager of Parent and School Engagement at The Portland Public Schools Foundation , to chat about this unique group effort that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a little more about the Portland Public Schools Foundation ( PPSF ) ? <p> PPSF was founded in 1994 when Portland Public School parents came together with the PPS School Board to form Local School Foundations ( LSFs ) . These LSFs were designed to raise funds to support teaching and staff positions in the schools , while also supporting high need schools through the establishment of the PPS Parent Equity Fund ( one-third of all funds raised by the local school foundations after the first $10,000 is allocated to the PPS Parent Equity Fund ) . The PPSF stewards the funds raised by local schools and manages the PPS Parent Equity Fund , in accordance with PPS School Board policy . <p> Can you explain the general setup of this arrangement and how the SchoolAuction.net group license plays a part ? <p> Under the non-profit " umbrella " of All Hands Raised , every school in the Portland Public School District has an established Local School Foundation account . Affiliated programs operate under the umbrella of the All Hands Raised and receive a variety of direct support services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate under their own 501(c) ( 3 ) and receive a more limited set of services . With SchoolAuction.net 's group-license agreement we are able to save district foundations a significant amount of time and money . We are able to provide measurable , tangible benefits to schools ( community building , volunteer swaps , less volunteer burnout , better coordination across chairs , establishing local best practice etc ) . <p> What are some other benefits of this agreement ? <p> Centralized credit card processing via the district foundations master merchant account , plus access to real-time financial and donor reporting ( including the ability to easily import donor data to the primary foundation CRM ) has been the most tangible benefit . This has enabled the LSF 's as well as PPSF to reach and exceed its goals . Additional support services from PPSF include stewarding donors through gift recognition and tax documentation , managing accounting , including deposits , accounts payable , accounts receivable ; taxes and audits ; use of Bulk Mailing Permit and Raffle Class A License ; event and umbrella insurance coverage ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a fee for operating under PPSF ? <p> No . One-hundred percent of the net parent-raised funds benefit PPS students " All Hands Raised does not keep a single dollar of ANY of the money raised , including for operating expenses , and neither PPS nor PPS parents are charged a fee for this work . By working with SchoolAuction.net we are better able to provide a shared group of services at lower costs . For example , renting credit card processors is a significant expense for school auction teams but through this group license we are able to have a set number of credit card processors on hand at no extra charge to the school . Normally it costs $200 for each machine rental , which saves the school at least $600 ! <p> Can you share any examples on how this has improved workflows , communication and planning overall ? <p> From the perspective of PPSF , the software saves us significant workforce capacity and expense since all auction payments are acknowledged at the event and our office does not need to send letters . From an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paperwork required to put on the event and creates a database of information to be used for future events . For LSFs , it also allows them to review the data to make improvements for next year , for example , determining how much the silent auction raises versus the work required to put on this portion of the event . PPSF benefits from having everyone using one system . <p> A big Thank You to Rosemary and the PPSF team for helping to continually improve the landscape of school fundraising . <h> What are your thoughts ? Do you know of a similar team effort in fundraising ? We would love to hear about it in the comments below .

@@99164846 @3364846/ <h> FAQ : " Limited " Mobile Bidding <p> From time to time , I 'm going to post questions sent to me from auction chairs about our product or company , along with our answers . <p> Last summer , we changed our subscription plans and added " limited " mobile-bidding features to the Standard Subscription . We also added a bunch of new mobile-bidding features to our Plus and Premium subscriptions . This has lead to people ( like Laura , whose question is featured below ) to ask what the differences are between the " full-featured " mobile-bidding that Plus and Premium subscribers get , and the " limited " mobile-bidding features that Standard subscribers get . <p> Laura asks : <p> - Hi Roger , <p> We spoke a few months ago and are finally getting to the decision time for selecting our software . I have a few questions : <p> if we went with the standard plan for $1000/month . What does it mean to have " limited " mobile bidding ? Is there a cap on the items that we can use for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with this level ? What exactly does email and in-brower notifications mean ? <p> Thanks for your help . <p> My answer : <p> Hi Laura , <p> Excellent questions. - Here are some answers : <p> There are no hard limits on the number of mobile items you can have in the Standard plan. - But it is limited to Silent Auction and Signup items only you can not do a mobile Special Appeal/Paddle Raise/Fund-A-Need or Live Auction . <p> Related to that , in the Standard package , mobile bidders are alerted if they are outbid in two ways they see a small indicator in the top right corner of their mobile devices browser , and they get an email message letting them know that they have been outbid . <p> Many of the groups that used our software for mobile-bidding auctions last year asked us for some improvements that would make it easier to run auctions with more than say , a dozen or so mobile-bidding items. - These include : <p> outbid notifications via text-message <p> invitations to bid via text-message <p> the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run talent contests- and group-bidding ( think Dessert Dash ) via the mobile-bidding system <p> So we added those new features , to our Plus subscription. - At the same time , we added the existing mobile-bidding features ( which had been Plus-only ) to our Standard subscription , to give more groups the option to test the mobile-bidding waters out and see if it would work for their group . 
@@99164847 @3364847/ <h> Selecting a Subscription Level <p> Last summer , we re-jiggered the feature sets for our subscription levels , adding significant new mobile-bidding features to our Plus and Premium subscriptions . - We needed to many of you who had used our mobile bidding feature last year said you liked it , and it worked well , but that you really wanted to use text-messaging ( and not just email ) for invitations and outbid notifications . You also wanted to be able to offer mobile bidding for Live and Paddle Raise items , and asked us to improve the display screens . <p> Once we got done with all of that , we decided that wed add the legacy mobile bidding features ( minus the improvements ) to all Standard subscriptions , so that mobile bidding would be available for more of you to test out . <p> But that kind of eliminated one of the easiest ways to tell the Plus and Standard subscriptions apart " does it include mobile bidding or not ? " - This has led to some hesitation and confusion when selecting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice this way : if you only want to test mobile bidding out in a small way ( to see whether your audience will respond to it ) , or if you want to stick to paper bid sheets and paddles in the air , then go for the Standard Subscription . - If you are all-in and gung-ho about mobile bidding , upgrade to Plus you 'll be a lot happier .

High <h> Welcome to our newest blog series , Case Study , where we highlight fundraising auctions throughout the country , sharing their experience with our software as well as some insider tips and tricks for auction success . <p> The first in this series highlights a first time fundraising event at a junior high , which was previously included in their feeder high school fundraiser until two years ago . The stars were aligned for Lakeridge Jr . High in Lake Oswego when Julie Davidson signed on to chair their event . Using her background in event planning , Julie and her team have run a successful event two years in a row , raising significantly more money each year , while providing their guests with a fun and easy experience ( and a cool Oktoberfest theme to boot ! ) . We sat down with Julie to gain some insight into how our software helped make it happen . <p> happy guests <p> What made you decide to use SchoolAuction.net ? I first became familiar as a volunteer parent at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to using it for an event I would chair , not only was it the right price and did what we needed it to do but it was easy to use and there were not a lot of bugs in the software . Also , unlike other companies , there was no outside marketing to my guest list . <p> What was the onboarding process like for you and your team ? First year using compared to second year ? The online help features and demos were extremely helpful and how I learned to use the software most . I loved the online help quite a lot and the screenshots for visuals .. And the training session with volunteers prior to the event was quick and useful . I directed a lot of our volunteers to use the online help because it was the best .

Everything is online now so mobile bidding seemed like the way to go . It was like not putting all our eggs in one basket . We knew the community was eventually going to use it so why not . Guests being on their phone the whole night was a concern because creating a sense of community is one of our top goals for the event but we did n't see a problem with that . People still had conversations and mingled . Our other concern was if the software would work properly that night . Opening a preview a few days before the event allowed us to sort out any kinks . We also had volunteers walking around with iPads the night of the event so people could find help that way . <p> I was concerned that all the auction items get the same real estate on mobile bidding and we wanted to highlight some items more than others so the second year around we limited mobile items to our favorite , most coveted bids . We made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end , mobile bidding is n't for everyone . It has to be the right crowd . Jr . High parents were our sweet spot . <p> What 's your favorite/most useful feature on the software ? I love how quick it is to set up our individual site . There are a lot of ways to customize it too . The catalog is intuitive . Although we did n't use it for our school auction , I like the assigned seating function , which I used at a different auction with great success . I would highly recommend using the function to sort seating for the sake of the volunteers . <p> Oktoberfestivities <p> How has the software changed your experience as an auction chair ? I felt the guest experience is really enhanced with the software . I can keep in good communication with them before the event . There is definitely less waiting in line to check in .

Everything else is on line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event was easier too , cutting down on printing and the use of Excel spreadsheets saved money and time .
