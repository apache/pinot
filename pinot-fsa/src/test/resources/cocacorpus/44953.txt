@@96341888 @541888/ <p> Back in 1995 , we needed a special " lovely " font for our " Fiolex Home Studio " , a small , low-cost , home-publishing software like Corel 's Print House . The idea was to create a romantic , elegant script font with some hearts in it . So " Fiolex Girls " was born , and was probably one of the first fonts with embedded hearts , if not the very first one . <p> We were in hurry ( one week later and our publisher would have killed us ) and had no time to create a completely new font . So we based " Fiolex Girls " on an existing font , that had no copyright restrictions ( not Linotype 's Coronet , it was delivered with an old Corel Draw ! version , if I remember right , the software we used to create the font , btw. ) , creating the new heart characters , adding accents and improving here and there . At that time , a legal ( if not prohibited by individual copyright terms ) and common praxis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a font very similar to Linotype 's Coronet , btw . The original designer of this font family was Robert Hunter Middleton ( 1985 ) . <p> We do n't  claim " Fiolex Girls " to be a completely new design , but we can claim it to be one of the oldest and first heart-fonts . And : back in 95 , not everyone was able to create fonts and publish them on the net . It was not so simple , far away from " throws some hearts around the caps " ; - ) <p> Anyway , who cares . We are glad , we are making so many people happy with that font , even if it was never intended to make it free downloadable . It seems , that some Home Studio buyer were so fascinated about it , that they spread it over the whole world . Honestly , we never thought , this font would have that success . <p> @Fiolex Software : ...

So we based " Fiolex Girls " on an existing font , that had no copyright restrictions ( not Linotype 's Coronet , it was delivered with an old Corel Draw ! version ... <p> Do n't really remember . Probably , but could even be that we used a clone from a shareware CD . It 's not an excuse , but at that time we started just from scratch , and we were an absolutely chaotic party of a few crazy guys with no organization at all . Way too long ago to say who did what and how . However , I remember we used Corel for font creation ( do n't remember the version though , something between 3 and 6 ) . The printed manual included 2 or more pages of detailed instructions how to edit and create fonts , and there was also a text passage mentionning the editing and changing of the Corel fonts , plus a note with the embedding restrictions . We did n't see any written restrictions concerning the use of Corel fonts as base for new ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found such notes . <p> Maybe we made a mistake ( and many other too ) , but the whole copyright thing was a grey zone at that time , and the lack of clearly defined rules did n't help at all . Many things have changed the past years , regarding copyright and trademark questions , using and publishing or sharing images , photos , music , logos , signs a.s.o .. Many things you used to do 10-15 years ago , you will never do again those days , unless you like legal disputes . And I do n't . <p> N.B. starting with version 7 of Corel , there is no more detailed information in the printed manuals or in the helpfiles concerning the editing , changing and creating of fonts ( except a short reference ) . The license and copyright info regarding images , clipart and other content are also lots more detailed and restrictive than in older versions . <p> @koeiekat : ... And not Linotype Coronet ?

That said , I removed them all , and will replace them with new , redesigned versions . Not much I can do against Fiolex Girls though , aside from spreading out a new version and hoping , people will appreciate this more than the old one . <p> Concerning Fiolex Mephisto : Feel free to do so , it 's handmade and nothing to hide here .

I 'm a bit concerned , but I do n't see problems here : similar ideas based on old scripts , but implementation and design are definitely different .

As there is no proper preview available I just compared the character preview of wtf with the enlarged preview here , and jumped into the conclusion that JohnLennon was a muddy copy of Goo Goo Gjoob and commented like that . I should not have done that . Triggered by your response I got Veer 's pdf with the font embedded to compare it with the freebee . And , JohnLennon is indeed a thing on it 's own and has little to nothing to do with Goo Goo Gloob . <p> As a starter , the lc p is completely different . I did not bother to check all glyphs .

JohnLennon is not what I said a bad rip-off , it is , I 'm sorry to say so Analia , straight forward rubbish . Not a single detail is preserved . No wonder it looks like mud . It is mud . <p> So should this stop Analia or others from putting their work on here ? No , of course not . But maybe keep the initial release for themselves and improve it before they make it public . <p> @Analia : you can prevent this muddy result by selecting None in the smooth filter when importing the bitmaps . It also helps when your bitmaps have a minimum of anti-aliasing . The hard work is not in the rendering but in the preparation of each bitmap . <p> I 've never had any direct correspondence with Analia . She posted on another message board that she had some fonts that she had made , and she would like to share them . If referred her to a number of sites that accept font submissions , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devroye , who set up a homepage for her on his site . I really like her dingbat font , but that has received no comments . <p> The John Lennon Normal font was made in August , 2006 , so , if she 's still making fonts , no doubt her skills have improved .

Nothing kills enthusiasm more than lack of encouragement and unconstructive criticism . <p> I was very fortunate to have support and encouragement from Luc Devroye while I taught myself fontmaking , through trial and error .

I 've had a lot of downloads recently , over 12,000 in the last 2-+ weeks , but very little feedback , including no comments here , other than my own notations . <p> Letraset no doubt uses a program much more sophisticated than ScanFont , but I 'm limited to ScanFont because it 's the only one I have that let 's me import monochrome bitmaps directly . Analia uses something from Font Logic , but I 'm not sure what . <p> I ca n't justify paying hundreds of dollars to buy a better program , just so I might be able to make my freeware fonts look a little bit better . I do the best I can , and I 'm sure that 's what Analia did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this site that were n't any better , but they were n't singled out for negative comments . <p> Bob , Analia uses ( used ) Font Creator v5 - www.high-logic.com - a program though not as sophisticated as the top-of-the-bill programs , is perfectly capable to render good glyphs . That is , if you get the settings right and your bitmaps are of good quality . But that , and specially the last , goes for any font maker program . So we are not talking about the lack of quality of design of a font , we are talking about the lack of quality of the rendering of the glyphs as a result of using a ' tool ' without trying to understand it 's function . <p> And , yes , you are right , Bob .

Seizing inspiration from designs by Daniel Pelavin and Neville Brody -- whose distinctive typefaces help define the retro-futuristic style of New Tomorrowland -- DecoTech features capitals from Metropolis Science Centre and Space Mountain , with the addition of an original lowercase set . <p> DECOTECH TL offers some extra capitals : the uppercase contain the common " Tomorrowland " character set , while the lowercase contain some additional designs based on signage from Port Discovery at Tokyo Disney Sea . These can be used alone or mixed with DecoTech upper/lowercase for more design possibilites . <p> Special thanks to Joshua Harris for the idea and design input ! ... <p> Decotech is just another variation of the Anna or AnneBoleyn , as you please .

So forget the missing parts and look to match the font , then make the trims . Do n't be misled by the " R " , it is n't open , the bar has been trimmed out . <p> well , it 's like this- do I spend an hour looking for a suitable stencil font or do I spend 10 minutes trimming a font I have ? Anyway , in reality stencils are normal fonts that are adapted for stenciling.

Thanks ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't . Microsoft Word gives you a number of Save As options , such as Word Document , Rich Text Format , WordPerfect document , etc. in the ' Save as type ' field in the Save As dialog box . One of the options is to save the document as Web Page . If you do n't use MS Word to make your web page , the program you use may offer this option as well . Saving an MS Word document as Web page creates an html document and a file folder which will contain any graphics which have been inserted into the document . This is very similar to what happens when you save a web page from the Internet . In MS Word , go to Tools in the Menu Bar . Select Options .... from the drop down list . Select the Save tab in the Options dialog box . Check the boxes for Embed True Type fonts and Embed characters in use only . Click OK to close the document , and save the document . For this to work , the font @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature is determined by the font designer , but can be modified with some font making/editing programs . For example , I can change embedding settings with FontLab Studio5 , but not with ScanFont . The font being embedded must always be installed on the computer you 're using to make the document . If you create a document with an embedded font , do n't uninstall that font , because that can affect not only the document you 've made , but also any other documents on your computer that have the same font embedded . It can also affect the font itself , and any copies of that font that are on your computer. - None of the character glyphs will appear when you open that font in preview ! This also happens if you rename a font that has already been installed . As far as I could tell , the only way to restore the font is to delete all copies on your computer , delete any documents which have the font embedded , and reacquire the font from wherever you got it in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embed fonts , and it has worked succcessfully once , with a font called 24hourbauer . I 've also caused myself a lot of grief by trying to do this with other fonts , even ones I 've made myself , where I have personally set the embedding paramenters . It 's also possible that this works properly for any embedible font , provided that all features of MS Word have been properly installed . I do n't wa n't to test that feature badly enough to uninstall/reinstall MS Word , just to test embedding . If you do want to try this , I recommend you do the following : 1 ) Before starting , send yourself an e-mail , with the font you want to use as an attachment . That way , you can retrieve it later , if other copies become corrupted. 2 ) Make sure you know where every copy of that font is on your computer , either installed , in a . zip , or in another folder . This includes copies which have the same font name in the header , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You download a font named ASQRDBD.TTF , and rename it to match the title given to the font by the author Both will be corrupted. 3 ) Create the document , and enable the embedding features . 4 ) E-mail the document with embedding to someone else , or to yourself , for the purpose of viewing it on another computer which does not have the font installed , to see if the embedding worked . The second computer used to check embedding is not at risk . Either the embedded characters will appear corrrectly , or MS Word will use a default font like Times New Roman or , in some cases , Fixedsys . I make fonts , and have experimewnted with embedding , but I gave up on it when it corruped some of my fonts . This was a big problem when I was making new fonts . I often make multiple versions of a font with the same name , to see if the glyphs need additional editing . If I install version 1.0 of my font , embed 1.0 in a document , uninstall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the risk of having all versions of 1.0 and 1.1 corrupted . So the key things in this are : 1 ) Do n't Uninstall a font which has been used in any ambedded document on your computer . 2 ) Test the embedding by viewing the embedded document on a computer which does not have the embedded font installed . I learned all of this the hard way . bito <p> 4 matchesI found this program Weft 3 on Microsoft 's home site and I ca n't get it to work . Does anyone know about WEFT3 .

I would stay clear of this line of thought . 2 ) The japanese have also a charater based writen form almost the same as chinese but also have a second form of writing called Kanji which is used to make the sounds of western words which they have no actual japanese meanings such as brand names . take the this not as a step back but as a step in the right direction it may be easier to find some one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . But be worned that in both chinese and japanese there is one indavidual charecter for every word in the language . and these words can not be broken down into letters as we know it . Its more than a font thing . you ca n't just get a chinese font and type in the charcters as they apear on your key board and spell out what you want , it would't make any sense , not phoneticly or in the actual language .

Which overlapping contours are , as well as intersecting points , and redundant points are . You can validate glyphs indivually by opening each glyph and hitting f7 or go to the toolbar and from toolbar &gt; fonts &gt; validate . But keep in mind , to fix all the errors it finds will take a long time , but like I said , I always do it now . I suggest checking the box for the option to automatically fix errors that way it fixes what it can but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will list for you and you can save that info as a txt file to refer to . and kk , I would have have to say he is not acting like another kirk or myself even .

The image shows one glyph with *contours that overlap , points that intersect , points that are redundant , and countours that consist of less than 3 points .

Thanks , Paul <p> 6 matchesAndrew , you know I am a fan of your fonts , they do look really good &amp; are very detailed . But you should optimize your fonts . Some computers crash with just one intersecting contour in a font . You can and should edit the points when making fonts. your designs are good , you have a lot of style so I hope this does n't sound like I am being rude , but it 's not that difficult to trace a glyph into a font program that looks cool , but has 900+ points and intersecting contours ... Not only will validating your fonts make them smaller files , they will make your fonts look better too , by ensuring the points are in the exact positions they should be in . Whenever possible remove redundant points , correct intersections . If you do this you will see that you could possibly remove entire contours from a glyph with incorrect direction , or that overlap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatically ! And though you may not have encountered this problem yet , believe me , these flaws in a font do crash computers and will , and a font that crashes a computer ... well , it 's not a good thing .

Make that 5 - I just found out about : Stained Glass a font created by Sue Ralston http : //www.web-of-dreams.com/ <p> 1 LONG ... The issue is this . With a digitized typeface you can not distribute a font only a typeface . For the simple reason that the whole subset is available in that typeface . Alex faces 3 situations . One with the typeface designers who hold the copyright on the actual design which they sell or license to others . For money or for free . Commercial typeface , shareware typeface or freeware . One with the companies that market a typeface and one with his partners in this forum . The last ones are typeface vendors . I assume they support these sort of forums to stop/limit the unlimited spreading of their sales items . So without any doubt Alex 's contract with his sponsors has a clear clause about not making commercial typefaces available other than linking/directing to his sponsors . Fair enough . The secon ones are the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name a few . These parties do not legally hold the copyright on a typeface ( That is with the designer ) , unless the designer actually sold the copyright . But they do hold the copyright ont the NAME of the typeface . So we face the odd situation that patent law seems to allow the originator of a typeface to protect the name he chooses to identify his work but he ca n't protect the actual design . Consequently , everyone is copying typefaces and re-issuing them with a different name . Without consequences if they also change the copyright lines and so in the metrics ( This stems from the time of lead letter printing when purchasing font sets of a typeface actually meant buying many kilos of lead and the right to use that lead . ( Or Linotype/Monotype matrixes ) . They will sue Alex when he makes their typefaces available for free on his site . And they will win . If Alex links to another site , the mere thought behind the hyperlink in the internet , they will sue him too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But ... they will throw in corporate legal with such force that Alex will be bankrupt before the preliminary proceedings are half way . Which is the whole idea because it is their only possibility to stop the free distribution chain . Again see Napster .

I can post the site here but the moderators might not approve . <p> When you get to that site , click on the 2010 tab and scroll down to the bottom of the list because the list is date-based and the font was released early 2010 . There are many other football fonts on that 2010 tab , just scroll through the list . <p> @skin This now outdated so not really relevant anymore but please understand that the fast majority of requests for these sort of fonts come from China/South-East Asia with the intention to make and sell counterfeit jerseys . We do not support links that will enable this . <p> Yet , as your link here also makes it possible to find fonts that copy current jerseys I had to change it a bit . Understand ? <p> This is your forum , this is your show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is right or wrong . You call the shots as far as what 's going on here . <p> However , the thread might be outdated but the topic is not . I occassionally get private messages from here looking for this font so I decided to do this to get myself out of this mess . I was hoping that indirectly linking to a site through a lesser known search engine might do the trick . This is what I got for bragging . : ( <p> If I only know how to create fonts , I will make my own fonts of all football jersey fonts . I love them and I am not engaged in any business directly or indirectly related to football . I also do not use these fonts for anything commercial , purely personal . <p> I am no longer replying to private or public messages regarding the MLS font . Considering that directly or indirectly linking to a site where i know the font is found is not acceptable here , I suggest that anyone looking for this font should go to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ font " . I also suggest that you use a meta search engine to rid yourself of unrelated search results ( spam ? ) that abound in the results major search engines show you . Go to a meta search engine like www.search.com , www.metacrawler.com , www.webcrawler.com , www.ixquick.com , www.dogpile.com and hundreds of other meta search out there but it is the top ( unpaid ) result at search.com : ) <p> BTW football jersey counterfeiters exist in South America , Europe and in every territory where the game is popular . China and South East Asia do not have a monopoly . Would you believe that football jersey counterfeiters exist even in Spain ?
