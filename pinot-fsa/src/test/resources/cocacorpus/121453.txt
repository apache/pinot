She defines CSRA 's strategy for digital platform offerings and also engages cloud practitioners through a strong community of interest within CSRA to help ensure our employees develop the technology skillsets our customers require . Lakshmi has worked in IT for more than twenty-five years supporting federal clients . In this article , she shares the top five reasons federal agencies are moving to the cloud . <p> Over the past several years , cloud computing and services has grown as a defining force for federal IT . Federal mandates , driven by highly publicized events such as government website launch failures , have made moving to the cloud a priority for small and large agencies alike . Additionally , cultures are changing with the entry of millennials into agencies , bringing the expectation of shorter application development life cycles and next-generation solutions . <p> Here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloud : <h> 1 . The Drive to Digital Government <p> In recent years , we 've seen several mandates focused on driving digital transformation in government in order to glean efficiencies and improve the delivery of services to U.S. citizens . The Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative ( FDCCI ) promoted the adoption of Green IT to reduce the overall energy and real estate footprint of federal data centers . The Data Center Optimization Initiative ( DCOI ) superseded FDCCI and focused on optimizing infrastructure and resources . DCOI satisfied the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act ( FITARA ) recommendation to streamline IT procurement and make use of private sector best practices . The combined benefits of these directives are reduced data center hardware , software , and operations costs by shifting IT investments into more efficient next-generation platforms . <p> Along with the FDCCI came the federal government 's Cloud Computing Strategy that encouraged agencies to think cloud first ' when refreshing legacy systems or implementing new systems . The government then introduced 18F in 2014 , which is now a part of GSA 's Technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched the U.S. Digital Service ( USDS ) the same year for supporting and facilitating digital transformation within federal agencies . <h> 2 . The Need for Speed <p> Next-generation technology has raised the bar in terms of speed and agility . Federal agencies can no longer wait a year or more to launch new applications . Cloud technologies and teams are helping federal agencies meet aggressive deadlines . With today 's cloud platforms , a federal agency can build and provision systems and migrate applications in timelines as short 15-20 days . <p> When tasked by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) to build a cloud-based uSAS drone registry application in less than two months , CSRA reached for the U.S. Digital Services Playbook for inspiration . Our solution employed open source , Agile and DevOps principles on an AWS Cloud backbone , which enabled us to rapidly develop and deploy the system. - <p> Speed and agility are vital when agencies face critical challenges . For example , this is demonstrated when the CDC uses technology agility to release new information and vaccines to combat a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cybersecurity threats quickly and effectively . <h> 3 . Budget-friendly IT Solutions <p> Federal agencies are always vigilant about their budgets . The cloud offers more cost-effective options for leveraging hardware resources through consolidation , shared services , orchestration , and leveraged automation . Cloud solutions also offer access to IT staff with expensive and specialized skillsets like cybersecurity and cloud management . Agencies can benefit from the economies of scale offered by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) , Microsoft Azure , and Google. <h> 4 . Supercharged Features and Shorter Release Cycles <p> Cloud providers offer a wide range of features from security and compliance to application development services , database services , analytics and even artificial intelligence . Developing features like these can take years " and time to adoption can take even longer " so these providers significantly shorten the release cycle . Agencies should , however , be judicious on how they implement these services as they might find themselves locked into a particular cloud vendor technology . <h> 5 . Improved Cybersecurity Posture <p> Security is a critical factor to successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrates to the cloud , there 's less hardware lying around to worry about because it 's now in the cloud provider 's data center . Agencies then need only be concerned with providing security around middleware and applications , which is outsourced to system integrators and contractors . Cloud providers who comply with standards such as FedRAMP ensure federal security standards and provide peace of mind . <p> With these five drivers , agencies are well on their way to adopting and migrating applications into the cloud . However , not every workload is appropriate for the cloud and often it 's practical to adopt a hybrid approach . A comprehensive IT strategy is paramount to successful and low risk IT operations " and CSRA can help .

GAAP revenue for the quarter was $1.03 billion , up 3.3 percent compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 as a result of the addition of one month of operations of SRA International , Inc . GAAP net income from continuing operations before tax was $59 million , down from $91 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 , driven by $44 million in separation and merger costs . GAAP net income from continuing operations before tax also contained one month of intangibles amortization associated with the SRA merger , including the amortization expense associated with SRA 's funded contract backlog , which was preliminarily valued at $65 million and is being amortized over one year . GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.29 .

The tables at the end of this press release provide appropriate reconciliations from pro forma adjusted results to GAAP results . When analyzing CSRA 's performance , investors and securities analysts should evaluate each adjustment in our reconciliation and use pro forma adjusted measures in addition to , and not as an alternative to , GAAP measures . <p> Pro forma revenue for the quarter was $1.27 billion , down 5.1 percent from $1.34 billion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 . Major drivers of the year-over-year decline include a reduction on the Army Logistics Modernization Program as it transitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts with federal civilian agencies , partially offset by increases on some Intelligence and Health programs . <p> Pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $224 million , representing a pro forma adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.7 percent . Third quarter pro forma adjusted EBITDA includes $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $28 million of net pension-related income . The strong pro forma adjusted EBITDA performance was driven by a combination of non-recurring improvements in profitability on certain contracts , a stronger mix of direct labor , cost synergies realized from the SRA merger , and a change in the method of estimating pension income . <p> Pension income in the quarter was $7 million above the run rate in the first half of the fiscal year , primarily as a result of a change in the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of pension income in the third quarter . The company anticipates that using the full yield curve in the estimation should improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and yield curve spot rates and provide a more accurate measurement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excludes transaction related costs such as investment banking , legal and accounting fees , as well as the costs to extinguish SRA 's interest rate swaps and to redeem its bonds . It also exclude costs specifically related to merger integration , such as external consulting , IT system integration , and employee severance costs associated with the SRA merger , as well as the periodic mark-to-market adjustments to the pension plan . <p> Pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48 based on a diluted share count of 165 million . Basic and diluted share counts for all GAAP and pro forma adjusted tables for the period ended January 1 , 2016 , are based on the weighted average share count over the period of November 30 , 2015 , the day of the spin-off and merger transactions , through January 1 , 2016 .

Pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share include a non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $50 million but exclude the intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA 's funded contract backlog .

The following table summarizes revenue by reportable segment : <p> - <p> ( in millions ) <p> Three Months Ended <p> - <p> Growth Rate <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> 1-Jan-16 <p> - <p> 2-Jan-15 <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Pro forma revenue <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> - <p> - <p> Defense and Intelligence <p> $ - - - - - - 545 <p> - <p> $ - - - - - - 625 <p> - <p> -12.8% <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Civil <p> $ - - - - - - 727 <p> - <p> $ - - - - - - 716 <p> - <p> 1.6% <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Total pro forma revenue <p> $ - - - - 1,272 <p> - <p> $ - - - - 1,341 <p> - <p> -5.1% <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Historical SRA revenue for periods prior to November 30 , 2015 <p> ( 240 ) <p> - <p> ( 342 ) <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Total revenue <p> $ - - - - 1,032 <p> - <p> $ - - - - - - <p> - <p> For the three months ended January 1 , 2016 , pro forma Defense and Intelligence segment revenues decreased by $80 million , or 12.8 percent compared to the same period of the prior year . A major source of this decline was our Army Logistics Modernization Program , which is transitioning to a maintenance phase after a very successful , large-scale software deployment . In addition , lower material purchases on Navy contracts , the sale of the Welkin business , and the wind down of Army Overseas Contingency Operations ( OCO ) work outweighed the ramp up on new Intelligence programs . <p> For the three months ended January 1 , 2016 , pro forma Civil segment revenues increased by $11- million , or 1.6- percent as compared to the same period of the prior year . New program starts and program expansions , primarily in Health , more than offset reductions in material purchases on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide segment operating income in future periods . Operating income provides useful information to CSRA 's management for assessment of CSRA 's performance and results of operations and is one of the financial measures utilized to determine executive compensation . The complexity of the one-time charges associated with the spin-off and merger transactions make pro forma adjusted operating income less meaningful for the current quarter . <p> Cash Management and Capital Deployment <p> As of January 1 , 2016 , the company had $204 million in cash and cash equivalents , an increase of $194 million compared to the end of the prior quarter. - With $200 million of drawn revolver and $2.8 billion of term-loan debt at quarter end , management believes the company 's steady cash flows and $500 million of undrawn revolver capacity create a capital structure that provides substantial liquidity and flexibility to manage the business . <p> Due to the complex nature of the spin-off and merger transactions , the company deemed it impractical to generate a pro forma adjusted cash flow statement , so all cash flow impacts are stated on a GAAP basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unique items , the most significant of which are reflected in cash flows from investing and financing activities . The company received funding from CSC prior to the spin-off to bring CSRA 's cash balance to $300 million . Then , on the dates of the spin-off and merger , the company received $3 billion of new debt financing and used it to pay off SRA 's existing debt and hedges , distribute the cash portion of the merger consideration to SRA shareholders , fund the special dividend to CSC shareholders , and pay SRA 's transaction-related expenses . <p> Large GAAP operating payments include $30 million to CSC , the first of five annual payments under the Intellectual Property agreement that governs inter-company proprietary information sharing , and more than $20 million in transaction fees to investment banks and other advisory firms . Accounts receivable increased by about $20 million compared to the usual run rate due to normal seasonal slowdown in payment . As a result , days sales outstanding for the quarter were 55 days . <p> On November 30 , 2015 , CSRA 's Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share on CSRA 's common stock . The first quarterly dividend was paid after the third quarter close on January 26 , 2016 to CSRA stockholders of record at the close of business on January 5 , 2016 . Also on November 30 , 2015 , CSRA 's Board of Directors authorized up to $400 million for repurchases of outstanding shares of its common stock , effective immediately through March 31 , 2019 . Through the end of the quarter , the company repurchased $37 million of shares on the open market , which is reflected as a cash outflow from financing activities . The dividend and stock repurchase programs are part of the company 's overall strategy for capital allocation to maximize shareholder value . The Board 's action is a reflection of the company 's strong financial position and its confidence in the company 's future performance . <p> Contract Awards <p> Pro forma contract awards ( bookings ) totaled $1.8 billion in the third quarter , representing a pro forma book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x . The third quarter marked the fourth consecutive quarter with a pro forma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awards for the trailing twelve-month period totaled $7.0 billion , representing a pro forma book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x . New business awards constituted about one-quarter of the total awards in the third quarter and one-third of the total awards in the trailing twelve months . <p> Included in the quarterly bookings were four single-award prime contracts in excess of $100 million in total contract value : <p> DC-1 Contract . The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) awarded CSRA a single award , Indefinite Delivery , Indefinite Quantity contract with a maximum value of $967 million over 54-months to extend current work in support of the agency 's Data Center 1 . Under the new contract any DHS component may award task orders for an array of managed services , private cloud offerings , hardware and software , network and security infrastructure , applications support , and project management . With services focused on the as-a-service model and CSRA 's exclusive private cloud , this contract will provide a unique combination of flexibility and technical capabilities to evolve with technology and mission needs as well as the highest levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enterprise Operations and Security Services ( ARNG EOSS ) III . Under a task order with a potential value of $247 million over five years , CSRA will continue to provide 24x7 network operations and cyber security solutions to support 105,000 EOSS users worldwide . Through the EOSS III program , the ARNG provides the operation , modernization , expansion , and further evolution of enterprise network services and cyber security via GuardNet to provide mission command support across all ARNG locations and missions . CSRA will support the ARNG with the operation and maintenance of GuardNet and protect the security of its data and network through the Network Operations and Security Center . <p> Administrative Office of the US Courts ( AOUSC ) Support . Under a task order with a potential value of $115 million over five years , CSRA will provide full software development lifecycle expertise for a variety of applications supporting probation and pre-trial services and electronic court filings . The services include program and project management , business requirements analysis , solutions architecture , software engineering , COTS/GOTS support and the development of new solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will expand its level of effort supporting the AOUSC Department of Program Services ( DPS ) Case Management Systems Office ( CMSO ) as it transitions all application development to Agile methodologies leading to the implementation of the Scaled Agile Framework- ( SAFe- ) and Development/Operations ( DevOps ) methodologies . <p> Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Intake , Conversion , and Mail Handling Services ( ICMHS ) . CSRA was awarded the ICMHS program to improve the Veterans Benefits Administration 's paperless processing of veterans ' disability claims by reducing the time required to establish , develop , rate , adjudicate , and pay the claims . CSRA will receive benefits claims material , convert the claims into paperless content , and help upload and process the material into the VA 's benefit management system . The five-year prime task order , which is valued at $233 million if all options are exercised , represents new work for CSRA . <p> The company 's backlog of signed business orders at the end of third quarter of fiscal year 2016 was $15.3 billion , of which $2.6 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 , total backlog increased 6 percent . <p> Forward Guidance <p> The company is initiating guidance ranges for revenue , adjusted EBITDA , and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 as specified in the table below . Beginning in fiscal year 2017 , the company intends to provide guidance for annual periods rather than quarters , since the timing of the spin-off transaction was not conducive to that approach in fiscal year 2016 . <p> Measure <p> Q4 Fiscal 2016 <p> Revenue ( millions ) <p> $1,280 " $1,330 <p> Adjusted EBITDA ( millions ) <p> $214 " $226 <p> Adjusted Diluted EPS <p> $0.45 " $0.49 <p> The company affirms its long-term model of average compound annual growth in revenue of 2 percent to 3 percent and average compound annual growth in adjusted EPS of 8 percent to 10 percent . <p> Dave Keffer , CSRA CFO commented , " Overall , I am pleased with the third quarter results , especially how well our team managed our costs while executing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment to unlock cost synergies from the SRA merger and drive earnings growth for our shareholders . We look forward to strong free cash flow conversion and balanced capital deployment as we pay down debt and return cash to shareholders through our ongoing dividend and share repurchase programs .

These statements represent CSRA 's intentions , plans , expectations and beliefs , including statements about network and asset protection and improving mission-critical functions . The forward-looking statements are subject to risks , uncertainties and other factors , many of which are outside the control of CSRA . These factors could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements . For a written description of these factors , see the sections titled " Risk Factors " and " Management 's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Computer Sciences GS " in CSRA 's Quarterly Report for the Fiscal Quarter Ended October 2 , 2015 and any updating information in subsequent SEC filings . CSRA disclaims any intention or obligation to update these forward-looking statements whether as a result of subsequent event or otherwise , except as required by law . <p> In particular , our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded based on U.S. GAAP accounting methodologies and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors , including weak performance of financial markets , declining interest rates , changes in laws or regulations , changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate returns . Our future funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans , the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels , the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in government laws and regulations . Future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns , assuming other factors are held constant . <p> Additionally , in connection with our spin-off from our former parent company , we rely on information we receive from that company to make certain calculations that are important to our external financial reporting. - For example , we rely on that company to supply us with the number of CSRA options held by employees of Computer Sciences Corporation ( " CSC " ) - whose CSC option awards were converted into options to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spin-off , which we use among other things in calculating our diluted earnings per share . We also rely on that company for other information including certain historical tax assets and liabilities and cash balances for pass-through payments made by certain customers and third parties to CSC accounts. - We expect our dependence on information supplied by that company to diminish over time , but until then we will have limited ability to control the quality , accuracy or timeliness of the information we receive from that company . <p> For a written description of these and other important factors , see the sections titled " Risk Factors " and " Management 's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Computer Sciences GS " in CSRA 's Quarterly Report for the Fiscal Quarter Ended October 2 , 2015 , CSRA 's Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed December 9 , 2015 , as amended , and any updating information in subsequent SEC filings .

@@77733333 @6433333/ <h> Priorities in Healthcare IT 6376 @qwx626376 <p> Atacan Donmez possesses 30 years of experience leading service delivery organizations that support complex system transformation programs in the Federal Government Health IT market . Currently , Atacan is responsible for program development and strategic advancement in CSRA 's Health and Civil business unit . He utilizes his deep technical expertise combined with business acumen and management skills to identify customer needs and develop transformation solutions for Health IT capabilities to address those needs , enabling successful healthcare reform , improving healthcare quality , and maximizing patient results . His clients include Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs . <p> I was pleased to attend the 2017HIMSS Annual Conference &amp; Exhibition in Orlando last month along with 40,000+ other health IT professionals , clinicians , executives and vendors from around the world . I was part of a CSRA delegation focused on learning what 's new in the industry and networking with key stakeholders in the federal health sphere . <p> The conference featured a number of education sessions on a variety of healthcare IT topics . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Growing Concern over Cybersecurity among Health Professionals <p> There were plenty of conversations and presentations at HIMSS about the ongoing challenges that healthcare IT leaders face , such as federal policy or changing payment models , but a common thread was growing concern about cyber threats . It was exciting to see that health professionals are increasingly focused on cybersecurity and are partnering with traditional IT firms to protect patient information in a way that still allows them to be innovative , share data , and develop more effective care models . <h> Precision Medicine Relies on Precision Data <p> There were a number of sessions and product vendors concerned with integrating research data with clinical data , and making that available to physicians at the point of care . I saw several case studies that demonstrated the high value of precision medicine to enhance the value of care , starting with accelerating diagnoses and achieving increased precision in drug prescriptions to treatment methods and protocols . <p> Precision medicine becomes even more effective when patient data is integrated with research data such as that obtained from human genomics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and similar data points . The CSRA team and I attended a product launch by a company called 2beprecise . It was an impressive demonstration , and they are already doing some live trials at the NIH Clinical Center . Our interaction with 2beprecise at the conference led to a meeting last week at CSRA where we established some synergies and plans to collaborate across our NIH and DHA clients . <h> Data Interoperability to Improve Healthcare Quality <p> The above observations tie to a higher level theme across the conference : How can we achieve data interoperability across the care continuum and even extend it to the entire healthcare eco-system to improve the quality of healthcare and lower costs ? It was widely acknowledged at the conference that there is a need for analytics and quality reporting , so what can you do with the data ? It became apparent that the analytics space is quite large and ripe with opportunity . <p> A number of presentations promoted the notion of interoperable analytics . Interoperability is not only about integrating health care systems ; it also includes establishing data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making that data available in a meaningful way to all stakeholders at different points of the continuum . The ultimate end game is to be able to identify and create interoperability at the data level , at the analytics level , and at the methods level . And this is actually where traditional IT methodology really shines in support of healthcare . <h> Integration through APIs <p> We know how to achieve data interoperability in IT " it 's through the use of APIs . At HIMSS , there was consensus around how API strategy will become the centerpiece of the health platform . Getting there will entail more people across the healthcare industry agreeing to expose more of their capabilities via APIs so that they can be integrated . There is some level of progress made on this front , but much work remains . <p> The health care sector , like government itself , is under pressure to modernize and implement new technologies. - The HIMSS conference served as an important reminder that in all cases , security is of paramount importance in pursuit of IT modernization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at #HIMSS17 was the best for networking with Federal Health IT colleagues , attendees named CSRA's- Howl at the Moon reception. - Check it out !

The following table summarizes revenue by reportable segment : <p> For the three months ended April- 1 , 2016 , pro forma Defense and Intelligence segment revenues decreased by $53 million , or 8.4 percent compared to the same period of the prior year . Fourth quarter pro forma Civil segment revenues decreased by $8 million , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prior year . <p> Pro forma segment operating income increased across the company , driven by profitability enhancements with the Defense and Intelligence segment . For the three months ended April- 1 , 2016 , total pro forma segment operating margin was 12.4 percent , up 70 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 . <p> Non-GAAP Financial Measures <p> The following tables illustrate the items and means to reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP . CSRA management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful additional information to investors regarding the company 's financial condition and results of operations as they provide another measure of the company 's profitability and ability to service its debt and are considered important measures by financial analysts covering CSRA . When analyzing CSRA 's performance , investors and securities analysts should evaluate each adjustment in our reconciliation and use pro forma adjusted measures in addition to , and not as an alternative to , GAAP measures . <p> Pro forma adjusted results include a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , non-backlog-related intangibles amortization , recurring elements of pension income , and other costs as if the separation and merger had occurred at the beginning of the period ; and exclude costs directly associated with the separation and merger transactions and the ongoing integration process .

Adjusted EBITDA may not equal the sum of the component figures due to rounding . <p> ( a ) <p> The reconciliation to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the periods ended April 3 , 2015 differs from that used to calculate the periods ended April 1 , 2016 . For example , Losses from continuing operations for the periods ended April 3 , 2015 , incorporate amounts furnished in the Form 8-K dated December 24 , 2015 , derived on the basis described therein . The same profitability measures for the periods ended April 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounting used to prepare GAAP financial information for those periods . <p> ( b ) <p> For the quarter and year ended April- 3 , 2015 , GAAP results reflect the operations of CSRA LLC . <p> ( c ) <p> SRA income prior to November 30 , 2015 merger from the most closely corresponding reporting period , which is January 1 , 2015 to March 31 , 2015 , in the case of the three months ended April 3 , 2015 and April 1 , 2014 to March 31 , 2015 , in the case of the twelve months ended April 3 , 2015 . <p> ( d ) <p> Inter-company income prior to the November 30 , 2015 merger plus costs directly associated with the separation and merger transactions , net of tax ; and one time integration costs . <p> ( e ) <p> Pro-forma EBITDA contribution of SRA acquisition made prior to merger ( revised from amounts furnished in the Form 8-K dated December 24 , 2015 ) . <p> - <p> Free Cash Flow <p> CSRA defines free cash flow as equal to the sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) investing cash flows , excluding business acquisitions , dispositions and investments and ( 3 ) payments on capital leases and other long-term asset financings . Free cash flow is further adjusted for certain non-recurring cash flow items , such as ( i ) separation-related payments and ( ii ) the sale of accounts receivables . Quarterly free cash flow and its components are calculated by subtracting the nine-month values from the 10-Q filed on February 16 , 2016 , from the annual values presented on the year-end statement of cash flows . <p> CSRA INC - <p> Twelve Months Ended <p> - <p> Nine Months Ended <p> - <p> Three Months Ended <p> ( Amounts in millions ) <p> - <p> April 1 , 2016 <p> - <p> January 1 , 2016 <p> - <p> April 1 , 2016 <p> Net cash provided by operating activities <p> $ <p> 554 <p> $ <p> 375 <p> $ <p> 179 <p> Net cash ( used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> - <p> ( 1,551 ) <p> - <p> ( 54 ) <p> Acquisitions , net of cash acquired <p> - <p> 1,472 <p> - <p> 1,473 <p> - <p> ( 1 ) <p> Business dispositions <p> - <p> ( 34 ) <p> - <p> ( 34 ) <p> - <p> " <p> Payments on capital leases and other long- term assets financing <p> - <p> ( 16 ) <p> - <p> ( 13 ) <p> - <p> ( 3 ) <p> Separation-related payments <p> - <p> 80 <p> - <p> 70 <p> - <p> 10 <p> Sale of receivables <p> - <p> ( 172 ) <p> - <p> ( 208 ) <p> - <p> 36 <p> Free cash flow <p> $ <p> 278 <p> $ <p> 112 <p> $ <p> 167 <p> Note : Free cash flow may not equal the sum of the component figures due to rounding . <p> ### <p> About CSRA Inc . <p> CSRA ( NYSE : CSRA ) solves our nation 's hardest mission problems as a bridge from mission and enterprise IT to Next Gen , from government to technology partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thinking , today .
