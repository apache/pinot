For instance , if your maids will be donning chiffon gowns , style your MOH in sequins ! That 's one way to make her ( literally ) shine . You could also dress her in lace or satin .

Opt for a unique hairstyle . <p> It may be a subtle distinction , but if all of your maids are wearing up-dos , allow your MOH the option to wear her hair down , or to the side , or half up and half down . The subtle differentiation between hairstyles will undoubtedly make her stand out and take center stage in a bridal party photo .

From crop tops to cutouts , you 'll love all of the fun elements in this upcoming season . Here are the top 14 trends to look out for as you shop for your perfect formal dress : <h> Top 2016 Prom Trends : <p> 1 . Cutouts- <p> This flirty and flattering detail is present in a lot of this season 's looks . What I love about the emerging collections is there is a lot of variety in the types of cutouts available . Some are very modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of skin , while others are a touch more revealing with a full material cut out . No matter what your comfort level or school 's dress code may be , this trend will definitely be present in a lot of the pieces you shop , and it will be easy to find a style to fit your own style and requirements . <p> - <p> 2 . Sequins- <p> Sequins have been popping up in formal wear for quite a few seasons , and this stunning staple is n't going anywhere yet ! A fun , form-fitting sequin dress is one of my personal favorite styles for a special occasion , and I particularly love La Femme 's selection for this season , as they seamlessly blend sequins with intricate beading in some designs , and also offer head-to-toe sequined floor-length gowns , perfect to catch the twinkling lights on the dance floor . Whether you opt for a cocktail-length style or full-length piece , you 'll feel like a million dollars in one of these standout sequin styles . <p> - <p> 3 . Crop Tops and Two-Piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2016 season , the crop top formal gown has to be my absolute favorite . I always feel ultra feminine and glamorous when I have a bit of my midriff revealed , and I can understand why this trend is showing up in every designer 's collection this season . Rachel Allen 's crop top prom dresses are particularly stunning , and offer some fun prints and embellishments to really make this look stand out . Be sure to take advantage of this trend while it 's still relevant " who knows how long it will stick around for ? <p> - <p> 4 . Floral Prints- <p> I 'm loving the bold floral prints that are emerging in this year 's formal wear collections , with gorgeous red , blue , and fuchsia flowers on voluminous skirts and bodices . Some of these remind me of Mexico City and Frida Kahlo " feminine , dramatic , super unique , and definitely unforgettable . Be sure to check out Sherri Hill and Rachel Allan for some particularly breathtaking prints . <p> - <p> 5 . Unique Beading- <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gowns , 2016 's prom line is very unique , in that there is a lot of geometric and tribal-inspired patterns , as well as edgy silver metallic beading and vintage pearl beading .

Backless styles- <p> Gowns featuring a backless cut are always a fun and flattering option , and this season offers quite a few cuts with this popular feature . One of my favorite combinations is a high-neck halter front with a deep backless cut , letting you show just enough skin without feeling too revealing in the front . <p> - <p> 7 . High necklines- <p> While the sweetheart neckline is a timeless formal wear option , I 'm very fond of the current trend of higher necklines . Many of these designs are either backless , offer cutouts , or utilize sheer fabrics , so they are still very flattering and youthful . I particularly love the bateau and halter necklines that are a part of Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look fabulous with a softly pinned back up-do , to accentuate the details of your bodice . <p> - <p> 8 . Sheer illusion- <p> Present in many bridal designs , it 's great to see sheer illusion detailing making its way into prom dresses this year ! Almost every prom designer will be utilizing this feminine and romantic detail , offering sheer bodices with intricate beading interwoven into the mesh netting . From sequins to lace , there are many variations of embroidery on these sheer illusion dresses , all of which are fashion-forward and flattering to every body type . <p> - <p> 9 . Off-the-shoulder sleeves- <p> A rarely seen and fun sleeve option for someone looking for a truly cutting edge design is an off-the-shoulder dress . Rachel Allan 's 2016 collection offers a few beautiful pieces offering this feature in two-piece crop top styles . I 'm seriously obsessed with this cut , with one design reminding me of a gypsy dancer and another embodying traditional Latin American costuming details . <p> - <p> 10 .

@@43381280 @3381280/ <p> We know , we know . The calendar has barely flipped to 2016 . But for the newly betrothed , wedding planning may mean they 've already got 2017 on the brain . For these folks , we offer a first look into next year 's chicest trends to help ensure a wedding for the ages . You can thank us later . <h> The Top 2017 Wedding Trends <h> The Happy Couple <p> 1 . Nice day for a pink wedding ? Sure , white is timeless and elegant , but perhaps not the best fit for the edgy , modern bride who wants nothing more than to shirk tradition and stand out from the pack . More and more , bridal salons are stocking their racks with gowns in shades of blush pink , dusty blue and beyond , which is why we 're predicting a departure from the traditional white wedding gown in the coming year . Do n't be afraid to show your true colors ! <p> 3 . Crop top ensembles hit it big in 2016 , and I think it 's safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least for the foreseeable future . Two-piece bridal gowns will continue to be seen in the coming year , particularly in the spring and summer as temperatures heat up . Remember to keep it classy and choose styles that show just a sliver of abdomen , with a skirt that sits high on the hips and a top that leans conservative . When it comes to crop top styles , less is definitely more . <p> - <p> 4 . Beachy bohemian will be big in the coming year , thanks to the trendy Raw Coast color palette ( more on that later ) . Think relaxed , flowing lace , drapey fabric off-the-shoulder details and high-low styles . Additionally , expect to see crown braids take the place of those ubiquitous flower crowns . <p> - <p> 5 . This year , dress styles hit peak sexy , with thigh-high Angelina-inspired slits and dramatic plunging necklines . While sexy never goes out of style and will likely continue to be seen in 2017 , we predict a return to traditional styles . With the old becoming new again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes and long-sleeve styles + la Duchess Kate . <p> - <p> 6 . For the most daring of brides , we predict no dress at all . Like the now-iconic Brandon Maxwell creation donned by Lady Gaga at this year 's Oscars , elegantly appointed pants or a craftily caped jumpsuit will flip the classic bridal silhouette on its ear , adding a modern edge . <p> - <p> 7 . Let 's not forget about the groom ! Some brides opt for multiple dresses , so why should n't a groom flaunt his own personal style with separate wedding day looks ? We predict that a few fashion-forward guys will opt for the wardrobe change in 2017 . While a classic dark tuxedo is ideal for the ceremony , guys can let loose for the reception , incorporating a more casual cream jacket or an on-trend pop of color , like a steel blue or a deep marsala . <p> 8 . Speaking of personal style , accessories have long served as a great way to add a bit of personality without disturbing the balance of a classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square have been the gold standard for showing off a groom 's personal style , there 's a new player in town " the lapel pin . In 2017 , we 'll see this luxe topper replace the boutonniere on lapels everywhere . <p> PS . Guys can jump on the mix and match bandwagon as well ! Consider having your guys wear different colored suits to allow them to have their own unique look . As with bridesmaid mix and match dresses , mix and match suits should coordinate when it comes to the tone of color . Think different shades of- brown or different shades of grey ( seen below ! ) <p> 10 . Sequins will break away from the holiday season , infiltrating bridal parties everywhere . Sequined bridesmaid dresses are a fabulous option for jazzing up a neutral color palette , so expect to see more and more of this glittering trend . <h> Florals <p> 11 . The next big thing in wedding florals ? No florals at all . Instead , we 'll see simple arrangements of leave , branches or palms " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic effect , consider incorporating a canopy of greenery that hangs high above guests ' heads . <p> 12 . On the flipside , cascading florals will take hold in 2017 . This look includes an abundance of flora , but with an undone feel , like centerpieces that drift across tables , bouquets that literally overflow with buds , or decorative blooms that cascade down the tiers of the wedding cake . <h> Food &amp; Drink <p> 13 . As we become more thoughtful about our food , next year will see food pairings creep into weddings everywhere . A cute cocktail hour idea ? Pair small bites with similarly themed cocktails , like mini tacos with spicy margaritas , caviar bites with icy cold vodka , or juicy sliders with craft beer . <p> 14 . With more interest than ever in where our food comes from and how it 's grown , we 'll see an uptick in sustainable catering , or using organic and locally sourced food . The result " the freshest , most delicious food for guests , with a much smaller environmental footprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 , with couples opting instead for tiered displays of delectable donuts , whimsical cupcakes or scrumptious macarons . Choose one tasty treat or offer guests a multitude of options with a few mouthwatering sweets to choose from . Forgoing the tedious multi-tiered cake is a great way to save a few bucks , plus it 'll give the couple a chance to jump on board the latest dessert craze ( macaronuts , anyone ? ) . <p> 16 . With the renewed interest in Cuban culture thanks to our newly restored relationship with the nearby island , we 're going to see its influence all over next year 's fashion , including bright , tropical colors galore and flowing flamenco-style frocks . The Cuban-inspired color scheme ( dubbed La Isla by the fashion trend forecasters at the recent MAGIC convention ) boasts deep purple , turquoise blue , tangy tangerine , bright coral , sunshine yellow , flirty fuschia and leafy green amongst its rainbow of colors " all the makings of a super-fun and carefree wedding color palette . Stick with the theme for food and drink with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the beachy bohemian wedding , there 's Raw Coast , another color scheme unveiled at MAGIC , which calls to mind images of the coastline and its natural environs . For weddings , this translates to breezy layers , oodles of linen with maritime-inspired accents like rope or netting details and shades of clay , indigo , stone and olive . <p> 18 . Golden accents will be a huge trend next year , with the metallic tone featured prominently as an accent shade . Think gold vases for the centerpieces , glimmering accents within each tablescape , place cards branded in golden cursive and romantic flickering candles housed in gold candleholders . Cakes will see the trend take hold , too , with all-white cakes bedecked with golden accents , or alternating tiers of white and gold . <h> Invitations <p> 19 . Artisanal invites will be all the rage " think less paper and ink , more wood , metal , leather and fabric . More and more , couples will look to set the tone of the their wedding via this first introduction , skipping traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully handmade creations . Not only are these invites completely unique to the couple , but they lay the groundwork for what 's to come on the big day . <p> 21 . As the world becomes more and more socially conscious , we 'll see charitable donations replace wedding favors . In lieu of the traditional favors , couples will leave guests with notes letting them know that the funds allocated for favors have been donated to their favorite charity . <p> Of course , it 's still early , so stay tuned for more of our predictions for 2017 and beyond ! <h> Comments <p> Your comment about small desserts being less expensive than a cake is very misleading . Every baker I know charges the same for a cupcake as for a slice of cakeand sometimes more . They are more work . French macaroons are a very specialised item with potentially expensive ingredientspistachios , gold leaf , rose water and other gourmet items . Also , they must be made at the last minute , so virtually no early prep can be done . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . At $3 each minimum and planning for guests to eat more than one , that gets more expensive than many cakes very quickly . Your comment was rather insulting , actually . Professional bakers take pride in everything they make . You are assuming that because something is not a wedding cake that it is easier . You go and make 300 macaroons in a day that are beautiful and taste incredible then get back to me to tell me how " cheap " those should be .

After spilling the big news about your engagement , one of your maids-to-be has another big announcement : she 's expecting ! This exciting news may be a bit of a challenge , but with some advice from the Wedding Shoppe 's bridesmaid department , all your bridesmaids will look beautiful standing up to support you , including the mommy-to-be. <h> 9 Tips for the Pregnant Bridesmaid <p> 1 . Your Measurements : Usually when bridesmaid dress shopping , your Personal Shopper will take your bust , waist , and hip measurements . However , if you are currently pregnant or plan to be , a waist measurement is next to useless . Your Personal Shopper will only take your bust and hip measurements , and will probably add on a few inches for future growth . <h> How to measure your bust : <p> Using a tape measure , measure around the widest part of your bust . Make sure the tape measure is straight across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth . <h> How to measure your hips : <p> - <p> - <p> Using a tape measure , measure around the widest part of your hips . This will usually include your bum . <p> 2 . Timing : Generally , bridesmaid dresses are ordered 5-6 months prior to the wedding . Because a pregnant woman 's body can change rather drastically during this time frame , it 's a good idea to wait until as close to the wedding date as possible for your final dress alterations . <p> 3 . Dress Alterations : Speaking of dress alterations , be sure to choose a seamstress or tailor with experience altering dresses for the pregnant body . <p> 4 . Four Months or Under : If you will be four months pregnant or under , you can probably order the same dress as the other bridesmaids a size or two larger . Generally , a dress can be altered down two sizes maximum without changing the style of the dress . For this reason , it 's not a good idea to go up more than two sizes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by far the most flattering dress style for a bridesmaid with a baby bump . Choosing empire waist bridesmaid dresses for all your gals will make it easier for your expecting friend to wear the same dress as everyone else . <p> 6 . Chiffon Fabric : Flowing , chiffon fabric is a flattering choice for all your bridesmaids , and is particularly forgiving for a pregnant bridesmaid . If you do choose a chiffon dress , order an additional yard of liner or plan - to add a gusset- ( a triangle of extra fabric used to let out a garment ) to the liner to accommodate your belly . <p> 7 . Five or More : If you will be five or more months pregnant , maternity bridesmaid dresses are highly recommended . You might struggle to find a style that matches the other maids exactly , but maternity bridesmaid dresses can usually be found in the same color . While potentially inconvenient , maternity bridesmaid dresses are the best way to be certain a pregnant bridesmaid will be comfortable . <p> 8 .

Back to Month Five : If you will be a bridesmaid recently after giving birth , many of the tips above for bridesmaid dress shopping are still applicable . If you will have just delivered , expect to be the same size as you were at 5 months pregnant . If you have enough advance notice , it can actually be really convenient to get measured and order your dress when you are 5 months along . <p> 11 . Breastfeeding : If you will be breastfeeding , allow for several extra inches in the bust . If you 'll need to slip away during the wedding to pump or to feed your little one , keep that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a halter you can untie or unfasten . <p> 12 . Avoid Temptation : If it will be a few months after your due date , do n't be tempted to order in your pre-pregnancy size . Instead , order a size or two above to be safe " trust us , even the most motivated of new moms may take more time than they expect to lose the baby weight . <p> 13 . Be Realistic : Seriously , it 's much easier to take dresses in , than to let them out . Be generous with the amount you expect to gain , and realistic about the amount you think you 'll lose . <h> Considering being a pregnant bridesmaid ? Here 's our advice : <p> 14 . Know When to Say No : Do n't feel obligated to be a bridesmaid if you 're at all concerned about fulfilling the duties , your energy level , your availability , or your health .

They have experience measuring and choosing dress styles that will work for your body . <p> 16 . Trying to Conceive : Are you a bridesmaid considering becoming pregnant ?

This technique creates a small patch of lace , to which more patches of lace can be attached with the use of small joining stitches , in order to create a large piece of lacework .

You will be walking down the aisle , sitting in the front row , dancing in front of a crowd , and mingling with every guest . You need to find an outfit that fits your important role . I 've done my research and compiled a list of ten things every woman should consider when shopping for mother of the bride dresses . I know this shopping trip is an important one , so take a deep breath ( maybe a few notes ) and consider the following . <h> 10 tips for shopping mother of the bride or mother of the groom dresses . <h> 1 . Let the MOB choose her look first . <p> According to wedding etiquette , the MOB gets to shop for her look before the mother of the groom . But have you considered shopping together ? Sounds like a bonding experience to me ! <h> 2 . The length of your dresses should match . <p> If you decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match the length of her dress to the MOB . Length can often determine formality , and it will also look better in family wedding photos . <h> 3 . Coordinate with or match the maids . <p> I highly recommend bringing a swatch from the bridesmaid dresses when you shop . It 's important that the color of your gown complements the bridal party dresses . If you want to match , consider designers who have bridesmaids and mothers collections . Jordan and Mori Lee dresses are stunning styles to consider . <p> Many mothers shop for their wedding look at large department stores , but for a dress this important I recommend looking at smaller bridal shops . Book an appointment with the Wedding Shoppe and get the attention you need and deserve. - ( Make an appointment by calling 651-298-1144 ! ) <h> 5 . Find affordable designers . <p> This dress is going to be an important purchase , but remember that this is n't a bridal gown ! Your wedding day look should be both fashionable and affordable . Consider VM by Mori Lee dresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I guarantee you 'll save a few pennies. <h> 6 . Comfort should always come before fashion . <p> You are going to find plenty of lovely looks for your child 's wedding , so do n't buy anything that is n't comfortable . This is going to be a long , busy day . If you 're not able to move your arms , sit comfortably , or bend over , you will regret choosing fashion over a comfy fit . Have you considered mother of the bride pant suits ? <h> 7 . Get the go-ahead before choosing black . <p> Black goes with everything , but it may not work with the bride 's wedding theme . If black is one of the wedding colors , go for it . If not , consult with your bride . <h> 8 . Some moms are wearing white is this O.K ? <p> It 's on trend for the mother of the bride to , yes , match her bride ! Many maids are wearing ivory , white , or champagne bridesmaid dresses to match their leading lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white may be an option . Just consult with the bride first . <h> 9. - Take it easy on the bling . <p> A little sparkle never hurt anyone , but do n't go crazy with embellishments and accessories . You deserve to look beautiful , but the focus should be kept on the bride . <h> 10 . The key is to keep in touch with the bride . <p> It may be your dress , but it 's the bride 's big day . Keep her involved in the shopping process and get her opinion when it 's time to purchase . If you and the bride are both happy , you may just have a winning dress in your hands .

Every girl knows which neckline works best for their bust . I personally hate strapless dresses due to the lack of support , but so many brides go with this style ! Would n't you love the chance to choose your own neckline , but still create a cohesive look ? <h> Which designers are following this week 's wedding trends ? <p> If you 're going to mix and match necklines , I 'd look through the collections from Kennedy Blue and Alfred Sung . Both designers have a wide variety of styles featuring various necklines that your maids would love to look through . They also have an array of colors to choose from , making them even more ideal for your wedding plans . 30529 @qwx440529

She was looking for a specific color that covered what she wanted covered and slimed her in all the right places . After trying on about 400 traditional dresses , she ended with a cute chiffon number that allowed her to wear great support undergarments .

@@43381431 @3381431/ <h> Dupioni Silk Fabric <p> Sometimes known as dupion or douppioni , dupioni silk is created with the threads from two different silkworms . When two worms spin their cocoons close together , the fibers get tangled up ; these naturally tangled fibers are then used together to make the silk thread . The thread is rougher than regular silk , and contains bumps and irregularities where the fibers from the two dupionicocoons are combined . Silk takes dye well and is usually easy to sew . <p> Silkdupionihas an advantage over some other types of silks , in that it tends to resist wrinkles , which helps to enhance the usability of the finished fabric . In addition , silkdupioni also has a tendency to take creases very well , which can give the final product a crisp and formal appearance . As an added bonus , the fabric is totally reversible , so it is perfectly acceptable for both sides of the material to be visible . <p> At the same time , dupioni silkdoes have a couple of drawbacks . The material has almost no stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be very exact in the measurements before cutting out any pattern .

When washed by hand , there is the chance of some shrinkage , and the fabric will most likely lose some of the crisp texture and a portion of the shimmering effect . For finished products constructed with silk dupioni , dry cleaningis definitely the best means of freshening up the material .

Behold , our newest wedding gown designer : Calla Blanche ! <h> NEW &amp; Noteworthy : Calla Blanche Wedding Dresses <h> Who is Calla Blanche ? <p> Basic , be damned . Kicking boring to the curb , the designers at the Toronto-based brand take pride in their ability to offer continually updated looks each season to keep brides on the cutting edge of wedding style . <p> With its fashion-forward approach , Calla Blanche is the go-to brand for the bride who embraces trends and knows how to integrate them into her own personal style . <p> That 's not to say that tradition is thrown out the window entirely . Each design begins with a classic silhouette " including A-line , sheath , mermaid , ball gown and more " at its foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the designer treatment in a flurry of fabrics and of-the-moment flourishes , transforming the conventional cut into a modern-day work of art . <p> In addition to the runway-ready style , another of the brand 's major selling points is its red-hot sex appeal . For the bride looking to majorly up the va-va-voom , Calla Blanche designs boast sexy flashes of skin and shapes that hug every feminine curve for the bride who wants to stand out , not blend in . Bust-hugging bodices , down-to-there V-necks , thigh-high slits , booty-grazing contours and wide-open backs " made tasteful , not salacious " are par for the course . <p> Perhaps the best part is the price tag .

This little lady is usually between the ages of 8-16 ; not quite old enough to be a full-fledged bridesmaid , but too old to be considered a flower girl . Many couples will choose to honor sisters , nieces , children of attendants , or their own children with this special title . Today on My Wedding Chat , were answering a few of your questions about junior bridesmaids . <h> What is a junior bridesmaid expected to do ? <p> A junior bridesmaid can be given several duties to help them feel like an important member of your wedding party . These special little ladies can help other bridesmaids with planning the bridal shower , making favors , and cleaning up after events . She should attend events like the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner , but not the bachelorette party ( unless you 're doing a spa day or something age-appropriate for her to attend ) . Your junior bridesmaid might help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs , or other small things .

Some designers will even carry a range of dress sizes intentionally for this purpose . However , it is not necessary for your junior maid to match your full-fledged attendants , just like it is n't necessary for any of your bridesmaids to match ! Choosing not to have matching dresses can help your ladies to feel more distinctive and comfortable on your special day . One thing you should keep in mind when shopping for junior bridesmaid dresses is modesty . Younger ladies should dress for their age , which might mean having a seamstress alter a bridesmaid dress to be more appropriate . <h> What are a few good ideas for junior bridesmaid gifts ? <p> Depending on the age of your junior maid , you can use the same bridesmaid gifts that the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't a flask or something too adult ) .

If you get her something completely different , though , she might feel left out . <p> If your junior lady is much younger or your bridesmaid gifts truly are n't  appropriate for her , another idea to consider is something personalized for her , like a frame for her to remember the day by , or a certificate for the two of you to do something fun together ! 30527 @qwx440527

Measuring about 30 inches long , this veil is very versatile , and can be worn in both semi-formal and formal weddings . <p> Elbow length veils can be single or double layered . A double layer veil will be fuller than a single layer veil , due to the bulk of the fabric , and the top layer is typically shorter than the bottom layer to create visual interest and/or to be used as a blusher . <h> Examples of a bridal elbow veil <p> Because of where elbow length veils hit the body , they are ideal for brides who want to highlight the skirt of their bridal gown . The break created by the bottom of the veil will draw the eye to the skirt , so elbow length veils would be perfect paired with dramatic skirts . Unlike longer styles , this length wont cover up the back of the dress or any part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be put on display . <p> As always , when choosing a veil , take into consideration your bridal gown . If its simple or classic with clean lines , a more elaborate veil might be appropriate .

Any non-military members will be wearing formal attire , so it can work well to have a mixture of military dress uniforms and formal wear on both sides of the aisle . However , it can also look striking to have bridesmaids in navy or green dresses that match the uniform color ( or colors ) of the groomsmen . <p> Keep in mind when planning , that boutonnieres are never worn with military dress uniforms , so only order them for civilian party members . <p> Finally , while it is expected of grooms to wear military dress uniforms , brides have more flexibility .

The length of flyaway wedding veils just brushes the shoulders , and as the name suggests , the tulle used in a flyaway veil typically has a stiffer quality than other styles of wedding veils , allowing the flyaway veil to " fly away " from the wearer , adding volume and a little bit of " poof " . <p> The flyaway veil is typically considered a more informal wedding veil style , most commonly seen paired with an informal wedding dress .

We 're here to help ! <p> With fresh offerings from Alfred Sung and Allure here at the Wedding Shoppe , brides have more options than ever for working the trend into their bridal party dressing . Read on for our tips and tricks for outfitting your maids in our newest floral frocks . Tips include our advice on choosing the right fit , how to coordinate shades , selecting the right accessories and much , much more . <h> Floral Print Bridesmaid Dresses : Taking on the Trend <h> How to Style : <p> First , decide which of your gal pals should wear the print . With an oversized pattern or an extra-bright color combo , dressing the entire bridal party in identical prints may be a bit over the top for the more modest bride . <p> If this sounds like you , try dressing just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mix-and-match bandwagon " another trend that shows no signs of slowing down " and outfit your girls in complementary floral print and monochromatic dresses , alternating as you go down the line . <p> Are you all in ? Let your besties be the statement piece in your wedding with bold florals across the board . <p> If you choose to mix and match , take note : There 's a certain art to it that can make or break your bridal party look . The key is to choose your print , then build around it . For example , take this Alfred Sung D724CP style in White Bouquet . <p> - <p> The floor-length gown , a strapless sateen twill stunner ( bonus points for the pockets ! ) , features oversized watercolor blooms in various shades of blue on a stark white backdrop . <p> With that color scheme in mind , start mixing . Choose a dress of the same length in a similar cut and fabric , opting for a shade that complements the blue hues of the print , like cobalt or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride ! ) . <p> While the logical pairing for a mix-and-match party would be a similar silhouette in a neutral taupe to complement the print 's brownish notes , I might also consider matching it with a monochromatic baby pink for a sea of springtime pastels . After all , I 'm not one to shy away from color ! <p> Just remember the cardinal rules : If you 're mixing and matching , choose one color family and stick to it . <p> If your print is multi-hued , pull out one shade and opt for coordinating dresses that complement that single note . And finally , maintain consistency across styles and dress length ; do n't mix an A-line silhouette with a fit-and-flare , and choose short orlong styles , but definitely not both . <p> As for the cut , be sure to opt for an A-line shape when choosing your floral-print frocks . With the heavy hand of the pattern , it 's best to stick with a simple , unfettered silhouette so as not to create a hot mess of visual effects . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on nearly everyone , as it accentuates the waist " the smallest part of the body " and covers what every gal wants covered down below . Trust us , your maids will thank you . <p> Finally , you 'll need to decide what type of feel you 're going for based on the location and theme of your wedding , and narrow down your style accordingly . <p> For an afternoon garden party , shorter styles are ideal , while a black-tie bonanza demands a floor-length gown . If your big day boasts a bohemian theme , opt for picks in flowing chiffon for a relaxed , effortless air ; conversely , choose structured satin for a formal affair . <h> How to Accessorize : <p> Pairing these daring designs with plain Jane accessories may seem like the safe choice , but it 's far less necessary than you might think , provided you style with care . <p> The majority of these dresses are strapless , so add a statement necklace in shiny metallic or a single coordinating tone for a fashion-forward touch . Just be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clashing situation and you 'll be just fine . <p> If statement pieces are n't your cup of tea , well , to each her own . At the end of the day , you ca n't go wrong with simple but gorgeous accouterments , like a silvery pendant necklace or a pair of elegant studs . Or you can opt for no jewelry at all , and let the prints speak for themselves ! <p> A belt or sash is another chic addition for the bride who wants to infuse a bit of personal style . Choose a simple , solid-colored belt in a coordinating shade , or get creative and cut your own sashes from a length of satin ribbon . As an added bonus , the waistline accessory will cinch the middle , creating a flattering shape that your girls will love . <p> As for the shoes , a neutral or metallic shoe will work just fine with these audacious prints , but why not kick things up a notch ? <p> Since the current trend encourages brides to make loud and proud color choices for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brightly hued statement shoe with a knee- or tea-length dress . <p> Take the Allure 1439 short style in pink/yellow , for example . A strappy sandal in a sunny yellow would help play up the subtle buttery notes in the print , do n't you think ? Or pair the tea-length Alfred Sung D722FP with a fiery red stiletto to make those scarlet blooms really pop . <p> - <h> How to Choose a Bouquet : <p> Just because your bridal party is covered in blooms does n't mean you need to forgo real flora . The key is to keep it simple . Choose one classic bloom , like hydrangeas or roses , and bundle em into a small cluster . <p> When in doubt , go white , but ultimately the choice is yours . In some cases , a single , understated color can harmonize nicely with your pattern of choice . With the Allure 1436 , for example , a baby pink bloom like a blush peony is the perfect complement to the gown 's varying light and dark pink shades . <p> - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may also want to try corsages or fans if you do n't want to overwhelm your bridal party with flowers and greenery . <p> Now that you 've got all the tools you 'll need to dress your bridesmaids in stunning florals for your upcoming nuptials , how will you style your girls ? 
@@43381523 @3381523/ <p> Outdoor weddings are beautiful and timeless . Many couples choose to have an outdoor wedding at the place they first met , to be closer to nature , for the lovely pictures , or because outdoor wedding venues tend to be more affordable . However , you must plan carefully when choosing a bridal gown for an outdoor wedding , because there are several evil forces of nature out to get your precious outdoor wedding dress ! <p> photo by A. Whitmore Photography <h> Protect your outdoor wedding dress from these culprits : <p> 1 . Heat : A summer wedding dress , or a destination wedding dress if you 're going someplace where the weather is usually hot , should be a light material , such as linen , organdy , or chiffon . Consider choosing a bridal gown that is tea-length and strapless for optimal heat stroke-avoidance . Bonus tip : Make sure you wear waterproof make-up , so it does n't  run if you 're sweating ! <p> 2 . Cold : A winter wedding dress needs to be a warm material , such as velvet or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart set on a short-sleeved or strapless bridal gown , pick out a furry shawl or warm bolero jacket . You do n't  want to be shivering so badly you cant say your vows ! <p> 3 . Dirt/Sand : Especially when shopping for a beach wedding dress , avoid ball gowns and long trains to minimize dragging your dress through the dirt or sand . Consider an ankle-length or tea-length bridal gown to better your chances of keeping the bottom of your dress dirt-free . Bonus tip : Its difficult to walk in heels on grass , and even more difficult on sand . Solemates help for most outdoor weddings , but choose flats or just go barefoot with a beach wedding dress . <p> 4 . Rain ( and other precipitation ) : Even if your wedding day is the driest of the year , be prepared for seasonal precipitation . This might mean having umbrellas for the wedding party , a canopy , or an alternate location ready . You may even want to have a plastic tarp or large rain jacket to protect your dress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding dress , or a gown for another windy location , avoid ball gowns . Its easy for the wind to get caught underneath the big skirt , and you do n't  want your dress flipping over your head in front of all your friends and relatives ! Also avoid long trains and veils ; they are easily blown about by the wind and might ruin photographs , or worse . Bonus tip : Plan for the wind when- you choose your wedding hairstyle . Have your stylist secure your hairdo so the wind wont ruin it , and decide whether leaving it down is worth the risk of having your hair blowing in your face . <p> 6 . Wildlife : A beach wedding dress could easily fall victim to seagull droppings , and any outdoor wedding risks falling prey to the terrors of mosquitoes and other bugs . Consider a canopy to protect yourself during a beach wedding . Check your locations bug population at night before settling on it , and light citronella candles to ward off mosquitoes if necessary . <p> 7 . Night : Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night away under the stars sounds so romantic ! However , consider if that 's worth potentially sacrificing the quality of your photographs . Flash photographs typically are n't  as pretty as naturally-lighted ones . Talk this over with your wedding photographer . Not to mention , you wont be showing off your dress as much in the dark ! <p> 8 . Sun : On the other hand , an outdoor wedding during the middle of the day presents its own challenges . If you 're going to be outside all day , make sure you wear and bring along plenty of sunscreen . You do n't  want to look like a lobster halfway through your wedding album ! Illusion necklines and sleeves can add a little extra skin protection without making you too hot . Bonus tip : Bring sunglasses for a fun photo op with the wedding party , but make sure you wont NEED to wear them . You 'll want most of your wedding photos with your whole beautiful face showing ! <p> 9 . Bathroom Options : Major downside of an outdoor wedding ? Your bathroom options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may have to share restrooms with the public ( and who knows how clean theyll be ? ) . An unconventional outdoor location means you 'll have to bring in portable bathrooms . Either way , choose your wedding gown accordingly ; a large skirt that you ca n't lift yourself will be pretty much impossible to fit in an outdoor bathroom option . <p> 10 . Wedding Crashers : Everyone loves the Owen Wilson-Vince Vaughn movie , but real wedding crashers at your wedding ? Not so enjoyable . If you 're celebrating have your wedding in a public place , there 's the chance that strangers will be around during your wedding . While they can usually be edited out of the background of wedding photos , you might find yourself providing food and drinks to a few unplanned guests .

@@43381538 @3381538/ <p> With the average wedding costing just over $30,000 these days , brides are often looking for crafty ways to cut down on their budget wherever possible . Many vendors know they can upcharge for their services , and brides can easily get taken if they are n't savvy spenders . Did you know more than 45% of couples go over their planned budget ? <p> Sure , many people can easily spend upwards of $50,000 on their big day , but it 's seriously a waste of money if you are able to get creative and think outside of the box a bit . Remember : this is just one day of your life and you do n't want to start out your marriage in financial ruin because you decided you needed to have peonies , a grand ballroom at the Ritz , and a horse-drawn carriage . <h> 37 Ways to Trim Thousands off Your Wedding Budget <p> I 've compiled a list of 37 ways to save money on your nuptials ; you do n't have to use every tip , but utilizing even just 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your big day ! <p> 1 . Keep your guest list small . With catering costs at about $68 a person , the difference between inviting 120 or 150 guests can cost you a couple thousand dollars . If there are any unfamiliar business associates of your parents , long-lost relatives whom you have n't seen in 20 years , or anyone else that you would n't truly miss on your big day , they probably wo n't be offended if they do n't receive an invite . I have a few friends who have not extended an invitation to me for their nuptials , but I ca n't say I 've been upset over it , because I know how pricey occasions like these can be . <p> 2 . Do n't break the bank on your dress . It 's a myth that a gorgeous gown has to cost a small fortune . You 'd be pleasantly surprised by some of the beautiful , affordable designs on the market today , and the Wedding Shoppe actually offers a good variety of designs in the $500-$1000 price point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheri Bridals , Alfred Angelo , and Blu by Mori Lee . <p> 3 . Shop sample sales . You can save thousands of dollars on gorgeous designer dresses by shopping the out-of-season floor samples . My older sister was able to score her designer bridal dress for a seriously great deal at a sample sale , and it suited her perfectly . Call up your local dress shop to find out if they have any sample sales coming up . Be sure to research ahead of time and know exactly what silhouette , fabric , and designer you are interested in , since you 'll need to make your decision quickly on these sale days . <p> 4 . Do n't buy two bridal dresses . Many brides are now buying two designs for their ceremony and reception , however this can be a significantly large added cost for most women . Instead of purchasing two separate dresses and totally blowing your budget , try shopping for a cocktail length or tea-length dress , then add a full skirt over it . Many designers like Tara Keely even offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one dress . <p> 5 . Host your event on a Friday or Sunday . By skipping Saturday receptions , you can automatically trim thousands off your venue rental . Try throwing your celebration on Memorial Day weekend or another 3-day weekend ; this way , you can host a Sunday ceremony and people still have the next day off of work ! <p> 6 . Skip the seated dinner . One of the most expensive aspects of your big day will be catering . A great option for casual daytime receptions is passed hors d'oeuvres with a generously appointed appetizer station . You can also offer cocktails and a cake cutting ceremony , too . You 'll easily save thousands on a plated dinner and your guests will enjoy all of the delicious nibbles . <p> 7 . Find a venue that is flexible with your vendor and catering options . When choosing your venue , be sure to find out if they allow outside vendors to operate on their premises . Venues with fixed vendor lists essentially offer a monopoly to the bride , not giving you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you can choose your own photographers , caterers , etc. , it will be easier to customize everything to your taste and budgetary needs , and you may even be able to bring in your own alcohol and bartender , saving you even more money . <p> 8 . Get creative with your cake and desserts . As we all know , wedding cakes are insanely overpriced . One of my favorite tricks that I 've seen friends do at their receptions is to order a small one or two tiered cake for the bride and groom to cut into , then have a large sheet cake in the back , which can be cut and served to guests . Nobody will ever know your smart secret , and everyone will still get a delicious slice of cake ! Many couples are even foregoing the cake altogether and opting for a dessert station equipped with tasty macarons , cupcakes , cookies , and other sweet treats . Often homemade ! <p> 10 . Opt for a digital photography package . Many professional photographers will charge an arm and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ask for your photographer to just provide you with a digital package of edited photos . You 'll save hundreds ( sometimes thousands ) off of the photographer 's prints , and you can use one of many online services to make your perfect , personalized book at a fraction of the cost . <p> 11 . Skip the professional hair and makeup . If Kate Middleton can do her own bridal makeup , you can too ! <p> Okay , this tip is really only for those who are actually adept at cosmetology . <p> For my best friend 's marriage , she went to a few makeup trials , but was unhappy with the results each time . The makeup was too heavy and she did n't feel like herself , so I volunteered to do her hair and makeup . I knew her taste and I know a thing or two about styling , so I felt comfortable enough doing this . I gave her a simple curled updo , which looked gorgeous with her veil . For her makeup products , we went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect products for the occasion , and she was able to keep all of the makeup after , too ! Once again , only do this if you are comfortable applying makeup and styling hair ; otherwise , this is definitely something worth paying a bit extra for . <p> 12 . Have a daytime ceremony and reception . You can honestly save thousands if you like the idea of a brunch or afternoon tea reception . Event spaces will charge less for use of their space in the daytime , and catering will be significantly less expensive , too . You can also get away with just serving mimosas and save on the open bar . <p> 13 . Make your own bands . Not only is this idea adorable , it is extremely creative and makes for a memorable experience , too . There are many studios across the country that offer couples the opportunity to create their own wedding bands by hand . You 'll save money on your jewelry too , as many engagement ring stores upcharge their inventory by ludicrous amounts . <p> 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you only have to pay for one venue , that 's a pretty easy way to save ! Not only will it cost less , but your guests wo n't have to worry about hauling themselves across town to get from one place to the next . This will save on transportation costs for everyone , and will take away stress from your celebration , too . <p> 15 . Skip the open bar . Okay , before you start freaking out , I 'm not suggesting you offer a cash bar or no liquor at all . A great option that many couples are opting for is to provide wine , beer , and one or two specialty cocktails . This can save you a good chunk of change , and your guests will still have access to tasty libations during your party . See if your venue allows you to bring your own liquor in , and shop for all of your supplies at a discount liquor store . <p> 16 . Block off a set of hotel rooms for a discounted bulk rate . Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels will offer group discounts if you block off a set of rooms for your party . You can include this information on your official wedding website , so guests can call the hotel and book a room under your group rate . <p> 17 . Use your creative friends for DIY projects ! Yes , DIY can be stressful if you decide to take on a bunch of projects on your own , but if you enlist your trusty bridesmaids , friends , and family to help , making some decorations from scratch can be a fun activity and will save you some serious dough , too . <p> 18 . Hit up your local wholesale flower market or farmer 's market . Your DIY-savvy group definitely comes in handy on this one , too . If you are on a serious budget but do n't want to give up having beautiful flowers , you could opt to do your own arrangements . Be warned , though : this is a time-consuming and stressful operation if you are ill-prepared for this or if you do n't allocate proper time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bridesmaids together right before your nuptials to do a floral assembly line , you could save hundreds of dollars by purchasing your flowers directly from a wholesale flower market . <p> 19 . Book an off-season date . If you are flexible with dates , consider having a late autumn or winter ceremony . Venues will generally have more openings and may be willing to come down on their prices if demand is low . <p> 20 . Do n't pay for a full-service coordinator . Most of the time , all you will need is a day-of coordinator . If you have people in your life who are hyper-organized and committed to making your day perfect , it 's definitely possible to get by without one , but having someone looking over all of your details on your big day will take a lot of stress off of you and will allow you to enjoy your special celebration . <p> 21 . Look into free or low-cost venues . Looking for an affordable or free place to host your celebration ? While it 's difficult to find , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for outdoor enthusiasts , and provide gorgeous backdrops for photos , too . Or you could call on a friend or family member with a large house to host your reception at . Be sure to keep in mind linens and furniture rentals will be an added cost if you go this route , so you 'll want to compare the added costs of vendors decorating a place from scratch vs. a full-service venue . <p> 22 . Get creative with wedding favors for guests . Favors can quickly become expensive , especially if you are hosting a large celebration . Most people do n't expect a favor , but if you are insistent on providing your guests with a small token , try to budget no more than $3 per person . Some great , economical options are a self-serve candy bar area , or a code to a digital download with the couple 's favorite tunes . <p> 23 . Utilize your friends and family who offer creative services . Do you have a cousin who is an aspiring photographer ? Maybe he 'd like to take photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your best friend a graphic designer ? Hello , personalized invites ! Maybe your circle of friends has a band , seamstress , baker , singer , officiant , or other creative genius . Not only will your loved ones be thrilled to provide services to you , they 'll likely be willing to give you a lower price than other professionals . They 'll appreciate the business and will be honored to take part in your big day , and your money will be supporting a creative freelancer ! <p> 24 . Ask your vendors for any freebies . If you are paying thousands of dollars for flowers , ask if your florist is willing to include the groom 's boutonniere for free . Or perhaps your venue will include an extra hour of set-up time in the beginning . The more you are spending , the more bargaining power you generally have . <p> 25 . Choose a venue with included amenities . Look for event spaces that provide linens , chairs , tables , and wait staff . This will help you save money on small add-ons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 26 . Choose a buffet style dinner instead of plated dinner . Buffets are a great route to go , as food costs are generally lower with buffets . Be sure to have a catering person manning the stations and serving people their food , as portions can easily get out of control with people serving themselves . <p> 27 . Re-sell your items afterwards . If you spent a small fortune on decorations or your dress , much of this can be re-sold online to other brides looking for a deal . As long as you are n't attached to these items , it 's a great way to make back a bit of money after your big day . <p> 28 . Skip the engagement party and day-after brunch . With so many events from the engagement party , bachelor party , bachelorette party , bridal shower , rehearsal dinner , and morning-after brunch , it 's easy to see how things can get to be so expensive ! Try to skip the unnecessary events ; by eliminating the engagement party and morning-after brunch , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event space costs . <p> 29 . Save on postage and paper . While many people still like to send invitations via snail mail , you can save a bit of money by issuing your save-the-dates by email . You can also save a small fortune by foregoing paper RSVPs and have your guests RSVP through your wedding website . <p> 31 . Look into renting an estate or villa . I 've always loved the idea of renting a large villa for a few nights and letting my close friends and family stay in the house before and after the celebration . The amount you would spend on a venue for a few hours would likely be the same as renting a large house for a few days , and you 'd have time to set up and decorate just as you like ( plus , you 'd save on hotel costs ! ) Just be sure to check with the owners of the home that you are able to host a celebration there , otherwise it may cause some issues if you do n't communicate with them ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play processional music . Contact your local university 's classical music department and see if they could recommend their favorite music students to provide processional music for your big day . They 'll cost a fraction of professional musicians , but they will be thrilled for the performance opportunity and many university music students are extremely talented and capable musicians already ! <p> 33 . Take your honeymoon a few months afterwards . Many couples are choosing to wait a bit before taking a costly 7-day honeymoon trip across the world . Rent out a local hotel suite for a night or two and pop a bottle of champagne to celebrate in the meantime . You 'll thank yourself that you waited a while , and you 'll feel less guilty about splurging on your honeymoon if you are a bit more financially stable . <p> 34 . Choose a DJ over a live band . On average , DJs cost less than half what a live band will charge you . Find someone who is willing to play music that is suited to your taste , and do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or YMCA from the playlist . <p> 35 . Keep your bridal party small . These days , it is customary to give your bridesmaids and groomsmen a small gift to show appreciation for their participation . If you have 10 bridesmaids and 10 groomsmen , you 'll be purchasing 20 gifts for your attendants ! Try to only include your very best friends in the party ( who will still be in your life in 5-10 years ? ) and you can opt for homemade gifts . I 've helped knit wool scarves for bridesmaid gifts before , and it was a heartfelt and appreciated token . <p> 36 . Skip some of the unnecessary pre-wedding pampering . While a manicure and pedicure may be important services to feel groomed and pretty , you probably do n't need a massage right before your ceremony ( keep that for the honeymoon ! ) Try to eliminate any extra grooming services that are n't required , as salon treatments can add up very quickly . <p> 37 . Remember your bridesmaids ' budgets , too ! Did you know that participating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $1,700 or more ? From hosting the bridal shower and throwing the bachelorette party , to purchasing a bridesmaid dress , accessories , hotel costs , beauty services , and more , it is expensive to be a bridesmaid ! Be sure to provide your ladies with fun , affordable , and versatile choices for their gowns . They 'll be sure to appreciate your consideration of their budgets . <p> Some of my favorite designers at the Wedding Shoppe for budget-conscious but fashionable styles are Kennedy Blue , Bill Levkoff , and Allure . <p> There are so many other ways to save big " just remember to shop around , explore your options , and never feel pressured into making a big purchase without being sure of your decision ! <h> Comments <p> Having a wedding on a grew day weekend is about the most inconsiderate thing I can think of .

We wanted to go but could n't find a babysitter because everyone was out of town for the holiday . Since kids werent invited we could n't make it to the wedding . That was probably not something that the couple even considered . Overall I think its a bad idea to have a wedding on a holiday weekend because it does force guests to chose between their wedding and what may be long standing plans on holidays . <p> I have to disagree with Laura and Josephine . Your wedding will only happen once people can go camping next year . Why should the bride and groom not save money because you do n't  want to miss one year of a family tradition ? That 's just as selfish <p> This was all great info . I had no idea that you could make your own wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding and I can assure you we have considered people with families/obligations but its our day to be selfish and if our friends and family want to be there they will . If not then we save money by having those that do n't  want to be there skip out . Weddings are meant to celebrate our union not to be worried about others problems . A bride and a groom have enough to worry about . <p> I liked some of the cost saving tips . We 've already taken advantage of off season rates . That saved on venue , limo , and photographer . We seriously considered a Friday wedding , but took into consideration the traffic in the area on a work day ( did not think of it until we went there to sign the contract on a Friday ) and would rather not risk anyone being stuck in traffic . It would not be worth the 200 saved if the minister , musician , parents , or even guests was sitting in traffic made worse by a fender bender . In regards to holiday weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , but we already made plans . " Roughly 20 -30% of invited guests do n't  go . Just be courteous and RSVP . Just because you 're invited does n't  mean you have to attend .

If your " Traditional camping trip " is so very important that you 'll be indignant about missing it PER YOUR DECISION , well maybe just stay home , cuz yall do n't  sound like you 're much fun at parties anyway . <p> I agree with Laura . And for those of you who say its easy to " just say no " , its NOT easy . If you say you have other plans then you 're scrutinized by the family and the couple . I 've said no before for a wedding on a Friday because I had started a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day off and risk a " strike " . A year later the family is still pissed we did n't  go ( and mention it frequently ) . Also , I do n't  agree that a wedding is JUST about the couple .

We 're so happy for Prince William and Kate Middleton , but it 's not just because they 're celebrities . We love all babies , and have recently welcomed a few bundles of joy to the Wedding Shoppe family ! To celebrate , we 've compiled some advice on how to prepare for your wedding when you 're expecting your own little prince or princess ! <h> Expecting and engaged ? Congratulations " times two ! <h> Here 's some advice for getting the most out of your celebrations as a pregnant bride : <p> 1 . Timing is Everything : If possible , try to schedule your wedding during your second trimester . By this point , hopefully the worst of your symptoms will be gone , but you wo n't yet feel like you 're hauling a watermelon onto the dance floor with you . Being a pregnant bride means you have double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . A morning or daytime wedding might be more up your alley if you tend to get tired as the day goes on . <p> 2 . White or Wrong : The traditional white wedding dress was first worn by Queen Victoria , and was originally a symbol of wealth and fashion . Over time , white came to have a moral overtone , but today it is simply popular and traditional . If you want to wear white for your wedding , then you absolutely should ! <p> 3 . Choosing the Gown : There are many lovely styles of maternity bridal gowns for you to choose from . Generally , empire waist dresses will be your best friends . Not only do empire waist dresses give you room to grow , but they also tend to be made of lighter fabrics , which will keep you from overheating . Consider fuller maternity bridal gowns rather than form-fitting - ones , as looser styles will be easier to alter . While you certainly can , be careful if you choose to go big with a ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one when you do n't have to go every 20 minutes ! <p> 4 . Expect Alterations : Whatever style of maternity bridal gowns you choose , expect to have alterations right up to your wedding . Part of why empire waist dresses are so perfect is they are usually made with loose , flowing fabric that will require the least amount of alterations . Because you can not predict how quickly you 'll grow , or exactly where , you 'll want to schedule your last fitting as close to your wedding date as your seamstress is comfortable with . <p> 5 . Lower the Heels : While shoes are definitely one of the most fun bridal accessories to choose , you 'll want to play it safe . Your center of balance is shifted when you 're expecting , so heels can actually be rather dangerous , not to mention uncomfortable . Also be prepared for your feet to swell or grow . A good plan is to stick to flats and purchase the winning pair close to the big day . <p> 6 . One Ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet that are affected during pregnancy " your fingers might also swell . Consider having a second fake ' ring created for your ceremony and the duration of your pregnancy that 's fitted to your swollen fingers . Store the real ring or wear it on a necklace until your fingers are back to normal . <p> 7 . Skip the Seafood : Be sure to discuss with your caterer the need for pregnancy-safe foods . This means no undercooked or raw eggs or meats- and no unpasteurized cheeses or dairy products . Hot dogs and deli meat need to be nitrate-free and heated to steaming , and it 's also a good idea to avoid high-mercury fish . Talk to your doctor for a more extensive list of what foods to avoid during pregnancy , and convey that information to your caterer so you can enjoy your wedding feast worry-free ! <p> Photo by Coppersmith Photography <p> 8 . Drink Ahead : An open bar ( or at least champagne ) is practically expected at weddings . However , being a pregnant bride means you wo n't be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , make sure that there are tasty beverages available sans alcohol . It 's extremely important you stay hydrated , so lots of water is also necessary . <p> 9 . Have a Safe Getaway : Depending on where you 're having your honeymoon and how far along you 'll be , check with airlines before booking flights to make sure they 'll let you fly . Flying while pregnant can be dangerous and many airlines will restrict how far along you can be and how long of a flight you can take ( for your safety ) . If you 're struggling , consider a romantic train trip or plan your honeymoon for when you 'll need a break from baby . <p> Remember to take breaks on your big day !

You want to be yourself , express your personal style , and communicate the vibe of your event with the look and feel of your website , yet you have to understand the accepted rules . Feel free to break them " that 's up to you " but it is important to know what they are . <h> Wedding Website Etiquette : To Do or Not To Do- <h> 1 . DO Inform Guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do your wedding website wording can be crucial . We do n't want to overload you with wedding website tips , but it 's important to have an understanding of some of the basics before you- create your site and share the link with family and friends . <p> Wedding websites are ideal for planning , organization , and sharing information between the couple-to-be , bridal party , and invited friends and guests . It 's a great way to communicate updates , provide basic details , and convey essential information , but it 's always a good idea to make your suggestions sound like guidelines rather than rules . <p> If you 're having a destination celebration , use your website to provide valuable information in regards to travel arrangements , lodging , itineraries , and pre- and post-wedding events- such as rehearsal dinners and day-after brunches. - On the other hand , if you 're throwing a hometown affair where most of your guests are traveling locally , do n't overload your site with inordinate details .

It 's perfectly fine to let your guests know what to expect and give them guidelines on what they might be most comfortable wearing . You should never lay down the law or make them feel as though they might be turned away at the door if they 're not in the proper attire . <p> If you 're having a celebration on the beach , let the women know that it 's okay to wear a short dress , go barefoot , or rock a pair of flip flops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear a three-piece suit . A simple button down shirt and a pair of khaki pants may suffice . Conversely , if you 're having a five-star affair in a grand ballroom , let your guests know that tuxedos and full-length gowns are suggested ( and recommended . ) <p> If you 're looking for wedding website ideas and do n't know what to focus on first , let us give you one crucial piece of advice " provide lots of information but do n't write a novel . <p> If you 've invited relatives , distant cousins , and co-workers who only know the bride or the groom , you may want to include a short and sweet story of how you met , how your relationship developed , or how you got engaged . What you should n't do is write a lengthy story about every date you 've had , every trip you 've taken , and every special moment you 've shared . Select just one or two personal anecdotes that have special meaning and write only about those . In this situation , less is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will already know your story , so keep it brief ! - This is the perfect opportunity to include candid shots from when you were dating or professional engagement photographs . In the age of social media , your guests are much more likely to scan through photos than read pages upon pages about your life together to this point . <h> 4 . DO Include a Registry <p> Most people who know a thing or two about wedding website etiquette will tell you that it 's uncouth to add your registry info to your formal invitations " and for the most part , they 're right . Registry info is expected to appear upon a bridal shower invitation " and that 's precisely where it belongs . <p> But if you 're a modern bride who 's spending hours creating a site and packing it full of information down to every last detail , it may make sense to include this info . The details of your registry should never be a main focus or a featured page on your site . Add this info in subtlya brief mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your online registries are sufficient . Remember to keep the focus on the bride , the groom , and the celebration itself . After all , you 're not getting married for the gifts , are you ? <h> 5 . DO N'T Include Exclusive Bridal-Party-Only Events <p> There is absolutely no need to make second-string friends and relatives feel even worse about your plans than by flaunting all- the bridal-party-only events you 're hosting and not inviting them to a part of . At some early point in the planning of your wedding day , you 'll need to invite your bridal party to take part in your special day . But we all have at least one or two friends or cousins that come close to making the cut but just do n't make the final lineup . Do n't make those people feel any worse .

While we 're always willing to break the rules and bend tradition , proper etiquette dictates that you never , ever list your web address on your formal invitation ! Yes , you have to spread the word and let friends , relatives , and guests know that you 've taken the time to create your unique website " but it 's much more tactful to include a link to the site on your save the date cards than on your actual invitation . <p> A wedding website is a great way to communicate your plans and get people excited about your big day in advance .

Get your bearings . <p> While most of- us think white sand- when we hear destination- wedding , this is n't always the case . Living in the land of- 10,000 lakes offers a multitude of- waterfront and- outdoor settings . Knowing your location is essential to picking out the perfect- ensemble. - Certain- designs , colors , and accents translate better by the ocean than they might up on the North Shore. - The terrain will vary- from place to place , and- the temperature is another crucial- factor in planning .

This can make veils tough- for outdoor weddings , especially- when- seaside . <p> - <p> With the ocean breeze or the wind off the lake , fabric can go flying . You want to focus on your big day , not- on- readjusting your veil with every new bluster that comes your way . While we love the- touch- veils can add to your- style , comfort and functionality are more important for a relaxing day at the beach. - Save the veil for some incredible photos , or try a short birdcage design . <h> 5 . But do n't  skip accessories ! <p> Just because a veil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other accessories are n't  ! <p> Make a statement with a bold bracelet . Or , if- your- neckline permits , add a lovely necklace to glam up your- appearance. - Both of- these will cause- fewer worries with the weather , and still give you the opportunity to add your own- style- and- flair . <p> - <p> Earrings can also be a great way to add a unique touch . Again , be mindful of- the wind . Large dangling earrings might pose problems if- its an especially blustery day- you do n't  want them getting tangled in your hair ! <h> 6 . Be comfortable- from head <p> While were on the topic wind can be a real pain when it comes to keeping your- do in place. - Free and- flowy- hair- might be what- you picture- for hitting the sand , - however , - a pinned hairdo might be more practical .

I would n't recommend it . <p> In case I have n't repeated myself- enough , - knowing your location is key to picking out the perfect shoes . Some- waterfront- locations have wooden platforms lightly covered with sand , which make heels possible. - However , - flats or sandals- tend to be- the easiest- for most- ceremonies . We suggest- finding something that you can slip on and off- fairly easy , just in case you get a little unwanted sand between your toes . <p> - <p> Still want a little bit of- a boost ? What about wedges ? The thicker heel will give you a bit more stability in the sand without taking away the height youre- looking- for . <p> Another idea ( one of- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes all together !

Here 's a shorter planning list that will keep his attention and keep him involved . <h> 10 things your groom-to-be will give a second glance : <h> 1 . The Budget <p> This one is obvious .

Give him style guidance , but remember to let him choose . Show him suspenders , vests , and colorful ties to see what he loves the most . <h> 4 .

Get glammed up , but do n't hide the everyday beauty he loves . <h> 5 .

Registering is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prioritize what you need over what you want , but allow each other to pick a few personalized items . <h> 6 . The Menu <p> One of the first things your man will ask about is the menu . This is the perfect wedding planning checklist item to do together ! Will your groom really complain about going to tastings ? Doubtful . If you have the option to design your own menu , combine your favorite foods into one fabulous meal ! I do n't think your guests will complain if you serve mac n ' cheese and chicken wings , do you ? <h> 7 . Delicious Dessert <p> This is one more item your groom-to-be will love to help out with . Most of your maids will want to join you when you dive into dessert options , but I guarantee your groom will too ! If you 're having a groom 's cake , let him design it . <h> 8 .

If professional facials do n't fit your budget , you can see a skincare professional who can offer tips and products for you to use on your own at home .

Because your feet are under major stress on a daily basis , moisturizing is also something you 'll need to practice on your feet daily .

To cover all of your bases , you might want to pick up a multi-vitamin , but specifically for skin , biotin , omega-3 , and vitamin E supplements are all good choices . Just consult your doctor before you start any supplement intake . You know what they say : You are what you eat . And when you 're giving the skin " as well as all of your other organs " the nourishment they need , you 'll not only look fabulous , but you 'll feel fabulous , too . <p> Also , if you find yourself in the sun often , make sure you 're wearing sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher and wearing appropriate clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but baking in the sun or in an artificial tanning bed is not worth potential drying out , wrinkles , and age spots .

It was one of my favorite things to write about because there is n't a lot of established attire etiquette defining what to wear . Luckily designers have started to notice that wedding dresses for second weddings are a needed part of their fashion lines . My new favorite ( and now in-stock online ! ) is Encore by Watters . <h> What is an encore wedding ? <p> Let 's get this out of the way : an encore wedding is the same thing as a second wedding or third wedding or fourth and so on . Encore weddings are usually smaller affairs , and usually involve older adult couples . The bride often chooses a less flashy wedding gown and throws a slightly less formal event . When looking for wedding dresses for second marriage , brides tend to look for more sophisticated- options . One problem : there are n't many fashionable , sexy , sleek options out there . Encore by Watters has filled that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall in love ! <h> Wedding dresses for second marriage : Sexy sophistication . <p> Watters is known for their elegant , timeless wedding gown designs ; they are some of our best sellers here at the Wedding Shoppe . They are usually the ones I fawn over when I visit the bridal department of our store , too . The attention to detail , exceptionally flattering silhouettes , and luxurious fabrics are worth every penny , and Encore by Watters is no exception . Plus , all Encore dresses are under $400 which will give you more wiggle room in your budget . <p> Each dress is named after a flower in the Encore collection . I 'm personally in love with Posey . It 's the perfect wedding dress with sleeves . It exudes simple elegance and confidence with its body skimming silhouette and lace overlay . Let 's not forget the gentle , modest neckline . That 's one of the great features of the Encore collection .

The point of wedding favors is to give your guests a small token of thanks for sharing in your special day . We will be having a candy bar in place of our favors ; guests can help themselves to the smorgasbord of chocolate , sugar and sours we will have available ! <p> Common Question : Do we allow Plus Ones ? How can we properly let people know who is invited ? Answer : This is always a hard question but has become more easy to understand in modern-day terms . The names you include on the invitation to your guests are those who are invited . Many guests who may not attend weddings very often assume the Plus One rule is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you receive a " +1 " on their RSVP . But here is a word to GUESTS of a wedding : If your invitation is addressed to " Your Name &amp; Guest , " you are allowed to bring a guest . If it has simply " Your Name , " you are the only one invited . If it says " Your Name &amp; Family , " you may RSVP for your family . There are many reasons why guest lists are created , and guests need to be respectful of the bride &amp; grooms wishes . They may have limited their guest list due to cost or space constraints , or it may just be that they do n't  want a bunch of people they do n't  know at their wedding . So , brides and grooms , invite who you want to spend your day with . And , guests , respect the couples decisions . They care about you and want you there . <h> 3 . For Guests : Wedding Gift Etiquette . <p> Common Question : How much should we spend on gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as you believe your meal is worth . " The modern answer here is " whatever you think is appropriate . " This is a question I get a ton . Being a bride now , I am floored with the generosity of our friends and family and can totally understand how blessed brides and grooms feel when receiving gifts , whether they be big or small . One of the best gifts we 've gotten so far is a small , cow-shaped butter holder from my grandma . Its so adorable and means a lot to us . The bottom line is that you are the best judge of what you should get the bride and groom , but know that whatever you give is much appreciated by the bride and groom . <h> 4 . For Brides/Grooms : Wedding Speeches . <p> Common Question : Who should give wedding speeches ? Do we keep it open-ended ? Answer : This , again , is up to you . However , after being a part of many weddings as a photographer , I can tell you that the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few select individuals . Just be sure your wedding party and DJ know who will be giving speeches or if it will be open to the floor . Traditionally , the father of the bride , maid/matron of honor , and best man will give speeches . <h> 5 . For Brides/Grooms : Tipping the Wedding Vendors . <p> Common Question : How much should we tip vendors ? Which vendors should we tip ? Answer : Many vendors have gratuity built into their contracts with you . You will want to be sure to know if that is the case before your big day . Now , if a vendor has gone out of their way to make your day carefree and wonderful , a tip is always a very kind " thank you " for their services . If you do n't  feel that the service was up to par , however , do n't  ever feel obligated to tip . Tips are only for high-quality services . It is common for DJs , bartenders and event sites to get tips , but not as common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you though , we greatly appreciate it ! <p> Common Question : What should I wear to a wedding ? Answer : This is a question that I do n't  get very often , but I think it should be addressed . I have photographed weddings for nearly five years now , and been a part of many , many weddings . I have seen some of the most beautifully dressed guests and also some of the most inappropriately dressed ones . Here are some general rules : <p> Do not wear white <p> Check your hemline , ladies . Short dresses are not appropriate at weddings , especially those in churches . If , when you put your arms straight down with palms flat against your thighs and your dress is shorter than your middle finger , it is too short . <p> So far , our wedding planning has been wonderful !
