@@107872772 @3272772/ <h> Rationale <p> It is widely believed that appropriate aftercare is essential to the long-term success and outcomes associated with bariatric surgery 1,2 , especially gastric banding procedures 3,4 . As part of this aftercare , periodic adjustments to the gastric band device are essential . Because of the exponential growth in aftercare visits , it is often necessary to use physician extenders to deliver aftercare to provide appropriate long-term access to care for patients . The intent of the credentialing guidelines for gastric band adjustments is to provide recommendations for appropriate education , training , and competency recognition for nonphysician providers . <h> Definitions <p> Adjustments : The infusion of saline for device tightening or withdrawal of saline for device loosening via an access port to alter or adjust the size of the adjustable gastric restrictive device . The need for adjustments are based on clinical assessment of the patient 's hunger , satiety , dietary intake , portion size , weight loss/gain , and associated signs or symptoms of potential complications 5,6 . <p> Physician Extenders : Although it is recognized that- terms such as nonphysician provider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which these providers and their services are held , this terminology is consistent with facility and payor practitioner descriptions .

Using this table , overweight and obesity are defined by percentage of weight in excess of IBW . <h> Body Mass Index ( BMI ) <p> The body mass index ( BMI ) is another measure used to define overweight and obesity and is considered a more accurate estimate of body fatness than IBW . Large population studies- find that the BMI generally reflects the amount of excessive body fat an adult has , although there are certain exceptions , such as the BMI of a woman who is pregnant , an athlete , a body builder or the elderly . BMI does not necessarily take into account a persons distribution of fat ( abdominal vs. peripheral ) , however , and is not a good measurement of the metabolic activity of a person 's fat tissue . <p> BMI takes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using a BMI chart or can be calculated according to one of the following formulas : <h> Obesity Prevalence and Rate of Occurrence <p> According to the W.H.O. , 65 percent of the world 's population lives in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight . Approximately 500 million adults in the world are affected by obesity and one billion are affected by overweight , along with 48 million children . <p> In the United States , epidemiological data from an ongoing study that measures the actual body size of thousands of Americans , show that 34 percent of adults more than 20 years old are affected by obesity and 68 percent are overweight ( 2007-2008 data ) . Obesity affects 10 percent of children between two and five years of age , 2 percent of those between 6 to 11 years old , and 18 percent of adolescents . <p> Throughout the last 20 to 25 years , the prevalence of obesity has been increasing at an alarming rate . Since 1985 , the Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) has supported an ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments , to examine changes in obesity prevalence state-to-state , and has found the following : <p> In 1990 , the obesity prevalence for most of the states was 10 percent or less . <p> By 1995 , more than half the states had a prevalence of 15 percent . <p> By 2000 , nearly half the states had a prevalence of 20 percent or higher . <p> Five years later ( 2005 ) , all but three states had a prevalence greater than 20 percent and nearly a third had a prevalence of 25 percent or more . <p> By 2010 , the data show that most of U.S. states had a prevalence of 25 percent and many had a prevalence of 30 percent or higher . <p> Not only has the obesity epidemic increased in number throughout the past two decades , but also in severity . Data obtained from the yearly ongoing CDC-supported U.S. study found that between the years 1987 to 2005 the prevalence of severe obesity increased by 500 percent and super severe obesity ( BMI greater than 50 ) increased by nearly 1,000 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American adults , or nearly 14 million people , are affected by severe obesity . <h> Progressive Nature of the Disease of Obesity <p> Obesity is considered a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic component . Acting upon a genetic background are a number of hormonal , metabolic , psychological , cultural and behavioral factors that promote fat accumulation and weight gain . <p> Positive Energy Balance <p> A positive energy balance causes weight gain and occurs when the amount of calories consumed ( energy intake ) exceeds the amount of calories the body uses ( energy expenditure ) in the performance of basic biological functions , daily activities , and exercise . A positive energy balance may be caused by overeating or by not getting enough physical activity . However , there are other conditions that affect energy balance and fat accumulation that do not involve excessive eating or sedentary behavior . These include : <p> Chronic sleep loss <p> Consumption of foods that , independent of caloric content , cause metabolic/hormonal changes that may increase body fat . These include foods high in sugar or high fructose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meats <h> Weight Gain <p> Weight gain is yet another contributor to weight gain or , in other words , obesity begets ' obesity , which is one of the reasons the disease is considered progressive ' . Weight gain causes a number of hormonal , metabolic and molecular changes in the body that increase the risk for even greater fat accumulation . Such obesity-associated biological changes reduce the body 's ability to oxidize ( burn ) fat for energy , increase the conversion of glucose ( carbohydrate ) to fat , and increase the body 's capacity to store fat in fat storage depots ( adipose tissue ) . This means that more of the calories consumed will be stored as fat . To make matters worse , obesity affects certain regulators of appetite and hunger in a manner that can lead to an increase in meal size and the frequency of eating . Weight gain , therefore , changes the biology of the body in a manner that favors further weight gain and obesity . <h> Obesity-related Conditions <p> A number of other conditions associated with obesity contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the number of calories that would be burned in the performance of activity . Weight gain may also cause psychological or emotional distress which , in turn , produces hormonal changes that may cause further weight gain by stimulating appetite and by increasing fat uptake into fat storage depots . <p> Sleep duration is reduced by weight gain due to a number of conditions that impair sleep quality such as pain , sleep apnea and other breathing problems , a need to urinate more frequently , use of certain medications , and altered regulation of body temperature . Shortened sleep duration , in turn , produces certain hormones that both stimulate appetite and increase the uptake of fat into fat storage depots . <p> Weight gain also contributes to the development of other diseases such as hypertension , diabetes , heart disease , osteoarthritis and depression , and these conditions are often treated with medications that contribute to even further weight gain . In all of these ways and more , obesity ' begets ' obesity , trapping the individual in a vicious weight gain cycle . <h> Diets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overweight and obesity , but , dieting is also a contributor to obesity progression . Dietary weight-loss causes biological responses that persist long-term and contribute to weight regain . One of these responses affects energy balance . When a person loses weight , the body thinks ' it is starving and energy expenditure is reduced in order to conserve calories . The reduction in energy expenditure with dietary weight-loss requires that , in order to maintain weight-loss , the dieter eat even fewer calories than someone of equal body size who has never been on a diet . However , eating less is difficult following a diet because there are long-term changes in regulators of appetite that increase the desire to eat and the amount of food that can be consumed . Such diet-induced changes favor a positive energy balance and weight regain and , because the conditions responsible for the reduction in energy expenditure and increased drive to eat persist long-term , an individual will often not only regain all of their lost weight , but even more . <p> Another biological response that occurs with dieting involves changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn fat and increase the capacity for fat to be stored in adipose depots ( fat storage depots ) . With dietary weight-loss , the amount of dietary fat the body burns is reduced by approximately 50 percent . In addition , dieting reduces the amount of fat the body burns for fuel during low-grade activity such as walking , cleaning the house , fixing dinner , or working on a computer . The reduction in the amount of fat that is burned for fuel following a dietary weight-loss makes more fat available to be taken up by fat storage depots , and dieting increases the capacity for fat depots to store even more fat than before a diet . Altogether dietary weight-loss reduces the use of fat for fuel and increases the capacity for the fat that is not utilized to be stored . These changes lead to a progressive increase in fat accumulation even if the individual is not overeating . <h> Summary <p> Multiple factors acting upon a genetic background cause weight gain and obesity . Conditions associated with weight gain and biological changes in the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progression of the disease , often trapping the individual in a vicious weight gain cycle .

@@107872812 @3272812/ <h> Global Bariatric Healthcare <h> Preamble <p> The following position statement is issued by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery in response to numerous inquires made to the Society by patients , physicians , society members , hospitals , and others regarding global travel and medical tourism for bariatric surgery procedures . In this statement , available data are summarized regarding this issue based on current knowledge , expert opinion , and published peer-reviewed scientific evidence available at this time . The intent of issuing such a statement is to provide objective information about the risk and benefits of travelling long distances for bariatric procedures , either out of necessity or as part of a medical tourism package , and to provide recommendations based on the current evidence . The statement is not intended as , and should not be construed as , stating or establishing a local , regional , or national standard of care . The statement may be revised in the future as additional evidence becomes available . <p> The term medical tourism is most often used to describe travel across international borders to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This term does not fully or accurately describe all of the issues or concerns related to bariatric surgery and the Society has adopted the term global bariatric healthcare to encompass all of the scenarios in which patients travel long distances for bariatric surgery ( including medical tourism packages ) . For the purposes of this statement , global bariatric healthcare is defined as travel to undergo bariatric surgery across any distance that precludes routine follow-up and continuity of care with the surgeon or program . No specific type of border or distance of travel can universally apply as regional differences in surgeon availability and expertise vary greatly throughout the world . While this practice commonly involves travel across international borders , travel across long distances within a country , region , or state involves the same risks and challenges for continuity of care as does long distance travel to another country and therefore applies to this statement . <p> This statement is not intended to single out a specific region , country , or facility that accepts patients from long distances . Rather , it is intended to provide guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or provide follow-up care for these patients . <h> The Issue <p> In recent years , there has been a sharp increase in the number of patients who travel large distances across state or international borders for medical care. ( 1 ) This practice , often referred to as medical tourism , has spurred an industry that facilitates travel for a wide spectrum of medical and surgical procedures . This new industry has been created to advise patients on the appropriate facility in the right region or country for their condition , handle all travel arrangements , teleconference with physicians , and send medical records . The medical tourism industry is projected to become a $21 billion a year industry by 2011. ( 2 ) <p> The primary motivation for pursuing medical tourism is financial . These packages can offer medical care and surgical procedures at prices 40% to 80% less than the cost in the patient 's home region . ( 2 ) This practice has also been driven by long wait times or unavailability of specific therapies or surgeon expertise in the patient 's own region , rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate insurance coverage , an increasing number of uninsured or underinsured people , and regulatory issues that may preclude specific therapies ( devices ) from being used in certain countries . Additionally , some insurance companies and employers promote this practice and offer incentives to patients who are willing to travel internationally for less expensive medical care . ( 2 , 3 ) Medical tourism internet websites are numerous and largely promote the benefits of procedures while downplaying the risks. ( 4 ) Despite some ominous predictions regarding the financial impacts of medical outsourcing , developed health care systems have not yet dealt with the legislative and health care policy issues surrounding medical tourism or the impact that medical tourism will have on individualhealth care systems and providers. ( 5 ) <p> Quality of the care and patient safety are the primary concerns regarding medical tourism . Several organizations including The Joint Commission International ( JCI ) , Trent International Accreditation Scheme ( U.K. ) , the International Society for Quality in Healthcare , the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) and the International Bariatric Surgical Review Committee ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by establishing accreditation procedures for international medical facilities . Although outcome statistics from hospitals utilizing these procedures are rare , first-person and anecdotal reports on quality are numerous . ( 6 ) In the last five years , the number of JCI accredited public and private hospitals around the world has increased by nearly 1,000 percent . Currently , over 250 facilities in 36 countries are accredited by the JCI , up from 27 hospitals in 2004 . Establishing this high standard of accreditation instills a higher level of confidence in citizens seeking affordable health care alternatives abroad . There are often regional or local variations in accreditation standards , though , based on cultural , societal , or religious differences . <p> The American Medical Association ( AMA ) and the American College of Surgeons ( ACS ) have developed and published guidelines regarding medical tourism and these statements provide an important set of principles for consideration by patients , employers , insurers , and other third-party groups responsible for coordinating such travel outside of the country. ( 7,8 ) These guidelines and other published recommendations(9) recognize patients ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the facilities , board certification of the treating physicians , appropriate documentation for the physician who will be providing follow-up care , proper informed consent policies , relevant legal standards governing privacy and confidentiality , insurance coverage for follow-up care including complications , and identification of the risks of traveling after surgical procedures . <p> There are currently no specific guidelines or recommendations in place regarding global bariatric healthcare . There are , however , unique risks associated with bariatric surgery that must be considered . Bariatric surgery patients are at high risk for venous thromboembolic events , and may develop infectious complications or gastrointestinal leaks after being discharged from the surgeon 's care . Additionally , the long-term need for revisional procedures in some patients must be considered . In the setting of medical travel , the preoperative evaluation and patient education component that is critical to success for bariatric surgery may be abbreviated or lacking . Also , patients may not be provided an appropriate level of continuity of care to monitor for early complications , nutritional deficiencies or late complications . Additionally , laparoscopic adjustable gastric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions for- postoperative band adjustments in the patient 's local area . Finally , unlike other kinds of surgical procedures requiring minimal postoperative followup , the successful long-term treatment of the disease of morbid obesity and its associated comorbidities requires a life-long process of care that includes a comprehensive program of surgical , medical , psychological and dietary care . This unique type of support and continuity of care is difficult to provide in the context of medical tourism or global travel . <h> The Data <p> Currently , there is little published data specifically addressing global travel for bariatric surgery . The number of patients receiving bariatric surgery abroad or across international boundaries is unknown and there is a need for more empirical research on the role , process and outcomes of medical tourism. ( 10 ) The issues raised by the AMA and ACS position statements do address the general issues that should be considered with regards to medical tourism . However , important unique factors associated with the treatment of a chronic disease such as obesity are not adequately addressed by these statements . Preoperative education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for successful outcomes in bariatric surgery(11,12) and these are not necessarily provided in the setting of medical travel . In addition , the cost of treating complications for patients returning from a procedure performed abroad has been reported and may be substantial , particularly if the patient self-referred outside a singlepayer system or is uninsured when he or she develops the complication. ( 13 ) <h> Summary and Recommendations <p> Based on the limited available data , guidelines published by other medical societies , expert opinion , and a primary concern for patient safety , the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery supports the following statements and guidelines regarding bariatric surgical procedures and global bariatric healthcare : <p> Based on the unique characteristics of the bariatric patient , the potential for major early and late complications after bariatric procedures , the specific follow-up requirements for different bariatric procedures , and the nature of treating the chronic disease of obesity , extensive travel to undergo bariatric surgery should be discouraged unless appropriate follow-up and continuity of care are arranged and transfer of medical information is adequate <p> The ASMBS opposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies for patients requesting bariatric surgery if a high quality bariatric program is available locally . <p> The ASMBS opposes the creation of financial incentives or disincentives by insurance companies or employers that limit patients ' choices of bariatric surgery location or surgical options and , in effect , make medical tourism the only financially viable option for patients . <p> The ASMBS recognizes the right of individuals to pursue medical care at the facility of their choice . Should they choose to undergo bariatric surgery as part of a medical tourism package or pursue bariatric surgery at a facility a long distance from their home , the following guidelines are recommended : <p> Patients should undergo procedures at an accredited JCI institution or preferably a bariatric center of excellence. - Patients should investigate the surgeon 's credentials to ensure that the surgeon is board eligible or board certified by a national board or credentialing body . Individual surgeon outcomes for the desired procedure should be made available as part of the informed consent process whenever possible . <p> Patients and their providers should ensure that follow-up care , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the insurance payer or purchased as a supplemental program prior to traveling abroad . <p> Surgical providers should ensure that all medical records and documentation are provided and returned with the patient to their local area . This includes the type of band placed and any adjustments performed in the case of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding , as well as any postoperative imaging performed . <p> Prior to undergoing surgery , the patient should establish a plan for postoperative followup with a qualified local bariatric surgery program to monitor for nutritional deficiencies and long-term complications , and to provide ongoing medical , psychological and dietary supervision . <p> Patients should recognize that prolonged traveling after bariatric surgery may increase the risk of deep venous thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , and other perioperative complications . <p> Patients should recognize that there are risks of contracting infectious diseases while traveling abroad that are unique to different endemic regions . <p> Patients should recognize that travel over long distances in a short period of time for bariatric surgery may limit appropriate preoperative education and counseling regarding the risks , benefits , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bariatric surgery program 's ability to medically optimize the patient prior to surgery . <p> Patients should understand that compensation for complications may be difficult or impossible to obtain . <p> Patients should understand that legal redress for medical errors for procedures performed across international boundaries is difficult . <p> When a patient who has had a bariatric procedure at a distant facility presents with an emergent life-threatening postoperative complication , the local bariatric surgeon on call should provide appropriate care to the patient consistent with the established standard of care and in keeping with previous published statements by the ASMBS ( 14 ) This care should be provided without risk of litigation for complications or long-term sequelae resulting from the initial procedure performed abroad . Routine or non-emergent care for patients who have had bariatric surgery elsewhere should be provided at the discretion of the local bariatric surgeon . <h> References <p> Reed CM . Medical tourism .

@@107872827 @3272827/ <h> Background <p> The field of bariatric surgery continues to grow , attracting surgeons with expertise in laparoscopic , gastrointestinal , and bariatric surgery . With the implicit goal of ensuring that surgeons have met minimum criteria to safely perform bariatric surgery , 3 national surgery associations " American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery ( ASMBS ) , American College of Surgeons ( ACS ) , and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons ( SAGES ) " independently created credentialing guidelines to guide hospitals and institutions in the credentialing process for bariatric surgery 1 , 2 , 3 . The guidelines were thoughtfully written to assist local credentialing committees in the evaluation of an applicant 's qualifications and were not developed to become a standard of care . <p> Both the ASMBS Bariatric Center of Excellence program ( ASMBS BSCOE ) and the ACS Bariatric Surgery Center Network ( ACS BSCN ) were developed to improve the quality of patient care and have been recognized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) . By creating a culture of data collection and outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement in outcomes and a significant reduction in patient mortality . In 2012 , under the leadership of the ASMBS in partnership with the ACS and in collaboration with members of the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative ( MBSC ) , a unified bariatric surgery quality improvement and accreditation program " the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program ( MBSAQIP ) " is being developed . <p> With the quest for unification , a joint task force ( members listed in Table 1 ) with representation from the key societies was created to develop a set of credentialing guidelines consolidating the 3 existing credentialing guidelines into 1 document . The guidelines have been endorsed by the leadership of the ASMBS , SAGES , ACS , and the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract ( SSAT ) . <h> Table 1 . Joint Task Force Members <p> ASMBS <p> ACS <p> SAGES <p> MBSC <p> SSAT <p> William B. Inabnet III , M.D. ( chair ) <p> Ronald Clements , M.D. <p> Kevin Reavis , M.D. <p> Arthur M.

These guidelines aim to ensure that bariatric surgeons have undergone appropriate training and have achieved a certain minimum level of skill to safely perform bariatric surgery and to recognize and treat complications . These guidelines offer recommendations to institutional credentialing bodies regarding surgeon experience and training for surgeons seeking bariatric surgery privileges . It is acknowledged that special circumstances may apply to an applicant surgeon 's training background , and thus , guidelines must allow for some flexibility . Ultimately , the decision to provide credentials for a surgeon resides with the local institution credentialing committee or their appointee . Credentialing recommendations should be stringent enough to ensure patient safety but not so stringent as to compromise access to care by limiting the number of surgeons credentialed to perform bariatric surgery . Credentialing guidelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been established with the specialty for safe practice . <p> It is strongly recommended that all the facilities in which the surgeon performs bariatric surgery participate with the MBSAQIP , including compliance with data entry of all bariatric procedures into the national outcomes registry . Requirements in this document as they pertain to the MBSAQIP also can be fulfilled by participation in an equivalent approved statewide or national bariatric quality improvement program . It is important to have institutional support for data management , bariatric surgery infrastructure , and personnel . All surgeons practicing bariatric surgery in accredited facilities are required to participate with the MBSAQIP or an equivalent regional/national quality improvement program , which involves submission of all bariatric surgery cases performed at the accredited institution and periodic review of outcomes . <p> Recommended bariatric surgeon requirements include the following : <p> Completion of an accredited general surgery residency . <p> Certified or eligible to be certified by the American Board of Surgery or equivalent ( American Osteopathic Board of Surgery , Royal College of Physicians , and Surgeons of Canada ) . Exceptions to the board certification requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical licensure in good standing . <p> Completion of an accredited bariatric surgery fellowship . For nonfellowship trained surgeons , documentation of previous bariatric surgery experience and formal didactic training in bariatric surgery ( such as that provided by the ASMBS Fundamentals of Bariatric Surgery Course ) is recommended . Supporting documentation , including a case log list or bariatric surgery training certificate , should be provided to allow the credentialing committee to assess the applicant surgeon 's bariatric surgery experience . <p> Participation within a structured bariatric program that provides or coordinates comprehensive , interdisciplinary care of the bariatric patient . <p> The surgeon will actively participate with the MBSAQIP and adhere to its standards by implementing changes in practice in accordance with feedback from the MBSAQIP or an equivalent regional/national quality improvement program . <p> Recommended criteria for surgeons with no or limited experience in bariatric surgery or advanced laparoscopy include the following : <p> Applicant surgeon must complete a structured training curriculum in bariatric surgery and advanced laparoscopic surgery as reviewed and approved by the bariatric medical director . <p> The applicant surgeon must have completed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases should be performed with a co-surgeon who is a fully credentialed bariatric surgeon . The absolute number of proctored cases is left up to the local credentialing committee . However , the local credentialing committees may wish to delineate separate requirements for those procedures that require gastrointestinal stapling versus those that do not . It is advisable that the first cases be of lower technical difficulty with carefully determined lower risk patients as determined by the bariatric medical director . <p> The surgeon will actively participate with the MBSAQIP program and adhere to its standards by implementing changes in practice in accordance with feedback from the MBSAQIP or an equivalent regional/national quality improvement program . <p> Investigational procedures should be performed under an IRB-approved protocol . <p> Local credentialing committees may wish to delineate separate requirements for those procedures that require gastrointestinal stapling versus those that do not . <p> Endoluminal bariatric procedures are not covered by these guidelines and should be credentialed under endoscopic privileges .

Ongoing participation with the MBSAQIP program or an equivalent regional/national quality improvement program . <p> The surgeon must demonstrate continued critical assessment of his/her outcomes as determined by periodic review of outcomes from an acceptable regional or national outcomes registry . <p> The chief of surgery or his/her designee should verify that these criteria have been met.

@@107872841 @3272841/ <p> The following statement is issued by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery in response to a recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) of a new device for weight loss called vagal blocking therapy for obesity ( VBLOC ) in patients with a body mass index ( BMI ) 35 to 45 kg/m2 clinical knowledge and published peer-reviewed scientific evidence available at this time . The statement is not intended as , and should not be construed as , stating or establishing a local , regional , or national standard of care . <p> The vagus nerve plays a significant role in the regulation of stomach functions ( meal-evoked fundic relaxation , antral contractions , and gastric emptying ) , secretion of ghrelin , pancreatic endocrine and exocrine secretion , and glycemic control . Truncal vagotomy can result in weight loss . In a study by Kral , 21 obese patients underwent truncal vagotomy and lost 20 - 4 kg ( range 0 " 51 ) at 12 to 40 months postoperatively ; however , longer follow-up showed limited efficacy 1,2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side effects , such as diarrhea , vomiting , and weight regain through compensatory mechanisms . <p> VBLOC , a new therapy for obesity , induces intermittent intra-abdominal vagal blocking with the use of high-frequency electrical energy . The development of this technology was based on short-term animal studies , which proved the concept that intermittent vagal blocking leads to weight loss without permanent damage to the vagus nerves 3,4 . The long-term effect of intermittent blocking of the human vagus nerve is unknown . Two C-shaped electrodes are positioned laparoscopically on the anterior and posterior vagal trunks near the gastroesophageal junction and are connected to a rechargeable neuroregulator placed in a subcutaneous pocket on the lateral aspect of the thoracic wall . VBLOC may adjustably deliver signals for 12 or more hours daily at a frequency of 5000 Hz , amplitude between 3and 8 mA , and a duty cycle , 5 minutes blocked and 5 minutes unblocked . The intermittent block of the vagus nerve may allow for nerve recovery , potentially preventing tachyphylaxis . Patients are required to charge the device for 60 to 90 minutes twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Three open label 5 " 7 and 2 randomized double-blind , sham-controlled clinical trials 8,9 with a follow-up extending to 18 months have been published 10 . In the first randomized trial ( EMPOWER trial ) , a double-blind , prospective , multicenter trial , 294 patients were implanted with the device and randomized into treated ( n = 192 , device was activated ) or control ( n = 102 , device remained deactivated ) groups 8 . The mean preoperative BMI was 41 - 1 kg/m2 for both the treated and control groups . At 12 months , the excess weight loss ( EWL ) was similar between the treated and control groups ( 17 - 2% for the treated group and 16 2% for the control group ) . The adverse event rate was 3% . In the second randomized trial ( ReCharge trial ) , the mean preoperative BMI was 41 - 3 kg/m2 in the treated ( n = 162 ) and sham ( n = 77 ) groups 9 . The sham group underwent implantation of a neuroregulator without implantation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum of 12 months . The mean difference in EWL between the treatment group and the sham group was statistically significant at 8.5% ( 24.4% in the treatment group versus 15.9% in the sham group ) ; however , it did not meet the 10% target of the study . The device-related adverse event rate was 3.7% . A study update 10 with 18-month follow-up showed an EWL of 23.5% ( 8.8 % total weight loss ) in the treatment group versus 10.2% in the sham group ( 3.8% total weight loss ) . At 18 months , 54% of the treatment group patients achieved more than 20% EWL , and 41% achieved more than 25% . Patients in the sham group regained over 40% of their EWL by 18 months , and most of this weight gain took place before the unblinding of the patients . Overall , the most commonly reported related adverse events were heartburn , dyspepsia , abdominal pain , belching , and dys- phagia . Most of these adverse events were transient and resolved spontaneously . There was one case of gastric perforation at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery rate at 18 months was 6.8% . <p> In another small prospective study of 26 patients with type 2 diabetes followed up for 12 months , VBLOC resulted in 25% EWL , improvement in HbA1C and reduction of blood pressure in patients with hypertension 7 . <p> The quantity of the data available at this time ( 6 published studies 5 " 10 ; approximately 600 implanted devices ) and the length of follow-up indicate adequate safety and efficacy in the short term . More prospective studies with longer follow-up are required to establish the clinically significant efficacy and patient tolerance of this device . The Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program is an ideal venue to track the data on this procedure beyond the reported 18 months to monitor durability of weight loss , adverse events , and long-term efficacy . The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery currently supports the following regarding VBLOC for the treatment of obesity and encour- ages members to participate in post-FDA approval studies : <p> Reversible vagal nerve blockade has been shown to result in statistically significant EWL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2 prospective randomized trials . <p> Reversible vagal nerve blockage has been shown to have a reasonable safety profile with a low incidence of severe adverse events and a low revisional rate in the short term .

However , the ASMBS recognizes the right of individuals to pursue medical care at the facility of their choice . <h> Understanding Accreditation <p> When deciding where to have metabolic or bariatric surgery , patients have many options . One significant choice to make is whether you will have your surgery at an accredited or a non-accredited facility . In making this choice , it is critical for patients and referring physicians to understand what makes a facility " accredited " , and why that accreditation is so important . <p> The bariatric and metabolic surgery accreditation process is called MBSAQIP , which stands for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program . MBSAQIP was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Society for Metabolic &amp; Bariatric Surgery , to foster patient safety and surgical excellence . To become accredited , a facility undergoes a rigorous process of evaluations to ensure their level of quality across safety , training , followup , and surgical volume standards . <h> Importance of Accreditation <p> A recent study showed that the mortality rates at non-accredited facilities are on average three times greater than the mortality rates at accredited facilities . <p> Accreditation is an important , life-saving process and we encourage patients and referring physicians to seek out those facilities that meet these rigorous standards .

While that effort was not successful , it is apparent that we have made an increasing impact on Capitol Hill , as evidenced by the greater support for the presently pending obesity bill . <p> It became immediately apparent to me that representing surgeons only was a limitation to our effectiveness in our lobbying effort . In addition , the number of people your organization represents is an important factor in determining who in the congressional office you get to meet . I therefore led the effort to establish a formal coalition with The Obesity Society , the Obesity Action Coalition and the American Dietetic Association , now known as the American Academy of Nutrition . Thus , we became a multidisciplinary advocacy group , most importantly including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our effort with a single lobbyist who has been most effective . For example , his most recent accomplishment was lobbying at the AMA meeting to get the delegates to out-vote their so-called scientific advisory board in declaring obesity to be a disease . This is a behind the scenes activity , but still an important step forward as we advocate for fair treatment of the severely obese . <p> An additional focus of my year as president was to bring bariatric surgery and the ASMBS into prominence at NIH and throughout the field of obesity , diabetes and related conditions . Many others contributed to this effort and share credit for transforming the academic reputation of bariatric surgery to one of a legitimate participant in basic and clinical research . My role as the chair of the LABS Steering Committee and the only surgeon member of the task force to revise the NIH guidelines on obesity facilitated this effort . <p> Also during my year , the stage was set for terminating the failing agreement with SRC and aligning ourselves with the ACS . While not everyone thinks this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin Blackstone should appropriately take credit for this organizational step forward . <p> I would say the most important aspect on the history of our organization is our concentrated effort to advocate on behalf of the severely obese .

The recommendation is based on current clinical knowledge , expert opinion , and published peer-reviewed scientific evidence available at this time . The statement is not intended as , and should not be construed as , stating or establishing a local , regional , or national standard of care . <p> Laparoscopic gastric plication , also known as laparoscopic greater curvature plication , has recently emerged as a new bariatric procedure . The rationale for this procedure addresses issues that may limit the acceptance of other bariatric procedures . Specifically , the gastric plication does not involve gastric resection , intestinal bypass , or placement of a foreign body , and this could potentially provide a lower risk alternative that will appeal to patients and referring physicians . The operation involves mobilizing the greater curvature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infolding or imbricating the stomach to achieve gastric restriction . There are increasing numbers of gastric plication procedures being performed worldwide and this operation is being marketed as a new option for surgical weight loss by some practices . The quantity ( 4 studies , &lt;300 patients ) and quality ( prospective or retrospective case series ) of the data available at this time is insufficient to draw any definitive conclusions regarding the safety and efficacy of this procedure . The Society will continue to monitor the data on this procedure as it emerges and will issue a formal evidence-based position statement at the appropriate time . In addition to the greater curvature plication procedure , a combination of gastric banding with greater curvature gastric plication has also been described in the literature . This procedure is similar to laparoscopic gastric plication but includes placement of the adjustable gastric band . This combined technique has been suggested to augment the early weight loss after gastric banding with possible decrease in the need for band adjustments . However , to-date there is only one peer-reviewed article describing this technique in 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clinical studies ( N=1 ) and lack of long-term follow-up , the combination of gastric banding with greater curvature plication is also considered investigational . <p> We currently support the following recommendations regarding gastric plication alone or in combination with adjustable gastric band placement for the treatment of obesity : <p> Gastric plication procedures should be considered investigational at this time . This procedure should be performed under a study protocol with third party oversight ( local or regional ethics committee , Institutional Review Board , Data Monitoring and Safety Board , or equivalent authority ) to ensure continuous evaluation of patient safety and to review adverse events and outcomes . <p> Reporting of short- and long-term safety and efficacy outcomes in the medical literature and scientific meetings is strongly encouraged . Data for these procedures should also be reported to a program 's center of excellence database . <p> Any marketing or advertisement for this procedure should include a statement to the effect that this is an investigational procedure . <p> The ASMBS supports research conducted under an IRB protocol as it pertains to investigational procedures and devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported , as is the reporting of all data through BOLD , Bariatric NSQIP or a specific research database .

There is currently little evidence-based guidance regarding specific indications and outcomes for reoperative bariatric surgery . A task force was convened to review the current evidence regarding reoperative bariatric surgery . The aim of the review was to identify procedure-specific indications and outcomes for reoperative procedures . <p> Methods : Literature search was conducted to identify studies reporting indications for and outcomes after reoperative bariatric surgery . Specifically , operations to treat complications , failed weight loss , and weight regain were evaluated . Abstract and manuscript reviews were completed by the task force members to identify , grade , and categorize relevant studies . <p> Results : A total of 819 articles were identified in the initial search . After review for inclusion criteria and data quality , 175 articles were included in the systematic review and analysis . The majority of published studies are single center retrospective reviews .
