His work for Vanity Fair , GQ and others have produced more famous portraits of famous people , ranging from iconic 90s musicians such as Kurt Cobain to President Obama to the Dalai Lama , earning him the title of " the leading portrait photographer of his day . " <p> Mark 's schedule is booked full , so we were grateful for the opportunity to speak with him . He has just picked up and started working with the Mamiya Leaf Credo 60 camera system , and we were interested to hear what he thought . <p> " My cameras are like paint brushes -- I use different cameras -- both film and digital . While 35mm increasingly offers a great range of possibilities , the thing about medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection to the work . With medium format you can get lens compression for a shallower depth-of-field -- which is key in portrait photography . In film , medium format gives you a better quality negative . With digital , it 's similar -- you get better resolution and quality of capture . <p> " I choose a camera system for its reliability and simplicity . Right now we 're trying out Mamiya Leaf . We like to keep our work streamlined and simple , because with our tight schedule , we do n't have the room to deal with equipment issues . Also , I understand that Mamiya Leaf has a great reputation for its film-like results . <p> " Actually I 'm still really interested in print making from film . I find that to be incredibly exciting and what I signed up for . What I like about film is that it keeps the focus on the relationship between the subject and me ; it 's something that I learned from coming up in the editorial world . For me , above all , it 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship , which is not only about what it 's looking like in the camera . With digital , I try to shoot portraiture the same way I would have shot with film . <p> " I like to take my time to decide which pictures are best . Often you have to step back and just let the photos go for awhile , which is something which historically film has let you do -- the edit takes place after the fact , not during . It will be interesting to experiment also with Capture One Pro on these digital images from the Credo system and see if it 's more like the darkroom experience . <p> " These are the essential things : Interaction . Imagination . How things evolve and become more sophisticated . Your eye and the time you put into it . <p> " When you 're doing a series of photographs , digital is a very helpful tool for being able to know when to move on and have some security about what you 've captured . In any case , you 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going on . <p> " There is a certain synergy between the music I make and the photographs I shoot . What 's great is that the music gives me a chance to step away from photography entirely and be engaged differently with another group of people . With music , it 's more purely like playing than anything else , so you 're really always in the moment . ( With photography there 's just a whole lot more preparation before you get to that point . ) <p> " But it still has to do with how people react to each other . There are similarities between my song writing and the story telling I do as a photographer . Writing a song , I 'm drawing from memory and imagery to create lyrics . And that includes some of what I 've experienced from behind the camera which has helped me to build a visual vocabulary that can end up as a line in a song . <p> " It might describe something I 've been through , or just that it sounds good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both music and in photography , I believe that if I 'm affected by what I 'm creating , then someone else will connect with it that way , too . <p> Besides making music , Mark is also an author of many books . The theme of his first book was on Holocaust survivors , for which he worked in a documentary style , to record something that he described as being " meaningful to pass on -- which is at the heart of being a photographer . " <p> " What I like about the work I 'm doing now is that it spans many categories of photography -- from landscape to fashion . " <p> Mark Seliger <p> And add to that a very exciting YouTube series that Mark created , called Capture <p> For Mark , Capture is " a chance to sit down with photographers and have a relaxed , open dialogue . I 'm curious about the way they think and work . And they are a diverse group . We like to invite a combination of guests , including a professional and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm fascinated by them all -- by their creative processes and their approaches to their subjects . " <p> " Recently we had an episode featuring Judd Apatow and Matt Mahurin . We 've also had an episode with Christy Turlin , Mick Jagger and Albert Watson . I find it very inspiring , meeting these incredibly talented and passionate photographers , at whatever level they 're engaged , and then sharing our conversations with our audiences . " <p> We are grateful to Mark for sharing his time with us and we are looking forward to speaking with him again and seeing more images that he 's created with the Mamiya Leaf Credo system , and to watching upcoming episodes of Capture !

The image is exposed to ensure that the clouds do not clip . As a result , the castle ruin , cliffs and the coast are underexposed and almost without details .

This LCC trick will often lead to fantastic results , but sometimes it causes a problematic halo effect around hard contrast edge as is the case with this picture . <p> On the image to the left , it is easy to see the halo effect on the castle ruin . The LCC has been used to open op the shadows , but because the images contains such a high contrast between the edges of the hill , the ruin and the bright sky , a strong halo appears . Therefore , another method to correct this image is required . <p> By using the " Mid tone " slider in the Levels Tool , I primarily brighten up the darkest part of the image . Naturally , using the " Mid tone " slider also brightens the mid tones and highlights . To counter this , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the High Dynamic Range tool and some negative exposure compensation . The result is much better details in the shadows without the halo effect . <p> If I need still more details in the shadows , I try to use the curve tool too . The curve preset " Shadows -Brighter " is a good starting point as it is specially designed to open the deepest shadows in an image . <p> Finally , I add some saturation and set the highlight slider in the Levels tool to ensure that the final image utilizes the full data range .

Even though this back is only 17MP ( less than my DSLR ) , it easily rivals and often exceeds my other cameras because of the large pixel size on the sensor . I also love the fact that I can dial down to ISO 25 , which I often do when shooting landscapes . The noise level is extremely low and the resolution looks as good as any film I 've ever shot . <p> &lt; <p> Jim Shoemaker is an award-winning fine art photographer whose images depict the nature , landscapes , historic landmarks and people he encounters in the western United States . His work has appeared in publications such as Outdoor Photography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Silvershotz and Malibu Times and has been featured multiple times on the cover of OUtdoors , a publication of the National Park Service . <p> Early in his professional graphic design career , Jim discovered a strong correlation between nature and the layouts , typography and color he used . Building on this concept he began to explore unique perspectives , lighting and composition through photography . His favorite study subjects include : Yosemite National Park , Death Valley , Utah , the California Coast and various ghost towns peppered throughout the western United States . <p> Today , Jim enjoys the challenge of capturing familiar , often-photographed subjects through a fresh lens . His drive for the perfect shot pushes him beyond the limitations of weather reports and tourist destinations into the realm of exquisite art . <p> Travelling off the beaten path is one of Jim 's specialties . The thrill of capturing rarely seen vistas with his unique eye often results in one-of-a-kind photos .
