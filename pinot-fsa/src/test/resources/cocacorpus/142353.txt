So you can either ( 1 ) use this OR ( 2 ) emulate its behaviour using MMM-RemoteControl. ( 1 ) is properly documented I guess . For ( 2 ) you have to send the exact notification MMM-Button would have sent .

@@22372922 @2372922/ <h> Show SMS text message on Mirror <p> Hi , New to this forum so a general question . I would like to show SMS messages on my mirror , fed from my local server . My server is apache , php &amp; wordpress . The functionality works fine but for some messages I would like to forward the SMS and display on the mirror . Is this possible and if so how to approach it ? I have looked at MM-iFrame but can not get that to work . Any suggestions welcome . <p> @broberg Thanks for that . I did see the module , but as I understand it this will just notify that there is a message , rather than display it ? The intended use I have is to display the message because the viewer may not be able to use a mobile phone . I can send the message to my website and maybe forward it to the mirror from there perhaps using the wordpress api . This is much more complicated though . <p> @hawkesley reading the readme file tells you that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible . Install it and try it . Eitherway you need some app like pushbullet to forward the sms text to other devices . <p> @hawkesley Trying MMM-syslog but cant get access . This device is not allowed to access your mirror . Please check your config.js or config.js.sample to change this . I modified the whitelist as follows : e-mail : <p> To test , if MMM-syslog suits your requirements you could simply set ipWhitelist : , which will allow all connections . In addition you might want to check this thread . In your case you could try to add " 192.168.1.1/24 " to support IPv4

However the mouse/cursor seems disabled whenever I load the magic mirror .

@@22372931 @2372931/ <h> Screen capture on a Raspberry Pi <p> I had to look this one up myself today . For those of you wanting to do a screen capture on your MM2 on the raspberry pi , you can install the scrot package ( sudo apt-get install scrot ) and use it to do that . Simply issuing the scrot command from a terminal will take a screen capture of what 's being displayed and saves a PNG file in the current folder . You can also tell it where to put the file by issuing scrot /path/to/file.png - note you must put in a file name as well for this to work . <p> Now obviously you ca n't do that when MM2 is running , but you can do it through an SSH login to the raspberry pi . You will have to tell it which display to use : DISPLAY=:0 scrot /path/to/file.png . <p> Because I develop from a remote machine ( through SSH ) , the above command comes in handy because I can drop the file onto a shared folder and access it from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the screen whenever you want to show something on your MM installation .

@@22372951 @2372951/ <h> Calendar event dates enhancement <p> This is a request that was made by djsunrise19 on GitHub which i will quote below : <p> Hi , today I 've seen another behavior . I had an event at 16 o'clock . I looked on both ( MM1 and MM2 ) mirrors at 15 o'clock : MM1 : displays in 1 hour or in 45 minutes ( of course , 15minutes later ) MM- : displays today at 16 o'clock Is it possible to put this function from MM1 in your MM- app ? I know that is a personal feature . But in my opinion the MM1 solution fits way better . So you realize that the event is in the near future . Perhaps we can make that configurable . <p> This is my current take on it . I added a timeFormat config option that allows you to set it to ' absolute ' or ' relative ' . When set to ' relative ' the time display will look like this : <p> While in ' absolute ' format , it looks like this : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the next 48 hours and translates the event time into TODAY at ' or TOMORROW at ' . I added another check to see if an event it within the next 6 hours , which will change the time format to in x hours ' which will count down till the event happens : <p> This is all currently being worked on locally on my fork . Once done I 'll submit a pull request . But I 'd like to get feedback from others ( as well as from djsunrise19 who originally requested this . ) I 'd like to know what other enhancements/changes people would like to see . <p> One thing for me is how I like things displayed . I like the relative time , but only up to a point . For example , if I see an event that says in 2 days ' , that will get my attention versus if it said May 4th ' . Simply because I may not know what the current date is and see the absolute date wo n't mean much . However , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now , I do n't need it to say in 20 days ' . I 'm perfectly happy with it saying May 22nd ' on that . So i may add another option , maybe call it ' urgency ' and allow it to be configurable to what one would want . For me that would be a week , so that any event happening within a week , it would say in x days ' where everything else further away would display the absolute date . It 's a combination of having both absolute as well as relative dates displayed . That 's just my preference though . <p> Some day someone is going to have to explain to me how Moment.js thinks that Mother 's Day is 5 days from today . I 'm sure it 's semantics , but the way I see it , today is May 2nd , add 5 days it 's May 7th . That 's not Mother 's Day Mother 's day is on May 8th . I wonder if it 's saying 5 days because it 's less than 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ) . I think it should just say in 6 days ' and ignore calculating whether it needs to round up or down based on how many hours are left in the current day <p> I agree that there are many ( configurable ) possibilities on the way event dates are displayed . And what I 've learned in the past two years , is that there is n't one way everybody thinks it works like it should = <p> More importantly , the Calendar module turns out to be the most difficult module to make bug free , since so many differences in the calendar feed appear to mess up the date calculation . Most of the current bug reports are about the calendar module . So it might be a good Idea to first work out these bugs , before we make the calendar module even more difficult . <p> Any help with regards to bug solving ( in the form of pull requests ) are more than welcome ! <p> Correct , there will never be that one perfect solution for everyone , however that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person can do it their own way . <p> As for the problems , my take on that is that one will always have bugs crop up . Technology changes , web sites will rewrite their code that we might rely on , there wo n't ever be a time where you write something once and never ever change it again . Eventually Time will catch up and something has changed , forcing you to do the same . <p> My suggestion is to do what 's possible , fix what 's easily fixable ( including some of the easy requests ) , release the thing . Let future bugs be exactly that : future bugs . Address them as they come up . <p> Hi @KirAsh4 , yes , since a frew hours , I 'm here ; ) .

So let me rewrite it first and clean it up . <p> This is n't a bug per se , I just happen to notice it . So my setup consists of an rPi-3 running MM2 on a screen that sits on my desk , next to my main monitor pair ( I actually have 5 monitors on my desk if you count the laptop as well ) . Anyway , I do n't generally touch the main MM2 display on the rPi unless I have to . Now on my main system , I run MM2 in a browser by hitting the rPi 's MM 2port . This allows me to make changes to the code , reload it in the browser , and then compare the output from one screen to the other ( on the rPi which has not been reloaded with the changes yet . ) This works great <p> Well , today this caught my attention : <p> Both those birthdays happen on that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) So I made a change in my config to show more events so I can see all three birthdates . And for some reason , the sorting is different on the rPi versus the remote browser window . <p> Please note , this is n't a bug specifically , as all the data is there , and nothing 's getting mangled . This is purely a sorting thing between how Javascript runs on an rPi and how it runs on a different platform . On the rPi it 's in reverse order than what is displayed on my Windows machine .

It simply displays the same compliment endlessly . <p> I decided to dig into the issue . I will spare you the troubleshooting process , but I found out that the Compliments module will append the anytime ' compliment to the end of the existingcompliments array . So the compliments array gets longer every time it is updated . <p> The anytime ' compliments are appended to the end of the compliments array , which grows the array indefinitely . The random compliment function works as intended , but if the compliments array has 10 anytime ' compliments and 3 afternoon ' compliments , there 's a high chance that a anytime ' compliment will be chosen . The odds that an anytime ' compliment will be chosen goes up every update . <p> Why this happens is not clear to me at all . Looking at the code , the afternoon ' compliments should be added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be appended . The compliments array is initially set to null , and that works , but for some reason , when the afternoon ' compliments are assigned to the compliments array , the anytime compliments are included . Again , this does not make sense . ( It should n't be doing that ) <p> Make sure you change afternoon ' to whatever time of day it currently is . Then run npm start dev ' and watch the console on the right side of the screen . <p> What I saw ( in the dev console ) was that **33;299;TOOLONG displayed the correct compliments defined by the defaults or whatever external file I specified . However , the compliments array would somehow have the anytime ' compliments in it . Every time the program updated the compliments array , there would be one more set of anytime ' compliments at the end . <p> Using the same method of displaying the array at different points of program , I found out that the compliments array is being set to null initially . I ca n't for the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in there . <p> To eliminate even more variables , I renamed my /MagicMirror directory and downloaded and installed a new one . I put the lines above in the compliments.js file and I observed the same behavior . <p> Hopefully , I explained this issue well enough that other people can understand . I also hope that this is a simple fix or mistake on my end . I would be glad to provide any extra info that might be needed . Thank you for any assistance . <p> The way javascript handles variables are usually call by value , but for objects ( this includes arrays ) it is call by reference . <p> So what happens in line 104 is the following : The variable compliments does n't get cloned , so that the values are equal .

@@22373272 @2373272/ <p> I started out with an old HEAVY 30 " monitor that I bought from a friend with 1080p HDMI support . <p> Then of course I installed all of the required MagicMirror software on my RPi 3 model B with Canakit case . I added a 5v GPIO fan because I knew it was going to generate heat behind the mirror and the monitor puts off a TON of heat . I drilled holes on the top of the case to allow more air flow and screwed it into the top . I also attached two squid buttons : both with python scripts to run reboot command and shutdown commands : <p> I built the frame from 2x4 birchwood with 1x3 45deg angled cuts for the border and 1x4 for the back to allow for hanging ( no plan to hang as of right now ) . I used pre-drilled holes and Gorilla wood glue to hold in place . I also used wood putty to fill in the holes and gaps created by imperfect cuts of wood that I picked up at Lowes . Then I sanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by hand . I also drilled several venting holes for the heat to escape . Then I put about 2-too-many coats of wood stain on it . It was below freezing in my garage when it was drying so it cracked after I put the acrylic top-coat on it . I think it looks pretty cool like that anyway . It looks kind of like snake scales . <p> The glass I used was the 1/8 " acrylic from Tap Plastics . I 'll be honest , I 'm not that pleased with it . Since it 's acrylic , in certain places it looks like a fun house mirror , distorting the image " perhaps it 's not completely flat , but it works well enough . To cut 30 " piece was $67 + 16 for S&amp;H . I was n't willing to spend $150+ for the glass at twowaymirrors.com . Also there are a few small imperfections with the glass where the mirror coating had chipped off when I got it .

The top squid is for restart and the bottom for shutdown . I took my Kinobo mic , attached it to a USB extender and glued it to the back of the frame . <p> And that 's pretty much it ! The software has been the biggest hurdle . I 've had the hardest time getting the AlexaPi skill to stay working correctly . It was working amazingly the first time I installed it but every subsequent install it has gotten worse and I ca n't figure out why .

@@22373300 @2373300/ <p> This would be a crude way of doing it , by creating another module to manipulate the ones you want swapping . It 's crude , but it gets the job done . Ideally this would be just a routine that allows you to tell it which modules to swap , as opposed to them being hard coded like they are in this code . But , this is just to show that it 's possible . One caveat is that if one module is wider than the other , you will notice things on your screen jump around a bit . That 's just the way CSS works when an element gets removed , and the nature of the flexible regions that we use . <p> This code swaps the default calendar and clock modules every 10 seconds , with a 2 seconds fade delay . The ' config.js ' portion is simply : <p> module : ' myswap ' , , <p> and in ' modules/myswap/ ' I have the following file called ' myswap.js ' : <p> Yes , I understand about all the caveats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping less obvious . But that problem already exists if you place the news-ticker at bottomcenter , since it will vary between 2 and three lines . And I guess I could force the alternating modules to have the same width . <p> BTW : thanks for teaching how to program modules . I love learning this way . <p> The fading does n't make it less obvious . It happens because of the different sizes per module . Fade or not , you will see the other modules in the same region jump to adjust to the new sizing . Some days my calendar will have long entries , and it makes the clock above it move . So when I hide/show the calendar , the clock will jump back and forth . The regions being flexible is what allows for longer entries on the calendar to be seen , for example . Same with the news ticker as you 've discovered . Having fixed regions can cause other problems as well . <p> But , this should be a start for you . As I mentioned , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a function you can pass details to but I will leave that as an exercise for you . : ) <p> By the way , this works best if the two modules you are trying to swap are right below each other in the ' config.js ' file . For example , if you 're trying to swap ModA and ModB , your ' config.js ' should list them together <p> modules : module : ' ModA ' , , module : ' ModB ' , , , <p> if you have a ModC in between them , it wo n't swap ' properly , it 'll just turn them off in alternate fashion while keeping them in their respective location . So you 'll end up with : <p> Yep , what you did is pretty much the idea . You figured it out and used your modules in the code . It needs to be rewritten a bit to allow for configurable module names . Possibly also allow more than just 2 modules to be swapped . There are some other things I can think of but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list for me . It is sitting in my dev repository , but it 'll be a bit before I focus on it . I 'm glad what I wrote is helping you out though . 
@@22373301 @2373301/ <p> IMHO a visible transmittance of 11% is a little bit too less . I got my mirror from myspiegel.de with a transmittance of 20% , so for all customers in Europe myspiegel.de will be the right choice if the weight does n't matter . Because these mirrors have a thickness of 8mm . I bought there a mirror for 75G at a size of 650x430mm . <p> @prototype0815 Thanks for your reply ! We only sell 12 " x 24 " on Amazon in order to help with stocking . <p> We are finalizing a website for custom orders ( will still be US only ) so I 'll edit this comment when that is up and running . In the meantime you can contact **25;1097;TOOLONG for custom orders . <p> The glass is sanded , not polished , but we can potentially do polished for an additional cost . Point taken about the 20% transmittance being preferable , but 10% produces a pretty good effect too , I have attached a couple pictures showing samples . <p> Disclaimer : this is still US only so sounds like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
