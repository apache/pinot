I thought we lived in democracy where everyone is allowed to have a voice , and especially God ? I do not need public opinion , thank you in advance , I demand an explanation from the admin . My blingees do not violate any rules and I am treated like scum here . I would like to see if the person who disables my blingees would show themselves for everyone to see who is against religious freedom on this site , which , when I joined , was supposed to have been Christian . <p> Persoanlly , I think the reason why they were " disabled " , as you put it , was because some of your blingees was causing an uproar here . I 've read some of your blingees and to be honest , you are really in people 's face about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your " bible beating " people . You of all people should know better . God does n't tell us to " bible beat " people into believing in Him . No , quite the contrary . There is a time and a place for everything . And again , to be honest , this site really is n't an appropriate place for such in-your-face type of creations . And just to be clear , there have been other people on here who have had there blingees removed from the spotlight . If people are just adding blingees to the spotlight to incite discourse , then they run the risk of getting it booted . By the way , which blingees are you talking about anyway ? I 've seen several of your blingees in the spotlight today . And for future reference , it 's not a good idea to come in here and " demand " something . That a good way to start trouble . <p> Hi , thanks for responding , are you an admin of this site ? I would like to know who disables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... You are entitled to your opinion , I respect your opinion even if I disagree with it . Here are just a few of points I would like to make : 1 ) I do not have a single blingee with any Bible quotes ( and if I had it is not against blingee rules to promote them ) . Quotes I have are coming from Jesus and Our Lady who are giving messages to today 's world through a particular messenger . You are free to believe or disbelieve them , its a matter of faith and that is not the point . Every person 's right of expression is what matters . I saw atheists bashing Christians on this site from Spotlight and their blingees were not disabled . I do not bash atheists or anyone else in my blingees , as can be easily verified by looking at my blingees . My job is not to convince but to inform . None of my blingees have any offence in them , just some people find Christianity and particularly Christian morals offensive . That does happen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible because some people do n't like it ? Democracy so far worked this way that even opposing sides have a right of expression . That is called pluralism , freedom of speech . You do n't have to agree or disagree with another 's point of view for it to be valid , as long as there is no personal attack made on anyone . Remember the saying ( right to say it " . Again , if that was the rule of this website : no blingees on Christian morals , for example , then , although sad , at least it would make sense . At the moment it makes no sense because if a blingee does not break any blingee rules I do not see how it can be disabled . Rules exist for us so we know where we are and rules exist for admin too to prevent any abuse of power ( which is what I believe happened on several occasions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blingees were disabled without any explanation , I feel it is time to demand it , since it is not freely given . If it was freely given and I was satisfied - I would n't be demanding it . <p> 3 ) I would like to be told exactly why the above blingee was disabled , to be shown a blingee rule that admin thinks I broke . I would then like an independent admin ( not the same that did it ) to review all my blingees that were disabled in the same way . 4 ) I would also like to know what happened to the money I paid for putting these blingees in the spotlight . It seems logical that if a blingee is rejected from spotlight when I did not break any rules , it is only fair that the money should be paid back . Thank you in advance , I still hope this can be resolved and I can be treated fairly . <p> Two more of my blingees are again disabled : LONG ... and LONG ... One of the admins here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my other blingees ) is a hater of Christianity . A person who is happy to violate other people 's freedom of speech should not be allowed to be admin . I am expecting that this should be resolved ASAP and the person who did it should really come up and show themselves so we know who they are . I am in the open and she/he is hiding . That is how all abuse is done . If the case is not resolved within reasonable timeframe , I reserve my right to tell people on every social network that Blingee.com is persecuting Christians . I have 3238 subscribers and 3 million views on Youtube , 3700 followers on Twitter , over 13 000 page followers on Facebook . I also have connections with high profile people in Christian and prolife community , including lawyers and journalists . I am patient and would like to believe that not every admin on this site is against religious freedom and that together they will resolve this case . I believe in the good will of the majority of people . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people make mistakes and I have no intention of hurting anyone 's pride . If the case is resolved ( my blingees are no longer disabled since they do not violate any blingee rules ) , all will be forgiven and I would not speak of it again . Peace . <p> I am not an administrator for this site and I have n't been disabling your blingees . I have nothing to do with how this site is run . I 'm just a normal member who wanted to express their view . And my view is this : You are entitled to your opinion if you want , but everyone else is entitled to theirs and do not appreciate you forcing your beliefs on them . Blingee is supposed to be a fun creative space for people to create art and get along . Of course people are going to take offence if you 're constantly posting blingees saying that their way of life is wrong . <p> Their is only 1 person who owns this site and makes the decisions about removing blingees from the spotlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from many different counties and their are all kinds of different religions on this site . <p> lumi-anime-girl , Well said ; - ) PolinaM : I think this has gone on long enough . You just do n't come in here and start demanding things . And now you 're threatening to tell everyone that this site is against " persecuting Chritians ? ? ? Are you kidding me ! ! ? ? ( that 's a rhetorical question ) . Perhaps you should send the BlingeeTeam an email through the " contact " link ( located at the bottom of your Blingee page ) . By the way , the BlingeeTeam built this site for fun . I found a couple of sites where you can post your views : LONG ... http : **27;0;TOOLONG http : **28;29;TOOLONG Maybe those sites are better suited for your needs . <p> I am sorry but I am not interested in anti-Christian personal opinions , I can ask a few Christians to write here in my support and it will be your word against theirs . However , in my view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only question that should be answered and has not yet been answered is how my blingees violate Blingee rules . Because if they do not ( and they do not ) the next question is how can it be allowed to disable them at one person 's will . Please also remember that the money was taken from me for the service that was not provided ( blingee in spotlight ) . Money has not been returned to me . Today you do n't defend other people 's rights , when you are in charge and in a position to do so , tomorrow none will defend yours . ++++++++++++++++ Next part of the message is purely for the person in charge who disables my blingees , not for anyone else : I know many good people left Blingee.com in the past year or so because of bad administration . This is another case to add to that . If you are a Blingee admin who disables my blingees are also the only person who can review my appeal then the system is properly corrupted ( or shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there will be other people . Blingee.com has seen a steady decline in popularity . If you do not see the reason is bad administration , the site will continue to decline . When I joined Blingee site around 2009 admins were Christians , and it was common knowledge that it was a Christian site . NONE of my Christian blingees ever got disabled , including the same one that got disabled just a couple of days ago . Disabling Christian blingees is working against God , and you can not expect to do that and still prosper . Take it or leave it , I have warned you . <p> Okay again , I do n't know who told you this but you were misinformed . This is NOT and has NEVER been a Christian site ! It is an unbiased site open to any religion . Nobody is persecuting Christians . There are a lot of blingees with Christian images that are not removed because they are not offensive . But yours are because you are persecuting other groups of people . How do you think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they 're sick of seeing such confrontational blingees in the spotlight . Guardian06 was nice enough to try and explain WHY your blingees have been removed , and even suggested some Christian sites for you . But clearly you ca n't handle this maturely and instead throw empty accusations at her and other Blingee staff , as well as use threats .

But most of them have nothing written next to them at all . When there 's just a blank space next to them , what does that mean ? Have they been accepted ? Were they rejected ? <p> Hello lumi-anime-girl , The only thing that I can see with all your blingees , is that you seem to have a signature style on all of them . There 's nothing really wrong with that in it of itself . However , when it comes to the postcards , people have a tendancy to treat it like they do the competitions . Some people seem to think that whatever they throw into the comps , they can also throw also into postcards . The postcards are a bit more specific than the competitions . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure they would get rid of it . <p> But the postcards are not meant to be accepted based on blingee users . It is meant to be the decision of the blingee-team . I have already pointed out that the signatures should n't be a problem since there are many other postcards with signatures on them . Some of them have signatures that are bigger and clearer than mine . Also , every blingee I have submitted to postcards has fitted into that category and has not been offensive . There is NO reason at all why any of the blingees I gave as an example should have been rejected ! <p> I apologize for the misunderstanding . What I meant by " signature style " is that all the links you posted ( that were yours ) , have the same artistic style . I know that the BlingeeTeam is looking for unique styles for postcards . My suggestion to you would be to look through the postcards that have been accepted , and maybe get a feel of what they 're looking for . Mind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to make it into the postcards . At least you 'll have a better shot at it . People need to realize that not all of their creations are going to make it in . <p> That 's a completely ridiculous reason for blingees to be rejected from postcards . So even if they fit the category and do n't break any rules , they wo n't be accepted unless blingee-team thinks they 're good enough or likes them ? That explains why all the postcards seem to be by the same few people . Proof that the blingee-team is incredibly biased . I am appalled .

@@40818339 @818339/ <h> The Lost City of Atlantis <p> " When the great gods divided the Cosmos between them , Poseidon the Lord of the Ocean took possession of a chain of islands stretching from Spain to central America . The largest of these islands was as big as the whole of Asia Minor . When Poseidon inspected his new domain he found the islands to be more beautiful than anywhere else in the world . Every leaf on every tree glistened as brilliantly as an emerald , and the rolling pasturelands were as sleek and green as the waves of a summer sea . The flowers were so richly scented that they made the warm air as intoxicating as wine . Great herds of tame cattle grazed the pastures , the water in the streams was as clear as crystal and as fragrant as clover , while the hillsides shone with veins of white , black , and red marble and with deposits of every kind of precious metal . The great god discovered that the people of the islands were singularly handsome and intelligent , but so newly created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not even given a name to their island home . As Poseidon explored the land he came to a hill rising from the very center of the largest island , and he climbed through its flowering forests until , close to summit , he found the abode of the most beautiful woman he had ever seen . She told him her name was Cleito . The dazzling glance of her sea-blue eyes , and the sumptuous beauty of her face and form , aroused such lust in the potent deity that he conquered her without delay . She responded ardently to his power and splendour and in due course bore him ten fine sons . They named the firstborn Atlas , and Poseidon named the islands and the surrounding ocean in honour of his son . They became Atlantis while the oceanis the Atlantic . Poseidon is the most violent and most jealous of the gods , distrustful of all mortals including Cleito , and so he isolated her upon her hill by digging three great moats around it . Each was about a kilometre wide , and separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same width . Thus the Hill of Cleito was surrounded by great concentric circles of land and water . When Poseidon 's ten sons grew to maturity he made them all into kings , each with responsibility for one-tenth of Atlantis . Under his orders they formed themselves into a council , led by Atlas , to rule the nation for the benefit of all its people . The Atlanteans were so vigorous and intelligent , so adept at developing their arts and technology and so industrious in exploiting the resources of the islands , that they soon established the world 's first and finest civilisation . With Poseidon 's permission , and under the guidance of the ten kings , they built a magnificent city upon the circles of earth surrounding the Hill of Cleito . Atlantean architects used the red , black and white marble of their county to design buildings of dazzling splendour , with the three colours artfully blended or contrasted to attract and please the eye . On the hill of Cleito they built her a great palace , and this together with the palaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazed with inlays of gold and precious stones . The principle temple to Poseidon was the wonder of all the world . The pinnacled roof was so high that clouds drifted around its spires , and it contained an enormous image of Poseidon riding in his chariot attended by sea nymphs and dolphins . The unique beauty of the city , on its circles of land linked by great bridges across the circles of water , was further enhanced by brilliant gardens , groves of flowering trees , and innumerable sparkling fountains . Great universities , observatories , libraries , laboratories and academies for people of all ages showed that Atlantis was the well-spring of human arts and sciences . Portions of the city were devoted to commerce and industry , because the Atlanteans used the discoveries of their scientists and technologists as the basis of a flourishing trade with other nations . They dug a great canal from the city to the sea , so that ships could sail right up to the water-circles and pass from one to another by tunnels dug through the land-circles .

The greatest of these festivals was staged once every five years , when the ten kings assembled in Poseidon 's temple for their quinquennial parliament . While they deliberated , stockmen drove a number of splendid bulls in from the outlying ranches and corralled them within the temple grounds . Great crowds assembled to admire these monstrous animals with their sleek hides and sword-like crescent horns , while warriors and nobleman prepared for the bull-hunt . When the parliament was over , the bulls were released and the hunters chased them barehanded through the temple grounds , dodging their charges as they attempted to seize one and throw it to the ground .

The other bulls were taken back to their ranches and the festival concluded with a great public banquet . The scientists and technocrats of Atlantis were not jealous of their skills and learning .

They taught the Egyptians and the Mayans how to build pyramids and the Greeks how to construct Atlantes , the sculptured figures of males which support the architraves of temples and other buildings . They spread their knowledge of metallurgy , astronomy , medicine , magnetism , and many other arts and sciences , wherever the ships of Atlantis could sail . They invented reading and writing , mathematics , agriculture , architecture , and all the concepts of human civilisation .

But , about 1200 centuries ago , the parliament of the the Ten Kings began to alter its attitude towards the outside world . In one of the quinquennial parliaments , the kings decided that it was not enough for the Atlanteans to spread their civilisation far and wide . Those who benefited from the Atlantean technocracy should also become its subjects and pay tribute to their imperial masters . Thus the Atlanteans embarked upon the conquest of the world . their ships took expeditionary forces to Central and South America , where they overwhelmed the Incas , Aztecs , and Mayas and sent rich booty back to Atlantis . Another force conquered the whole of North Africa , and regrouped in Egypt so that they might invade Greece and then sweep eastwards through the kingdoms of Asia . In about 9500 BC , a great Atlantean invasion fleet sailed into the bat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resist them . When the two armies clashed the arrows flew in such clouds that they darkened the sky , the hooves of the chariot horses were like thunder upon Olympus , the brazen armour of the Atlanteans dazzled the eye and their spearheads seemed as multitudinous as wheat growing in a field . But the Athenians fought desperately in defence of their city-state and at last the massed batalions of Atlantis faltered , fell back , and turned in headlong retreat towards their ships . The Atlantean fleet was about to set sail when the whole sky turned the colour of dry blood , and a mass of black clouds swept across it with such a dreadful sound as had never been heard before . The seas rose in gigantic waves which swallowed the entire fleet , while the whole world reverberated with earthquakes and the ocean roared and rushed from one sea to another like water swilling around in an immense bowl . For days on end it seemed the whole Cosmos would fly apart . The skies deluged the earth with water , the mountains shuddered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monstrous waves . When at last the seas became calm again a few battered ships crept into port . They brought the news that Atlantis had disappeared , and that the Atlantic Ocean rolled over the place where this magnificent empire once flourished in all its glory . Ever since those days , historians have debated the reason why Atlantis was obliterated . Some say that Poseidon was angered by the Athenian victory , and punished his people with total destruction . Others say that an Atlantean scientist had discovered the forbidden secrets of the Cosmos , and released the forces which may eventually destroy the whole of mankind . " ---

Said to have been born of sea-foam . She is kind to those she liked , but can be cruel and merciless to those who displease her . She married Hephaestos , had an affair with Ares , and was caught . Aphrodite is the daughter of Zeus and Dione , and mother of Eros . Her animal totems are the dove , sparrow , swan , and swallow . Plants sacred to her are myrtle , poppy , rose , and apple . She symbolizes feminine prowess , sexuality , relationships , flower magic . Though Aphrodite was married to the ugly Smith God , Hephaestus , it was not by her choice but by arrangement of Hera . Her true love was Ares , the God of War . The two conceived three children : Phobus , Deimus , and Harmonia . They were also said to have been the parents of Eros and Anteros . Another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From his birth , she placed him in the care of Persephone , who also fell in love with him and refused to give him back when the time came .

Zeus made her fall in love with Anchises as a punishment , and she warned him never to reveal that Aeneas was her son . Being a mere mortal , he could n't keep his mouth shut and was stricken with blindness and paralysis . Hephaestus was fully aware of Aphrodite and Ares ' ongoing affair but could do nothing about . He did , however , conceive a plan to capture them together in a net made of gold and showed them to the other Olympians . Most of them were embarrassed for the two or refused to get involved . Aphrodite ended up sleeping with Hermes as a kind of " thank you " for freeing her . This union resulted in a child named Hermaphroditus . Aphrodite , in Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterpart of the Roman Venus . In Homer 's Iliad she is said to be the daughter of Zeus and Dione , one of his consorts , but in later legends she is described as having sprung from the foam of the sea and her name may be translated foam-risen . In Homeric legend Aphrodite is the wife of the lame and ugly god of fire , Hephaestus . Among her lovers was Ares , god of war , who in later mythology became her husband . She was the rival of Persephone , queen of the underworld , for the love of the beautiful Greek youth Adonis . Perhaps the most famous legend about Aphrodite concerns the cause of the Trojan War . Eris , the goddess of discord , the only goddess not invited to the wedding of King Peleus and the sea nymph Thetis , resentfully tossed into the banquet hall a golden apple , marked for the fairest .

Probably Oriental in origin , Aphrodite was identified in early Greek religious beliefs with the Phoenician Astarte and was known as Aphrodite Urania , queen of the heavens , and as Aphrodite Pandemos , goddess of the people . Of all the goddesses of ancient mythology , none was more widely venerated than the goddess of love . The Greeks called her Aphrodite . The Romans worshiped her as Venus .

To this day , this is the largest nuclear weapon detonated . This website was created after the 50 year anniversary of the detonation and you can find here videos of the detonation , maps of the location as well as some interesting facts . The 27-tonne Soviet Tsar Bomba ( king of bombs ) was the most powerful weapon constructed . Officially named AN602 hydrogen bomb , it was originally intended to have a yield of 100 megatons , but this would have posed problems with the radioactive fallout. the explosion of tsar bombaLater , the Tsar Bomba was reduced to have a yield of only 50 megatons of TNT .

The bomb served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too heavy to carry and there was no plane able to do intercontinental flights with such a load . History of development The idea of creating a bomb of this power first appeared on July 10 1961 in a meeting between Khrushchev and the senior weapon designer , Andrei Sakharov . Initially , the bomb should have had a yield of 100 megatons , but this was changed in a later stage since a bomb that big would have posed serious safety issues and it would have affected inhabited parts of northern Soviet Union . The development of the Tsar Bomba was rushed , since Nikita Khrushchev wanted the bomb to be detonated during the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party held between October 17 and October 31 1961 . The development team consisting of Victor Adamskii , Yuri Babaev , Yuri Smirnov and Yuri Trutnev had little time to prepare the bomb so they rushed everything .

Since the Tsar Bomba was too big , the Tu-95 had to be slightly modified ; the bomb doors had to be removed .

Detonation The plane piloted by Andrei Durnovtsev dropped the Tsar Bomba at 11:32 AM Moscow time , from a height of 6.5 miles ( 10.5 km ) over Mityushikha Bay in Novaya Zemlya . The bomb detonated at a height of 2.5 miles ( 4 km ) . The descent from the height it was dropped from until the place of the detonation at 4,000 meters above ground took 188 seconds , just enough time for the pilot , Andrei Durnovtsev to fly to a safe distance .

Capricorn sets high goals for yourself and then you overcome whatever obstacles may appear between you and the top of your personal mountain . As Capricorn climbs the ladder of success , your ambition pushes you forward . Status can be important to Capricorn and often , at the top of your game , you gain personal satisfaction by knowing that others respect you for what you have accomplished . Capricorn can dance out on the edge of a cliff , but will never fall . Why ? Stability plays an important role , but so does practice . As a typical Capricorn , you may appear reckless , but chances are that your actions will have been very well planned , and probably also rehearsed .

It reveals the purpose for His coming . The Bible says that Jesus came to keep every commandment of God ( Matthew 5:17-18 ) ; to bear witness unto the truth ( John 18:37 ) ; to reveal to man his sinful condition ( John 15:22 ) ; to call sinners to repentance ( Luke 5:32 ) .

( Luke 19:10 ) Jesus Christ did not come to establish a religion , work miracles , set an example , or teach beautiful truths , though He did all those things .

The ultimate purpose for His coming was to die on a cross for your sins and mine ( John 12:27-33 ) , then rise again to offer us forgiveness and everlasting life . ( Romans 4:25 ) Jesus came because you and I are sinners who fall short of the glory of God ( Romans 3:23 ) and have no hope of reaching Heaven on the basis of anything we can do- good deeds , church membership , baptism , charity , etc .

Bruner must battle the state lawyer , as well as her own doubts , as she realizes that her career so far has not fulfilled her . She takes the case , albeit reluctantly , because she believes it will elevate her to senior partner at her law firm . The priest agrees to let her defend him only if he is allowed to tell Emily 's story . The trial begins with the calling of several medical experts by the prosecutor , Ethan Thomas ( Campbell Scott ) . One expert testifies that Emily was suffering from both epilepsy and psychosis . The defense contests that she may have actually been possessed , though Bruner is careful never to say that in so many words initially . Indeed Bruner explains that Emily was suffering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Father Moore as well as her family realized this and tried to help in another way . Several flashbacks show how this began . Alone in her dorm room one night , at 3:00 AM , Emily catches on to a strange burning smell coming from the hallway . When she checks on it , she sees the door open and shut by itself several times . When she goes back to her room , she sees a jar of pencils and pens move by itself . Additionally , her covers roll themselves down and a great weight seems to press down on her , a force which also proceeds to choke her and seemingly to possess her momentarily . Through these episodes she wonders if they are really happening or if they are just hallucinations . She suffers more visions , is hospitalized , and diagnosed with epilepsy . She is given anti-seizure medications , which she claims do not work . Her visions continue , as do her severe bodily contortions . She leaves school and returns to live with her parents . She and her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is possessed by demons . They ask for their local parish priest to be called in to perform an exorcism , and the Church agrees . The prosecution argues that all this could be explained by a combination of epilepsy ( the contortions ) and psychosis ( the visions ) . Meanwhile , Bruner begins to experience strange occurrences in her apartment at 3:00 AM , including strange smells and sounds . Father Moore warns her that she may be targeted by demons for possibly exposing them . Later in the film Father Moore explains that 3:00 AM is the " witching hour , " which evil spirits use to mock the Holy Trinity . Significantly , it is the opposite of 3:00 PM , traditionally taken to be the hour at which Jesus died . Seeing that the prosecution is putting up a seemingly solid medical case , Bruner decides to try to show that Emily may have actually been possessed . She calls in a professor in anthropology and psychiatry , Dr. Sadira Adani - who teaches at Northwestern University - to testify about various cultures ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A Separate Reality as means to understand the subject . She suggests that Emily was a hypersensitive . On these suggestions the prosecutor strongly objects , and calls the testimony a pseudoscientific analysis . A medical doctor present during the exorcism comes forward to reveal an audio tape made during the rite . The priest is then called to the stand to testify . The tape is played and the movie then flashes back to the exorcism . It is performed on Halloween night , because Father Moore believes it might be easier to draw out the demons on that night . The priest , Emily 's friend , and her father are in the room . Emily is tied to the bed , and the priest uses holy water and various words from the Rituale Romanum . Emily speaks in tongues , including Latin , German , Ancient Greek , Hebrew , and Aramaic . Several cats run into the room , jumping on the priest and knocking him down . Emily breaks her ties and jumps out the window , running into the barn . They follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more supernatural phenomena such as unnatural gusts of wind and demonic screams and voices . The demon inside Emily refuses to name itself after repeated demands from the presiding Father , but finally reveals contemptuously that there are not one but six demons . They go on to identify themselves in dramatic fashion , naming themselves one after another in dual voices from Emily . They identify themselves as the demons that possessed Cain , Nero , and Judas Iscariot and one of the Legion . Beyond that two demons name themselves directly as Belial , and " Lucifer , the devil in the flesh . " The film returns to the court room . The priest says that after this , Emily refused another exorcism but also refused to take her anti-psychotic medication , having accepted her fate . She died a few weeks later . The prosecutor contends that her speaking in tongues can be explained by her having gone through Catholic Catechism , in which she could have learned the ancient languages , and that she had studied German in high school . The priest admits that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bruner then wants to call the doctor as a witness , but he does not show . She walks outside and sees him on the street . He says he can no longer testify , but he does believe in demons . Before he can explain he is hit by a car and killed . Later that night Bruner 's boss tells her she has ruined the whole trial and that if she recalls the priest to the stand , she will be fired . Nevertheless , Bruner calls the priest back to the stand the next day . He reads a letter that Emily wrote before she died . In the letter Emily describes another vision she had , the morning after the exorcism . She walks out of the house and sees the Virgin Mary , who tells her that although the demons will not leave her , she can leave her body and end her suffering . However , the apparition goes on to say : if Emily returns to her body , she will help to prove to the world that God and the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter by saying : " People say that God is dead . But how can they think that if I show them the devil ? " She then receives stigmata , which the priest believes is a sign of God 's love for her . But the prosecution counters that she could have received the stigmata wounds from a barbed wire fence . Father Moore is ultimately found guilty ; however , on a recommendation from the jury , the judge agrees to a sentence of time served . In modern American legal practice , juries are only allowed to answer questions specifically directed to them , though sometimes they are asked separately to sentence defendants . The jury 's recommendation in this fictional case does not follow American practice . Bruner is offered a partnership at her firm for saving Father Moore from extended jail time . But she refuses and , in fact , quits . She goes with Father Moore to Emily 's grave , where he has put a quote ( which Emily recited to him the day before she died ) from the second chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out your own salvation with fear and trembling .

She was a three-time Olympic Champion ( 1928 , 1932 , 1936 ) , a ten-time World Champion ( 1927-1936 ) and a six-time European Champion ( 1931-1936 ) . Henie won more Olympic and World titles than any other ladies figure skater . At the height of her acting career she was one of the highest paid movie stars in Hollywood.Sonja Henie occupied a unique position in Hollywood history , Johnny Weissmuller comes closest to it in male stars . But Weissmuller was an American citizen albeit that he was born in Rumania . Henie like Weissmuller was the unchallenged champion of her sport figureskating , but there was far more to her story than that .

In addition to the income from the fur business , both of Henie 's parents had inherited wealth . Wilhelm Henie had been a one-time World Cycling Champion and the Henie children were encouraged to take up a variety of sports at a young age . Henie initially showed talent at skiing , and then followed her older brother Leif to take up figure skating . As a girl , Henie was also a nationally-ranked tennis player and a skilled swimmer and equestrienne . Once Henie began serious training as a figure skater , her formal schooling ended . She was educated by tutors , and her father hired the best experts in the world , including the famous Russian ballerina Tamara Karsavina , to transform his daughter into a sporting celebrity. //// Henie won her first major competition , the senior Norwegian championships , at the age of 9 .

But by the next Olympiad , she needed no such assistance . Henie won the first of an unprecedented ten World Figure Skating Championships in 1927 at the age of fourteen , and her first Olympic gold medal the following year . She also won six consecutive European championships . Towards the end of her career , she began to be strongly challenged by younger skaters including Hedy Stenuf and Cecilia Colledge , but she held off these competitors to win her third Olympic title at the 1936 Winter Olympics . During her competitive career , Henie traveled widely and worked with a variety of foreign coaches . At home in Oslo , she trained at Frogner Stadium , where her coaches included Hjordis Olsen and Oscar Holte . During the latter part of her competitive career she was coached primarily by the American Howard Nicholson in London . In addition to traveling to train and compete , she was much in demand as a performer at figure skating exhibitions in both Europe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that police had to be called out for crowd control on her appearances in various disparate cities such as Prague and New York . It was an open secret that , in spite of the strict amateurism requirements of the time , Wilhelm Henie demanded " expense money " for his daughter 's skating appearances . Both of Henie 's parents had given up their own pursuits in Norway " leaving Leif to run the fur business " in order to accompany Sonja on her travels and act as her managers . Henie is credited with being the first figure skater to adopt the short skirt costume in figure skating , and make use of dance choreography . Her innovative skating techniques and glamorous demeanor transformed the sport permanently and confirmed its acceptance as a legitimate sport in the Winter Olympics. ////After the 1936 World Figure Skating Championships , Henie gave up her amateur status and took up a career as a professional performer in acting and live shows . While still a girl , Henie had decided that she wanted to move to Hollywood and become a movie star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thick accent might hinder her acting ambitions . In 1936 , following a successful ice show in Los Angeles orchestrated by her father to launch her film career , Hollywood studio chief Darryl Zanuck signed her to a long term contract at Twentieth Century Fox which made her one of the highest-paid actresses of the time . After the success of her first film , One in a Million , Henie 's position was assured and she became increasingly demanding in her business dealings with Zanuck . Henie also insisted on having total control of the skating numbers in her films . In addition to her film career at Fox , Henie formed a business arrangement with Arthur Wirtz , who produced her touring ice shows under the name of " Hollywood Ice Revue " . Wirtz also acted as Henie 's financial advisor . At the time , figure skating and ice shows were not yet an established form of entertainment in the United States . Henie 's popularity as a film actress attracted many new fans and instituted skating shows as a popular new entertainment . Throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skating extravaganzas at Rockefeller Center 's Center Theatre attracting millions of ticket buyers . At the height of her fame , her shows and touring activities brought Henie as much as $2 million per year . She also had numerous lucrative endorsement contracts , and deals to market skates , clothing , jewelry , dolls , and other merchandise branded with her name . These activities made her one of the wealthiest women in the world in her time . Henie broke off her arrangement with Wirtz in 1950 and for the next three seasons produced her own tours under the name " Sonja Henie Ice Revue " . It was an ill-advised decision to set herself up in competition with Wirtz , whose shows now featured the new Olympic champion Barbara Ann Scott . Since Wirtz controlled the best arenas and dates , Henie was left playing smaller venues and markets already saturated by other touring ice shows such as Ice Capades .

Henie was drinking heavily at that time and could no longer keep up with the demands of touring , and this marked her retirement from skating . At the time of her death , Henie was planning a comeback for a television special that would have aired in January 1970 . In 1938 , she published her autobiography , which was republished in a revised edition in 1954. ////NAZY CONTROVERSY : : : : : : Henie 's connections with Adolf Hitler and other high-ranking Nazi officials made her the subject of controversy before , during , and after World War II .

She did not repeat the salute at the Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen , but after the Games she accepted an invitation to lunch with Hitler at his resort home in nearby Berchtesgaden , where Hitler presented Henie with an autographed photo with a lengthy inscription . After beginning her film career , Henie kept up her Nazi connections , for example personally arranging with Joseph Goebbels for the release of her first film , One in a Million , in Germany . During the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany , German troops saw Hitler 's autographed photo prominently displayed in the Henie family home . As a result , none of Henie 's properties in Norway were confiscated or damaged by the Germans . Henie became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1941 . Like many Hollywood stars , she supported the U.S. war effort through USO and similar activities , but she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making public statements against the Nazis .

You do n't get to make the rules on here . Stop trying to act all high and mighty and justified . Your views are just that , your views .

You do not have the right to choose what is accepted in accordance to BLINGEE RULES and say everyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with the rules go make your own RATED G Disney site somewhere else and enforce your own rules there . Then and only then can you can play God and dictate on your own site . Until then , please stop trying to shove your views down everyone else 's throats and making them behave according to YOUR rules . It 's not your site and you are not God or the Owner of this Site . Respect the people who made it ! Moderator does n't make you better than everyone else . You are just a user with moderator privileges . Respect your role and function like a responsible and FAIR moderator or stop being one , period . And please do not throw children up in my face , you stated a few paragraphs up even if it were n't for children ... meaning you DO NOT approve and it has nothing to do with children . Stop using them as an excuse !

I absolutely , 100% agree with Kelly ! And , let me clarify , since I have been a moderator on here since 2007 , the stamps that need to be deleted must show actually GENITALIA or BARE BREASTS ! Now , the last one that was displayed above ( the gothic one , I did n't copy the link ) where the woman is looking in a mirror and her breasts are showing in the mirror , that DOES cross the lines of Blingee rules , and I would think that it was probably missed by a moderator because it 's easy to miss the breasts if you look quickly .

Although kids use it , there is n't supposed to be ANY CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 13 ! ! ! I just want to make one more point . According to The Blingee Terms of Use ( WHICH EVERY SINGLE USER WITH A PROFILE AGREED TO , Section 5 , sub-paragraph E : " ...

Skin showing and no clothes does not fall under blingee nudity , as long as the PARTS are not showing ! That 's what they are using nudity as . Furthermore , an image showing the top of a butt and exposed back while a sheet drapes over her bottom half is okay .... her whole butt showing IS NOT okay ! Wait , are whole butts allowed ? Glo , you called the goth chicks breasts showing as the offense but her butt is okay ? And MOONING is not sexual and some people think even funny/fun when orchestrated in the right manner ! Though I find mooning offensive , I can certainly see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! ... especially 16 year old boys ! So they should not think it 's funny because it might offend little ol ' me ?

So am I supposed to just turn off my taste because you do n't like it ? Especially when BT says I CAN make blingees of burlesque dancers , why do you think you get the ultimate say that I ca n't when I say that I can and will ? GET REAL .

Of course we need moderators because some people do genuinely post offensive and inappropriate blingees . It 's rare but it does happen . The problem now is pretty much anyone can sign up to be a moderator and some people are moderating based on their own views rather than blingee rules . It 's really sad to see so many wonderful blingees staying as unranked and not being able to be a part of challenges and contests , just because someone has rejected them even though they do n't break any rules . And blingee-team do n't seem to be around anymore to approve them , so these blingees just stay unranked . It 's quite worrying that this is happening . Recently I made a few stamps using GIMP.They 're animated and they 're not fully nude , but some of them have revealing clothes so I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be rejected , or even worse if I make a blingee with them it might stay unranked and never be able to be used in a contest . <p> Lumi , just moderate them yourself . As soon as you upload them click moderate down at the bottom and get to the queue fast . That way you know they 'll get through this stupid Bull CRAP . Sadly now , I just told anyone who would ACTUALLY upload truly offensive PORN how to beat a dishonest moderator and I fully expect to see the repercussions because of dishonest moderators and the true offenders getting away with murder all thanks to BAD moderators ! Sad when we have to take the rightful law into our own hands just to beat abusive vigilantes ! <p> Thanks Kelly , and yes , it 's sad that we have to take such measures to assure our works get published . Technically there should not be any child on any site without adult supervision . A child should have an adult supervising while learning how to use blingee and navigating the program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . Each time I have always been with them . The Stamps for Challenges are normally for adults not children , and they do follow the blingee rules-there is no nudity involved . <p> @Mystique I would if I could . I have two accounts on blingee and the main one I use I applied to be a moderator years ago . For some reason it does n't work anymore and wo n't let me moderate anything , but at the same time it wo n't let me sign up to be a moderator again . I 've just signed up to be a moderator again on this account and I managed to do a little bit , but once again it seems to have stopped working . I do n't know whether it is an error to do with the computer I 'm using , or if it 's an error that happens on some people 's accounts and I 'm just unfortunate enough to have it happen twice , but that seems to be the case . I would be completely unbiased and would n't reject loads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't moderate . Yet some people can but they continuously reject blingees and stamps that are fine . It 's incredibly unfair but I do n't think there 's anything I can do about it . <p> Lumi , what is it that you see when you click moderate ? If there 's just a big okay button and nothing there , it is n't a bug . There is nothing in the queue to moderate . Most of the time I have nothing sitting in the queue but once in a while there is something . So it might not be a bug , just nothing there . <p> On this account there is just a big okay button as you said , so I guess that means there is n't anything in the queue . Every now and then on this account there is something in my queue . I just checked now and accepted a few stamps so it 's working fine on this one . I have another account , my main one , and no matter how many times I check there is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blingee or just uploaded a stamp there is nothing in the queue on that one . And I have a message that says something like " Your moderating is automatically tracked to your computer " I seem to have a lot of bugs on my other account which is a real pain because that 's the main one I use and the one where I have a large circle . <p> By the way , what is the correct response when a blingee or stamp appears in the moderating queue and it is n't there anymore because it 's been deleted ? I just had one and I just left it as " accept " since there is n't anything offensive because it 's no longer there . But it seems weird to accept something that 's been deleted anyway . <p> Usually , that 's all I see too , Lumi . : ) Once in a while something is there . I think there 's someone who moderates a lot more than most and probably gets the brunt of it . You 'll see to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually has the highest number of blingees moderated . I never wasted my time with those deleted ones . I just let it stay defaulted to accept . I never thought much about it . : ) I see your point though . Hmmm . I 'd say if it bothers you , reject it : ) . I 'm not 100% positive but I think in that case , even if it has been accepted and from what I have seen from the tons of stamps I 've deleted because of things being wrong , they are gone . The ones that ' ghost ' and remain with that ' error ' type of message are ones that have been here forever . For some reason those will stick around but newer ones are removed . 
@@40818785 @818785/ <h> Merry Christmas ( Birth of Jesus ) <p> The True Meaning of Christmas : ) The Bible tells us that 2000 years ago Jesus Christ came into the world ; that God took upon Himself a body of human flesh and made His appearance on this earth in Bethlehem 's manger. ( 1 Timothy 3:16 ; Philippians 2:5-8 ; John 1:1-14 ; Luke 2:1-20 ) But beyond the fact that He came , the Bible tells us something very important . It tells us WHY Jesus came . It reveals the purpose for His coming . The Bible says that Jesus came to keep every commandment of God ( Matthew 5:17-18 ) ; to bear witness unto the truth ( John 18:37 ) ; to reveal to man his sinful condition ( John 15:22 ) ; to call sinners to repentance ( Luke 5:32 ) .

( Luke 19:10 ) Jesus Christ did not come to establish a religion , work miracles , set an example , or teach beautiful truths , though He did all those things . Jesus Christ did not come so we could celebrate His birth , though many enjoy doing so . The ultimate purpose for His coming was to die on a cross for your sins and mine ( John 12:27-33 ) , then rise again to offer us forgiveness and everlasting life . ( Romans 4:25 ) Jesus came because you and I are sinners who fall short of the glory of God ( Romans 3:23 ) and have no hope of reaching Heaven on the basis of anything we can do- good deeds , church membership , baptism , charity , etc . ( Ephesians 2:8-9 ) .

@@40818796 @818796/ <h> When is a blingee indecent ? <p> I keep wondering what standards of decency in blingees BT is keeping . I see stamps and blingees with women in black leather suits , hardly covering anything , and those are obviously allowed . But artistic nude , even only the backside , like in this blingee , are n't moderated , but keep sitting on ' unranked ' in the competitions without explanation . I find that so hypocrite ! These so called christians are real farizees ! Thank God many blingee friends do apprecitate art and vote for it anyway . http : //bln.gs/b/28f3x4 <p> I just want to know why many vulgar blingees , showing i.e. women hardly covered in black leather outfit with boops almost falling out , are allowed , while esthetic nudes ( like the old painters creations ) are forbidden ! I myself make a clear difference between ' naked ' and ' nude ' , but the BT inquisition obviously does n't know that difference . This has nothing to do with religion , but in another topic here , some blingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And some of those people seem to want to push Blingee in a certain strait-jacket . And does it really need only 1 person to report a blingee or stamp to ban it ? Well ... in that case BT can expect lots of blingees reported by me ! <p> Its not just Christians that are Mods . I made a bling of a baby and its not naked or anything ... its just stuck in blingee limbo . Their is all kinds of people being Mods here on Blingee ... Christians to pagans . To what ever else in between . Your blingee just got stuck it happens computers are not perfect just like people are n't . <p> If that 's true , and I understand that can happen , than is n't BT reading these comments ? I added my blingee , which I like very much , and added it again in 1 competiton this week . But again it keeps sitting on " unranked " . They could at least give me an explanation why this is ? <p> The answer is no . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it gets banned . BT has always respected ' art ' vs. ' smut ' . There is a difference and the human body in art form is a beautiful and artistic subject to work with . I had a blingee stuck in moderation for for a very long long time . It was not even an image of a real woman .... she was bare waist up but her hair covered any exposure completely . She was , in my humble opinion , a magnificent piece of art . She was a mermaid beauty , for sure . The stamp had already been approved . Some clueless or whatever you want to add here decided she was offensive ? ? ? ? ? ..... lol . She finally passed BT inspection months later . And I entered her into competitions . So , to answer your question , I think sometimes it takes BT a while to get the queue that was rejected by a moderator , and nothing more . I kept getting ' awaiting moderation ' and I had that happen to two other blingees I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end . Some know they 're okay and still disagree and slam them into a BAD queue , while others just might not be sure if it 's acceptable or not and do n't want to risk it .

I personally would love to see porn go bye-bye forever for many a reason but then again , that 's just my opinion and I wo n't go into the details-psychology of all that mess . It 's just wrong on oh so many levels . But people have the right to do whatever they wish in the privacy of their own homes , as long as we 're dealing with consenting adults .

Not saying all serial killers had fanatical religious parents ( usually a mother ) but quite a few did ... and look at the Catholic priests . Cry forever over that . Perhaps if people stopped viewing and teaching how wrong the body is and started teaching that it 's a vessel to express LOVE .... a lot of sex crimes would go away ... say NO to someone and what 's the first thing they do ? .... you get the picture .

And when we 're not seeing other religious groups doing that , then it 's kind of hard to really put a finger on anything else . So yes , hard to know who actually denies them but easy to see who is saying it 's wrong when they are spelling it out for you . : ) I respect their rights to their opinions , I just wish they 'd stop trying to make everyone else behave like they think they do .

They have the right to live their lives the way they choose , in their own little world , as long as they are not causing direct harm to anyone else . <p> Last thing , then I 'll shut up cause I ramble on and on lol .... But you know , when I was a child , one of the images I remember clearly and probably tore my whole child psyche apart was in a Children 's bible when Abraham was going to sacrifice Isaac .

That gave me a giggle too . I do n't believe in spells or any of that mystical stuff anyway . EVEN if I did , I certainly would doubt that someone like her would have any power at all because she is not only bat crap crazy , she is outright evil ! Someone who puts that much negativity out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as funny as her words can sometimes be , I just wish she would leave me alone . Ignoring her has not ever worked . I 'll send you a gift to tell you what my next step IS ! @Angell2-I completely agree with you . I do n't know why the Blingee Team can't/wo n't block her ip address . I always thought they could , but given the amount of times they have had to kick her off , I would think if they had the capabilities , they would have done it by now . I do n't know . It 's easy to say not to let people like that bother you , but when they relentlessly harass , antagonize and needle you and it goes on and on and on , at some point it starts to break you down . I did n't tell anybody except one of my closest friends for most of the time because I detest drama and did NOT want her to lure me into it . I guess there comes a time when others NEED to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much better seeing all of the wonderful support I have from friends on here , and how quickly the Blingee Team responded to it all ! I am very lucky . <p> Just to let everyone know ... BlingeeTeam has in fact blocked her IP address . But unfortunately she can get another IP address ... it 's really not all that hard to do . I can also tell you that BT does not put up with that kind of behavior on here . If anyone has a problem with bullying then you must bring it to the BlingeeTeam 's attention and they will take care of it : ) <p> @Deb Thank you so much for the info on the ip address ! I knew there had to be SOME explanation because the BT certainly does n't enjoy continuously having to go on and deal with this ! I did n't realize it was that easy to get a new ip address . Anyway , you are right ! I should have made it MUCH more clear in here that ever since she got initially banned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as it was brought to their attention that she was back on Blingee . They really are wonderful and I appreciate all of their help . I know for a fact that she is back on because she down-rates all of my blingees , but I do n't care about my blingees getting down-rated . As long as she does n't harass ! I love all of you so much who have come together to support me and made me feel so loved during this difficult time ! And that includes you , Deb ! Thank you so much for all of your help ! <p> Hi , yes you are right , it gets aggravating , frustrating.But that 's what they want.They are bullies , they find the right buttons to push . And they start pushing them.But you ca n't let the bullies of the world win.See people like this is not happy , until they 're making someone else unhappy and miserable.I think all the people on here , should block her and all her Nicks.But just remember there 's more good people one here.Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bullying . <p> Yes , Gerl+ne , she is from the Netherlands . But do n't be embarrassed ! There are people like that in EVERY country and from every walk of life . That 's just the way it goes .

Perhaps instead of banning images , mark them 18+ and then put a new feature in effect to where you can pay a one time fee for an 18 and older account so that way everyone is happy and no kids can see the 18+ posts without buying an account which would require parents permission because if I had children I 'd want to know what they are about to buy online ! and everyone has a choice if they want the account or not ! This site is no longer family oriented and should mark a disclaimer " 18+ " or " 13+ " or " pay 5$ for an 18+ account ! or a free account with limited acess " <p> Surely things will get better .

Also it is especially important to get red carpet blingees moderated and it should n't be that hard since they are flagged red and at the top but , for some reason my friend 's blingee was made yesterday and it still is in moderation and I do n't understand it unless some dummy rejected it !

If there are new moderators then I suggest to you to not moderate unless yo do it right same goes for bullies ! Go bully somewhere else ! To the long time moderators please help moderate more often so this kind of thing wo n't happen so much ! Also just so you moderators know that if you reject a image it wo n't be removed from the website since blingee team is suppose to check rejected images and they are n't so the only thing that happens is stamps might go private and they will not show up in the public stamp search and then the blingees just do n't get to be entered in any competitions or challenges ! So moderation has become kind of pointless now ! I still moderate just to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know are okay so I can save them from rejection ! I am only one person so I hope others who know how to moderate and what to accept and reject will help ! If anyone reads these posts Thanks for your time ! <p> @ cassandrajd : The reason why you 're only seeing a handful of blingees when you go to moderate is because we 're finally all caught up with the back blingees : ) As for your friend 's Lady Gaga blingee getting rejected . I do n't know what happened there . Obviously if there is a clear violation of the rules , ie : clear nudity , porn , extreme violence , racist , etc , then the blingee will get rejected . I 'm sure this was n't the case with your friend 's blingee . As you already know , we as moderators do n't have the final say as to what gets rejected . While we 're on the topic of moderating ... I 've been noticing several clear violations of blingees slipping through the moderating cracks ... so to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamps making it through the moderating process ! I can see once in a while one slipping by but lately there 's been too many . So we really need to be paying more attention when we moderate . Remember , there are a lot of young users on here . I hope I have addressed your concerns : D <p> @guardian06 ; Deb , when we moderate , I do n't see it showing hits and misses . That is one reason people would n't just pick a blingee to reject , just because they do n't like it , because they would get " a miss " against them which lowers their score . I know I have had at least one sure hit that did n't show up and that was last week . Are hits and misses not calculated any longer ? <p> I 've noticed a couple of things regarding moderating. 1 ) Some blingees I 've seen have had a flag next to them . Presumably that means someone has already rejected them . The ones I saw with flags had nothing wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cute picture of a cat for goodness sake ! 2 ) There are a lot of blingees and stamps being uploaded all the time . Yet sometimes there 's no blingees in the queue and sometimes there 's only a few . 3 ) The blingee rankings are not changing at all . I had to reject two blingees recently since they were both full-on nudity , but my stats are still showing no hits and no false alerts . <p> Flagged blingees in moderation are blingees that need to be approved for the red carpet comp or to be put in the spotlight . They have not been rejected . I too have noticed that sometimes I do n't get my hits . I am missing 1 hit from last week and 1 from today . <p> The reason why you see little to no images in the queue at times , is because we have finally caught up on the backlog . As for seeing the " red flag " next to certain blingees , it 's just like TracyMcGibbon said . Those are for Red Carpet or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stats on moderating .... I just moderated a few images and I saw someone go from 3rd or 4th place up to 2nd place . <p> Really all the Blingee community needs help because it can not be that team this Blingee in this situation so terrible and evil . Blingee whole community should solve this together already underway BLINGEE TEAM UP NOW ! <p> I , too , have seen strange things in the statistics ! A few times , I moderated a full page of items and never saw them reflected in the number of images moderated ! I do n't even know how the statistics are measured ; how can anonymous , who 's ranked #1 , have only moderated 7 items , yet had 35 hits ? ! I 'll keep moderating , though ! I know how important it is to do my part for Blingee ! <p> as BlackCat41 said , the moderator rankings do n't make any sense . Some people 's stats are changing but some people 's stats are not changing at all . And Anonymous users should n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate if they do n't even have an account ? <p> I do n't think people should be allowed to moderate as Anonymous . What are they wanting to hide ? Also , I now have 4 false alerts but no hits . One of the images I rejected was a photo of a woman 's breasts completely uncovered . Now , unless the rules have changed and we are now allowed to show off our nipples ... something has gone wrong . <p> I agree with the position that anonymity should not be allowed in moderation ! Plus , I still do n't understand how these anonymous moderators can have more hits than images moderated ! Right now , anonymous is on top with the following statistics : 11 images moderated , 55 hits ! How can you get 55 hits from only 11 images ? It 's entirely illogical and it 's driving me crazy ! 
@@40818824 @818824/ <h> Statistics moderating . <p> Been moderating most of the day . Just happened to be there when it changed to the next week . I had 38 in #1 position . No other images in que to moderate . Anonymous pops ups with 50 . I keep hitting ok and get one stamp or blingee to moderate . Clicking OK as fast as I can . Every on that gets into the queue counts as one for me . Anonymous stats jump by 50 each time and no images in the queue . By the time I got to 60 , anonymous is at 650 . How is that possible when I 'm moderating as fast as they pop up in the queue one by one ? <p> I 've been wondering the same thing for a long time . I do n't think anyone should be allowed to moderate anonymously anyway . But the anonymous ranked number 1 seems to be getting more images to moderate than the rest of us . <p> I 'm thinking the " Anonymous " that gets the most images to moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time blinger who does like a first level moderations to decrease the chance of any " child " moderators of seeing the crazy stuff . I 'm thinking that person probably is n't in the run for a badge . Do n't ya think ? <p> I ca n't say with absolute certainty , but from what I 've seen , I believe that this , particular " anonymous " , is actually the Blingee team ! When each new week begins , not only do they have hundreds of images viewed , they also have huge numbers of ' hits ' ! If the images we reject go into a secondary queue , it stands to reason that BT would be able to go through them , quickly , and it would make sense for those numbers to increase , exponentially ! As for badges , I know that I have been in second place , with only anonymous ahead of me , and I did not get a first place badge ! This does n't bother me , it 's not why I moderate , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Once again , though , this is my opinion , I can not state it as fact ! <p> Another week struggling to moderate even a modest number of stamps and Blingees and a thought came to me . If the top two " Anonymous " moderators get all those hits before they see them before we do , then why do n't all our hits count as misses for them ? If we have a miss , it counts against us , but all our hits mean they missed them on first go round , so why do n't they count as misses for them ? It would be more fair . <p> If the anonymous moderators are the blingee-team or people who actually work for Blingee then it makes sense that they would n't have any misses . They are the ones who decide what is a hit and what is n't . <p> I think their hits are our hits ! If we reject an image , it should go to the BT next , so they can decide if it was a hit or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would allow them such high numbers ! Even their ratios are high , in comparison to ours ! Mine is just a theory , though ! <p> But , you know when we are moderating , we see blanks of images that have already been rejected . I thought those were the hits for the person who always has the most hits . They are moderating very fast and those are their hits . I thought we go through what they went through and that is why we see the blanks . What they miss our hits so should be their misses . Of course , the final moderation is the Blingee team deciding whose hits are really hits and misses . Thanks . I 'm just pondering this .

His father , Joe Jackson , had been a guitarist but was forced to give up his musical ambitions following his marriage to Katherine ( Scruse ) . Together they prodded their growing family 's musical interests at home . By the early 1960s , the older boys Jackie , Tito and Jermaine had begun performing around the city ; by 1964 , Michael and Marlon had joined in . A musical prodigy , Michael 's singing and dancing talents were amazingly mature , and he soon became the dominant voice and focus of The Jackson 5 . An opening act for such soul groups as the O-Jays and James Brown , it was Gladys Knight ( not Diana Ross ) who officially brought the group to Berry Gordy 's attention , and by 1969 , the boys were producing back-to-back chart-busting hits as Motown artists ( " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never Can Say Goodbye , " " Got to Be There , " etc . ) . As a product of the 1970s , the boys emerged as one of the most accomplished black pop/soul vocal groups in music history , successfully evolving from a group like The Temptations to a disco phenomenon . Solo success for Michael was inevitable , and by the 1980s , he had become infinitely more popular than his brotherly group . Record sales consistently orbited , culminating in the biggest-selling album of all time , " Thriller " in 1982 . A TV natural , he ventured rather uneasily into films , such as playing the Scarecrow in The Wiz ( 1978 ) , but had much better luck with elaborate music videos . In the 1990s , the downside as an 1980s pop phenomenon began to rear itself . Michael grew terribly child-like and introverted by his peerless celebrity . A rather timorous , androgynous figure to begin with , his physical appearance began to change drastically , and his behavior grew alarmingly bizarre , making him a consistent target for scandal-making , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to Elvis Presley 's daughter Lisa Marie Presley -- were forged and two children produced by his second wife during that time , but the purposes behind it appeared image-oriented . Despite it all , Michael Jackson 's passion and artistry as a singer , dancer , writer and businessman are unparalleled , and it is these prodigious talents that will ultimately prevail over the extremely negative aspects of his seriously troubled adult life . For it all to end on June 25 , 2009 , with his sudden death at age 50 of a cardiac arrest just as he was just coming out of a four-year reclusive period and rehearsing for a sold-out London concert " comeback " in July seems uncommonly cruel and tragic .

@@40818827 @818827/ <p> Hello melarocks , I 'll be more than happy to answer your question . The first link you posted , I used glitterboo and then I took the image to one of my other programs to speed up the efftects . You can even take it to Lunapic to change the speed . By the way , I payed $8.99 a year for my Glitterboo account . It is so worth the money . As for the other 2 links that are by " soave " , I 'm just making an educated guess here . I believe she used some brushes and set it to " overlay " instead of normal . I 've been doing this on a lot of my stamps , ie : http : **32;192;TOOLONG ( I made 6 frames with this one ) http : **32;226;TOOLONG I hope I 've answered you questions to your liking . And please , if you need my help with anything else , do n't hesitate to ask . I know what it 's like to want to know how a specific stamp was made but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more than happy to share my knowledge/experience ; - ) And FYI , I used GIMP on those last 2 stamps that I posted . <p> Hello Tracy , No , I did not use animated brushes on my flower stamps . And yes , there are animated brushes . Go to Deviant Art and type into the search box : animated brushes for GIMP . To animated some of my flower stamps , I used the " wave " effect . To do a partial wave on a stamp/graphic , you want to use your lasso tool . Just outline the part you want to animate ; - )

@@40818838 @818838/ <h> Since when are BIG breasts offensive ? <p> LOL , someone needs a reality check ! Either you people have a mother complex or an extremely low self image issue and feel jealous over a computerized image of a woman ! OMG . I think BT needs to reevaluate their moderators ! There is a chart that shows , and has NOT been updated in many months , showing statistically BT is not even moderating the moderators anymore , and moderators are getting away with their uncontrollable desire to ban whatever they feel is inappropriate and ignoring the RULES BT incorporated for their site . This is just not fair to people who spend all that time making appropriate stamps and blingees . If BT does not have the time to check the moderators and does not trust anyone enough to allow them to moderate the moderators and do the work for them , they should just ban these clueless people from being moderators . I 'm sure there are plenty of people who would volunteer to moderate the moderators . That list I was referring to shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have an outrageous number for rejection should be removed and not allowed privileges ! I made this stamp and there is absolutely nothing wrong with this except in someone 's perverted and twisted mind of the female anatomy , her Double D 's . Which , by the way , are not even Double D 's , more like C cups but Double D 's had a nicer ring to it ! Tehehe . So I uploaded the stamp again and approved it myself , which should not have to be . We should just be able to trust that our APPROPRIATE stamps and Blingees are being moderated properly . Here 's the link to my stamp : http : **32;260;TOOLONG Here is the link to the chart that verifies the information I am giving in the above paragraphs . You can actually see the number of false alerts given by moderators . This is an overall ranking system . And the numbers have NOT changed in over 6 months and probably much longer . So I 'd be willing to bet , anything that got slammed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alerts is still sitting in the queue waiting to be moderated by the admin who checks the moderators . LONG ... At first I kind of felt guilty about posting this , but then it occurred to me , anyone who ever applied for moderator can view this and anyone who signs up can be a moderator . Everyone has access to this information . <p> I do n't see anything wrong with your stamp mystique1155 . I 'm assuming that it must have passed through or otherwise I would n't have been able to view it . As for the moderating issue ... I agree that something needs to be done . <p> It has n't been totally rejected yet , Deb . The moderator who rejected it has not been moderated by the admin who oversees moderators and I am assuming that is BT , or hired help who left long ago and was never replaced . Reason why I know it was rejected by a moderator is because none of the search keywords show the image in a search . It 's just sitting there waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being dealt with . I uploaded 8 images for a challenge two weeks ago . I finally got around to creating the challenge yesterday . 4 of the images showed up in a search and 4 did not which tells me 4 were approved by a moderator , 4 were rejected . Those stamps and blingees are not getting lost in limbo , let 's get real . It is possible with really crappy CODE that only a handful get lost and everything else shows up in a queue , but highly unlikely especially since blingee has been around all this time . That bug would have been reported and fixed back in 2007 or 2008 and no later than 2012 when the last major upgrade happened on blingee because it is an annoying problem . It 's the same concept with all those insanely ridiculous PORN blingees that people find and link in this group that sits there forever until someone higher up rejects it . I know this because I 've seen them sitting there for well over a month and I can still click the link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not slacking on those bannable ( yes I made that word up ) images because someone or several are click happy and say OH LOOK big boobs .. REJECT . I KNOW they are not missing the real things to reject and yet people are still viewing , linking and posting these images in this group constantly . Tracy deserves a gold medal for her diligent and relentless work exposing that garbage ! <p> Okay , this is the way it works . Save sends the image , stamp and blingee alike , into a moderator 's queue . Moderators break the images down into two categories , approved and rejected , which in turn makes it easier and quicker for the OVERSEER and final say person ( the big boss ) to view separated and categorized images . When either of those two are clicked on they are sent into either queue based on moderator action . I 'm sure you know this ! : ) However I 'm going to say what I have to say to clear up any confusion . : ) And I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RED it means approach and judge with extreme caution , you have approval rights on this because it 's going into Red Carpet , spotlight or challenge and we 're bypassing the moderation of the moderator . OBVIOUSLY , the ones that are being approved by moderators are being checked by whoever does the queues because after so many hours , those blingees and stamps do indeed show up in a search or do not get rejected in a challenge with AWAITING moderation for MONTHS . I still have one , yeah , she 's exposing SKIN but no parts show that I made probably 8 months ago that I still can not enter into a challenge . The stamp was approved eons ago , Mejserr made it and she has n't been around for several years . I made another that showed a lot more but same case , stamp WAS approved , blingee awaited moderation even after a few days in the competition I joined . I reported with email and told them if it does n't pass I 'd understand but it was just sitting there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day with votes in the competition . The next week it ranked either #2 or #3 . Ca n't remember . This proves it sat in a disapproved queue until SOMEONE higher up approved it or rejected it . The approve queue is in fact being dealt with , that queue is a priority and NEEDS to be approved daily and chances are , most images that pass into that queue are legitimate images . I 'm thinking the rejected queue has been neglected for a LONG time . Too many legitimate stamps and blingees are never being approved , show up in a search . And based on the chart , people who have over 12k false alerts are the reason WHY that queue is n't being checked . : P Someone does n't have the time for all that nonsense . Hey , I COULD be totally wrong or even partially , but all evidence tells me this is what is going on and unless someone with authority corrects me , that 's my observation and I am sticking to it ! <p> I know that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything they dislike without considering the rules of Blingee . I wish I could help out , and I did sign up to be a moderator ages ago . But for some reason , I never have any blingees or stamps in my queue to moderate . I 'm guessing there is some sort of error that does n't allow me to moderate anymore . <p> There is no error , there are no blingees or stamps sitting in the queue for approval most of the time . There used to be literally hundreds of blingees/stamps sitting in the queue . We could n't keep up with them but blingee has lost a great many users over the years and some people have high count , while others do not . I approve less than 100 and probably less than 50 every week while others score a lot higher . They probably check the queue a lot more than I do . Again , this could be the bug that loses everyone 's work .... ? ? ? ? Doubtful though . <p> Hi , I do not see nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion power goe to some peoples heads.moderator Need to be moderated.just like downvoters , nothing never done about them from blingee team ..
