@@22713506 @2713506/ <h> How to write a personality quiz <p> Writing a quiz is not like writing an article its a completely different animal . An article is meant to be a one-to-many medium , where a quiz is one-to-one . You would n't talk to a friend at a bar as if they were a crowd of people , so do n't  write a quiz like its addressing a crowd of people . This is n't something we are used to as writers . Typically we create pieces that will hopefully be read by thousands of people and perhaps commented on , talking directly to someone through a quiz is a new task . <p> here 's how to write the perfect personality quiz . ( or at least try ) <p> The quiz title <p> A full 80% of quiz takers will make a decision about whether or not to take your quiz based off of the title its given . You should spend nearly as much time coming up with a title as you do actually writing the quiz . However , if you do n't  feel like doing that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> The " Actually " title : " How much do you actually know about the world cup ? " this quiz is just a simple knowledge assessment , but by adding an element of challenge it becomes much more fun <p> The celebrity comparison title : " Which celebrity would play you in a movie version of your life ? " based on a simple personality quiz , this headline appeals to our undeniable love for all things celebrity . <p> Which blank are you ? " Which type of cake are you ? " again , this is just an adaptation of the personality quiz with personalities replaced by objects ( in this case cakes ) <h> The quiz results <p> With any quiz , you 've got to work backwards from the results . The result is what gets shared , what calls people to action , and what makes your quiz worth talking about . <p> Results must be convincingly upbeat , meaning that you 've got to make every single result positive without coming off as a phony . here 's how to do that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Michael Jordan or are like an Oatmeal Raisin cookie , there 's something genuinely good about whatever they are . Lead with the good . <p> Be simple : Do n't  use too many flowery words and adjectives in an attempt to be upbeat . One of the ways Detectives can tell if someone is lying is when they add extraneous details to a story . Say what you have to say and say it clearly . <p> Use personal pronouns : You is one of the most powerful words in our language . A quiz should speak to you and use the word you . <p> Be certain : Do n't  use generalities . If you want to tell a quiz taker that they 're the color blue , come right out and say , then state the reasons why . Certainty is a strong way to ensure trustworthiness . <p> Build rapport : Speak conversationally . Insert yourself as the writer into the equation by creating hypothetical scenarios . Remember , a quiz is a one-to-one medium where you can speak like you would to a friend . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school or any kind of school , no need to use overly formal language or perfect sentences . <p> Use images properly : Images can be good or bad . Good images make sense in context and add to the result , bad images are in the result for the sake of having an image in the result . <p> Let 's look at a great quiz result and dissect what they did right . <p> This is a quiz result that basically states I do n't  like socializing , something that carries a stigma in society . This quiz taker would be referred to as a loner or even a loser . However , the Buzzfeed writer does an excellent job of turning the tables to make this result positive . First , they pull the good out of it " You do n't  need to have a ton of people to have a good time " The writer then goes on to use simple language and speak directly to the quiz taker , building rapport by speaking conversationally " I 'd suggest we hang out . " The result also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowery syntax . <h> The quiz questions : <p> The goal of quiz questions is to funnel people towards the quiz results while building up anticipation . You want to build up a connection with the quiz taker so theyll be more likely to believe and potentially share your quiz result . Here are a few ways to do that . <p> Do n't  try too hard : No need for formality or big words . Say what you mean and mean what you say . <p> One-to-one : A quiz is you as the writer talking to one quiz taker at at time , use that to your advantage . How would you ask someone what their favorite food was if you just met them at at a party ? <p> Be the " tipsy college student " version of yourself : If you think something is too edgy , make it edgier . Quizzes are n't  the place to use your amazing academic writing skills . <p> Let 's look at the quiz questions for the result we were analyzing earlier to see how they did it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like were at a pub , a few drinks deep , enjoying a conversation . The questions are informal and short , letting me voice my opinion . They 're also pretty forward and edgy , there 's no formality to be found here . <p> Check out a quiz that puts all these practices into place . This particular quiz has been taken about 40,000 times . 
@@22713507 @2713507/ <h> How to write better quiz questions <p> The questions of a quiz are the most important part because they provide an opportunity for one-on-one communication that is n't found anywhere else in content marketing . Good quizzes have great questions and bad quizzes have awful questions . Its up to you to create a great experience for your quiz takers , and writing questions is a big responsibility . Luckily we 've been watching as thousands of quizzes are created through Interact with all degrees of success . Here are the top 6 things that great questions do . <h> 1 . Use pictures <p> 100% of the top 100 Interact quizzes use at least one image question . Visual content is more engaging , and its much more interesting to click on a picture than some words . Good quizzes use images that make sense and are high quality , meaning that they follow sizing guidelines and actually match the thing they are supposed to represent . Take this example question below , you can see that each image is accurate to what it is supposed to represent ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also good quality ( no pix-elation or blurring ) . <h> 2 . Each question should stand alone <p> A quiz is a multi-step process . Each time you present a new question you also present an opportunity for your visitor to leave and go look at other things on the internet . Each and every question on your quiz needs to be able to hold its own against all those distractions and present an interesting proposition . This can be achieved through using personal questions because we all like to talk about ourselves ( bonus points for also using images ) . <p> The example question below comes from the author of Steve Jobs biography , a man who certainly knows how to keep people engaged . His question is both personal and visually appealing . This question as its own piece of content on the internet could compete with all the other riff raff. <h> 3 . All questions should work together <p> Quizzes are unique because you can use the logic within the quiz to give people a personalized result . Every question you write should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if it does n't  , do n't  include that question . Think of all your quiz questions as a personal concierge that 's guiding visitors to the correct result , a concierge would n't ask a random question in the middle of their line of questioning to provide the best service possible , and neither should your quiz . <h> 4 . Pick a person to talk to <p> Remember , quizzes are a one-to-one medium , which means you 'll only be talking to one person at a time . This is very odd to think about , given all the forms of content we are used to as marketers ( blog posts , video , infographics , slideshare , etc . ) All of the traditional forms of media are meant for a mass audience , whereas quizzes will only ever reach one person at a time . That means you have to fundamentally think differently about how you write quiz questions , and the best way to do that is by thinking of one person who would really enjoy your quiz and speaking directly to them . <p> Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is well in-tune with who here audience is . You 'll notice that the question really only makes sense if you are a mother or father who is in charge of home life . This might seem like a bad idea because anyone else taking Rachaels quiz would feel excluded which is true , but it also makes the people who do identify with this question feel very included . <p> Little things like this can be the difference between someone sharing your quiz because they feel a personal connection to it and not sharing your quiz . <h> 5 . Follow the pub rule <p> Named for the Irish Post ( pubs are a very Irish past time ) , this rule states that you may not ask any question in a quiz that would be weird to ask in a pub with your mates . Our tendency with writing things online is to be overly formal , mostly because of the fear that a lot of people will read what we 've written and judge us . However , if you write a quiz like that it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The solution is to follow the pub rule take for example the question below , I can just imagine two people in a pub playing out this question . The first person asks the question and the second person proceeds to answer by singing the ballads , then the whole pub joins in for a reveling time ( okay maybe that wont happen , but it would be awesome ) . Good things happen when you follow the pub rule . <h> 6 . Have 6-12 questions with 4-6 responses <p> This is - guideline that I highly recommend following . If you stay within six to twelve questions you 'll be asking people to spend about two minutes taking your quiz , which is the upper limit on our attention spans on the internet . Also , having no more than six responses to each question will make sure that each response is read and there is n't an overwhelming amount of text on the page . 
@@22713509 @2713509/ <h> How To Embed Your Quiz Into Any Site <p> So you 've built an awesome quiz using Interact , and now it 's time to get that amazing piece of interactive content integrated into your website . Lucky for you , embedding quizzes is super simple for nearly any website or social network . In the following guide we 'll walk through exactly how to embed quizzes on any website . Just find the one you use and you 'll be embedding in no time ! <h> Wordpress . <p> At the end of the quiz creation process you 'll be given a code that looks like the one pictured below . this code is just an iframe ( the same technology youtube uses to embed videos ) . All you need to do is copy that code and you 're ready to get started . <p> Once you 've got the code selected it 's time to put that quiz into your post . You can embed this code virtually anywhere on a Wordpress site ( posts , articles , sidebar , etc ) , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's because the ideal size for quizzes is 800 by 600 pixels , which is about 2/3 's of an average web page . This provides adequate space for the quiz to display all of its content . <p> Once you 've got a new post open , select the " text " tab in the upper right-hand corner and paste the quiz code in . There 's a picture below of what that looks like . <p> Once the code is pasted in , you can continue editing the page to add text content or anything else you want . I would advise switching back to the visual editor so you can see where the quiz will be in the post . That way you can work around the quiz and make sure the page looks nice when it gets published . When you 're done creating all the content , just publish the page and the quiz will be there , just like the screenshot below . <p> *One thing to note is that wordpress.com does n't allow you to embed iframes . What you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz that links to the full page quiz hosted on Interact . <h> Custom HTML . <p> For sites that are custom-built , the process is slightly more complicated than for wordpress ( slightly in the most literal sense of the word , it 's still really easy ) . To demonstrate how simple it is , I embedded a quiz using a simple online text editor to show how it works . If your page is created using HTML , just use the same embed code as picture in the wordpress tutorial above and embed it in a &lt;p&gt; tag with the styling you 'd like to use to center it . I did it in the image below . The code itself is also in there so you can see the format of the embed code within the paragraph tag . <h> Tumblr . <p> The site that prides itself on minimalism does n't disappoint when it comes to adding quizzes . It only takes two steps to drop a quiz into a tumblr blog and be up and running . To prove how easy it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and called it " Interact Testing Blog " after setting up my account , I selected to create a new text post and then clicked the " html " button to paste in my code . <p> After dropping in my code I had to switch back to normal mode by clicking the " html " button again . Then I clicked post and was done . One thing to note is that when you first click post you 'll get a weird preview thing that does n't look right , but once you click through to actually view the quiz on your blog it will look like this . <h> Blogger . <p> Blogger is in a heated battle with tumblr for the absolute easiest way to embed a quiz . Once again I started from scratch with a brand new blog to see how long it took me to get a quiz up and running . Again , I used the same embed code , which you can access from your dashboard . All I had to do was create a new post and paste the code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code is pasted in , you can continue working on the post , or just publish it with the quiz . When you 're ready , just publish and the quiz will be all set . This is how it will look ( yours will be fancier since I just made this blog ) <h> Google site . <p> This is the first of our slightly more difficult embed options . By more difficult I mean you have to do some digging to find the right widget to support the Interact widget . What you 're looking for here is the " embed gadget " which can be found in the " insert " menu of your Google site web builder . Once you have selected the widget you 'll be able to drop the iframe code from Interact into it . <p> One thing to note with Google sites is that they do n't allow for script embeds ( which is the default option for Interact quizzes ) you can shoot us an email to josh@tryinteract.com to get the iframe version of the quiz embed code . Once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save and you 'll be all set . <h> Wix . <p> Wix is a bit involved , I 'll be honest . That 's why it gets its own article for how to embed a quiz . Check that out here

This will be a wide discussion from start to finish , processes I 've experienced , and how to curate the content and design to fit perfectly with the brand you are working with . <p> Overall the process is not complicated and you should be able to follow along quite nicely and this can even be a good overview to look at before you get moving by yourself on creating a quiz . Before we get going , below is the quiz that we 'll be completing today , why do n't you take it and then we 'll get into it ! <p> I 'll set the premise and some goals before I get going . For example today , we 'll be working with a clothing company called Sevenly who want to make a personality quiz . Their goal is to match potential buyers visiting their website to a product they have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz to match up users with an article of clothing and even specific designs within that these articles . <p> If you are n't familiar with Sevenly , they are a clothing company that donates $7 of every purchase to certain charities that rotate . They stand for good causes , but to be honest I just love them because their shirts are designed so well . Sevenly is going to be my example company today that I 'm building a quiz for . <p> Sevenly also has a specific brand and company colors that they want the quiz to match so it looks well positioned in their website . Our goal is to make them a quiz that can easily be implemented in their website , and help them with content and images so we can make an overall good looking quiz with a high completion rate . All of these aspects along with title and tagline will tie in to how successful this quiz will be , so let 's discuss all of that and a typical process for making a quiz like this . <p> These 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be doing working with this client . So let 's get cracking ! <p> To make a quiz like the one talked about in this article , head to tryinteract.com <h> 1 . Building out the Visual Language of the Quiz <p> So one of the first things we need to do is figure out how this quiz is going to look . Here is the visual identity of Sevenly 's brand , and we need the quiz to match this . Below is the logo and color scheme that Sevenly has , so it 's what we need to follow . <p> Sevenly boasts a light blue to almost teal-ish brand , which you see across a lot of their work . We 'll definitely want to keep this mind as we design the quiz . They have a mixture of typefaces that they use , from simple san-serifs to more slab-serif title text . Before designing a quiz these are all things we want to make sure we 're aware of so we can set up the design properly . <p> Once we 're signed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new quiz . When it prompts us to choose what type of quiz we 'll be making , we 'll choose personality quiz . This is because we are making a quiz that does n't have wrong answers , just different responses that lead to a result . <p> Once we click on that , we 'll be working with a blank slate . A few things we might want to change on this quiz that you see options for are the cover image , font , font color , button color and text , and the logo . <p> First , let 's change the cover photo . We want this photo to represent the products of the company as a whole , and most likely we would be able to receive an image from them that would look best on the front cover . I always recommend trying to get some faces in there , as we have learned that conversion rates tend to improve when there are faces on a quiz . To upload our photo , we 'll click on Cover Photo ' in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo in the quiz . We recommend the photo to be 900px by 400px . <p> Once we upload our photo , we can see what it looks like on the quiz . <p> Looks good ! Now that we have that done , let 's keep going down the line . Next we want to replace the logo . Click on the edit button in the Custom Logo section in the top left , and let 's upload the Sevenly logo with the blue typeface , which will look best on white . <p> Since the background of our quiz is white , that looks great sitting there in the bottom right corner . <p> The background we 're going to keep white for this quiz , so we 'll leave that option alone . <p> Up next is the font color . Now this one is interesting because we really do n't want to mess too much with the font color , because if it 's anything but a darker grey or black it 's not going to look good unless the brand specifically calls for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't use that as the font color . Let 's go ahead and just keep it at the default , which is a dark grey . <p> For font type , I also like the default best here as Sevenly works with a sans-serif and modern brand , so Proxima makes sense as for what we would want to go for . <p> Up next , the button color and text on top of it is a great way that we can not only personalize the main color block to our brand , but also use the text to entice users to take the quiz . Let 's make the button color match our light blue to teal brand that is exemplified in the logo . <p> The last option we have to work with is what the text on the button says . Let 's change it to something a little more inviting , such as Let 's Go ! <p> Well now that all the editing is done , here is what our quiz looks like ! <p> Looking good . We have a quiz that matches the brand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done here , let 's hit Save &amp; Continue ' and move on to point number two . <h> 2 . Content Beginnings / Results <p> If you want to make a quiz similar to the one we 're making or at least follow along with your own examples , head to tryinteract.com and walk through the process with me ! <p> First things first , after we save and continue from the design portion of the quiz , we need to title our quiz and put a description in . As for the title , I decided to make it pretty simple and straightforward into what the quiz is about , choosing Which New Sevenly Apparel Design Should You Get ? This pretty much calls the quiz what it is , and poses the direct question that the quiz answers . <p> We can get a little more into detail in the description area , so let 's populate that with some more text . I 'm writing Sevenly has just released quite a few new designs and causes that they support . If you 're feeling a bit confused on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this short quiz can help ! <p> Before we get going on the actual questions of our quiz , we want to write up the answers that our users will be getting . For this quiz , let 's go ahead and just make two different types of answers . Based on the way they answer the questions , they can get one of two results . The first is a t-shirt design of a new product line that donates to the cause of the week , while the second is another t-shirt dedicated to giving to water.org . Here they are below . <p> The first thing we want to do is make an association with who would be buying each product . We 'll dig into this a bit more when we actually craft the questions , but we need to come up with descriptions of each result and then craft questions with answers that can naturally feed into that result . <p> Let 's make our result and description for each of those products . <p> First is the result that points toward the shirt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donates to water.org . Water.org works all over the world but has major operations throughout Southeast Asia and Africa , as well as some in South America . If someone has a desire to help these regions specifically , they might be compelled to donate towards this cause . There are other factors here including different designs that may affect the decision , but these are all things to take into account . To add a description to our first answer , click on Click to give this result a description . <p> Here 's a good description for our result : - We 've matched you up with our Life ' design which donates money to water.org for every item bought . Water.org is an organization that has been in operation for over 20 years and works all over the world providing clean , safe water to those who need it . Buying our Life ' design t-shirt donates $7 directly to this organization . Click below to buy the shirt from our site or look at our page that talks about water.org to find out more about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good practice to provide direct links to the product and the organization so that the user can immediately be sent to the right area of the site after the quiz . We also want to add a photo of the design , so I uploaded a photo of the hoodie to be displayed when they get the result . This can easily be done by clicking click to add picture to this result . <p> For our second result , we have a more general design that caters to the cause of the week . This is the vibrant community tee which overall promotes general awareness of causes listed on the site , and donates to the rotating causes that are listed on the site . This is a bit more complex of a design , which might please others over the simplicity of the life design . <p> We 've paired you up with our community tee since you like to see different causes solve different problems . The design for shirts like this are a bit more complex but still maintain a good message about general awareness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $7 to our rotating cause of the week , so you know this shirt is donating money that will really help make a difference . ' <h> 3 . How many questions ? What will they be ? <p> As you scroll down , first let 's talk about the length of the questions and amount of answers before we get into content . We 're making the goal of this quiz to be short and sweet ; we 're going for a high completion rate and simple questions to answer . With just two results , I think it 's safe to go ahead and just go with two responses to each question , each one correlating to a single result . <p> As for the total length of the quiz , let 's go with 5 questions . This way no matter what at least one result will win by majority , and it 's short and sweet . It should take users less than 30 seconds to take the quiz , which is a great target for a short quiz like this . <p> Now we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're making questions . Since our t-shirt company also gives $7 of each purchase to a charity associated with the shirt , this could also sway which design a user would choose . Along with that , we have the designs themselves , but this quiz is attempting to place a user with a product based on some personality questions . Our questions can be incredibly direct , or a bit more obscure . Here are five questions below that I 've come up with . <p> 1 . What part of the world are you most mindful of when it comes to social justice ? 2 . Simple or more complex designs ? 3 . T-shirt or hoody ? 4 . Would you rather travel to help humanitarian causes or get involved at home ? 5 . Which cause do you feel you should be more a part of ? <p> So now that we have the questions , let 's talk through each one . <p> Question 1 asks What part of the world are you most mindful of when it comes to social justice ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they care more about issues here at home or out abroad . Our answers for this question are Right here at home ' or Out abroad . ' Basically this points us towards water.org if they 're more aimed towards issues around the world , and towards the community tee option if they are more concerned with domestic issues . Right below each response there is an area to choose which result that answer complies with , so select the proper result beneath each response . <p> Also , we do want these quizzes to be modeled after a conversation , so instead of making our answers simple , make them seem like more of a response you would get if you we were actually in a conversation with someone . Instead of here or there , for this question I chose to use the more conversation friendly answers you see above . <p> The second question simple asks if the user would want simple or more complex designs . There is n't too much to talk about with this one , and it entails a simple answer simple ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while complex associates with the community tee . <p> T-shirt or hoody ? ' This is another simple question with a simple answer . I probably do n't need to dive into this one too much either . <p> Our question here is Would you rather travel to help humanitarian causes or get involved at home ? ' This again caters to whether our quiz taking audience would rather get involved with domestic issues or foreign issues . Our answers for this are going to be Take me abroad ! ' to refer to the water.org result , and Let me help right here at home ' for our community result . <p> Our final fifth question asks directly which cause they would be more interested in being involved with . This question is asked to perhaps tip one result over another , and solidify which product they 're going to get . Our answers will be Providing a clean source of water for those who do n't have it ' and Helping the homelessness issue in my hometown . ' You can probably figure out which result each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quiz , making sure things line up <p> Now that we actually have our quiz built , go ahead and take it below to see what it looks like live . <p> Alright so now that we have our questions and answers built , how do our results line up ? I know we made the responses before we crafted out the questions , so do we need to go back in and tweak anything ? <p> For our quizzes sake and being made with this article mind , I think it 's safe to say that we 're fine and the quiz makes sense . I added this question in here because often times when I 'm building quiz I have to go in and change the wording or edit some of the questions or responses to create a better flow for the quiz . <p> If you feel satisfied with the content of your quiz , we can move on to the next step . <h> 5 . Email collection , strategy <p> So here is where you can find some extra value in your quizzes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection to the end of the quiz , and talk about why below . I feel there are tons of benefits to adding this to the end of a quiz , and it can really add value to your quiz as a whole . <p> Lead collection is something that is very popular amongst websites today . But with every popular idea to gain customers , there always comes the difficulty of actually making it happen . What we have here is an easy way to collect leads , and we can even create incentives around the prospect of giving up your email to see your result . <p> When you collect leads through your quizzes with Interact , there is always the ability to have a skip option if your users decide not to give their email . This takes away the worry that users wo n't complete their quiz if they have to give up their email . We normally see about 50% of users who take the quizzes complete them and give their email , so that is a pretty incredible conversion rate. - If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy quiz , that 's at least 50 new emails you get to add to your email list , which is awesome . <p> To create lead collection , first you have to tell Interact that collecting emails is something youd want to do . Simply click Yes when you move on from the questions area . <p> Once you click through that , you 'll see the many options we have to collect to your email list provider . After clicking on way , follow the steps to connect your email list to your quiz . <p> Now after we do that , well need to fill out what our call to action page is actually going to look like . Below are the blank call options we provide that you can fill out . <p> The email heading and subhead , as demonstrated in the image to the right of the text boxes , refer to the larger and smaller text that the quiz taker sees when he or she goes to the call to action page . I decided to put in Enter your email to see your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your next purchase ! This would be an incentive , which I 'll get into in a second . I supported the heading text briefly by inputting The coupon is good for any item on our site ! in the subtext. - I do n't  need any of the other information that you can ask for , so I 'll keep those boxes unchecked . I do want to give my users the option to skip putting in their email if they do n't  want to , so I 'll leave the Allow users to skip email input option . There is also a link to put in a privacy policy if you would need to do that . <p> A strategy that I think is great is the idea of giving an incentive for people to give up their email . We 've had customers that have done something as simple as telling the user they will get a coupon for 10-20% off their purchase , and this dramatically increases the amount of people that are willing to give up their email , especially if they 're looking to buy the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , and it allows you start a virtual relationship with more people . Through this you 'll have more customers buying your product , and they might even buy more in the future . <p> I always recommend putting in an email capture at the end of a quiz , as it does n't deter users from finishing and can give you valuable leads . Interact hooks into a lot of major email collection services so your emails can go straight onto your list automatically , or their also just straight up downloadable from the site . <h> 6 . Quiz placement environment <p> Let 's talk about the seamless quiz experience for a second to wrap up the article . Now we do want to be smart on where we place our quiz inside our website , as we want to optimize user flow and how it matches the environment we 're in . <p> Look above to where I implemented the quiz into this article . The white background blends right in with the article , there are n't borders or anything like that , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It truly is a part of its background . This is something you should always strive for when placing the quiz . You want it to not stick out in its environment , but just be present within it . <p> This ensures that the user flow is n't interrupted , and that is what we 're going for. - I normally recommend sitting the quiz within a page , but there is always the option of having the quiz standalone in its own page . This makes the quiz the only experience happening on the page , and then you can go ahead and link out of that page through the results to where the user might want to go . <p> This might come in handy by linking to a standalone page off an email , where you might be able to get more insight into who is clicking out of the email to get to the quiz . You can also see exactly how the quiz is performing because there is nothing else to do on the page . Placing a quiz this way has its benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another great thing we get through our quizzes is plenty of data . You can see who answers each question in certain ways , which result gets the most hits , and how many emails you have collected based on completions and views . This data can be very valuable and tell you a lot about the users that are taking the quiz . <p> To put this inside a scenario , let 's say we 're seeing a large amount of quiz takers leaning towards water.org as their result . This might cause us to cater our products to more foreign causes because we see that our users are more interested in that . We might even want to extend the feature of water.org as a partner of ours , since it seems to be popular with our users . <p> If you use the quiz with enough hits from your user base you can learn things like this , which might cause you to understand characteristics or trends you did n't know about your users before . This can also be some pretty valuable data . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , hopefully now you have a good indication of how quizzes can be used effectively as a marketing tool to point your users to more sales and establish relationships through email collection . The goal of this article was to provide a thorough case study and example that you could easily tweak to make a quick quiz that caters to the audience of your website . <p> We 've seen some pretty incredible results of companies getting tens of thousands of leads by using quizzes , and we honestly believe that any company can create the right content for their quizzes and see major success in adding emails to their newsletter lists . If you 're running any sort of start up , you know that gaining users attentions is one of the biggest factors into making them a customer . 
@@22713512 @2713512/ <h> How to Make a Lead Generation Quiz <p> Quizzes as lead magnets are highly effective . Brands are using interactivity to engage potential customers and generate leads in droves . With Interact all of those leads are automatically connected to email marketing and marketing automation programs for instant , personalized follow-up , which makes them deliver strong ROI . <p> We get a lot of questions about how exactly to go about setting up a quiz for lead generation , so below is a guide that covers all of the content guidelines for the ideal personality quiz designed to capture leads . <p> The first key to any quiz idea is to make it about the person taking the quiz . We are all narcissists to some degree and we want to know about ourselves . Thus , the ideal title for any quiz is " Which ( Blank ) are you ? " so anything along the lines of " Which Style are You ? " or " Which Famous Human Rights Hero are You ? " is perfect . <p> The second key to a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because you 'll be using the quiz to capture leads , you do n't  want to stray to far from your core business with the idea but you also do n't  want to make it boring . The sweet spot is when you find a quiz that does both perfectly I.E. a company selling digital training courses for salespeople running a " What 's Your Negotiating Style ? " quiz . ( P.S. that ones available as a template on interact ) <p> Quiz Questions <p> The questions of an interactive quiz are what makes the quiz " human " and a huge part of the reason why quizzes work so well to generate leads . Within the questions you are able to have a scripted conversation with the person who is taking the quiz and build up a rapport that can be utilized to ask for a lead once that person finishes your quiz . <p> In order to make the most of your opportunity to connect directly with potential customers through quiz questions , here are the rules of engagement . <p> 1 . Speak like a human <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a study and found that the more you use personal pronouns like " I , you , and we " the more views your quiz will get on average . That 's because we use those types of words a lot in our daily lives and it feels much more natural to answer a question like " How would you describe yourself ? " than it does to answer a question like " Describe yourself " <p> 2 . Let people talk about themselves <p> 40% of the words well say in our lifetimes are about ourselves . That sounds narcissistic , and it is , but does n't  make it any less true . There are actually neurons that fire off in our brains when we talk about ourselves that give us good feelings . We really like to blab about our own person , and your questions should encourage people to talk about themselves . <p> 3 . Have 6-10 questions <p> You want people to spend 2 minutes on your quiz , which is about how long it takes to answer 6-10 questions , depending on how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you anticipate mostly mobile traffic ( which a lot of quizzes get ) , then you 'll want to keep the number of questions closer to 6 . <p> 4 . Use image answers <p> All 100 of the top 100 Interact quizzes have at least one question with image answers . This format provides visual representations of each answer choice which makes the quiz so much more appealing at a glance and easier to progress through . <p> Quiz Lead Capture form <p> After a quiz taker answers all the questions , theyll be presented with a form to opt-in in order to see their results ( often its an optional form ) . This is where you get an opportunity to capture contact information and send it to our integration partners . <p> 1 . Give people a reason to opt-in that 's not just to see results <p> It can be a discount , advice based on your personality , or a free consultation , etc . Whatever it is , just give people some incentive other than just seeing the quiz results . <p> 2 . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be up-front about what you 'll be sending to people or how you 'll be contacting them after they opt in then to leave it ambiguous . You only want people to opt-in because they like your business . <p> Quiz Personalities <p> After someone opts in , or even if they choose to skip that step , they are immediately taken to see their quiz results within the same quiz module . This is where the real payoff comes for the quiz taker , who has built up anticipation as to which personality they are . In order to make sure people are satisfied with their personality type , follow the rules below . <p> 1 . Have a good hero image <p> This is the first thing people will notice when they see their quiz results , and its very important that the image not only accurately represents the personality type , but also that it is just a high quality photo ( when people share their quiz results , this photo also gets shared ) <p> 2 . Write a short description <p> You want the short description to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make every result positive without lying by only focusing on the good aspects of a personality when you write the description . For example , if you tell someone they are a big truck , focus on the strength and durability of the truck , not the lumbering , slow nature of a big truck . <p> 3 . Include outbound links to personalized pages <p> Quizzes are highly effective at helping people experience your website in a personalized way . You 'll want to point people to a relevant resource that matches up to their personality . <p> 4 . Have social share buttons prominent <p> Quizzes are highly share-able , people will post their results to Facebook and Twitter given the opportunity , give them that opportunity . <p> Promotion Strategies <p> A quiz can only convert people into leads if they actually see the quiz . Weve identified two primary channels through which to promote your quizzes and below is exactly how to utilize both options . <p> 1 . Facebook ads <p> The #1 way people promote quizzes today is through Facebook ads . Because people on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top 5 publishers on Facebook for 2015 were quiz-heavy content sites ) , they will click on quizzes posed as ads . Below is how to best utilize quizzes as ads to generate leads . <p> 1 . Target an existing audience <p> The best and most consistent results we 've seen when promoting quizzes on Facebook is to run them as ads against an existing audience you have set up within Facebook advertising tools . This way you can quickly see the increase in conversions you 'll get from running a quiz ( and with Interact you can integrate with Facebook to track conversions on quizzes from Facebook ad clicks ) . <p> 2 . Promote a page on your website where the quiz is embedded <p> You always want to point people back to a page on your website where the quiz is embedded to take the quiz , rather than sending them directly to the quiz by itself . This way you 'll give people the opportunity to navigate to other pages should they choose to , and it increases brand awareness . <p> 2 . Website link <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple website links that are placed on the home page of sites . You can think of them as a replacement or augment to the standard " subscribe to our newsletter " box that every website has ( but most people instinctually overlook ) .

If you already have audiences set up in Facebook you can skip this step , but I 'm going to set up a new one for this walk-through. - <p> Part 1 : Set up your Facebook audience that you 'll be marketing toPart 2 : Set up your Facebook conversion pixels for when people reach quiz results , which means they have become a leadPart 3 : Construct your Facebook ad <h> Part 1 : Set up your Facebook audience that you 'll be marketing to <p> In my Facebook ads manager I 'm going to click " Ads Manager " and then " Audiences " so I I can to where I want to be so I can create a new audience for reaching with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager , I want to create a new audience , so I 'm going to click " Create New Audience " and then " Custom Audience " this will allow me to upload a list of contacts that will make up the audience I want to reach with my quiz ad . We recommend starting with this , so for example , you could upload your blog newsletter list and then create a lookalike audience based off of that , we 'll go over creating that lookalike audience in a minute . <p> Now I 'm going to upload a file with my contact list in it . There are other options for creating audiences , but by uploading a list of your existing contacts and using that as the basis for your overall audience , you 'll ensure that you are reaching people who are similar to the ones who already engage with your brand . <p> Now I 'm going to select " Add customers from your own file or copy and paste data " but you could also import directly from Mailchimp if you host your list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mailchimp I 'll show the upload method. - <p> Once I select to upload my own file , Facebook has a super sweet walk-through we can follow to upload the file and get everything set up . The first step is to upload my file of contacts . So we 'll click the " upload file " button to grab that . <p> I already prepared my file of contacts and stripped out all the data except the email addresses , but you can use the identifiers listed in the previous screenshot as well . Once I click the " Upload File " button I 'll be able to select my list of contacts from where it 's stored on my computer <p> Once I upload the file , the second step is to map the data in the file to data points within Facebook . Facebook will automatically identify the fields , and since I just have emails in my file this step is quick . <p> Now Facebook will check my contacts to make sure they are all good . Once that 's complete I 'll be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contact list I just uploaded . Basically that means that Facebook will go out and find people who are similar to the ones already on my list so I can advertise to them . I 'm going to click the " Create a Lookalike Audience " button to get started with that . <p> Now you 'll have options for setting up your lookalike audience , usually I just go with the " 1 " on audience size , which will still bring in a lot of people to the audience , and I try to limit the audience based on country so you 're only reaching the languages you support <p> Once you confirm the audience Facebook will automatically start creating it . You 'll need to wait about 15 minutes for them to complete the creation of the audience . Once it 's done you 'll see it says " Ready " and has a green dot next to it . Now you can click " Create Ad " and start actually creating the ad for your quiz <h> Part 2 : Set up your Facebook conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have become a lead <p> Now that our audience is created , let 's take a second to create the conversion event for when someone completes a quiz ( which means they became a lead because in an Interact quiz the results are shown after the lead capture form ) . <p> In order to do this , you 'll need your quiz set up and integrated with Facebook pixel , I 'll start from the beginning and show all the steps needed to set that up , so we 're all on the same page . If you 've already set up your quiz , you can skip down to where I show the Facebook pixel integration <p> With Interact , you can create quizzes from scratch , or select a template . I 'm going to select a template in the marketing category. - <p> Now , to make sure that only people who have opted-in reach your quiz results , so you can track conversions accurately within your Facebook ads , you 'll need to set up lead generation for your quiz . To do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my quiz " once your selected quiz template or custom quiz loads in. - <p> Once you turn on lead collection , you 'll be able to select what fields you want to require from people in order to see their quiz results . You 'll also want to uncheck the box that allows users to skip the opt-in form , so that you know for sure people who have reached the results have actually logged in. - <p> Once you 've selected that you 'll connect to your email marketing program . We have integrations with everyone , so select your program and sign in , then you 'll see a list of your lists so you can connect the quiz to whatever list you want . ( you 'll want to take a pause here and go create a list just for the quiz if you want to keep your leads separate ) <p> Now select the list you want to connect to <p> Now you 'll map the data you 're collecting in your quiz to your list and the fields in it <p> Now save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd like . And test the integration to make sure it 's properly connected to your email list <p> Now your quiz is set up to collect leads . The next step is to connect your Facebook pixel to your quiz so you can create events for the quiz outcomes so you can track conversions and retarget based on quiz outcomes. - <p> Go back to your Facebook ads manager and copy the Pixel I 'd from the top right of the page . <p> Now go back to Interact and paste the Pixel I 'd into the Facebook pixel integration under " Conversion Tracking " in the builder ( screenshot walk-through below ) <p> Now your quiz is connected to to Facebook ads and there will be events created for each of your quiz outcomes and you can create custom conversions based on those events . Unfortunately it takes 1 hour for those events to be created in Facebook , so at this point you have to wait 1 hour . <p> Once the hour is up , you can move back to Facebook and set up conversions based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this , you 'll navigate back to the " Pixels " section of your Facebook ads dashboard. - <p> Now click on " Create Conversion " <p> Then click on " Track Custom Conversions " <p> Now , in the " Rule " section , select " Event " <p> In the " Event " dropdown , select " Quiz " ( NOTE : If you have n't waited an hour , sometimes an hour and a half , this event will not exist yet , it takes Facebook an hour to set up your Event -&gt; Quiz , and that ca n't be rushed , so if you do n't see it , that 's because it has n't been created yet , and you have to wait an hour from when you first set it up in Interact <p> Now in the box where it says " Choose a Parameter ( optional ) " you 'll want to do two things . 1 . Create a label for the title of your quiz , and 2 . Create an action that contains all of your quiz result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title of the quiz result <p> Now , go to Interact quiz builder , and click on " Cover " then copy the title of the quiz and paste it into the box - in your Facebook ad manager next to where it says " Label " " Contains " <p> Now , click " and " next to where you just set up the " label " and select " action " from the drop-down menu , so you should have what looks like this <p> In the box next to " action " " contains " paste in all the result titles from your quiz , so you should do the following <p> Now , under " Category " select the appropriate category for what this conversion event is , for most cases this will be " Lead " because if someone reaches the results of a quiz that has lead capture turned on , they are a lead <p> Now , name your Conversion Event and save it <p> Now you 'll need to go activate the pixel , which means you need it to fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the results . In Interact , click " Share and Embed " for the quiz you just set up the Facebook pixel integration for , then copy the " Direct URL " and paste it into a new browser window <h> Part 3 : Construct your Facebook ad <p> Now we 're ready to go set up an ad for our quiz ! In your Facebook ads manager , click " Create Ad " <p> Now , under " What 's Your Marketing Objective " select " Conversions " because we want to get as many conversions as possible and since we set up the pixel to track conversions on our quiz we can track that <p> Give your campaign a name , I just put " Digital Marketing Quiz " for simplicity <p> Now we 'll start putting together the targeting for our ad . The first step is to set up the conversion event , and from the drop-down we 'll select " Quiz Leads " which is what we named our conversion event when we set it up above . <p> Next , we 'll set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this guide , I 'll select the lookalike audience from the list of contacts I uploaded . For now this is all the targeting I 'm going to do with my audience because I 've already set everything up , so that 's all I want to do <p> Under placements , I 'm going to leave it as " Automatic Placements " but if you want to specify placement on different devices etc. you can do that as well <p> The final step on the first part of setting up this ad is to set up budget and delivery .

The first two things you 'll do on this screen is name your ad and select the ad type . Again I just named it " Digital Marketing Quiz " and set the ad type as " Single Image " because the most effective ads are simply recreations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up the actual ad . There are three elements to cover. - <p> The URL of the ad , which I 'm going to use the direct URL of the quiz for , you can also paste in the URL where you have the quiz embedded if you are embedding it onto your website or a landing page <p> The ad Headline , which should match the title of the quiz <p> The ad text , which should be a short teaser to entice people to click the ad <p> Now make sure the Facebook pixel is green dotted at the bottom of the page , and place your order for the ad to start running <p> Once you place your order , wait 15 minutes for Facebook to approve your ad and it will start running. - 
@@22713514 @2713514/ <h> How to make the perfect quiz <p> Quizzes are the fastest-growing segment of content marketing , and whenever a segment is growing that means there is a greater opportunity for success as the market evolves . Although quizzes have been around for over ten years , they have not been a normal part of most content marketers ' arsenals " until recently . <p> More and more people are jumping on board to make quizzes , but what they are finding is that it 's difficult to make a quiz , unlike an article or video you ca n't just sit down and write it ( or record it ) . <p> Quizzes are much more complex , with scoring systems and correct answers , images , videos , GIFs and text all mixed in . To help navigate you through the wild world of quiz creation , I created this guide based on research done with 1500 quizzes built on Interact which have been viewed over 2 million times . <p> To kick things off , - here are the most important parts of making a quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . The Quiz Title : 5 templates that you need to know <p> 80% of people will make a decision as to whether or not they want to take your quiz based on its title . Without a title no one will care about your quiz and it will fall into the oblivion where non-liked social posts go to die ( I hear its somewhere in Iceland ) . Here are 5 data-driven templates for writing quiz title . <p> 1 . The Celebrity Comparison title : " Which celebritys sunglasses should you buy ? " throw the word celebrity into your quiz title and it can boost your quiz views by up to 1000% . As people who live in a celebrity-obsessed world , we are constantly subconsciously ( or consciously ) comparing ourselves to famous people . That 's a natural seg-way into creating a celebrity comparison quiz title . <p> To use the celebrity comparison title , start with a personality quiz and replace the personalities with people who have those personalities . This method can be used for products as well , by figuring out which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around that . <p> 2 . The " Actually " title : " What type of traveler are you actually ? " was/is one of the top-performing quizzes in the travel genre . The quiz takes advantage of the fact that everyone craves to learn more about themselves . The actually title plays on that desire and creates an irresistible proposition . <p> 3 . The " Which ( blank ) are you ? " title : This is the one that really kicked it all off for quizzes . " Which creature will you be in your next life ? " is a quiz that has received more than 385,000 views and it exemplifies the quiz trend quite perfectly . The quiz is - personality quiz modified to tell you what you will be in the next life . <p> 4 . The " How much do you really know ? " title : Think about how many games have been invented to settle the score on who in your group of friends and family knows the most about random subjects ? Trivial Pursuit , scrabble , Risk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge . <p> Quizzes can capitalize on our inherent desire to show the world how smart we are by posing the question " How much do you really know ? " Our inherent desire to appear smart will take over and we wont be able to resist taking your quiz . <p> 5 . Who said it ? title : Continuing on the topic of turning boring knowledge tests into irresistible challenges to our ego , I present the " Who said it ? " quiz title . <p> For example , a recent quiz titled " Who said it , Isis or Hamas ? " sparked tweets from the Israeli embassy and commanders of troops in the middle east . The quiz shows various quotes by one of the two groups and then asks you to identify which one said it . Knowledge buffs pitted themselves against each other and the quiz took off . <p> While this is a particularly strong ( and sensitive ) case , it does exemplify how powerful a comparison quiz can be . <h> 2 . Cover image hook <p> Where a blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image hook . The cover of every quiz has an image on it that acts as the visual stimulus from to which readers are drawn when browsing through social media sites . We did some research to find out what kind of images you should use as cover photos to maximize quiz traffic , and found that photos of smiling people outperform every other kind of picture . <p> Ideally the picture only has one person in it , because our brains are wired to find faces , but get overwhelmed by more than one face at a time . <p> Check out this graph which shows the average number of quiz views for 32 Buzzfeed quizzes that have a cover photo with a person on it versus 31 quizzes with no smiling person . The average , while not overwhelmingly higher , is statistically better when your cover photo has a picture of a person on it . <h> 3 . Conversational questions <p> Moving on to the content of your quiz , let 's look at best practices for writing quiz questions . <p> We had a hunch about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion was that the most natural-sounding questions would be on the same quizzes that ended up getting the most views . Since 60% of our normal conversations revolve around ourselves , and talking about ourselves uses a lot of the words " I , you , and me " the test we ran was to see if there was a difference in quizzes that used more of those words . <p> The results are strongly in favor of using more of the words I , you , and me . The times when we use these words are when we talk as if we would normally , in our natural tone , using our own voice . <p> The best quiz questions not only speak in a personable tone , but have a little pizzazz to them . The writers who create these quizzes are confident in their writing abilities and have no problem speaking naturally . <p> To give an example , check out the picture of a question from a quiz by Food52 below . This particular quiz was viewed over 25,000 times , but that does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you have to keep in mind when writing quiz questions is that quizzes are made primarily for entertainment . Sure . you can present targeted offers ( which we will go over ) , but your main purpose is to create a fun and interactive experience for existing and prospective customers . <h> 4 . Uplifting and actionable results <p> The results of your quiz are where you get an opportunity to amplify the reach of your content . The coveted social share buttons at the bottom of each result can either make your quiz explode in popularity or go unnoticed depending on how your go about creating your results . <p> Additionally , quiz results can potentially lead to qualified customers continuing to interact with your brand and eventually purchasing if you play your cards right . <p> Part 1 of quiz results : How to write them <p> Writing quiz results is akin to telling people their fortunes without all the weird stuff . You are essentially making a claim about the quiz taker based on the way they answered your questions . You want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you also want to retain your voice as you did in the quiz questions . <p> Here are a few tips . <p> Be kind . No one wants to hear about their problems . Even if your quiz identifies someone as sub-par , do n't  be rude and put them down . To show just how much of an effect positive results have on quiz shares , we analyzed 2000 tweets of quiz results from interact quizzes for several keywords including , excellent , awesome , great , good , and a few others . The goal was to see what percentage of actual tweets have a positive connotation . <p> A full 75% of all tweets contain positive trigger words . Social media is a bit of a popularity contest , and when a quiz tells you that you rock , that helps your popularity . <p> A word of warning , do n't  go and just fill up your quiz results with feel-good positivity . People will know if you are just trying to butter them up . To avoid making this error , just focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description around those . <p> This example of a quiz result from Amnesty Internationals " Which famous human rights activist are you ? " quiz does an excellent job of exemplifying a great quiz result . The text is factual , but also contains trigger words such as " important " and " influential . " <p> Remember , this quiz result comes after you told the quiz a bit about yourself , so hearing a positive story like this result makes you feel pretty special . <p> Part 2 of quiz results : How to keep the conversation going <p> The second important element of a great quiz is the follow-up . When you give someone a quiz result , you have their full attention . After all , you just assessed their life based off of the way they answered your questions and they are quite curious to know what it all means . <p> The best quizzes have a personalized and immediate follow-up , check out a couple of examples for how to do that . <p> 1 . Provide a personalized content recommendation <p> Quizzes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each result of your quiz , you can include a link to check out further reading or videos about the particular result and you have a captive audience to click those links . <p> Forbes did this with their " Which college is right for you ? " quiz . The quiz results give you a region and type of college that fits your personality . Then , they included a link to check out their college adviser with the settings already dialed in to your personality pretty cool ! <p> To replicate this method , you can either create long-form content that goes along with each quiz result , or just link out to existing content that fits well with your quiz . Providing a personalized recommendation drastically improves on-site time and makes each quiz taker feel special . <p> 2 . Offer a unique product to each person- <p> Another way to utilize the personalization aspect of quizzes is to provide targeted product recommendations . A study done by Baynote- showed that offering personalized products can increase sales by 300% , and using a quiz its possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equate a set of products to different personality types and make a normal personality quiz with the products . Then give a link to purchase the product in the results . <p> For example , this quiz done by Hookah and Shisha titled " Which Hookah are you ? " has seven different kinds of Hookah as the results and provides a link to purchase the recommended product on the site . <h> 5 . Soundbites for sharing <p> With so much of quiz traffic relying on social networks , its vital to make sure your quizzes have easily share-able snippets that render well on social media . <p> There is a formula for how quizzes get shared , it goes like this : " I got ( my result ) ( title of the quiz ) " <p> In real life that looks like this : " I got Almost there : do you actually know how to swim ? " which is in fact the actual share-able snippet from a Red Cross quiz they unleashed on social media to educate people and raise awareness for their new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key is to make sure your quiz title and quiz results titles match up well . The result title will be what entices the share , and the quiz title will be what attracts other people to take the quiz . <p> You also want to make sure each result has a nice image tat goes along with the title because that will get pulled and shared on social media as well . 
@@22713516 @2713516/ <h> How to build your email list using quizzes <p> If you 've worked in marketing for more than ten minutes , you know that generating fresh leads is the backbone of everything that happens in the marketing world . Today I 'm going to look at how quizzes those viral , share-able , pieces of content that just wont go away , can be turned into lead generation machines that feed the top of your sales funnel . <p> To better understand how quizzes for lead generation work , we are going to follow the process of three companies whose quizzes combined to bring in 5,570 new email leads . Well look at the exact method each marketer used to formulate these quizzes and well walk away with actionable ways you can create your own quizzes for lead generation . <h> Step 1 . What to make a quiz about <p> Before you do anything , you need a subject to create your quiz on . To learn more on how this works , let 's meet our three example companies and see how they landed on the quiz ideas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNiDAYS <p> This company is an E-commerce site dedicated to University gear . Their method for selecting a quiz idea was to scour the likes of Buzzfeed and Zimbio to find the top quiz content and use those ideas for themselves . This is also known as the skyscraper technique , which means finding out what 's worked for others and improving on it . <p> Unless you are n't  on Facebook , you recognize the title " Which Celebrity is Your Soulmate ? " it pops up in one form or another on almost everyones newsfeed . I especially like this example because it shows that any quiz can be turned into one that brings in new email subscribers , this is quite literally the same quiz title that 's been used hundreds of times before , but this time it will be used for growing UNiDAYS email list stay tuned to learn how . <p> World Wildlife Fund <p> This organization is one of the worlds largest dedicated conservation-based groups . They work around the world to protect endangered animals and environments . For their quiz , they used something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on past popular content . In simple terms , the World Wildlife Fund discovered that the most popular articles on their website were about the various animals they were protecting ( this was done by looking at Google Analytics ) . Then they created a quiz where the results led to one of those popular articles . <p> This method is great because its easily replicable on pretty much any site , you just have to look at the top articles and group them into a quiz format . <p> Viewsbank <p> This is a website that pays you to take surveys which companies want respondents to . They create quizzes to grow their email list which can then be leveraged into more customers ( people who take surveys ) . The quiz strategy from Viewsbank is based on events . Theyve done Halloween " Which Monster Are You ? " , Christmas " What kind of gift giver are you ? " , and Valentines Day " What Kind of Valentine are you ? " <p> Again , I like this quiz strategy because its not very specific to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be adapted to virtually any business application . <h> 2 . How to build out your quiz <p> The first thing people see when they agree to start taking your quiz are the questions . For a quiz that 's designed to collect new email subscribers , the questions must build up some trust with the people taking your quiz so theyll be more inclined to subscribe at the end of the quiz . Let 's look at how our three example companies built rapport using questions . <p> UNiDAYS <p> Following the topic theme of pure entertainment , the questions in this quiz are meant to just be fun . The example here is " What 's your drink of choice ? " which does n't  have much of a direct bearing on the results of the quiz but does work to break the ice and create some conversation . This tactic works to build trust by just having a good time , at the end of the quiz when the opt-in form comes up and asks for an email address , people are more likely to give over their email address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The World Wildlife Fund has a different but equally effective technique to their quiz questions . Their goal is to make you start thinking about what you really believe in and what you stand up for . The question below " What 's Your Communication Style ? " - makes you stop and consider for a minute what your best communication style is . This starts to open your dialogue up and when you are asked for an email address at the end of the quiz its not such a big deal . <p> Viewsbank <p> This quiz gets really personal , another great way to ask quiz questions . People are surprisingly willing to answer personal questions when taking quizzes online , and personal questions double as an excellent way to build trust with someone you do n't  know who is taking your quiz . <h> 3 . How to use the quiz for lead generation <p> After the quiz questions and before the results is when the email opt-in form pops up . This is where you get to collect personal contact information from your quiz takers and continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you ask for the email address can determine the conversion rate , let 's look at a few prime examples of this opt-in text . <p> UNiDAYS <p> The UNiDAYS quiz is all about fun . Its lighthearted from the start and the quiz questions are enjoyable . The call to action reflects this theme by asking for an email address in a simple but direct way . This fits with the general idea of the quiz , which is perfect , and led to a very strong conversion rate . <p> Conversion rate : 68.5% <p> World Wildlife Fund <p> This quiz integrates a contest with the email capture form . The main call to action still references the fact that the lead capture form comes before the results , so the person should put in their email address to see the results , but since their is a skip step that 's not always enough to entice someone to input an email . This quiz has a contest attached to subscribing , its not a big contest ( a Patagonia jacket is worth about $100 ) , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Conversion rate : 39% <p> Viewsbank <p> This one is interesting . Viewsbank is a site that pays people to take surveys , and you have to be a member to take those surveys and make money . Their quiz asks for an email address in return for showing the results and getting your own personal invite to Viewsbank . This is a very direct tie-in to the product behind the company producing the quiz , but it turned out to be effective in this case . <p> Conversion rate : 81% <h> 4 . How to write quiz results that get shared <p> When someone inputs their email address ( or if they choose to skip that step ) , they are then taken to the quiz results . This is your very first interaction with a person who has given your company their email address , and it is important to building the type of connection that can lead to long-term customers . There is a lot of pressure here to make a good impression on new quiz takers , let 's see how our example companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see below , there 's not much to this quiz result besides a picture and some share buttons . This is on purpose . UNiDAYS primarily targets young people , who are active on social media . The quiz results , which tell you who your celebrity soulmate is are all very popular and attractive celebrities . Getting a well-known celebrity as your quiz result is like a badge of honor for these University students , and sharing those results is the primary objective . That 's why the results are limited to a large image and the ability to share . <p> World Wildlife Fund <p> The quiz results from The World Wildlife Fund have the primary objective of getting quiz takers to continue interacting with the website . There are two large orange buttons that point to " learn more about Grizzly bears in Alaska " and " learn more about grizzly bears " These buttons provide an easy and natural opportunity to continue engaging with The World Wildlife Fund , which is exactly what they want . <p> Remember , because quizzes get shared so much on Facebook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the brand behind the quiz . There needs to be some sort of connection really soon after the quiz to connect people to the brand , and articles about bears are the perfect way to achieve that . <p> Viewsbank <p> This quiz wants to reach as many people as possible , and the main way it gets traffic is through social shares . They take a short and simple approach to getting shared , with a very brief description that 's up-lifting . Sometimes shorter is better like this scenario where what really matters is the result title more than the full description . <h> 5 . Beginning the customer connection via email <p> After the quiz is all said and done , you have a strangers email address and the permission to email them . The key to beginning successful relationship with this person and eventually converting them into a paying customer is to have a smooth transition into an email connection . The example below from The World Wildlife Fund is a perfect representation of this . This is the first email you 'll receive after taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it also offers up yet another free resource for people who are on the list . <p> There is a ton of pressure put on marketers to bring in leads all the time , that 's just part of the job . When emerging technologies like quizzes can help with generating new subscribers , that 's an amazing thing . Hopefully Ive sparked some ideas for creating lead generation quizzes here .

Once that page exists , you simply edit the content on the page and select the " code block " option by clicking on the little raindrop symbol that opens up all the page options . The code block option will let you drop in your embed code directly from Interact without having to do anything funky. <h> 4 . Grab your Interact embed code <p> So now you need the embed code for your quiz . Obviously you 'll need to make a quiz first , so if you are n't  there yet , go to Interact and make the quiz you want . You can set the size of your quiz from within Interact by typing in the height and width you want , be sure to play with various sizes to find the optimal one for your Squarespace page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You can see below that I pasted in the iframe code from Interact into the Squarespace code block html editor .

Also make sure you grabbed the iframe embed option from Interact , we have a javascript code that will not work in Squarespace. <h> 6 . Now you have a quiz in Squarespace <p> That 's literally all you have to do . I set up a new Squarespace account , created the quiz page and embdded this quiz in a total of about ten minutes .

@@22713521 @2713521/ <h> The Beginners Guide to Making Your Own Quiz <p> If you 're like me , you saw Buzzfeed quizzes or Zimbio quizzes and thought " Shoot , I 'd really like to make one of those for my website , " especially one of the ones that has gotten millions of views . The bad news is that most of those quizzes you see do n't  allow you to make your own , the good news is that Interact does ( start here ) . This guide walks you through the steps to creating your own quiz along with some general tips on how to create a quiz that 's worth sharing . <p> Step 1 : Write your title and description . <p> The first step of the quiz-making process is to give your quiz a title , description , and call to action . There are some great tips for writing titles here , and for the description , you want to reaffirm the title while adding some intrigue . On this screen you may also upload a custom cover photo ( which I recommend doing ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Step 2 : Connect up your email list ( if you want to ) <p> This is an optional but very cool feature of interact quizzes . Weve created partnerships with various email marketing and marketing automation programs to funnel new emails collected through your quiz into your email list . On this page , just select your email marketing program from the list and sign in to connect it up . <p> One other thing you can do with the email capture feature is customize the call to action , so when people take your quiz they are presented with text that makes sense in the context of what you 've created . For example , if your quiz is about The World Cup , and you are going to follow up with marketing tips learned from the world cup , tell the quiz taker that that is what 's going on so they know . <p> Step 3 : Write the quiz questions . The majority of time spent on your quiz is in the questions -both for you as the creator and for the people who take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz questions based off of over 1000 quizzes created using Interact . <p> Keep it simple . I 'm a big fan of questions that use plain english . Quizzes are great because you can do things like ask questions that simply say " pick one " and its still intuitive . Do n't  over-complicate things by creating confusing wording . <p> Do n't  have too many . Ten questions takes about two minutes to finish ( based on our analytics data ) . You do n't  want to ask for much more than two minutes of your quiz takers time or you risk losing people before they finish <p> Get the scoring right . The way interact scoring works is by assigning values to every quiz answer . These are numerical value ( integers if you want to get specific ) . Based on the total number of points a quiz-taker gets , they will be shown a different result . <p> Step 4 : Create the quiz results . This is your chance to amplify the reach of your quiz . Quizzes are notoriously share-able and you can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Based on our quizzes and popular quizzes on the web , here are the best practices for making results . <p> Give it a good title . Each quiz result is like a short story about the person who just finished your quiz . Short stories need great titles if you want to maximize the impact . <p> Be uplifting . The results are a story about the quiz taker , a personal story that 's believable because the quiz taker just answered a bunch of personal questions to get to the result . Do n't  insult people by making their story a negative one . <p> Get scoring right . Based on your quiz questions , you will have a total number of points available , let 's say you have a maximum of 50 . For personality-type quizzes , you can get the scoring right by lining up your results ( for example , from most introverted to least introverted ) , then 41-50 is the most introverted and 0-9 is the least introverted . The middle scores correlate to the middle personalities . <p> Embedding/Sharing . Quizzes can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that YouTube videos do , or they can be shared through social networks . The best way to share your quiz is by taking it yourself and sharing your result . The results will be formatted like this : " I got ( result ) ( name of quiz ) " that way every result is personal and encourages other people to take the quiz .

Embedding a quiz in a static html app is pretty simple , but I created a guide for how to do it over here . A good example of using an app to embed a quiz comes from Cal Recycle , who created a quiz " What 's your recycling personality ? " that is applicable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter does n't  let you automatically share images the way Facebook does , which is a bummer . Do n't  worry though , you can either share without an image which is still effective , or manually add a screenshot of the quiz or your quiz results . The best Twitter shares have their own personal touch , just like Facebook . <h> Part 2 : How to make a quiz that 's worth sharing <p> Getting more shares does not just begin and end with the share button . Before you even expose your quiz to an audience its important to put in the work to create an excellent quiz that deserves to be shared . In the following steps I 'll walk through the elements of a quiz that 's worth sharing based on analyzing more than 2000 quizzes created using Interact . <p> 1 . Picking a topic that fits your niche. - <p> Before you put pen to paper ( actually fingers to keys ) , you have to come up with a topic that resonates with your audience or else theyll never bother to share it with friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking your topic . <p> Target a small group of people who care . Trying to please everyone in the world with your quiz will only lead to creating a mediocre quiz that no one really cares about . Instead , create a quiz that a smaller group of people will really enjoy . For example , there 's a newspaper in Faquier County , Virginia that created a quiz for the residents of their county ( of which there are only 80,000 ) . <p> Within two weeks one in every four residents of the county had taken the quiz . When you consider that only 1/2 of those residents voted in the last election , that 's quite a feat . Build a quiz that people love , even if its not very many people , and you 'll be sure to gain healthy traffic . <p> Speak to one person . Expanding on the previous point , think of one person out of that small crowd of people who would really enjoy your quiz and you know for sure would forward it on to friends . Create a quiz with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the right mindset , since quizzes are a very personal type of content and you want to make sure the style is done in such a way that it appeals personally . <p> 2 . Writing a quiz title that stands out on social channels. - <p> A full 80% of people will decide if they want to take your quiz based on the title they see popping up on their social media feeds . I recommend spending nearly as much time coming up with a catchy title as you do creating the quiz content itself . Luckily , you might not have to do that because we 've found a few title templates that consistently outperform everything else . Check them out . <p> The " Actually " title : " How much do you actually know about Israel ? " is a quiz that has taken Twitter by storm , receiving more than 1000 retweets and hundreds of thousands of views from Reddit and Facebook . Really all you are doing is setting up a knowledge test , but the word " actually " makes it much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helping the quiz to stand out on social channels . <p> The " Which ( blank ) are you ? " title : - " Which famous human rights activist are you ? " is a quiz that Amnesty International created to help raise awareness for pressing issues around the world . They assigned one famous activist to each quiz taker as the results of the quiz . <p> The awesomeness of this quiz is that it turns something that seems distant , like international issues , and turns it into something personal that applies to each individual . This is an excellent tactic for many marketers who face similar issues of getting customers to really care about the products or services they are offering . <p> The Celebrity Comparison Title : StyleCraze is an India-based style and fashion brand that is funded by advertising dollars . They created a series of celebrity comparison quizzes " Which celebrity hairstyle should you have ? " for example . They did five of these quizzes , leading to over 100,000 views in total , a strong bump in traffic . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subliminally compare ourselves to them anyways , so using celebrities in a quiz is natural and fun <p> 3 . Writing quiz questions that make people want to share your quiz. - <p> It might seem like there is a big divide between the questions of your quiz and getting more social media shares , but in reality they are more connected than you think . The questions of a quiz are where you get an opportunity to connect with each quiz taker on a more personal level , and if that goes well they will feel more comfortable sharing your content and promoting you . <p> Its like asking a stranger to write you a review versus asking an acquaintance , even though the acquaintance may not know you very well , they still will be comfortable giving you a positive rating if your initial interaction went well . Here are a few tips on writing questions that turn strangers into friends . <p> Use your own voice . Remember that your quiz questions are only viewed by one person at a time in a one-on-one session . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather speak candidly like you would to a buddy . <p> A perfect example of this comes from Food52.com . They consistently create high traffic quizzes and every single one has a fun voice to it . You know its coming from a person who is fun to talk to . <p> Do n't  drone on . Ask your questions quickly and get out of the way , give people time to express themselves . After all we actually get a brain stimulation when we are talking about ourselves , so giving people the platform is an excellent way to get your quiz takers to like you more . <p> 4 . Crafting quiz results that need to be shared. - <p> Now that you 've done all the work of getting people to click on your quiz title and writing questions to build some rapport , it comes time for the big test enticing quiz takers to click the social share buttons and expand the reach of your quiz . <p> There is somewhat of a magic formula here ( its not really magic , we used analytics to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in your quiz results . <p> Be really upbeat . When is the last time you saw someone put up a post that made them look bad ? We just do n't  do that . Social media is where we get to brag about how awesome we are and make our friends jealous . Your quiz results should feed into that . <p> ButStay Honest . Do n't  go telling people they are awesome for no reason . For every result , you can find some tidbit that really is great and build up the content around that . The best example of this Ive ever seen comes from Randall Reilly , an agency that made a truck quiz " What type of truck are you ? " and managed to make every single result fun and upbeat without making stuff up . <p> Be ready for sharing . The formula for Interact quizzes goes like this . " I got ( my result ) ( title of the quiz ) " so for example " I got Southern Private Which College Should You Attend ? " make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format so that when people share your quiz it shows up nicely . <h> Conclusion do as Shaq Does . <p> Shaquille Oneal is a rich man , and not just because he s won several NBA championships . He has grown his reach by having a very strong social presence and leveraging that to launch successful products . His rule for maximizing social reach is to make 80% of his content with the purpose of entertaining his followers , 15% of it to inform , and 5% to sell products . <p> Keep that formula in mind , and you 'll be sure to create a killer quiz for social media .

The guide is broken into two parts . <p> Part 1 : Setting up your quiz <p> Part 2 : Promoting your quiz <p> Let 's get to it . <h> Setting up your quiz <p> Select a template that makes sense for you , or start from scratch <p> Interact has over 100 quiz templates to choose from across a variety of industries . If you are doing something specialized , you can still start from scratch and not use a template , either way the tool is dead simple to use . <p> Customize the cover and add your own logo to brand the quiz <p> The first thing you 'll do after selecting a template or starting to build your quiz from scratch is customize the cover page of the quiz . This is what people will first see when they click through to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title your quiz , there are only two templates you should think about . <p> 1 . For personality quizzes its " Which ( Blank ) are You ? " <p> 2 . For assessments its " How Much do You Really Know About ( Blank ) " <p> Stick to one of those two templates , customize it to your use-case , and you 're golden . <p> The other thing to do right when you jump into the builder is upload your own logo so the quiz is branded like your company ( this requires a Pro account ) . <p> Customize the quiz results ( personalities or score ranges ) based on your brand <p> Each quiz outcome is unique and can be customized with a separate image , description , links , videos , and more . The Interact quiz templates are all set up to where you do n't  really need to change much , but you can still modify them if you 'd like . At the very least , you should add links in each quiz result so that people can click through to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and correlations to your liking <p> You can quickly and easily modify questions on a template or add new questions from scratch . On each question you 'll see a button in the top right corner of the page that says " Result Correlations " you can click that to connect up the answer choices to the outcomes for personality quizzes . <p> Connect your email marketing program <p> Interact integrates with most email marketing systems and marketing automation systems ( see full list here ) . You can sign into your email marketing or marketing automation account and select the list that you want to connect with your quiz . Interact will automatically send the quiz results along with the new emails you capture in your quiz so you can segment your list based on quiz results and send personalized follow-ups . <p> Customize your lead capture call to action form <p> Change the text on the lead capture form and make sure you cover two main things . <p> 1 . Tell people why they should opt-in , other than just getting to see their quiz results . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their recommended pair of shoes ( if you 're doing a shoes quiz ) <p> 2 . Tell people how you 're going to contact them . Will you be sending a monthly email ? Calling people directly ? Just give people a heads-up . <p> Embed on your website <p> Within Interact , click " publish " and then copy the iframe embed code for your quiz and paste it into your webpage . We also have a wordpress plugin that turns your quiz into a shortcode if you prefer that . <h> Promoting Your Quiz <p> Weve identified two primary methods for building your list in a cost-effective manner using a quiz . <p> 1 . A Facebook ad targeting your audience <p> Set up a Facebook ad to target the audience you want on your email list and use the quiz as the creative and copy for that ad . Quizzes are naturally appealing on Facebook ( as I 'm sure you 've noticed on your newsfeed the last few years ) , which is why they work great as ads . Weve seen our customers acquire leads using Facebook ads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also leave the same ad running to the same quiz for a very long time ( record so far is 3 years ) . <p> 2 . A link on your website <p> Another place our customers are finding huge success is by adding a link to the quiz inside of their website . In todays web world , people pretty much gloss over as soon as they see an email opt-in form , but a quiz is different , and captures attention immediately . By adding an image of your quiz to your website you can drive a new , consistent flow of new leads .

You have to have a quiz before it can go on your Wix site . There is a special process to making quizzes a set of things you must get right to have the minimum needed for an awesome quiz . Here are those things : <p> Create a quiz just for your readers : Do n't  try to address everyone with your quiz , make it just for your readers . The quizzes that we 've seen have the most success are the ones that address one specific set of people . My favorite example of this is the Irish Post , a magazine that made a quiz just for Irish people living in London ( of which there are only 200,000 ) and 15,000 of them took the quiz that 's a high percentage ! <p> Keep it fun even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they give you the unique ability to speak directly to your audience members the way you would at the local pub . Take advantage of that by remaining fun and light-hearted . We 've had every business from Plumbers to United Way make quizzes , and the ones that perform best are the ones that are amazing fun . <p> Create share-able results : Think ahead to how quiz-takers will eventually share your quiz . In general we share things that apply directly to us ( which your quiz will ) , and make us look good ( which you can control ) . Make sure your quiz prints out results that are uplifting and fun . <p> First , grab the embed code which will be created when you 're done building your interact quiz . You can access it from your dashboard under " embed " Interact quizzes work like YouTube videos as far as embedding goes , so its super simple . <p> - Once you 've got the embed code , add it to Wix using an HTML app . You can add an HTML app from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left navigation bar under " apps " select the html one and then select HTML code instead of website address . You can then drop in the code you just copied from Interact <p> As soon as the code is in place you should see a preview of the quiz pop up . If it does n't  come up for some reason , there is a problem Contact support at Interact for help if that happens . You 'll want to check and make sure that the quiz fits in well with the content around it before publishing . Generally , quizzes work well near the top of a page , if you put them at the bottom fewer people see it and if they came to your site because of the quiz , you may lose them before they find it . <p> This is what your quiz will look like on your new Wix site ! There are tons of uses for quizzes and they are amazing fun . Using interact , it just takes a couple of minutes to get your quiz up and running on Wix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a prominent part of your site , just like any blog post quizzes do go out of style after a while . <p> Step 3 : Launch your quiz and share it with the world ! <p> Weve seen quizzes get popular on all platforms , so to maximize your chances of " going viral " be sure to share it everywhere . You can share the page using the built-in Wix tools , or share the quiz directly using the social share buttons that will appear at the end of the quiz . Within Interact you can customize the share links to point back to your Wix site so anyone who shares your quiz will share a link back to your site and not anywhere else . <h> To get started with a quiz of your very own to add to Wix , head to Tryinteract.com 
@@22713529 @2713529/ <h> How to Create a Quiz for Your Brand <p> Quizzes are viral . Buzzfeed , Zimbio , and The New York Times have all shown that you can bring in 100 's of millions of visitors with quizzes , and they continue to dominate social feeds . However , I 'm going to argue that all that traffic is useless if you do n't  do something with it . <p> Today were going to look at exactly how YOU can create a quiz for your company and use it to bring in qualified sales leads and actually sell products . This is great stuff , check it out . <h> Part 1 . Design it to match your company <p> Using third-party tools to create content ( like quizzes ) can be scary if you work for a corporation because of the fear that you wont be able to abide by brand guidelines . That 's why we 've built interact to be customizable to your style needs . <p> a . Branding <p> With Interact you can put your own logo in your quiz , effectively making it white-labeled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> b . Style <p> You can also customize the colors of the quiz to match the overall look and feel of your site . A little freebie if you use a picture of one person as the cover photo you 'll be in a bracket with quizzes that get twice as many hits , on average . <h> Part 2 . Create content to engage the audience <p> The way you title your quiz and write the questions has a huge impact on how well it ends up performing , let 's look at the important elements . <h> a . Title : <p> The title is the deciding factor for 80% of people when they are considering whether or not to check out your quiz . Take it seriously , follow these templates . <p> 1 . " Which ( blank ) are you ? " <p> For example " Which Dog are You ? " titles that contain the three words " which " " are " and " you " ( like this one ) get more than twice the hits on average , in a study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Celebrity Title " <p> Like " Which Celebrity Should You Marry ? " Quizzes with the word " celebrity " in the title get 10x the hits of an average quiz . This is partially due to the fact that a lot of entertainment and news sites make these types of quizzes , but its still telling . <p> 3 . " How much do you Actually Know About ? " <p> Like " How Much do You Actually Know About Iran ? " Adding the word " Actually " yields a 50% boost in hits on average . This template is perfect for any multiple choice quiz . <h> b . Questions : <p> The questions of a quiz are magical . You get to have a real ( albeit scripted ) conversation with every single potential customer , where else do you get that opportunity ? Nowhere , that 's where . Here are three tips on writing good quiz questions . <p> 1 . Inject personality <p> We , again , did a study , and found that using words like " you " " I " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correlated with getting more visits and shares . That 's because we use words like that in our real lives , so it makes sense to use them in a quiz . <p> 2 . Use Images <p> All 100 of the top 100 quizzes created with interact have at least one image question in them . That 's pretty telling that you definitely want to have images in your questions . <p> 3. 6-10 Questions <p> Our online attention spans are two minutes ( I know , a bit sad right ? ) but that means you want 6-10 questions in your quiz , which is the amount someone can answer in two minutes . <h> 3 . Set up lead capture to drive value <p> Quizzes going viral is great , but if you want to build lasting value from your quiz , include a lead capture form . With interact , this form comes up between the questions and the results , and can be either optional or required . This form has an average opt-in of 50% across all of our quizzes , and we 've helped brands bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three tips to get in on that action . <p> a . Offer Value <p> Yes , you are " gating " the results of your quiz with the lead capture form , but you should also offer some other form of value . This can be an exclusive discount , a free download , or personalized advice . <p> b . Tell people how you 'll be contacting them <p> Give your new contacts an exact picture of how often you 'll be contacting them and how . This build some trust first and foremost so the relationship gets off to a good start . <p> c . Integrate with your marketing automation system <p> Interact integrates with all the major marketing automation and email marketing programs . Connect your up so the follow-up happens automatically . <h> 4 . Craft results to increase your reach <p> Quiz results are where you get the opportunity to go viral by having your audience share their personality and get friends to take your quiz . Here are the three things to get right on the results . <p> a . Be nice without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive trigger words like " great " " awesome " " innovative " etc . People like to share things that make them look good , that 's called the " self-serving bias " and its a proven psychological principal . Be careful though , do n't  lie to people or itll be obvious . <p> b . Use great images <p> Quiz results get shared like " I got ( my result ) ( title of the quiz ) " with the image from the particular result included in the share . Make sure you have great images in your results . ( and shares with images get clicked on 18% more <p> c . Include personalized calls-to-action <p> Personalized calls-to-action convert 42% better than regular ones , use that to your advantage and include a link in each quiz result to learn more about your personality or purchase products based on your interests . <h> 5 . Follow-up to close sales <p> Once you collect emails with your quiz , you can use automation to follow-up in a personal way to each person based on the personality your quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> a . The " Thank You " email ( immediately ) <p> The first thing to send out for brand new subscribers who came in through a quiz is a simple " Welcome " or " Thank You " or just an acknowledgement of who the person is by their personality . <p> b . Send out personalized suggestions ( 3-5 days in ) <p> A few days after you collect a persons information , send another email with personalized suggestions for them based on their personality from the quiz . <p> c . Tell people why you exist ( 7-10 days in ) <p> The third email should be a story of one of your customers or of the founding of your company and why it exists and what your core mission is . <p> d . Call to action close the sale ( 12-17 days in ) <p> About two weeks after collecting information , send an email with a call-to-action to make a purchase , bonus points if you personalize this based on their personality . <h> That 's all you have to do to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all that good stuff , but this guide shows exactly how to harness that popularity and turn it into something that actually generates leads and sales for your company .

@@22713532 @2713532/ <h> How to set up the scoring for your personality quiz <p> With a personality quiz , there is no correct answer , its like that philosophy class you took in college while you were in the " finding yourself " phase . Instead of correct answers , there are correlations between the quiz questions and the quiz results . This might sound super confusing ( the word correlation never really makes any sense ) . - However , I 've attempted to simplify how it all works and hopefully it makes sense to you . <h> Step 1 : Set up " Set Answer Correlations " Dialogue <p> Personality quizzes work backwards . You start with the quiz results ( the personality types ) and then you create the quiz questions afterwards . <h> Step 2 : Choose how to correlate each answer choice to your results <p> Once you create the quiz questions , you can connect them to the results you set up in the previous step . In words , each quiz question will have several answers , and each answer will correlate to its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result that got the most overall correlations will get shown as the quiz takers personality type . <h> FAQ : <p> 1 . What if two results tie ? <p> The first one you created is shown . Let 's say for example you set up three results , red , yellow , and green . You have questions that correlate to those results . At the end of the quiz , all three results have two - points , so there 's a tie . At this point the result shown will be red , because that 's the first one you set up .

@@22713534 @2713534/ <h> How to make a trivia quiz and delight your audience <p> Weve been lucky enough to have some amazing trivia quizzes built using Interact , but none I can think of does a better job than Smooth Radio , a UK station that has done an excellent job of augmenting their on-air material with fun trivia quizzes that are used for contests and promotions . <h> Step 1 : Write fun questions <p> Smooth Radio does a great job of this . <p> Be coy . This is the strategy that most closely aligns with what Smooth Radio does in their trivia quizzes . The object here is to give the minimal amount of information needed to have someone answer a question and no more . This makes it almost like a game show in a way where not all the information is revealed and creates a sense of adventure . <p> Take on a persona . Usually this just means be a more ridiculous version of yourself , but sometimes it means acting like a gameshow host and writing questions in their terms . <p> Follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be a bit crass , a bit off-the-wall , a bit strange . The rule is that you cant ask a question that would be unacceptable if you were in an actual pub , that way every question is entertaining . <h> Step 2 : Satisfy curiosity instantly <p> People really want to know if they got the right answer immediately . This is a huge part of the draw of trivia nights and pub nights around the world . There 's something about clicking a button and instantly knowing if you chose the right option that is enthralling and draws a response out of people . Every good trivia quiz uses the Interact option that allows you to show quiz takers the correct answer right after they choose an option . <h> Step 3 : Give a reason to share <p> Quizzes that catch a social wave get 10x the traffic of quizzes that just get posted on a website and do n't  go anywhere else . Social shares originating from quiz results can really take a quiz to new levels of traffic , so its important to incentivize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful campaigns run where a prize is offered to a random commenter or a random person who shares their quiz results . The most successful campaigns have believable prizes ( like a basket of chocolate ) , and the results are worth sharing even without the prize . <p> Capture peoples pride . Sometimes you just want to show off how much you know to the world . By inserting positive comments about how much people know into quiz results you can successfully garner social shares . <p> Be kind . No one wants to share a quiz result that says they suck . Rather , be nice with your quiz results and really focus on the positives , even if someone does n't  do to well , turn it into a funny thing and not a negative .

@@22713538 @2713538/ <h> Step-by-step guide to building a personality quiz <p> Its recently come to my attention that we do n't  have a thorough run-through of what it takes to create a personality quiz ( hint , its easier than you think ) Thus I thought I 'd put together an overview of the steps involved in putting together using THE original personality quiz , the Myers-Briggs quiz . <h> Design <p> Right , so the first thing you do when editing a quiz is to customize the design . Interact is built for businesses , so being able to match your companies branding is absolutely crucial . Let 's go over what you need to do here . <p> 1 . Upload a cover photo . That nice picture you see of the pensive young lady is from one of the free sites we 've compiled in our list of places to find stock photos. - Youll need to add your own picture for your quiz , and if you really want to have good success , I recommend getting the creative department involved , you 'll be thankful if ( when ) your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With any of our paid plans , your quiz has your branding , not ours . You can upload a logo from your computer or add one from your website using a URL . <p> 3 . Edit the background color . I recommend leaving it as white , but sometimes it looks really cool to change it . You can add a hex code that your creative department provides , or just pick a color that looks good . <p> 4 . Font color . I 'd say just leave it black on the white background , but if you do choose to go for a dark theme you definitely want to change the font color to white . <p> 5 . Font Type . Our design team has compiled a great list of fonts that are available for you to use on your quizzes . Pick one that most closely matches your brand ideally . <p> 6 . Button color . Some people prefer orange for their call to action buttons , others prefer blue , whatever your choice , you can use it on your Interact quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors you want you can have . <p> 7 . Button text . Whether you are using interact to make quizzes or assessments or test you can customize the button text to match your use case . <h> Results <p> The next step in making a personality quiz is to create the results , or the personalities that people will see at the end of a quiz when they 've finished answering all the questions . So in my example quiz I have all the various combinations of personalities ( like ENFJ ) and I set those up first so I can then later correlate my questions to them . <p> Let 's break down the pieces here . <p> 1 . Result title . This is more important than you think . The default share style for Interact quizzes is " I got ( my result ) ( title of the quiz ) " so the result titles will end up all over the place when your quiz makes it big . I recommend keeping the title short ( 5 words or less ) if possible so it shows up well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Description . Each result has its own description that can be used to describe the personality type . You want to stay positive here , do n't  go telling people how bad they are in your quiz result descriptions , no one wants to share a negative description . <p> 3 . Result image . This also gets shared when people share their quiz results on Facebook ( 50% of quiz traffic comes from Facebook shares ) . <p> 4 . Links . You can add a link in each quiz description to go to a page on your site . I highly recommend you do this . So for example in my Myers-Briggs quiz I can send people to a page on my site that describes in further detail the personality type that my short quiz told them they were . <h> Questions <p> Ah , the fun part of quizzes ! Think about it , when else as a marketer do you get to ask people questions that they actually want to answer ? ( Surveys that you you have to pay people to answer do n't  count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them unique over all other forms of content , and in my opinion what causes them to get so much traffic . Great quizzes feel like a natural conversation because of well-written questions , and this is your opportunity to converse with potential customers without ever having to pick up the phone or write an email . <p> If you notice in my little screenshot here that each answer is correlated with a specific result . The way the scoring on personality quizzes works is that each answer gives a " point " to one result , and at the end of the quiz whichever result gets the most " points " is the one that is shown to the person taking the quiz . <p> You also have a choice of options when writing your quiz questions . You can do image questions and text answers , a text question with image answers , and any combination of the above . I definitely recommend that you do some sort of images in your questions , whether that be image questions or image answers , these types of questions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Quizzes can be used for lead capture ( and pretty effectively , I just got done talking to a customer who collected 5,000 email addresses in five hours ) . When you 're setting up your personality quiz , setting up lead collection is just one simple step in the process . By default the email collection is set up to collect email addresses ( again , you do n't  have to do this ) . You can also ask for names , company names , zip codes , and phone numbers in this piece . As an added piece you can insert your privacy policy link so people know what they are getting into when they hand over information . <p> If you do choose to insert a lead capture form into your quiz , it will show up between the last question of the quiz and the results . That way people will be incentivized to opt-in ( although there will be a choice to skip ) . <p> There are also two text input fields on this page for " email heading " and " email subheading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they should opt-in to your list . So for example in my quiz I say " Get updates about your personality " and " including personalized advice on career and relationships " <h> Embed &amp; Share <p> We try our best to make it easy to share and embed your quiz in a way that keeps your brand integrity . What I mean by that is your quiz can be embedded into any page on your website or blog without any sort of indication that it comes from Interact , and it can also be shared on Facebook and Twitter ( or any other network ) in a similar way where all the traffic goes back to your website . <p> here 's the actual quiz we 've been talking about that emulates the famous Myers-Briggs type personality quiz that is really the basis for all other personality quizzes .

We recommend starting with this , so for example , you could upload your blog newsletter list and then create a lookalike audience based off of that , we 'll go over creating that lookalike audience in a minute . <p> Now I 'm going to upload a file with my contact list in it . There are other options for creating audiences , but by uploading a list of your existing contacts and using that as the basis for your overall audience , you 'll ensure that you are reaching people who are similar to the ones who already engage with your brand . <p> Now I 'm going to select " Add customers from your own file or copy and paste data " but you could also import directly from Mailchimp if you host your list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mailchimp I 'll show the upload method. - <p> Once I select to upload my own file , Facebook has a super sweet walk-through we can follow to upload the file and get everything set up . The first step is to upload my file of contacts . So we 'll click the " upload file " button to grab that . <p> I already prepared my file of contacts and stripped out all the data except the email addresses , but you can use the identifiers listed in the previous screenshot as well . Once I click the " Upload File " button I 'll be able to select my list of contacts from where it 's stored on my computer <p> Once I upload the file , the second step is to map the data in the file to data points within Facebook . Facebook will automatically identify the fields , and since I just have emails in my file this step is quick . <p> Now Facebook will check my contacts to make sure they are all good . Once that 's complete I 'll be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contact list I just uploaded . Basically that means that Facebook will go out and find people who are similar to the ones already on my list so I can advertise to them . I 'm going to click the " Create a Lookalike Audience " button to get started with that . <p> Now you 'll have options for setting up your lookalike audience , usually I just go with the " 1 " on audience size , which will still bring in a lot of people to the audience , and I try to limit the audience based on country so you 're only reaching the languages you support <p> Once you confirm the audience Facebook will automatically start creating it . You 'll need to wait about 15 minutes for them to complete the creation of the audience . Once it 's done you 'll see it says " Ready " and has a green dot next to it . Now you can click " Create Ad " and start actually creating the ad for your quiz <h> Part 2 : Set up your Facebook conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have become a lead <p> Now that our audience is created , let 's take a second to create the conversion event for when someone completes a quiz ( which means they became a lead because in an Interact quiz the results are shown after the lead capture form ) . <p> In order to do this , you 'll need your quiz set up and integrated with Facebook pixel , I 'll start from the beginning and show all the steps needed to set that up , so we 're all on the same page . If you 've already set up your quiz , you can skip down to where I show the Facebook pixel integration <p> With Interact , you can create quizzes from scratch , or select a template . I 'm going to select a template in the marketing category. - <p> Now , to make sure that only people who have opted-in reach your quiz results , so you can track conversions accurately within your Facebook ads , you 'll need to set up lead generation for your quiz . To do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my quiz " once your selected quiz template or custom quiz loads in. - <p> Once you turn on lead collection , you 'll be able to select what fields you want to require from people in order to see their quiz results . You 'll also want to uncheck the box that allows users to skip the opt-in form , so that you know for sure people who have reached the results have actually logged in. - <p> Once you 've selected that you 'll connect to your email marketing program . We have integrations with everyone , so select your program and sign in , then you 'll see a list of your lists so you can connect the quiz to whatever list you want . ( you 'll want to take a pause here and go create a list just for the quiz if you want to keep your leads separate ) <p> Now select the list you want to connect to <p> Now you 'll map the data you 're collecting in your quiz to your list and the fields in it <p> Now save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd like . And test the integration to make sure it 's properly connected to your email list <p> Now your quiz is set up to collect leads . The next step is to connect your Facebook pixel to your quiz so you can create events for the quiz outcomes so you can track conversions and retarget based on quiz outcomes. - <p> Go back to your Facebook ads manager and copy the Pixel I 'd from the top right of the page . <p> Now go back to Interact and paste the Pixel I 'd into the Facebook pixel integration under " Conversion Tracking " in the builder ( screenshot walk-through below ) <p> Now your quiz is connected to to Facebook ads and there will be events created for each of your quiz outcomes and you can create custom conversions based on those events .

Then , once you are done with your quiz there 's the issue of how to post it and embed it on your site . <p> All of this makes for an involved process that can easily become overwhelming . <p> That 's why here at Interact we put a huge focus on simplifying the quiz creation process to remove all unnecessary steps and organize the steps that do need to be taken in order to set up a new quiz . <p> As a customer success manager here at Interact , I often work with clients to create their quizzes . Today I 'm going to walk you through how I do it from start to finish , highlighting the unique time-saving pieces that are especially useful . <p> For the purposes of this walk-through , I 'll start from the beginning , as a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new quiz " button to begin setting up my first quiz ( we even have a nice little animation while you are in this area ) . What you 're looking at right here is your Interact dashboard , which is the command center from which you operate your Interact account . <p> Next , I 'll be prompted to select either an assessment or personality quiz to make . An assessment is a quiz that has a correct answer for each question you ask ( I.E. What month is it ? ) . A personality quiz is one where there are various personality types as the outcomes of the quiz and each question correlates to different personality types . Whichever personality type ends up with the most correlations at the end of the quiz is the one that 's shown to the quiz taker . <p> For this walk-through Ill select personality type because that 's the most common type built on our platform . <p> Once I select " Personality " as my quiz type , I 'll be asked if I want to " choose a template " or " create from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a variety of templates available and I can use one that 's basically already set up for what I want to do . <p> I 'll get a list of templates I can use for my own business . In the top right of this page I have options to sort the templates by Industry . I 'm going to look at the Non-Profit quizzes and choose the " Which Animal are You ? " template because we have the privilege of working with lots of animal-based non-profits so I 'm well-versed in this arena . <p> After I select the template , the Interact quiz builder will load in all the data for that template . Since its my first time here , there is an overlayed walk-through that greets me . I 'd highly recommend following along with this your first time , as it " lays the land " in terms of what to do and when . <p> *Im now going to switch over to an upgraded account within Interact so I can show you all the proper features . You can use Interact for free , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I 'm making my quiz is upload my own logo . I want to have my quiz look like my brand because that will prevent a breach of trust , especially since I 'm going to be using this quiz for lead generation . In order to get started with that , I 'm going to switch to the " styles " tab on the left grey sidebar. ( picture below ) <p> Ill click the " Logo Image " button to upload my own logo . There is a recommended size for uploading a logo . This is a them you 'll see all throughout Interact , every time you upload an image there will be a recommended size . <p> Now that my logo is added , I can see that its on my quiz . You can modify all other elements on the design , including the cover photo ( the cute dog in this example ) , as well as the colors of everything and the font type . <p> Now I 'll switch the tab back to " Content " and begin modifying the quiz results . The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you 'll end up correlating the questions to the outcomes , so you need the outcomes to be there in order for that to work <p> The first thing I 'm going to do with this quiz outcome is modify the hero image ( the picture of the running dog ) . This part is awesome because of how simple it is with Interact . No need to use any sort of image editor , we take care of everything for you . I can click on the dog photo to edit it and search for " dog " to see other photos of dogs that will work . <p> Once I choose a photo , I will get a preview of how it will display in the quiz results and I can modify the zoom and part of the photo that I want to show as the quiz result . <p> Now I click " Crop &amp; Save " and the image is added to my result ! Its that easy to add images to your quiz , and that 's a good thing since it takes an average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a side note , you can also upload images and use the cropping tool built into Interact to cut them down to size as well . You can add image attribution and such for each image as well . <p> Now I want to edit the description for this result and add a link to donate to my non-profit . If I click on the text below the image , it will open up a WYSIWYG editor that will let me add more images , links , lists , videos , and bold/italicize text . <p> Once I add a link , it will appear and I can see how it looks . We always recommend adding links to quiz results because are very curious by the time they see a quiz result , so its the perfect opportunity to continue the conversation . <p> *Before we leave the quiz outcomes , its worth mentioning that you can have as many outcomes as you want , but we recommend having 4-6 results . <p> Now well move on to the quiz questions . I wont spend too much here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over how to search for and add images . There are a variety of formats for building quiz questions , but we recommend the one picture below , with text for each question and an image for each answer choice . <p> One thing I did want to call out is the correlations between the questions and the outcomes we already set up . There is a button in the top right corner if each question editor that says " result correlations " and you can click that to determine how answer choices affect the outcomes of the quiz . <p> Now well move on to setting up the lead capture form that you can turn on between the last quiz question and the outcome of the quiz . I can modify the call to action text on the form , and I 'll want to make it related to the quiz itself to maximize conversions . <p> I can also add more fields and make the lead capture form required if I 'd like . I can also add a link to my own privacy policy to make sure Im conforming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my email capture form , I want to connect it to my email marketing or marketing automation program so the new leads go into a list of my choosing . Interact will automatically send quiz information along with new contacts that are added , so you 'll get a rich profile for each person who opts in to your quiz . Interact integrates with all major email marketing and marketing automation programs , so select yours <p> Once you select your program and sign in , your lists that you already have set up in your email marketing or marketing automation program will be displayed , and you can select the one you want . The example below shows my test Aweber account with all the lists displayed . <p> Once you select the list you want , you 're all set ! that 's how easy it is to connect Interact lead generation quizzes to your email marketing or marketing automation program . <p> Now Ive got everything set up on my quiz , I 'll click " publish " and embed this quiz into a blog post and share it out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to grab the iframe embed code ( same as a YouTube video ) , and paste it into my new post . <p> The quiz will appear in my blog post just as I created it , and it will look like part of the page . <p> If I 'd prefer to share the quiz directly to Facebook , I can select that option from the " publish " menu and click the Facebook icon to post the quiz straight there . <p> The quiz will show up in a super nice format straight to a Facebook timeline . <p> Making quizzes would be complicated if all those steps werent organized in a nice neat way , fortunately they are , so head to interact to make a quiz now .

@@22713552 @2713552/ <h> Simplified Way to Build an Effective Giveaway <p> Giveaways work well for quickly driving hundreds or thousands of new contacts into your funnel at a relatively low cost . These leads are n't  going to be as qualified as quiz leads , but you 'll still get lots of people in the door , and with the way we set up giveaways at Interact , you can also add social components to boost your social presence on the big networks . <p> Here are the keys to an effective giveaway. <h> 1 . Have a strong and relevant prize <p> The giveaway needs to not only be valuable , but also make sense for the company that 's running it . Itd be ridiculous to run a giveaway as a car company and give away a Jiffy Lube gift card , but if you 're Jiffy Lube then it does make sense . If you absolutely cant find anything that 's relevant to your particular company , you can resort to Starbucks giftcards or itunes or something generic like that ( but still widely desired ) . <p> The exact value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brands who want to drive millions of new contacts as part of an annual push , and the grand prize was $50,000 , but weve also done giveaways for a single sweatshirt that helped a growing brand drive a hundred or so new contacts . Pick a value that 's a bit higher than youd initially think about doing ( a good rule of thumb is to think of the value as the " Cadillac " to the average " Ford " value ) . <h> 2 . Make subscribing optional <p> When you set up a giveaway , you can add an optional check-box to subscribe to your regular newsletter . This should not be required , but should have a strong incentive to subscribe . For example , you could promise relevant industry news or to send a discount for anyone who does check the box . <h> 3 . Build in social promotion <p> One of the greatest aspects of creating a giveaway is the ability to also use it as a tool for boosting yourself up on social media . With Interact you can let people gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinning " or sharing on Instagram . You can then run future promotions to get those people onto your email list and and purchasing your products <h> 4 . Be very careful with your terms <p> You can use a template like RocketLawyer- to create the terms for your giveaway . These are very important , and you can easily find yourself in a world of trouble if you 're not careful .

@@22713555 @2713555/ <p> In this article , were fortunate to be joined by Maroposts CMO Bob Frady . Our subject today is the idea of E-Commerce marketing automation . Here at Interact , we are fortunate to work with some of the worlds most forward-thinking retailers , who are making massive moves in the E-Commerce space . Together were able to generate 100 's of thousands of new leads every month , and turn internet strangers into real contacts . <p> Were also fortunate to be integrated with Maropost Marketing Cloud , so those leads can be added to a central command system for personalized follow-up based on the information provided during the quiz . <p> In this session , we go back and forth with Bob , tackling some of the biggest questions our customers have in regards to using automation to effectively convert leads after they are acquired . Let 's jump right in . <p> Q. What gets customers to open emails in the first place ? <p> A. ( And I 'm paraphrasing for Bob here ) . There is really one thing that stands out from the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is triggered emails . For example , a welcome email after someone takes a quiz and inputs their information that references the quiz is going to get great open rates . <p> The way I see it , emails almost always do one of two things . <p> 1 . Start a conversation <p> 2 . Continue a conversation <p> Emails that continue a conversation are much more effective than emails that try to start a conversation . When you can use a tool like a quiz or any other form of triggered email that allows you to continue a thought already started , you 'll get better results . <p> Q. Let 's talk quiz follow-up . If someone opts-in through my quiz , how should I begin emailing them and how much should I email them . <p> A. The first thing to do is have an immediately triggered " Thank You " email reaffirming that you received their information and introducing yourself . This allows you to continue the conversation that was started in the quiz and create a continuous experience . <p> Then I would send several emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz content . The goal with these emails , and the reason for sending so many , is that you want to let people know who you are and what you 're about . If they unsubscribe during these first few days , that 's a good thing , theyll decide your company is not a good fit and step away , which is not a bad thing at all . <p> If the customer is still subscribed after 4-5 emails , then you can add them back into your regular newsletter sequence . <p> Q. As a follow-on , what is the right frequency with which to email your regular subscribers ? <p> A. There is no right answer here , but I will say that a good rule of thumb is to email whenever your content changes . If you publish content every day , email every day , if you publish content once a week , email once a week . The frequency of mailing also depends a lot on your ability to execute quality email messages , you never want to sacrifice quality in order to send more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get emailed , which means testing frequencies in order to see what results in more sales . People are often too afraid to test , and that means leaving money on the table . <p> At Maropost , we have customers emailing anywhere from once a week all the way up to 28 times a week , and those numbers were arrived at by testing effectiveness . <p> Q. If I have a list and want to get better at emailing segments based on their interests , what 's the best way to get started with that ? <p> A. There are two ways to begin with this . <p> #1 : Capturing basic data ( domain of customer , browser , etc . ) . Things as simple as whether they 're using Yahoo vs . AOL can be telling in terms of who the audience is and how they use the internet . <p> #2 : Bringing in customer data . This is more nebulous and difficult . A good example of how this is done would be to run a query and identify everyone who has purchased skis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports " segment . Sending out the latest golf club or fishing pole in an email to a segment of people who purchased skis in the past gives you a better shot of being relevant than just blasting out to everyone . <p> Q. Last Question , where do you see email going in the future ? <p> A. I see email being used as a branding tool . It will continue to increase in importance as an identifier . Every email you send out is a brand impression , and the content of those emails will become incredibly important as the consumer will demand more targeted and better quality content .

We recommend starting with this , so for example , you could upload your blog newsletter list and then create a lookalike audience based off of that , we 'll go over creating that lookalike audience in a minute . <p> Now I 'm going to upload a file with my contact list in it . There are other options for creating audiences , but by uploading a list of your existing contacts and using that as the basis for your overall audience , you 'll ensure that you are reaching people who are similar to the ones who already engage with your brand . <p> Now I 'm going to select " Add customers from your own file or copy and paste data " but you could also import directly from Mailchimp if you host your list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mailchimp I 'll show the upload method. - <p> Once I select to upload my own file , Facebook has a super sweet walk-through we can follow to upload the file and get everything set up . The first step is to upload my file of contacts . So we 'll click the " upload file " button to grab that . <p> I already prepared my file of contacts and stripped out all the data except the email addresses , but you can use the identifiers listed in the previous screenshot as well . Once I click the " Upload File " button I 'll be able to select my list of contacts from where it 's stored on my computer <p> Once I upload the file , the second step is to map the data in the file to data points within Facebook . Facebook will automatically identify the fields , and since I just have emails in my file this step is quick . <p> Now Facebook will check my contacts to make sure they are all good . Once that 's complete I 'll be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contact list I just uploaded . Basically that means that Facebook will go out and find people who are similar to the ones already on my list so I can advertise to them . I 'm going to click the " Create a Lookalike Audience " button to get started with that . <p> Now you 'll have options for setting up your lookalike audience , usually I just go with the " 1 " on audience size , which will still bring in a lot of people to the audience , and I try to limit the audience based on country so you 're only reaching the languages you support <p> Once you confirm the audience Facebook will automatically start creating it . You 'll need to wait about 15 minutes for them to complete the creation of the audience . Once it 's done you 'll see it says " Ready " and has a green dot next to it . Now you can click " Create Ad " and start actually creating the ad for your quiz <h> Part 2 : Set up your Facebook conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have become a lead <p> Now that our audience is created , let 's take a second to create the conversion event for when someone completes a quiz ( which means they became a lead because in an Interact quiz the results are shown after the lead capture form ) . <p> In order to do this , you 'll need your quiz set up and integrated with Facebook pixel , I 'll start from the beginning and show all the steps needed to set that up , so we 're all on the same page . If you 've already set up your quiz , you can skip down to where I show the Facebook pixel integration <p> With Interact , you can create quizzes from scratch , or select a template . I 'm going to select a template in the marketing category. - <p> Now , to make sure that only people who have opted-in reach your quiz results , so you can track conversions accurately within your Facebook ads , you 'll need to set up lead generation for your quiz . To do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my quiz " once your selected quiz template or custom quiz loads in. - <p> Once you turn on lead collection , you 'll be able to select what fields you want to require from people in order to see their quiz results . You 'll also want to uncheck the box that allows users to skip the opt-in form , so that you know for sure people who have reached the results have actually logged in. - <p> Once you 've selected that you 'll connect to your email marketing program . We have integrations with everyone , so select your program and sign in , then you 'll see a list of your lists so you can connect the quiz to whatever list you want . ( you 'll want to take a pause here and go create a list just for the quiz if you want to keep your leads separate ) <p> Now select the list you want to connect to <p> Now you 'll map the data you 're collecting in your quiz to your list and the fields in it <p> Now save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd like . And test the integration to make sure it 's properly connected to your email list <p> Now your quiz is set up to collect leads . The next step is to connect your Facebook pixel to your quiz so you can create events for the quiz outcomes so you can track conversions and retarget based on quiz outcomes. - <p> Go back to your Facebook ads manager and copy the Pixel I 'd from the top right of the page . <p> Now go back to Interact and paste the Pixel I 'd into the Facebook pixel integration under " Conversion Tracking " in the builder ( screenshot walk-through below ) <p> Now your quiz is connected to to Facebook ads and there will be events created for each of your quiz outcomes and you can create custom conversions based on those events . Unfortunately it takes 1 hour for those events to be created in Facebook , so at this point you have to wait 1 hour . <p> Once the hour is up , you can move back to Facebook and set up conversions based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this , you 'll navigate back to the " Pixels " section of your Facebook ads dashboard. - <p> Now click on " Create Conversion " <p> Then click on " Track Custom Conversions " <p> Now , in the " Rule " section , select " Event " <p> In the " Event " dropdown , select " Quiz " ( NOTE : If you have n't waited an hour , sometimes an hour and a half , this event will not exist yet , it takes Facebook an hour to set up your Event -&gt; Quiz , and that ca n't be rushed , so if you do n't see it , that 's because it has n't been created yet , and you have to wait an hour from when you first set it up in Interact <p> Now in the box where it says " Choose a Parameter ( optional ) " you 'll want to do two things . 1 . Create a label for the title of your quiz , and 2 . Create an action that contains all of your quiz result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title of the quiz result <p> Now , go to Interact quiz builder , and click on " Cover " then copy the title of the quiz and paste it into the box - in your Facebook ad manager next to where it says " Label " " Contains " <p> Now , click " and " next to where you just set up the " label " and select " action " from the drop-down menu , so you should have what looks like this <p> In the box next to " action " " contains " paste in all the result titles from your quiz , so you should do the following <p> Now , under " Category " select the appropriate category for what this conversion event is , for most cases this will be " Lead " because if someone reaches the results of a quiz that has lead capture turned on , they are a lead <p> Now , name your Conversion Event and save it <p> Now you 'll need to go activate the pixel , which means you need it to fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the results . In Interact , click " Share and Embed " for the quiz you just set up the Facebook pixel integration for , then copy the " Direct URL " and paste it into a new browser window <h> Part 3 : Construct your Facebook ad <p> Now we 're ready to go set up an ad for our quiz ! In your Facebook ads manager , click " Create Ad " <p> Now , under " What 's Your Marketing Objective " select " Conversions " because we want to get as many conversions as possible and since we set up the pixel to track conversions on our quiz we can track that <p> Give your campaign a name , I just put " Digital Marketing Quiz " for simplicity <p> Now we 'll start putting together the targeting for our ad .

For now this is all the targeting I 'm going to do with my audience because I 've already set everything up , so that 's all I want to do <p> Under placements , I 'm going to leave it as " Automatic Placements " but if you want to specify placement on different devices etc. you can do that as well <p> The final step on the first part of setting up this ad is to set up budget and delivery . I 'm going to set this up for $20/day and running all the time , but you can change those if you want <p> Now click " Continue " and we 'll get to setting up the actual ad . The first two things you 'll do on this screen is name your ad and select the ad type . Again I just named it " Digital Marketing Quiz " and set the ad type as " Single Image " because the most effective ads are simply recreations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up the actual ad . There are three elements to cover. - <p> The URL of the ad , which I 'm going to use the direct URL of the quiz for , you can also paste in the URL where you have the quiz embedded if you are embedding it onto your website or a landing page <p> The ad Headline , which should match the title of the quiz <p> The ad text , which should be a short teaser to entice people to click the ad <p> Now make sure the Facebook pixel is green dotted at the bottom of the page , and place your order for the ad to start running <p> Once you place your order , wait 15 minutes for Facebook to approve your ad and it will start running. -

@@22713560 @2713560/ <h> Best Practices for Creating Quizzes to Sell Products <p> Quizzes are an incredibly powerful tool for retail brands . They can be used to both bring in new leads and sell products in a personalized way . Here are the tips we 've compiled from helping over customers bring in over 1.5 million leads and sell millions in products . <h> Part 1 : Creating Your Quiz <h> 1 . Quiz Subject <p> There are two ways to make retail quizzes . <p> 1 . Recommend a certain product . If you are a small brand or you want to recommend a specific product within a category , make a quiz that points to a specific product . For example " Which Facemask Should You Get ? " <p> 2 . Give People a " Style " which narrows down your products . Give people a style based on your categories of products . For example , if you are a clothing brand , the styles could be " chic " " modern " or " classic " <h> 2 . Quiz Title <p> This is easy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Which ( product ) are you ? " <p> if you are assigning a style , the title is " Which ( blank ) style are you ? " <h> 3 . Quiz Questions <p> Have a conversation with your quiz takers in the questions . Build a connection , create trust . Here are three specific ways to do that . <p> 1 . Inject your personality . Speak like yourself and people will connect with you more naturally . <p> 2 . Speak like a human . Do n't  make your quizzes like the ones you had to take in school . Speak naturally by using personal pronouns ( I , You , We , Me , etc. ) <h> 4 . Quiz Lead Capture <p> I recommend you capture leads using quizzes , if you do , here are the best tips . <p> 1 . Explain why you 'll add value . Modern marketing is all about adding value . Give a reason for people to opt-in ( other than just being able to see the quiz results ) . This could be exclusive discounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be honest about your marketing . If you send one email each week , say so , if you send one a month , tell people . Remember that a lot of people will find your quiz through social media , so re-enforce your brand by starting off with honesty . <p> 3 . Let people skip . You can require an opt-in , but I recommend you let people skip , this will eliminate anyone who is n't interested . <h> 5 . Quiz Results and product recommendation <p> There are two ways to format your quiz results . The first is to have a call-to-action button in the results for one product ( which you 'd do if you only recommended one product ) , or you put a call-to-action button to check out the style category ( which you do with a style personality quiz ) . Here are the best ways to do the results and the product recommendation pages . <p> Results <p> The results should be pretty simple , include a great image , and include share buttons . <p> Products <p> The product recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told people they were . It should also include call-to-action buttons to purchase said products . <h> 6 . Marketing Automation Follow-Up <p> After you capture contact information from someone in a quiz , you have to make the transition to sending email marketing messages . This is a tough move , but here 's how to navigate it . <p> 1 . Immediate Thank You <p> Here are Interact we integrate with every major marketing automation system , and you can use those systems to send an immediate follow-up email after someone takes your quiz . The subject should be " Your Style Personality is ( blank ) " or " Your Product Recommendation Is ( blank ) " This email connects the dots between the quiz and your email messages . <p> 2 . Send out what the other styles are ( optional ) <p> One strategy Ive seen work really well is to send a second email a few days after someone takes your quiz that explains what the other personalities or products are . This is like a bridge email between the quiz thank-you email and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recommended Products <p> Send products for someones personality or send products related to the original one you recommend . <p> 4 . Offer a discount or special promotion <p> After sending a few messages , give people an exclusive discount or offer , this is where you close people who were on the fence from the start . <h> Part 2 : Sharing and Embedding Your Quiz <h> 1 . Sharing <h> Facebook <p> 1 . Select a great image to share . <p> 2 . Write a caption that has to do with the quiz or one of the personality types . <p> 3 . Share the image and caption with a link to take the quiz . <p> Bonus : Respond to people who comment sharing their style <h> Twitter <p> Follow the same pattern . <p> 1 . Grab a great image <p> 2 . Write a caption ( can just be the title if you are n't  feeling creative ) <p> 3 . Share with a link to take the quiz <p> Bonus : Respond to people who tweet @ you with their results <h> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an iframe so that all traffic and social shares come back to you . <h> That 's it , making product quizzes is simple .

If you answered nothing ( other than that it looks great ) you 'd be right . If I did n't  tell you , youd never know that the quiz is an embed from Interact into the LBC website , there 's no clear indication or off-putting visual break . <p> This is great for LBC because they do n't  risk losing any of their hard-earned visitors who my click away through the quiz or want to check out more quizzes ( kind of like when you embed a YouTube video and you lose people ) . <p> None of that happens with Interact , you get the full benefit of a fun Buzzfeed-style quiz without the drawbacks of losing customers . You can even customize the quiz share links so they point back to the page on your site where the quiz is embedded . <p> In this guide I 'll go over the components of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll need to do to get it onto your site and make sure you keep all the traffic from your quiz . <h> Part 1 : Setting up the quiz <p> A. Quiz ideas <p> Before you start writing a quiz , you have to decide what its going to be about . Sometimes this is so difficult that people give up and never even get a chance to see if a quiz can benefit them do n't  be that person . We looked to see what kinds of quiz topics have been most successful for current Interact users , here 's what works . <p> Accentuate an article : If you have a high performing article on your site , add a quiz to it . For example , if you did a solid in-depth piece about writing quizzes , make a quiz testing peoples quiz writing skills . The nice thing about quizzes is that they are a truly different form of content , so you can do a quiz on the same subject as an article without overlap <p> Personalize your website . If you have several great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help people find out which one they should read next . We have a great client that posts a lot of recipes on their website and uses quizzes to help people discover the recipe they should make next . <p> Recommend products . If you sell products online , use a quiz to recommend one . <p> Raise awareness . Some of our top performing quizzes have been ones where little known but highly controversial issues were quizzed on . For example , a quiz titled " How much do you know about Iran ? " got 14,000 views in a little over an hour . <p> B. Quiz titles <p> Did you know that a full 80% of your potential quiz taking audience will judge you based on the title of your quiz ? That 's pretty shallow if you ask me , but also just the way the world works . Thus , youd better spend some time crafting the perfect quiz title or risk having your quiz flop . We have some templates that can help , based off of the top 100 Interact quizzes ever made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " title : This is probably the one you are used to seeing on Facebook every day . Titles like " Which celebrity are you ? " have racked up millions of views and continue to be produced with success . <p> The " How much do you know ? " title : For example " How much do you know about the World Cup ? " this is a simple knowledge test , but presenting the quiz as a challenge makes it so much more fun . <p> The " What kind of ? " title : " What kind of Patriots fan are you ? " this quiz title uses the power of personality quizzes to identify where you stand on the spectrum of fandom , or other issues . <p> These are the heart and soul of your quiz and what truly sets it apart from virtually every other form of content . Here you get to have a conversation with each person who visits your site and takes the quiz in a one-on-one manner unlike anything else . <p> The goal with quiz questions is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who takes the quiz so theyll be more likely to share and get connected with your brand . here are some tips from expert quiz builders . <p> Speak naturally . In our regular everyday conversations we have a certain way of speaking . It involves a lot of talking about ourselves and the people we are close to , which means words like " I , you , we , us etc. " come into play a lot . Try to use that same sort of natural tone you 'd use with a friend in your quiz questions . Remember that your quiz is a conversation with one person , not an article written for a lot of people . <p> Keep it light . The most common association with the word " quiz " is in schooling , and no one wants to take a class on your website ( unless that happens to be what you do , in which case do write like a class ) . If not , then keep your quiz questions fun and short . <p> D. Quiz lead generation <p> Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I do n't  recommend that everyone use it for that . Sometimes its a good idea , and sometimes its not . A good way of knowing is to ask yourself " Is this quiz topic related to a bigger issue for which much more explanation is needed ? " if yes , than go ahead and collect emails , but follow these rules . <p> Make sure people know why they are giving an email address . Do n't  just tell them to put in an email to see their quiz results ( although that is still compelling ) . Make sure to explain why they would want to opt-in . For example , " well give you this exclusive discount just for subscribers " would work . <p> Only collect leads that have to do with the quiz . Your call to action should be anchored around the content of the quiz in which it lies . If you writ a quiz about ground breaking technology in the cooking industry , tell people to subscribe to learn more about that technology . <p> E. Quiz Results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially given you their contact information , and they are anxiously awaiting their quiz results do n't  let them down . Seriously , quiz results are a tricky business because someone just told your quiz a lot of personal information when they answered your questions , so they are very sensitive to what kind of results they get . Heres what you should do . <p> Be kind . If your result has negative aspects to it , do n't  highlight them , focus on the positive . Never lie and tell people they are great with no grounds , theyll see right through it and lose trust , but stay focused on the good . <p> Include a link . No matter how much explanation you give in your quiz results , people will always want more . After all , this is a very personal issue here . Make sure to include a link to learn more , buy a personalized product , or check out other related content . <h> Part 2 : Putting it on your site <p> To embed your quiz once its finished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embed " link . Youll be presented with a page that allows you to select the size of quiz you 'd like and then provides you with a simple line of code that goes into your site to make the quiz appear . <p> Things to think about for the embed : <p> 1 . Make sure your content fits <p> We allow for any size of embed so that all of your questions and results will fit . If your quiz is too small , people will have to scroll to reach all the answer choices or to read through their result , which is no good . <p> 2 . Make sure your site accepts javascript <p> We use a javascript embed because it makes the embed code just one line instead of a whole paragraph ( if you have no idea what javascript is , ask your developer or email us ) . Some sites have an option to allow javascript embeds , if you are using a platform like Joomla or Drupal or WordPress , check with them to make sure you have javascript embeds turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your site has a white background , the quiz should have a white background unless you want to use the color as a way to make the quiz stand out . As you can see in my example below , contrasting colors make the quiz pop , but that 's not always a good thing . <h> Part 3 : Keeping the traffic from social media <p> Pay attention ! This is where Interact becomes genius . If you 've done your research with quiz builders , you 've noticed that nearly all of them are running ads on their websites . Because they make money off of ads , that means they need visitors to go back to the quiz makers website , essentially stealing traffic from you . <p> That 's where Interact is different , when you set up a quiz , you put it on your website and when people share the quiz , they share a link back to YOUR site , not ours . That way you keep all the traffic from your quiz . So not only does the quiz fit right into your site and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also drives even more traffic back to your site through social media .

@@22713566 @2713566/ <h> How to make a character quiz <p> I realized today that a huge portion of the popular quizzes built using Interact are character quizzes " Which Studio C Character Are You ? " " Which Red Lobster Endless Shrimp Flavor Are You ? " these are the types of titles that continually pop up on Twitter and Facebook . So in honor of that , I wanted to create a guide that not only shows how to go about making a character type quiz but also shows how to use that quiz to generate some ROI and drive traffic back to your domain . <h> Step 1 : Write the character types <p> So to make a character quiz you need characters for people to get as their results . In the interact quiz builder , the character types come first , and this is how you should write the quiz that way you can correlate the questions to the various characters as you go . In general I have a few tips for how to write great quiz results that come from our existing users who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uplifting . Think of quiz results as your audition to get shared . If the person taking your quiz enjoys what their result , they are much more likely to share it on social sites , and since social accounts for 75% of quiz traffic , you need people to share . <p> 2 . Think about sharing ahead of time . There is a specific formula for how quizzes get shared , and knowing about it ahead of time will ensure you maximize the social reach of your quiz . The formula goes like this " I got ( my result ) ( title of the quiz ) " So for my result below where I got Goofy it would be " I got Goofy Which Disney Character are You ? " this snippet along with the result picture of Goofy will appear in my Facebook news feed when I share my quiz result . <p> 3 . Provide a follow-up . If you look below at the Goofy result , you 'll see that there 's a link to check out more stuff about Goofy and buy Goofy merchandise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in your quizzes as people are typically very curious to read about their result after finishing a quiz . <h> Step 2 : Create compelling questions <p> Quiz questions are my absolute favorite part of any quiz . I mean , where else do you get to ask your website visitors personal questions and have them actually answer without being weirded out ? haha . In all seriousness , its pretty cool that quizzes allow you to have one-on-one conversations with your web visitors in a way that 's far more personal than them reading some article you wrote . There are a few things to keep in mind if you want to take full advantage of this opportunity , here 's what those things are . <p> 1 . Use lots of images . All 100 of the top 100 quizzes built using Interact have at least one picture question . What I mean by picture question is a question like the one below where there is a question and then the answers are images or vice versa . <p> 2 . Take queues from games . A quiz is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactics . One of my favorite games recently is called trivia crack , and they do a great job of creating compelling questions , think of your quiz as a game when writing the questions. - <p> 3 . Do n't  be afraid to get a bit personal . People like to talk about themselves , according to a Time magazine study , 60% of everything we say is about our person . It might seem odd to ask personal questions , but it can actually really boost the stickiness of your quiz and make people enjoy taking it . <p> 4 . Have 6-12 questions . This many questions will take approximately 2 minutes to answer , this is the sweet spot between boring people and making your quiz believable . <p> 5 . Have 3-6 answer choices per question . Again , this is the right amount to make your quiz accurate but not overwhelm people with options . <h> Step 2.5 ( optional ) : Collect new leads <p> 1 . Consider what you need . There are known drop-offs in conversion for every extra piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone number in addition to email address drops opt-ins by 20% ) Keeping that in mind , never ask for more information than you know what to do with . Do n't  request a zip code just in case you might need it , only ask for a zip code if you are going to actually send offers based on location . <p> 2 . Be up-front about what you 'll be sending . Its better to say " we send updates weekly " than to not say anything at all . We live in a post-spam world where everyone from email providers to individuals is hyper-wary of un-requested messages and will not hesitate to blacklist you . <p> 3 . Have a compelling offer that 's related to the quiz content . When you set up your lead generation form inside your quiz , you have the luxury of knowing exactly what state of mind your audience is in when the offer is presented . Take advantage of that by relating your offer to the quiz subject . ( I.E. " opt-in to get exclusive offers on Mickey merchandise " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which result they got and send targeted messages . <h> Step 3 : Follow up and get your moneys worth <p> Quizzes can fundamentally change the way we engage with email subscribers . Because you know which Disney character your email subscriber is ( or whatever your quiz covers ) , you can send content and offers that actually interest your audience without a doubt instead of just guessing and hoping your newsletter stick . <p> here 's a hypothetical list of emails to send to your quiz list . <p> 1 .

@@22713573 @2713573/ <h> 4 Ways to use quizzes in your marketing <p> I like quizzes , customers like quizzes , the internet likes sharing quizzes ( perhaps a bit too much ) . Only problem is , it can be difficult to come up with uses for your quizzes . You create one and that 's awesome , but now what do you do ? Well , to help solve that issue I 've put together a list of four use cases which can be used at your discretion . <p> 1 . Use quizzes to drive traffic On July 5th , food blog Food52.com posted a quiz to twitter . By July 7th , the quiz had been taken 20,000 times , driving loads of people back to the Food52 website and creating hundreds of dollars in ad revenue . <p> Keys to creating a traffic-generating quiz : <p> Make sure every quiz result is positive . I noticed a strong trend with the Food52 quiz , which was that each result ( what kind of cake your are ) said excellent things about the person taking the quiz and made them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz were so dang happy and why there were over 500 of them . <p> Do n't  even think about pushing your product . The Food52 quiz had one call to action , and that call to action was to check out a recipe for the type of cake you are . They did n't  try to sell anything or push their brand . If your quiz is designed to drive traffic , do n't  be overly sales-like , it wont work . <p> Make it fun . You are competing with Soccer Stars for your quiz takers time ( check it out , its an iphone game that 's addicting ) . Keep that in mind and make your quiz fun . <p> 2 . Use quizzes to generate leads- One of our first customers at Interact was Skilledup , an online education site , and since signing up they have collected more than 5000 new email leads using their quiz . What they did wasnt difficult , and the page they put the quiz on did n't  even have to change to account for the embed . Here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to making a lead generation quiz . <p> Build it with lead generation in mind . What I mean is to create a quiz where it makes sense to put in your email address . The skilledup call to action makes sense , their quiz is about testing your excel skills , and the call to action is to get more excel tips in the future . An example of a quiz that would make no sense to have lead generation would be " What 's your animal personality ? " because there 's just no reason for it . <p> Try to remain fun . You are still competing with soccer stars for peoples attention . <p> 3 . Use quizzes to sell personalized products. - A site called Hookah and Shisha ( which happens to be the largest online retailer of Hooka ) , came up with an awesome idea for using quizzes to sell products . They created a quiz " Which Hookah - are you ? " and made each result a different kind of Hookah which quiz takers could then go buy on their website . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personality quiz . Since Hookah and Shisha made their quiz a personality type quiz , they were still able to benefit from social sharing and organic reach that comes along with quizzes that have share-able results . The best way is to just turn your products into different personalities and then include a link to buy your " personality " for each result . <p> Follow Shaqs rule for sales . NBA all-star Shaquille Oneal has a rule for how he does product promotion . For all the content he produces , he makes 80% of it to entertain , 15% to inform and 5% to sell . Your product quiz should be the same way . <p> 4 . Use quizzes to learn about your customers . Wouldnt it be nice to know what your customers values are ? Or what kind of food they prefer ? These might seem like dumb things , but think about the possibilities if you have this information . You can write blog posts with your customers interests in minds , answer their questions , and speak in their vernacular . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what questions you want answered by the quiz takers answers . Start with a list of things youd like to know about your customers . For example , do they care more about politics or sports ? Or how old are they on average ? <p> Still make it fun . If you just want customer data , create a survey and then offer people some kind of ridiculous prize to take the survey ( okay , done ranting about surveys now ) . Analytics can be the main point of your quiz , but do n't  sacrifice the fun factor of your quiz .

@@22713576 @2713576/ <h> How to make the perfect quiz for your health and fitness business <p> One of the most popular categories for quizzes at Interact is the health and fitness one . Personal trainers , medical offices , and even OBGYNs have used quizzes in various ways to increase engagement and get new leads into their systems . Weve learned a lot about what works , so I thought I 'd share some of the top tips here . <p> Let 's kick things off with a story , because stories are awesome . The story is about personal trainer Brad Gouthro , one of our oldest customers at Interact . He s had a quiz on his facebook page " Test Your Fitness IQ " for the last year or so , and its one of the most consistent sources of leads for his growing business . Every month , it drives 20-25 new email subscriber leads who Brad follows up with and eventually converts into paying customers ( at least some of them ) . <p> The best part is that Brad really has n't  had to do anything since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook page , which is n't hard for him because he s got great stuff , check it out ) <p> The goal in this article is to get everyone who runs a fitness or health business set up with a great quiz like Brads . I 'll go over the basics of what makes a good quiz and then run through some examples that use that advice well . <p> Part 1 : How to make a quiz for your health and fitness business <p> Step 1 : Name it right . Here are a few types of names that generally work well . <p> The " Could You Pass The " Test . For example " Could You Pass the Physical Trainers Aptitude Test ? " This kind of quiz satisfies the burning desire to know . With audiences that are interested in health and nutrition , the trainers exam , the nutritionist exam , and the physical therapistss exam are all good examples . ( obviously shorten them ) <p> The " How Smart are You ? " Quiz . Similar to the challenge quiz , but more personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " takes the question directly at the person who 's taking the quiz so they feel like the result tells them something about themselves . <p> Step 2 : Create questions to connect with potential customers . Here are three tips on that . <p> Speak simply . We like things that we can understand . Write questions that do n't  confuse people , this is n't a school test , you 're not trying to make people fail . <p> Speak with a personality . The best quizzes on Buzzfeed and Zimbio all have a bit of snark to them . You do n't  necessarily have to do exactly what they do , but speak like you would to a client . <p> Step 3 : Collect leads to stay in touch ( optional ) . Check out these best practices . <p> Make the offer relevant . Quizzes provide a unique opportunity to offer up a call to action that makes sense in direct context to what 's happening right now . <p> Make the offer valuable . Lead generation is a trade . Make sure your end of the trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering a discount , a free product , or a free consultation , offer up something of value in return for personal information . <p> Be positive . We share what makes us look good . No one shares that picture from last summers family reunion when they got way too drunk , they share the picture from the concert when they got a picture with Jay Z. Make your quiz results tell the quiz taker they are awesome . <p> Be honest . Its possible to tell people they rock without lying . Pick out one good thing about your quiz result and focus on that . For example , if you tell people they do n't  know anything about nutrition , focus on the fact that they have a blank slate to start healthy habits with . <p> Be share-able . Depending on your actual business , you may not be big on social media . Trainers and nutritionists probably are , insurance companies , maybe not so much . Either way , social is too big to ignore . People will talk about you on social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well plan for how you 'll be shared so you 'll like it . The formula for being shared goes like this " I got ( my result ) ( name of the quiz ) " So for example , that would look like " I got Fitness Guru , How Much do You know About Fitness ? " Just know how that works and name your results accordingly . <p> Part 2 : Great examples to learn from . <p> 1 . EC Medical Group . This awesome team debunked one of the top myths in the quiz world your business is n't too serious to run a quiz . They cover some fairly weighty topics not usually turned into quizzes ( womens health ) , but with some clever wording they made it work . <p> One of their quizzes is titled " Progesterone Quiz " and I 'll be honest I " m not entirely sure what that is , but the writers over at EC Medical Group put together a series of questions that were formal enough to go along with the highly professional nature of their brand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor . <p> Quizzes are a good way to bridge the gap between professionalism and fun , this one is a good example of using a quiz to " break the ice " for potential new customers before they ever set foot in their physical door . <p> ( the cover photo is a bit creepy , however ) <p> 2 . WellPoint . Wellpoint is the largest managed health care company in the Blue Cross Blue Shield group they are huge . Its not easy for them to come across as anything but a massive corporation to their customers and the general public . Combating that image is n't necessary all the time , but for attracting progressive clients who are n't  super keen on supporting a huge company , it could help Wellpoint to be more personable . <p> 3. - StyleCraze . This company is a huge fashion brand in India , and where fashion plays , fitness stays . ( that did n't  work out as well as I thought it would ) . Anywho , fitness is a hot topic for a lot of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Their quiz , " How Fit are You ? " does n't  really tell you how fit you are , but rather tells you how much you know about fitness . Most of the results are positive , reinforcing the quiz taker . <p> The question is , why would a fashion company make a fitness quiz ? There 's no call to action that makes sense , you cant try to sell a fashion product after having someone take a fitness quiz . However , as I mentioned , StyleCraze attracts people who are interested in fashion , and those people are likely to also like fitness . By bringing in people for a fitness quiz , they get the attention of an audience that they know is also interested in their core product fashion . <p> This tactic works well for companies that need a way to diversify content . Find out what interests your customers have ( other than your core business ) , then make quizzes about these complimentary interests and share them to attract an audience that is ripe to become your customer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about creating a quiz for your health and fitness business , do n't  hesitate to contact us ( josh @ tryinteract.com ) .

@@22713577 @2713577/ <h> How To Find Images For Your Quiz <p> Bad stock images are seriously uncool . So many corporate websites use the same smiling lady to represent their " customer service " department , but all they 're really doing is cementing the idea that their company is run by corporate giants who do n't care about customers . However , it 's way to expensive and inconvenient to get all your own pictures taken , so there has to be some stock photography . Here are seven resources for finding images that will make your quiz just that much more special . <p> 1 . Unsplash : This is by far my personal favorite . There are ten new photos added each week , and you can subscribe to get them sent directly to you . The photos are primarily nature and architecture . <p> 2 . ImFree : This is the best resource on this list for stock photos of people . A lot of their photos are pulled in from Flickr , which can work , but you have to dig through them a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A good resource for general images . This is the only site on this list with a search function , if you need a picture of a specific thing this is the place to go . <p> 4 . Little Visuals : Another excellent resource for landscapes and nature photos . This site differs from Unsplash because it focuses more on " normal " places . A lot of pictures of farms and the countryside rather than monuments etc . <p> 5 . Gratisography : This site is run by a photographer who takes pictures of pretty much whatever suits his fancy . That leads to some pretty off-the-wall images with quite a few gems mixed in . <p> 6 . Wikimedia Commons : This is a massive database of over four million images that can be used free of charge without licensing . This is a good resource when you need something more abstract .

Much like the early days of Pinterest , there are terms against posting products and linking out is tough to do . However , given that quizzes are ever-popular and you cant put them directly into Instagram posts , there must be some solution here . <p> The best you can really do with quizzes on Instagram is to put up a post letting people know you have a quiz and then putting the link in your bio . <p> For example , here 's a post about a style quiz that refers to having a link in the bio .

" How much do you actually know about color ? " <p> Which would you be more likely to click on if it showed up on your facebook feed ? I 'd go with the second , and so would a lot of other people . You see , the " actually " title is one of our top five best performing quiz title templates and is a sure-fire way to make sure you do n't go creating a mediocre quiz . <p> Based on research done on Interact quizzes which have received over 2 million views , we 've come up with the top five quiz titles that work every time , here they are . <p> 1 . The comparison title . " Who said it , ISIS or Hamas ? " <p> A quiz created in response to middle east conflict , has garnered more than 11,000 views and prompted tweets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops in that region . <p> In the quiz a statement is presented and then quiz takers are asked to identify which group it comes from . <p> We are drawn in by how similar the two organizations sound and become curious to see who said which statement . This quiz title template can be applied to your business by choosing two things ( or people ) that are commonly confused and writing a quiz asking people if they know the difference . For example , a quiz was made and titled " are these diets real or fake ? " the quiz asked people to identify the real diet out of two ridiculous sounding names . <p> 2 . Which ( blank ) are you ? " Which birthday cake are you ? " <p> Is one of several quizzes created by the site Food52 , and they have yet to get any less than 10,000 visits per quiz . They always create some variation of the " Which ( blank ) are you ? " title and have had great success with it . <p> This title template @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually any set of products ( like cake recipes ) or people ( like famous human rights activists ) and create a quiz to find out which one you are most like . You 'll want to start with the personality quiz template to make this happen and build the " personalities " as whatever you choose to put in there . <p> 3 . The celebrity title <p> Like it or not , you have heard of celebrities . They inundate our very lives and are a constant presence , reminding us that there are people in the world who are much more rich and famous than we could ever realistically be . What that means is that we project ourselves onto celebrities , we identify with them and see a reflection of our own personality in famous people . <p> That 's why celebrity comparison quizzes work so well . Take for example " Which celebrity should play you in a movie version of your life ? " this is a goofy quiz , but it works very well . <p> You can apply celebrities to a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairstyle should you have ? " " Which celebrity coffee drink should you have ? " celebrity quizzes boil down to personality quizzes with famous people inserted . <p> 4 . The " actually title " <p> " Which American City Should You Actually Live In ? " is a quiz that in one version or another has gone viral many times over . The concept is simple , start with a personality quiz or a multiple choice quiz and add the word " actually . " It sounds stupid to create an entire template based off of adding one word , but when you think about the concept , it makes sense . <p> Adding " actually " turns your quiz into a challenge instead of just a normal personality or knowledge quiz . You are making your content more abrasive , which is what entertainment is all about . <p> 5 . Can we guess your ? title <p> " Is your diet too restrictive ? " is a quiz that exploded in popularity because it makes a prediction about the quiz taker . We all are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so making a quiz that " reads " people is an awesome play . <p> You have to be careful with this type of quiz , making false predictions about people can backfire if your predictions are mean or negative . Try to remain honest , but do n't by any means be negative .

I went through the best quizzes we 've seen built at Interact and found the most common questions that get asked . I use this post myself when making quizzes to get inspiration by scanning through until I see something that makes sense in context of the quiz Im building . <p> 1 . What 's Your Favorite Color ? <p> I use this question as an ice-breaker , towards the beginning of a quiz to get people started . You can gather data from it in terms of what kind of person the quiz taker is as well . For example , neutral colors are more mellow personalities whereas brighter colors are stronger or more assertive people ( typically ) . <p> 2 . Where would you like to live ? <p> This question can give you data on how someone likes to live , which ties directly to their personality . A person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in a city are obviously different and you can tie that back into your quiz correlations . <p> 3 . What kind of House Would You like to live in ? <p> This question can be positioned to give you lots of information . For example , you can use it to gauge someones affinity to luxury by putting pictures of houses in various states of fanciness . It can also be used in combination with the " where would you want to live ? " question to get an idea of how someone really wants to carry out their life . <p> 4 . How old are you ? <p> I do n't  always ask this question , but it can be super useful , especially if your personalities vary based on time . For example , if you are doing a personality quiz on which TV character people are most like and the characters come from different time periods , youd use this question to point quiz takers towards the period that fits their age . <p> 5 . Where would you like to vacation ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , which is a great jumping-off point for a result that uses adventure as a key indicator . <p> 6 . Pick your favorite car <p> This question can tell you a lot about a person , do they pick the most expensive car of the classiest one or the most well-known ? Use this as a money/style question . - <p> 7 . What 's your favorite food ? <p> Classic quiz question . Great one to put towards the beginning of a quiz and use to get the ball rolling . The selection can be used to inform your quiz results by tying the answer choices to different cultures and preferences . <p> 8 . What do you do to relax ? <p> You can learn a lot about someone by seeing what they do when no one is watching . This question let 's you behind the scenes of someones life so you can see what they prefer to do on their own time . <p> 9 . What 's Your Favorite Dessert ? <p> Ah , dessert . Since dessert is not an everyday thing ( at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how people like to indulge when given the chance . - <p> 10 . What are you most passionate about ? <p> A pretty deep question , no doubt , but one that people are willing to answer in a quiz . I love that questions like this actually get answered in quizzes because you can do so much with the data received . <p> 11 . What 's Your Dream Job ? <p> 12 . Who is your favorite celebrity ? <p> 13 . Which pattern do you like the most ? <p> 14 . How would your friends describe you ? <p> 15 . What 's Most Important to You ? <p> A purposely open-ended question that allows you to gather pertinent information you need to provide good quiz results . For example , in the question below we ask " What 's One Thing You Ca n't Live Without ? " and the answer choices are somewhat random , but help inform the quiz , which is a style personality quiz . <p> By asking someone who they would like to go to lunch with , you 're actually asking them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . If they select someone like Steve Jobs , they are more serious and tech-minded , if they choose someone like Ellen they are more fun-loving and philanthropic . <p> 27 . What 's your spirit animal ? <p> 28 . What 's your favorite snack ? <p> 29 . What is your favorite hobby ? <p> 30 . What 's your biggest fear ? <p> 31 . What 's Your Favorite TV Show ? <p> 32 . What 's your favorite board game ? <p> 33 . Do you like attention ? <p> 34 . What size group do you prefer to be in ? <p> 35 . Do you like change ? <p> 36 . What 's your morning routine like ? <p> 37 . How often do you read ? <p> 38 . What 's your favorite type of weather ? <p> 39 . What 's your favorite type of music ? <p> 40 . Which celebrities style do you like best ? <p> 41 . What 's your favorite car ? <p> 42 . What 's your favorite Friday night activity ? <p> 43 . When you were a kid , what did you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's a perfect date for you ? <p> 45 . Are you more outspoken or reserved ? <p> Great question for any type of personality profiling quiz , and it can be used in more serious quizzes as well . With our personality or tallied scoring systems you can use this question to move a quiz taker towards one outcome or you can use it as a very strong indicator by adding a lot of points depending on how they answer . <p> 46 . What 's your favorite social network ? <p> Very telling in terms of personality . Instagram is more creative and picture-heavy , snapchat is more in-the-moment and spontaneous , so on and so forth . <p> 48 . What inspires you ? <p> This is a super flexible question that fits into almost any quiz . I use it as a way of figuring out what matters most to quiz takers . You can insert pretty much anything into the answer choices which allows you to gather the information you need depending on your unique quiz setup . <p> 49 . Who would you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of asking " who do you want to be like ? " which gives a strong indication of what kind of aspirations a person has . <p> 50 . What 's Your Favorite Breakfast Food ? <p> I like to work this question in as a way to gauge someones health habits as well as routines . For example , if one of the answer choices is " I 'm usually to rushed in the morning for breakfast " then you know that person is not someone who is big on routine .

The only problem is , your student prospects are not thinking about what university to attend when they are browsing Facebook , so white papers and information forms just do n't  cut it when it comes to marketing on the social network . <p> Not to worry , there is one kind of content that absolutely crushes it on Facebook , and that content is quizzes . Today we are going to look at exactly how you can use quizzes to bring in warm leads for your higher education institution through the medium of Facebook . This is an actionable guide , you 'll walk away knowing exactly how to build your own lead generating quiz stay tuned . <h> How to create the quiz <p> There is an art to crafting a personality quiz that is organically interesting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided by a fairly strict set of guidelines for how to create the quiz . Let 's jump in step-by-step . <p> What to make the quiz about <p> This is the easiest part of the whole process . All you have to do is make a quiz titled " Which Major Should You Have ? " or alternatively " Which Career Should You Pursue ? " ( the same quiz basically ) . This same quiz has been done over 100 times that Ive personally witnessed and led directly to over $1.5 million in revenue . <p> How to write quiz questions <p> A quiz presents the unique opportunity to speak directly with your audience through a scripted conversation . You can use this chance to build trust with the prospect and warm them up to opt-in when you ask them to . The key to successfully building rapport through quiz questions is to sound human . Just loosen up , remember that you are speaking to one person at a time through the quiz and you do n't  need to put on a professional tone to address an audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the questions of the quiz you can place an opt-in gate before the quiz results are shown . This is a natural incentive for the quiz taker to put in their information , but its also important to get the wording right here to maximize the opt-ins . <p> The first thing to do on this opt-in text is convey value . For higher ed the simple offer is to call the prospect and explain their recommended major in more detail . Since the quiz will get them curious this is a subtle way to continue the conversation . <p> The second thing to do is say exactly how and when you 'll be contacting the prospects who opt-in . Its much better to be honest here , and as you can see in the example below , even if you are overly blunt about the amount of contacting that will be done the form can still convert at 50% or higher . <p> How to present results worth sharing <p> After the op-in form is presented your quiz taker will be taken to their result ( recommended major ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz results and continue interacting with your brand . There are three steps to achieve that outcome . <p> First , be up-lifting . No one wants to share negative things about themselves , and that 's especially true with quizzes . Tell people that they rock , but use facts , do n't  just mindlessly flatter people theyll see right through it . <p> Second , continue the conversation . Include a personalized link in each quiz result to check out more information on the recommended major . That way if someone is interested in learning more right now they can . <p> Third , let the people share . Obviously include social buttons for people to share their results . Quizzes get 75% of their traffic from Facebook , so sharing is how you 'll get more leads . <h> How to promote the quiz <p> After you make your quiz its time to get it up and running . This is a two-step process . <p> On your site <p> The first step is to embed the quiz on your own website so that when you share it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The quiz embeds through a simple iframe code and looks native to your site like the example below . <p> On Facebook <p> Take the link of the new page you created to embed the quiz on and share it on Facebook with a picture of a person as the hero image . For best results you should promote the post to a targeted audience of prospects . <h> How to turn the quiz leads into new students . <p> Now that you have your quiz up and running and its started bringing in tons of new leads you have to do something with those leads to convert them into new students . The first step in this process is to send a welcome email referencing the quiz like the one below . <p> After that first email you 'll want to either call every prospect ( if you have their phone number ) , or start them on a drip campaign to warm up the lead and get them sales-ready . Below is an example of a sequence of emails to send to a new quiz lead in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student prospects are on Facebook , and quizzes are the perfect way to reach them in a non-threatening way .

@@22713591 @2713591/ <h> How to come up with great quiz ideas <p> I get the question " What should I make a quiz about ? " every once in a while , and its always a tough one to answer . There are so many ways to approach quizzes that each company has to forge their own path . However , recently I 've started to notice a few trends that I think can really help those in search of quiz ideas . <p> Let 's break it down . <p> There are two types of quizzes that get shared , and sharing is your path to getting new customers using quizzes , whether you are using the quiz to collect leads or as a way to grow your social traffic , you need the social shares to get things going . Here are those two types of quizzes : <p> 2 . Multiple choice tests . Think " How much do you know about your alma mater ? " or " How much do you know about George Strait ? " <p> Now these two types can be applied to virtually any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychics to trucks to baby toys , so do n't  go telling me you do n't  think a quiz can work in your industry . <p> Ive come up with a simple mind map that is the kind of questioning I use to help people come up with new ideas when we do in-person product demos . Ill put the visual first because if you 're like me you care a lot more about the visual than my explanation ( which is below anyways ) . <p> Let 's break this down. - <p> The best place to start when coming up with quiz ideas is to think about what your customers really care about when it comes to using your product or service . What problem are you solving that causes people to sign up ? If you are already doing content marketing , the answer to this question is probably found in the titles of your most popular blog posts , if not , then it would n't hurt to ask people why they use your service . <p> Once you know this , your first quiz should definitely revolve around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start with the most crucial issue and expand from there , quizzes should start with the most important thing and then branch out . <p> For example , in the graphic below we see the basic strategy from Food52.com a site that focuses on providing cooks ( in the broad sense of the word as anyone who cooks ) to become better cooks . The first quiz they created was " What kind of cook are you ? " which hits the target on the core mission . Then they proceeded to branch out ( the yellow circles ) , and create content about current events ( holidays ) , specific types of food ( cake ) , and cooking knowledge . <p> Deciding which quiz to make first is important , and you should carefully consider ( and do some soul searching ) if you have a really hard time coming up with that first quiz idea . However , you should also be aware of the fact that typically people spend a long time creating the first quiz ( two weeks to launch ! ) and on average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The second quiz only takes a week to formulate and release ( on average ) and brings in 475 views , so it does get easier . <p> That 's all I have to say about coming up with concepts for your next quiz .

@@22713592 @2713592/ <h> 10 Facebook Marketing Ideas You Can Execute in 10 Minutes <p> Facebook marketing is difficult because posts do n't  last very long as newsfeeds are quickly filled up with content from all sorts of brands and friends vying for attention . In order to be successful you have to create content frequently and that content must grab attention and get shared so the reach goes beyond just a fleeting minute . <p> To help accomplish those things , I 've put together a list of 10 Facebook-friendly content pieces you can use that take 10 minutes or less to build and post . <h> Quizzes <p> Youve seen these on Facebook , which is a clear indication that they work . The personality quiz has been around for a long time and it keeps striking a chord with people ( in a good way ) . Now brands are getting involved and creating their own personality quizzes and posting them to Facebook to increase engagement and grow their email lists . <p> Everyone loves quizzes <p> They 're undeniably fun , and there 's actually a lot of scientific reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have to do with how narcissistic people are ( we like to talk about ourselves and share things about ourselves ) . See the question below , where the quiz asks people what they think summer smells like , which gives people an opportunity to state their opinion , which everyone loves to do . <p> How to run a quiz <p> Quizzes are simple if you let them be . Basically what you want to do is emulate the quizzes that you 've seen on Facebook , or in magazines in the past . Then use a tool like Interact ( which is free ) to create the personality quiz and post it to Facebook . The key is to not over-think it and to make the quiz fun rather than business-focused . <p> You 'll get people interested in your brand naturally if they take a quiz from you that they enjoy , much more so than if you try to do a quiz like " How much do you know about sales strategy ? " if you 're selling sales strategy people will see right through that . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Movie are You Most Like ? " which is much more enjoyable . <h> Sweepstakes <p> This one is classic , and has yet to lose its appeal . Its not complicated , were willing to go to some effort at the possibility of getting something for free . That 's only natural . The best part is that putting together a giveaway can be really quick , and you can let people gain additional entries by sharing the giveaway , which adds a natural viral element . <p> How to run an effective Giveaway : <p> Giveaways can work extremely well for growing your email list and getting engagement on Facebook . There are a few keys to running one that works . <p> 1 . Give something away that matters to your audience . For example , giving away an ipad to your audience of retail customers might have some appeal , but giving away an exclusive selection of next years product line is much more targeted towards the actual people who are your customers . <p> 2 . Let people enter by sharing . If you want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll want to let people gain additional entries by sharing on various social networks and by email . <h> Photo Contest <p> Any time you can get users involved you 're winning with social marketing . Plus a photo contest keeps people coming back to see how their submitted image is doing . These days everyone wants to be a photographer , and it appeals to our sense of competition to want to be the best , so a Photo Contest is the perfect fit for Facebook ( since its basically just a giant popularity contest anyways ) . <p> How to run a Facebook Photo Contest <p> There are two ways you can run a photo contest on Facebook . <p> 1 . The quick and dirty way . Come up with a hashtag that 's unique to your photo contest and ask people to post photos with the hashtag in the caption of the post . Then choose a photo by searching for that hashtag on Facebook and selecting a photo to win the contest . <p> 2 . The cleaner but more expensive way . Use a tool like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing it this way is that the tool will have a built-in voting system , so you can let your audience choose the winner by voting and get more involvement that way . I 'd recommend running the giveaway either in a Facebook tab , or on your site and link to it from Facebook . <h> Caption Contest <p> Similar to a Photo contest with a little less involvement and a lot less cost . Simply find a fun picture and post it , asking people to write the best caption . This one works really well with whatever trend is happening in the media at the moment . For example , here are a few things that happened in 2016 that would work . <p> -Harambe <p> -Election Debates <p> -David Bowie <p> How to run a caption contest : <p> The main challenge for running a caption contest is finding good pictures . This takes social awareness . The best thing to do is follow news sites and socially relevant blogs to see what they 're talking about . If you get it right and find something socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get people to engage and write a caption . <h> Poll <p> You can actually run polls right inside of Facebook , or use a polling tool for more advanced options . The real draw with polls is that you can see how other people are voting . For example , the poll below from Starbucks shows how many people order their drink in each manner , and right after you vote you can see what category you fall into . <p> How to run a poll : <p> There are two methods for running a poll , one simple and quick , the other more complex and in-depth but potentially costing money . <p> 1 . Just use the Facebook polling tool . <p> here 's a Dummies guide on how to do it . Polls are basically the same as any other status update you 'd run , and do n't  take any longer to put together . However , the poll will be super limited and look exactly like the one above . <p> 2 . Use a more advanced setup . <p> You can run something more visually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sign up for a service and pay for it . However , the downside is that Facebook does n't  allow other products to live right inside the newsfeed so people will have to click through to your website to vote and see results . <h> Facebook Live Poll <p> This is a new one for 2016 that may or may not be around very long well see what Facebook decides to do with it . For now , people are using Facebooks live streaming functionality ( Facebook Live ) , to create polls where your audience can vote by reacting to the post . Then you end up with something like what 's pictured below where people can vote on the best Christmas movie by reacting with the " love " " angry " reactions , etc . <p> How to run a Facebook live Poll : <p> Currently there 's not a reputable option for creating Facebook live polls . Most people are throwing them together using some convoluted methods . Interact is working on a tool that let 's you put together a Facebook Live Poll quickly and without programming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch for that . <h> Customer Story <p> There 's something really powerful about sharing stories of your customers and how your product has helped to make their lives easier or how you 've helped grow their businesses or how they just enjoy using what you sell . Plus people just naturally connect with stories because we can see ourselves in them , so they tend to perform better . <p> How to put together a customer story : <p> The best customer stories come straight from the experiences of your customers , which means actually picking up the phone and talking to the customer . Prepare a short list of questions beforehand , but then let the conversation progress naturally . Post the conversation as a blog post ( with the customers approval of course ) , then share that blog post to Facebook . <h> Listicle <p> There is actually a lot of science behind why we like lists . Also , the list format is very mobile-friendly since the formatting is usually something like ( image -&gt; short description ) , which shows up nicely . It makes intuitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play into the concept of what Facebook does for us as a distraction from our real lives and what 's actually in front of us . Lists are like a bunch of really short stories that only take a fleeting second of your attention , but all pieced together into one post . <p> How to put together a list : <p> The key to a good list is to make it different and eye-catching . The best lists Ive seen recently are " 10 Abandoned Places You Can ( But Ca n't ) Visit Around the World " and " 10 Reasons 2016 Was the Absolute Worst . " There 's actually a bunch of research on what makes a good list , and you can read through that , but the general rule is that you want the list to contain a lot of visually appealing elements , and also be timely relevant . <p> I 'd recommend creating the list on your blog and typing it up/adding images there , then share the blog post to Facebook so people end up coming back to your site to see the list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days when you just ca n't be creative . You can go to Buzzsumo- and find the most shared content for any topic . Simply find a link that makes the most sense for your audience and share it to your page . Sometimes its best to just re-use what 's already interesting , and odds are most of your audience has n't  seen the top content even if it is already popular . <p> How to do this : <p> Go to Buzzsumo , search for a topic you are thinking about sharing , and look at what has been popular , then share one of those links . If you do n't  know what to begin searching for , start off with whatever news is happening in your industry right now , what 's new , what 's hot , and look at the types of posts that are up . <h> BONUS : <h> Facebook Notes <p> I have to be honest , this one has n't  played out super well for me , but I spoke with someone from Weebly who does marketing over there and they mentioned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pushing the Notes feature and showing it more in newsfeeds , which could be advantageous if you 're blogging anyways . Also , since the notes are published straight to Facebook , you can boost them just like you would a blog post , but people can read the post and click through to your website directly , which takes out one middle step of clicking through to your website just to read the post . <p> Facebook Notes is just blogging on Facebook , except the posts are put up on your Page instead of on your URL . <p> How to blog using Facebook Notes : <p> On brand Facebook pages , click the Offer , Event + option when you are writing a status , this will open up a sub-menu where you can choose " Write a note " which will open up a full content editor just like WordPress , except when you publish it goes to a Facebook URL . The process is actually really quick , and it can open up a new element to your Facebook mix if you do find good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for you . My goal with this post is to give a small directory of quick concepts you can run with to keep your brand Facebook page fun and engaging . As Facebook continue updating their algorithm and pushing posts down more and more quickly , coming up with fresh concepts constantly is more important than ever . - If you have additional ideas , feel free to share them in the comments below .

Be warned though , its aptly named it really is like crack and will get you hooked instantly . <p> I was looking through search terms for Interact recently and noticed that people have been searching for " how to make trivia crack quiz " and " trivia crack template " a lot more recently and landing on our website , so I figured I 'd make a guide for how to create a Trivia Crack quiz that goes on your website . <p> So I 'm just going to make a quiz that 's as close to a Trivia Crack quiz as possible , pointing out things along the way that I think are important . <h> How to make a quiz like Trivia Crack using Interact <p> Now I say " like " Trivia Crack because obviously we cant build in all the socially connected aspects of trivia crack in a quiz that will be created in the next hour or so . However , what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crack quiz as it pertains to the questions and trivia aspects . So let 's do this , here are the steps to making the quiz ( actual quiz at the end ) <h> 1 . Pick a topic <p> Trivia crack is organized by categories , and that 's a huge part of what makes it so much fun . My favorite category in the game is Geography , so I decided to make a quiz about geography , specifically about Italy . When making a quiz for your specific website I highly recommend picking something related to your business , this will make it easier to write questions and people will be more interested in the quiz if theyve already interacted with your brand , and if they have n't interacted with your brand , you can use the quiz as a marketing tool . <h> 2 . Give that thing a title and design it <p> This is where I think Interact actually has an advantage over Trivia Crack , if you want to scroll down to the bottom of this post you can see how Interact quizzes look when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool , and can really make your quiz go viral quickly . That cover image you see in the Facebook post is what you are designing here in the design section of the Interact quiz builder so take it seriously . <h> 3 . Write questions <p> This is where all the magic happens . Trivia Crack is a game based entirely off of well-written and thought-provoking questions . Because you set the quiz to reveal the correct answers immediately after each question is responded to , that means each question should function on its own as a mini game . While Trivia Crack only does text questions and answers ( which you can do with Interact ) , you can also have image questions and image answers with Interact , which is quite cool . <p> Some tips for writing questions. - <p> Have a good time <p> Imagine you are with friends at a bar and trivia begins to happen , try to ask questions in your quiz that youd imagine the trivia master asking or that you could see yourself asking friends as entertainment . Remember this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Base everything off of facts <p> Good trivia starts with a core fact that is interesting because its new to some people . That sounded really dumb but all I 'm saying is that you should write questions about things you actually know about and feel like are unique to you ( or Wikipedia where you learned the fact ) . <p> Keep your quiz fairly short <p> Yes quizzes are fun and the questions are fascinating , but no one wants to answer your 50 question trivia quiz that takes like an hour to complete . I would say try to stay under 10 questions . <p> Heres what - question looks like after you answer it . Look familiar ? I think Trivia Crack took cues from our styling ( we were around before anyone knew it existed ) . I put this here because the explanation of why someone got an answer right ( or wrong ) is almost as important as the question itself . Make sure you actually know the correct answer and also make sure you provide adequate explanation to satisfy the curiosity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question right or wrong . <h> 4 . Write results <p> Because you are revealing the correct answer to each question right after its answered , the overall result of the quiz becomes less consequential . However , with interact you get an option to show correct answers only at the end , which changes the game a bit and makes the results actually important . <p> If you look below for a second , I set up a mock result for ( 0 to 0 correct ) that links out to an event that is located in Italy where obviously the quiz taker could learn more about the place . If I was someone running events in Italy , this Trivia Crack quiz would be an excellent way of marketing it . <h> 5 . Embed on your site <p> This is a key feature . When you set up a quiz you can set the social share URL to any URL you want , meaning you can send traffic back to your site when people share the quiz the links point back to your domain and you keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been looking at in this blog post and changed the social share links to point back to this post as well , so you can see how that works . <h> 6 . Share on Facebook <p> As the person who made the quiz , you want to get it out there for the world to see . There are two ways you can do this . The first is to actually take the quiz yourself and share it from the results page you get . The second is what I did before where I just share the quiz itself , which comes complete with the cover photo . <p> Note : If you are sharing on a business Facebook page it wont automatically share the cover photo image ( damn Facebook settings ) , so you have to manually share the photo along with a link to the quiz . <h> 7 . Bonus ! How to get ROI from your Trivia Crack quiz <p> So you might be reading this as a marketing professional and you 're like " sick , I can make that kind of quiz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a couple of answers to that question , I 'll go over them briefly . <p> 1 . Website traffic <p> As I mentioned in the embed section , I can embed a quiz in my blog post or website page and set the social share links to point to it so I 'm getting extra traffic on my domain from social sites . If I want to show ads or show email signup forms I can do that and get some lasting value from my quiz . <p> 2 . Sales leads <p> I put in a screenshot of a lead capture form below so you can see what it looks like . Basically its a form that goes between the last question of your quiz and the results that asks for lead information . The actual form below was shown 475 times and lead to 123 opt-ins . That 's not bad for five form fields ! 
@@22713596 @2713596/ <h> 100 Quiz Examples that will teach you all the things about making quizzes <p> Whenever I 'm doing product demos for Interact there 's usually an aha ! moment when the customer sees what they were looking for and from there the product sells itself , I do n't  have to do any convincing . Often that aha ! moment comes when I pull up an example quiz that 's similar to the one the customer is interested in building . My goal with this post is to highlight some examples of excellent quizzes from various industries to help with your planning process . <p> If you do n't  feel like reading all these examples , go straight to Interact to make a quiz . <p> I 've broken the examples apart by the topic of the quiz , but I 'd also like to point out the top two use cases for our users . <h> 1 . Lead generation <p> You can insert a lead generation form between the questions of a quiz and the results . That lead generation form can be customized to be relevant to the actual quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates on their forms . <h> 2 . Social engagement <p> The leading reason people use Interact quizzes is to increase social engagement . Interact quizzes have been some of the most popular social posts ( measured by likes+comments+shares ) ever produced by brands like The Red Lobster and PBS . <p> Without further blabbing , here are the 100 examples ( feel free to scroll down to your industry ) <h> TV Show Quizzes <h> 1 . Rachael Ray <p> When Rachaels team first logged on and created a quiz for her show , we were both stoked and surprised by the use case . No one had really thought to do a TV show quiz ( even though now it seems obvious ) . The Rachael quiz was built and launched in one morning , and it instantly blew up on Facebook and Twitter , getting more than 10,000 views the day of the show . There 's a big opportunity in complimentary content to TV shows , as we sit on the couch watching our favorites , our phones or tablets are in our hands , and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on devices all at once is a big deal . <h> 2 . PBS <p> PBS created the perfect TV show compliment , a quiz about cute animals . Following the same model as Rachael , this quiz works to both promote the show and be a complimentary piece . At the end of the quiz you are told which " animal misfit " you are and also given a link to check out the show online . This led to a lot of great tweets as people gushed over the animals presented in their quiz results . <h> 3 . Golf Channel <p> The Golf Channel has a lot of content to work with . Since they do n't  have the same type of daily or weekly show as Rachael or PBS , they used historical content to develop a quiz . Again though , this quiz acts as a complement to a piece The Golf Channel invested heavily in ( The Golf Book ) . This is where quizzes really flourish as online marketing tools to the offline TV content that brands like The Golf Channel already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , the classic personality quiz applied to a TV show , makes perfect sense . Zap2it , which is an ABC affiliate site created this Pretty Little Liars quiz and it inevitably got shared a lot , like thousands of times a lot . Not much to say about this strategy , its just a personality quiz , but I do have a word of advice , always include links in your quiz results , so for example if you get Sarah as your quiz result , there should be a link to check out Sarah clips from the show or something like that , always maximize the engagement created with a quiz by including links . <h> 5 . Inverness Film Festival <p> Our first contest example ! ( hint , that will be a recurring theme ) . The Inverness Film Festival created a trivia type quiz with prizes for people who get all the answers right . While not directly related to one TV show , this quiz still has a lesson to be learned , when thinking of creative ways to run a contest or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit is natural , you have a way to make it a real contest ( by asking questions ) , and its simple to collect information from entrants ( using the lead generation feature in Interact ) . <h> 6 . Resurrection ( Spanish ) <p> Google translate let me down , so all I know is that this quiz is titled " Where in the world ( something ) " What 's more important though is the way this quiz is used in a Spanish arm of Sony Entertainment . They create these quizzes for a variety of English shows that are translated into Spanish and embed the quizzes into the cable providers website . The quizzes get shared on average twice as much as the regular articles on these sites which gives the shows a prime spot in viewers minds as they browse through social feeds . <h> 7 . BBC Proms <p> Similar to the Inverness film festival , BBC created a quiz for their big annual show called Proms . here 's the scenario , you are waiting in line or sitting and waiting for a concert to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a Proms quiz testing your knowledge of the event , bam ! simple entertainment on the go , compare your score to your friends around you . This is basically exactly what happened with this quiz , propelling it to 10,000+ views ( mostly on mobile devices ) <h> 8 . Studio C TV <p> Studio C is a TV show with a very strong following on Facebook . That 's why we were so impressed when a couple of quizzes they created became some of the most " liked " posts ever on their Facebook page . They take a modified approach to the personality quiz and use it to help people decide which side they should be on for issues related to the show itself . Again , imagine watching the show and taking this quiz at the same time , it makes the whole experience more enjoyable . <h> 9 . Greys Anatomy <p> Do you know everything about Greys Anatomy ? I do n't  know , good question . This quiz does something that is smart , in limiting their audience . One common theme among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audiences they have no chance of reaching . If you make a quiz for one group of people who really like it , they will share their results , if you make a quiz for everyone and most do n't  really care , they wont share their results . <h> News Quizzes <h> 10 . The Irish Post <p> The Irish Post was the first Interact customer to go " viral " they made a quiz that reached nearly 20% of all Irish people living in London and wrote themselves into history by inventing the " pub rule . " The pub rule says that you should never write a quiz question that you would n't ask in a pub with your mates . Think about it , when someone takes your quiz , they are answering your questions directly , its a one-to-one medium , not a one-to-many , treat it that way and good things will come . <h> 11 . SCPR <p> I applaud Southern California Public Radio for two reasons . 1 . They successfully made public radio like ten times cooler by making a quiz about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , getting thousands of social shares and hundreds of comments . Even better , the quiz helps you find your favorite socal pizza spot , and was actually a compliment to a radio show about pizza in socal . Just like the TV shows augmented their content with quizzes , radio can do the same thing and continue the conversation online . <h> 12 . NPR <p> I would like to formally apologize to NPR . In college one of my roommates and I would imitate the network by speaking in monotone voices about the most mundane subjects we could think of but now theyve totally redeemed themselves . The Seattle branch of NPR is now making news quizzes each week as part of their online content , and they are exceptionally fun . There 's always news , people keep doing stuff , so news quizzes will always be effective marketing pieces . <h> 13 . Leading Britains Conversation <p> I had to Google " Ukip " because being an American my knowledge of world issues is kept to a minimum . Turns out its the UK independent party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the twitter conversations around this quiz , I found several long strings of back-and-forth opinions ( sometimes I really wondered how mad people were getting ) . This brings us to my next point , controversy . Some of the best quizzes ( including this one ) , use polarizing issues to increase their reach . A social share is a social share , and controversial quizzes get shared whether the quiz taker agrees with their result or not . <h> 14 . Isis vs . Hamas <p> I was reluctant to include this example because its a sensitive worldwide issue , but chose to add it because it shows a way that quizzes can really highlight news issues in a unique way . An anonymous party created this quiz , which asks people to identify the differences between ISIS and Hamas , which many were unable to do . A lot of people got involved in the conversation , including Israeli embassy twitter accounts and former military generals . <p> What they were able to do with a quiz couldnt be done with any other medium , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originates from ISIS or Hamas , that 's just something you could n't do effectively with video or text content . <h> 15 . BillyPenn <p> A lot of news is local , which could be a problem or could be a solution , depending on your point of view . For Philadelphia news site BillyPenn , focusing on one small market has allowed them to really perfect their content strategy . For example , this quiz " What Philly Neighborhood are you ? " really only applies to people who live in Philadelphia , but that did n't  prevent it from becoming popular , seeing more than 7,000 visits . A takeaway here is that you can create more granular quizzes and have more success than if you go for it all at once . <h> 16 . Berim.org <p> Iran gets a bad rap in the news , it seems no one has anything good to say about the country . That 's where Berim saw an opportunity and absolutely nailed it . They created a news quiz testing people on their knowledge of Iran , and the results were convincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Berim was able to change peoples perceptions of a nation by pointing out that Iran is a country filled with people just like us who are n't  inherently bad . <h> Marketing and Sales Quizzes <h> 17 . Gemalto <p> Gemalto is a company innovating the idea of marketing in enterprise software . They produce a lot of great content , and have begun creating quizzes as part of that strategy . What I especially like about this quiz is the attention to detail . Where many companies would be okay with using stock images for their quizzes , Gemalto insisted on creating custom graphics for each and every question of their quiz , and the results are excellent . The quiz was a hit and really added some flavor to the Gemalto content strategy . <h> 18 . UserTesting <p> E-commerce and the holidays have a love-hate relationship . On the one hand the holiday season can account for a large chunk of a sites annual sales , but on the other hand , one bad holiday season can essentially sink a business . Usertesting is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maximize usability , they created a quiz to prep their customers ( and potential customers ) for the holiday season . <p> This quiz takes the place of a " checklist " type of article and builds in interactivity at the same time . <h> 19 . Skilledup <p> When Interact was still somewhat of a pipe dream , Skilledup agreed to try out a quiz on one of their pages and use it to generate new email subscribers to their mailchimp list . 8 months later , that quiz has seen 600,000 views and generated nearly 50,000 new email subscribers . Its not the most interesting quiz in the world ( its about Microsoft Excel ) , but it is on point ( being embedded in a page about Excel ) and the quiz is on its way to 1 million views . <p> I think the real lesson from Skilledup is that context is king . Because this quiz is right in the middle of a long blog post about Excel , the lead generation about Excel makes sense , and works . <h> 20 . Adestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  take themselves too seriously . Adestra is an email marketing company that does this well , weaving fun into their own promotions . This email client quiz is a prime example , creating engaging content with a bit of goofy attached . Not to worry though , they were sure to include a lead capture option so interested customers could receive more information about email marketing . <h> 21 . Stackadapt <p> You know what 's scary ? when you are spending money on something you do n't  really know anything about . That 's the point Stackadapt is making with this quiz about online advertising , asking people if they really know what 's going on . This is an excellent first interaction for a company that provides information and a product around native display advertising . The quiz did its job and was shared hundreds of times , creating a great top-of-the-funnel piece . <h> 22 . Booker <p> A lot of businesses rely on heavy holiday sales to boost profits for the year . One industry where this is true ( I think ) is spas salons . Booker.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that genre of small business , and they made a quiz to help their customers decide what kind of holiday decorating they should do . At the end of the quiz , they even offered to send a holiday guide for free in return for an email subscription . <p> I picked this example in particular because it shows the power of targeted calls to action . Out of context , offering to send a holiday guide is a pretty good offer , but nothing to write home about . However , after you answer some questions about gearing up for the holidays , a holiday guide sounds like just what you are looking for . Quizzes can be used to make your lead generation calls to action hyper-relevant . <h> E-commerce quizzes <h> 23 . The Elephant Pants <p> This is one of my favorite stories , and represents a huge opportunity for quizzes . Elephant pants made a quiz to find out which type of these sweet pants you are , and linked the results to a Kickstarter page to pre-order your pair . I 'm happy to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over $8,000 to produce the first production run of the pants . <p> Quizzes can be used to personalize a range of products in the same way that Amazon recommends things to buy based on your interests , pretty cool stuff that does n't  require any programming . <h> 24 . Hookah and Shishah <p> Looking to get in on the personalization action , Hookah and Shishah ( the largest online retailer of Hookah ) created a fun quiz to find out what kind of Hookah you are and then linked the results to pages where you could actually purchased products . The quiz has seen more than 2500 views , and over 25% of those quiz takers actually clicked through to check out their recommended product . <h> 25 . Dean and Deluca <p> here 's a really genius way to sell more products and also create a fun experience for customers . Create a quiz titled " What 's your thanksgiving style ? " then put in a lead generation form offering 10% off everything in the store in return for an email address . Not only did this quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Deluca , but it also brought in new email subscribers who were incentivized to purchase with a discount winning all around . <h> 26 . Goedekers <p> A quiz built by a furniture company keeps popping up in Twitter feeds on its way to more than 20,000 views . The best part of the " What type of house should you live in ? " quiz is that it links out to products which can be purchased on the spot to match your style as recommended by the quiz . This quiz shows the versatility of quizzes in E-commerce , pretty much anyone who offers a variety of products can use a quiz to help people find which one they should buy . <h> 27 . Philips Sonicare <p> What do toothbrushes have to do with social media marketing ? Mm , I got nothin . Fortunately the team at Philips Sonicare is a lot smarter than me and came up with a series of fun quizzes for their Facebook page like the one below . Each quiz includes links to check out products ( including a pink toothbrush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fun . On average , the thousands of quiz takers spent two minutes each taking the quizzes , boosting social engagement significantly . <h> Social Justice quizzes ( non-profits ) <h> 28 . United Nations World Health Orignization <p> I am incredibly proud to partner with the U.N . to inform people about breast feeding . Theyve now completed a series of four quizzes that really bring to light the benefits of natural feeding for young children . For such a controversial subject , quizzes are a perfect medium for creating a non-threatening experience in which people can test their knowledge without having to read through a pamphlet or handout , its an ideal scenario to start conversations that could end up saving lives . <h> 29 . The American Red Cross <p> Do you really know how to swim ? Or just think you do ? That 's a potentially life-or-death question . Its surprising how many people do n't  know the basics of swimming and survival if you find yourself in the water , and The American Red Cross is raising awareness and getting people equipped in new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges you to test your swim skills , then they link the quiz results to an app that helps you learn how to swim and a form to sign up for swim lessons . <p> A lot of people ( myself included ) would n't question our swim skills , much less download an app to get better at swimming , yet when a quiz shows up on Facebook challenging our ability to survive in the water , its a challenge worth accepting . Many people shared this quiz ( over 1000 ) and its helped reach tens of thousands with the message to learn about swimming or face potentially dire consequences . <h> 30 . Amnesty International <p> There is incredible power in numbers when it comes to intervening in social justice issues around the world . Amnesty International works by bringing a crowd of seven million to the scene when human rights are on the line . There human rights activist quiz is helping to boost that seven million to even higher numbers , with this particular quiz already reaching more than 30,000 people . <p> One big issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people just cant relate to issues on the other side of the globe very well . This quiz helps alleviate that issue by giving people one problem to focus on and relating the strife to the quiz taker based on their personality . <h> 31 . Oxfam <p> Having grow up in a farming community , I was excited that this quiz was created , ( and yes , I could make it as a farmer ) . However , the reality this quiz is trying to bring to light is that its difficult for people in developing nations to make a living as farmers , and we are n't  helping by buying food from huge manufacturers who treat farmers like cogs in a machine that produces massive amounts of food . <p> Again , its easy to forget that eating a snickers bar is causing peanut farmers in South America to live rough lives , and Oxfam is one of many great organizations that is helping raise awareness ( in new and fun ways ) . <h> 32 . FYA <p> If we do n't  shape the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to be great . Future Youth of Australia created this fun quiz to help people discover a bit more about themselves so they can focus on improving their strengths and shoring up their weaknesses . The quiz also links to a book published by FYA that can be purchased at the end of the quiz . <h> 33 . World Vision <p> World Vision is an organization that supports children in developing countries . I know this because I 've been personally involved with World Vision for the last ten years . I do n't  say that to brag ( although there 's no avoiding that now ) , but I do know the actual impact that the World Vision is having in nations around the world . For non-profits , producing effective online marketing material is crucial to continue reaching giving goals as traditional outlets turn digital . Luckily , they made an excellent quiz and are using it to collect email subscribers who can be turned into givers . At our last check-in this quiz had helped generate just over 200 new email addresses , nothing crazy but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross #2 <p> A few days after I took this quiz , a house less than 100 yards from mine exploded and burned down from a drug lab explosion ( I live in one of the top 10 safest places in the U.S. it was completely out of the blue ) . I followed the procedures recommended in the quiz and everyone stayed safe but it drove home just how amazing The Red Cross is . They were there on the scene of the explosion and helped neighbors find temporary housing and provided relief truly selfless behavior . <p> Until that experience I had n't  had a first-hand experience where a quiz had an impact beyond social marketing and sales , but now I have a whole new outlook on what we can do with the natural share-ability of quizzes . By combining the draw of a quiz with a serious issue like home fires , we can reach people who would never even think about picking up a Red Cross manual to read about disaster relief , we can go to where people are ( on Facebook ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone . <h> 35 . Smart Colorado <p> There is a billboard in Denver , Colorado that links to a quiz that one still takes some getting used to , its one of those moments where you are blown away a bit . Okay , now on to the real point . The quiz gives two pictures of foods that look exactly the same ( think two gummy bears side by side ) , and then asks people to identify which one has pot in it . No one knows , and has to guess . The issue is that children are being rushed to emergency rooms in droves after eating candy and food that 's been infused with pot , and that has to stop . <p> Smart Colorado made the quiz , put it on a billboard , and was covered by over 200 news outlets including The Guardian and The USA Today . <h> University Quizzes <h> 36 . UCLA <p> My alma mater was kind enough to start building quizzes with Interact before anyone thought quizzes were cool , and surprised themselves when the quizzes rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the school continue building fun quizzes , mostly based on the rich history of the school . Their quizzes show how interactive trivia can be a part of any marketing strategy , all you 've got to do is write for your audience . <h> 37 . UC Berkeley <p> What do you want to eat ? I du n no , what do you want to eat ? I du n no How often does that happen in your life ? Its a regular occurrence in mine , and one that I 'm not exceptionally fond of . Evidently students at Berkeley also have the same problem , so the school was kind enough to make a personality quiz that helps you find the best place to eat . Interestingly enough , this quiz was placed on the schools admissions blog , perhaps a fun way of recruiting new students with the most important thing college students need food . <h> 38 . Florida Gators <p> Do you know about the Gators ? Florida wants to know , and when they created this Gatorology quiz , a full 1/5 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives home my previous point , which is that you should always focus your topic on a group of people who really care , even if that group is n't massive ( in this case , 50,000 students ) . You 'll always come out ahead this way because people will actually share their results . <h> 39 . University of North Carolina <p> Remind me never to do anything dumb around college students . Recently there was a scandal uncovered at The University of North Carolina , and students were quick to satirize the situation with this quiz , which was promptly picked up and spread around over 100 other publications who helped propel the quiz to more than 10,000 views on the first day . For the original publication the quiz appeared on that was one heck of a day . <h> 40 . University of British Columbia <p> Intramural sports are a great part of college , but for many students who come in with no previous sporting experience , they can seem like something that is n't a good fit . Luckily The University of British Columbia is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a sport that fits your personality in a fun quiz format . <h> 41 . University of Illinois <p> On average , people would rather share their personal financial details than speak in public . Part of the reason for that is the lack of education around public speaking in our schools . The University of Illinois is working to change that by creating quizzes , and by all accounts its actually working . The quiz question below is an excerpt from their quiz titled " Test your public speaking skills " which is a non-invasive way for students to see what areas they need to improve on without losing their confidence . Its been taken more than 1,000 times , not bad at all for an academic piece . <h> 42 . Hotel School The Hague <p> There is a method that works in some scenarios to make people desperately want whatever you have , despite the price . This method is derived from exclusivity , where the object in question is reserved for a select few and you must qualify to be one of those select ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . This madness is what Hotel School The Hague is going after with their quiz that determines if you are even qualified to apply for the school . The quiz is a main part of the marketing material for the school and has become a big hit , driving demand higher and higher for the school . <h> 43 . Independent Art School <p> This school relies heavily on visuals ( its art , btw ) . So Facebook and Pinterest are big for promotions , but those platforms lack the ongoing engagement that email offers . To bridge the gap , Independent Art School created a quiz that could be shared on Facebook and Pinterest which also collected new email subscribers . The quiz " Which famous artist are you ? " presents a series of fun questions followed by an opportunity to opt-in to learn more about those famous artists before showing the quiz results . Its been effective , with 45% of quiz takers inputting an email address . <h> 44 . Pepperdine University <p> Where should you study abroad ? Is a question that probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other methods used to answer this question ( flipping a coin , asking a friend at a party , etc. ) its not so bad . Pepperdine used this quiz to help their students decide where to study abroad , but it also did something more meta than that . The quiz ended up with hundreds of social shares and more people took it than are enrolled at Pepperdine , which means that the quiz actually acted as a marketing tool for Pepperdine . <h> Travel Quizzes <h> 45 . Hostelworld <p> A humble travel personality quiz has reached 40,000 views , thousands of comments , and hundreds of inbound links from other sites sharing the quiz . I 'm talking about the quiz below from HostelWorld which has stood as one of the best travel quizzes weve ever seen . In comparison to other posts on the HostelWorld blog , this one got 10x more views ( based on other quizzes they made and posted on the site ) . So why did this one resonate so well ? I think it was a combination of things done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question asked is quite exciting , especially to HostelWorlds audience of folks who take travelling as a part of their lives . Second , its full of imagery and pictures that remind you of travelling , and third , the quiz results all have fun names that are worthy of sharing . <h> 46 . Afar Magazine <p> I picked this quiz for the supreme social engagement it received , despite the fact that its also used as a lead generation piece , two things that do n't  usually play well together ( in my experience ) . What I mean is that this quiz sparked social discussions , a lot of them it is one of the most commented-on Facebook posts for Afar this year , and on twitter people are having week-long discussions about their recommended destinations . <p> Also , as I mentioned before , this quiz is working to collect new email subscribers for Afar . From just over 2500 quiz views , more than 800 people signed up for the newsletter to get more travel tips and information about the destinations mentioned in the quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Healthgrades <p> Need to find a doctor ? Healthgrades can help , need to find out which TV Doctor you should have ? Use Healthgrades . This is a great example of a business that does n't  take themselves too seriously , and simultaneously provides an excellent service . After you find out which TV Doctor you should have , you get an opportunity to find a real life doctor who is in your area and highly rated . The quiz was taken over 2,000 times and shared over 500 times , creating effective engaging content . <h> 48 . APIC <p> This is one of those weird quizzes that could be a good idea , but could also be really weird and off-putting . Created by APIC ( I 'll spare you writing what that is an acronym for , its a medical group ) , this quiz aims to prevent disease by making light of the germs that can cause great harm if not treated properly . Luckily the quiz worked , and resulted in over 8,000 quiz takers and 1,200 quiz sharers who really enjoyed sharing what kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke ) . <h> 49 . Ancestralize Me <p> As a fan of trying out diets because they are fascinating , this quiz from Laura Schoenfield was eye opening . Turns out diets can actually be unhealthy if they prevent you from getting adequate nutrition , and that would be very difficult to discover with out a quiz or survey . Turns out I 'm not the only one interested in this subject , Lauras quiz was taken over 2,000 times ( more than 20x what her average post gets ) . <h> 50 . Grist.org <p> Controversy is king , especially when it comes to quizzes . Grist.org created this quiz and it quickly became one of their most commented-on ever the reason being that it really struck a nerve with a lot of people , both in positive and negative ways . Some were very happy with their quiz results while others took it way too seriously and commented angrily . Of course this create a comments war , with Grist benefiting all along as the quiz skyrocketed to 50,000 views in a week . <h> 51 . Beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RealAge sold to Hearst- - for around $100 million . The entire premise of that site was that you would answer a series of questions and find out what your real age was compared to your numbered age ( based on health factors ) . People are very keen to learn more about themselves , especially when it pertains to personal well-being , and BeautyOasis is a site that is effectively tapping into that desire . Theyve created a variety of quizzes about how old you are and each one is successful ( 1,000+ quiz takers per quiz ) . <h> 52 . Sage Research Labs <p> Sage Research does some excellent work with chemical engineering and I have great respect for them . I also have great respect for the way they 've made their business fun to deal with by using quizzes like the one below . At the end of the day people loved sharing their results on twitter , leading to more than 3,000 total quiz takers . <h> Food Quizzes <h> 53 . Red Lobster <p> Clocking in at 182,000 likes , this Red Lobster quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant chain . As part of their endless shrimp campaign , this fun personality quiz was set up and embedded into a tumblr site for The Red Lobster . The quiz anchored the Facebook campaign for the Endless Shrimp promotion , and by all metrics it was a great success , driving tens of thousands of comments and shares . <h> 54 . Food 52 <p> If you want an example of how to use quizzes as a consistent part of your content strategy and not just a one-off thing , look no further than Food52 . Every week for the last six months theyve produced another quiz that gets at least 10,000 views , with some reaching as much as 50,000 . To help simplify things , I 've identified a couple of things Food52 has done to create a sustainable strategy . <p> First , they have a set style , every quiz looks very similar and each one is 4-6 questions all text so that the person writing the quiz does n't  have to do a lot of thinking when it comes to style . <p> Second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement . The quizzes are shared on Facebook and Twitter and point traffic back to the main Food52 site , they do n't  mix it up and use some for lead generation or as assessments , every single one has the same purpose . This allows Food52 to improve their writing over time and continually produce better quizzes . <h> 55 . Dean and Deluca <p> I chose this quiz because it exemplifies the beauty of a well designed quiz . Dean &amp; Deluca sells home products that are of a finer quality and their brand reflects that . When it came time to create - a fun quiz telling people which Thanksgiving meal they should eat , the brand needed to carry through and protrude quality . The designers at Dean &amp; Deluca did an excellent job mixing fonts , colors , and images to create a beautiful quiz that represents the brand well on all social outlets . <h> 56 . Biolite Stoves <p> Biolite is one of the coolest products Ive seen around food innovation . Its a camp stove that converts Kinetic energy into electricity so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The beauty is that you can cook and charge simultaneously which not only provides a heat source but could also get you out of a jam if you need to call someone for help . Another benefit is that the stove conserves energy by using one source of energy for two things ( heat and electricity ) . <p> This is all fine and dandy , and the quiz is a big hit ( 20,000 views and counting ) , but views on their own are empty unless there 's a conversion metric . Biolite was smart to add a lead generation piece to the quiz and offer a prize to one of the people who opt in . This led to more than 1,000 new email subscribers and increased engagement in the long term . <h> 57 . Food 52 ( again ) <p> I put this brand on here twice because they invented a method that I now recommend to every single Interact user . They make food quizzes , which give you some sort of food as your result ( in this example , Cranberry Sage Pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post that has a recipe for that Pie . Because these quizzes get shared all over the place ( 75% of their traffic is from social ) , its easy for the brand to get lost which devalues the quiz as a marketing tool . However , because each quiz result links back to the Food52 domain , they are able to get traffic back to their site from social , which is genius . <h> 58 . The Micro ( Wisconsin State Fair ) <p> What 's better than the Wisconsin State Fair and craft beer ? I do n't  know actually , I 've never been to the Wisconsin State Fair so I would n't be a good judge to determine what 's better . What I do know however , is that this beer quiz was used to generate new email subscribers for the fair who got updates and discounts , helping drive foot traffic to the fair and in particular to The Micro , who was serving craft beer at the fair . <h> Quizzes embedded in Facebook tabs <h> 59 . California Recycling <p> I love that the California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as funny but amazing all at once . What 's even better is that they are using a quiz to fundamentally change our perception of recycling . When you think of recycling , you probably picture a blue bin with a recycling symbol on it ( or maybe that 's just me and I 'm weird ) . You do n't  really think of recycling as " fun " and not much as been done to change that until this quiz . That 's over dramatic , but I really do like that Cal Recycle made this quiz a semi-permanent part of their Facebook page by embedding it in a tab and displaying it for all to see . <h> 60 . Eegees <p> I chose this one for its design . Since Facebook is a new-ish platform that means its being bombarded with spam entire websites are built with viral articles with the sole intention of getting millions of Facebook shares and driving ad revenue . I 'm saying all this to point out that people are wary of Facebook stuff coming from third parties , there 's a lot of junk being spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the goal is to make it look as natural as possible and not stick out as a third party app . Eegees did this very well and the result is a great looking integration . <h> 61 . Brad Gouthro Fitness <p> One in every ten Interact customers is in the health and fitness industry , where Facebook and Instagram rule the market for posting fitness pics and nutrition advice . Brad Gouthro took advantage of his large Facebook following to gradually leverage some of those fringe followers into paying customers . He has a program called LiveLean that helps people get in shape and keep their gains . His quiz asks people how much they know about fitness , and depending on how they do , he links to his fitness program as an offer to help . <h> 62. itransition <p> Name the top 5 most fascinating things you can think of code should be on that list , but for many its not . itransition is a company that makes websites and they are using a quiz on their Facebook page to humanize the work they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each kind of code so that when clients get around to proposals and actually having their products built , they know a little something about what 's going on . Its really a smart way to make something traditionally shrouded in mystery a more manageable topic . <h> Publishers quizzes <h> 63 . Forbes <p> Google " college quiz " and the first hit is the quiz picture below . Because of the search engine ranking and the evergreen nature of the quiz , it actually gets more visits per week now than it did right after launch . This is a perfect example where a quiz has become a staple part of a website that continues to draw traffic even after the social buzz has long faded away . <p> To imitate this success , the topic of the quiz has to be one that people will care about for a long time , college is a great example of this , something like a news quiz is not . Also , realistically you do need some sort of social buzz and launch for the quiz to get backlinks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned in other places for referral traffic . <h> 64 . The Boston Globe <p> Sports ! The Boston Globe covers all things Red Sox , Patriots , Celitics , and Bruins , complete with interactive quizzes . This quiz in particular was effective because it is both simple and goofy . The editors created custom graphics for each question , and with results like " Full Head Tattoo Guy " you know people shared their results on Facebook ( at leats 535 people to be exact ) . <h> 65 . Verso Books <p> I do n't  know who Hegel or Hubbard are , maybe that makes me an idiot , maybe not . Regardless , there is a subset of people who really care about which of these authors they are . Over 700 individuals took it upon themselves to share their results on Facebook or Twitter , and proceeded to argue amongst themselves as to why they got the result they got . For a publisher like Verso Books this is awesome , people are having vibrant social conversations about educational books , imagine that . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wrote Steve Jobs biography ? He s back with a new book about Innovation , and even made a quiz for it . From Simon and Schuster , this quiz is one of our best looking ever , they did an excellent job of picking colors and images that give off a visually appealing aesthetic . What 's even better is that this quiz was used to reach people who probably would have never heard of " The Innovators " book by getting shared on Facebook and Twitter . <h> 67 . Kansas City Public Library <p> When I think of public library , I remember the smell of books and the nice old lady who would check out the books , not online quizzes . Evidently Kansas City Public Library is way ahead of my vision , for the last few months theyve featured quizzes on the home page of their website . The quizzes are successful to , averaging about 8,000 views apiece . But that 's not just for bragging rights , the quizzes are used to recommend books to kids who need to read more . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation and a link to reserve it right online. - <h> 68 . TED <p> Imagine you are watching a TED talk about introversion ( one of their best ) and as an aside you see the quiz pictured below . Of course you want to find out how introverted you are , you are watching a talk about introversion , so you click on the quiz . At the end of the quiz you are prompted to enter an email address if you 'd like to receive more talks similar to this introversion one that sounds pretty cool , what the hell , why not . <p> That scenario is exactly what TED envisioned with their introversion quiz , and it works , this quiz continues to drive new email subscribers who support TED talks to this day . <h> Entertainment Quizzes <h> 69 . Grand Theft Auto <p> Do n't  know what it says , but do know it was created by Rockstar Games , the company behind Grand Theft Auto . Quizzes are similar to games and can be used to market games . <h> 70 . Smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trivia quiz . Theyve done like 15 quizzes and every single one gets hundreds of shares and comments , creating extremely effective online content to compliment the on-air radio shows produced by Smooth Radio . Here are just a few examples of the types of quizzes they have success with . <p> -Weekly news quizzes <p> -Pick a famous artist and do a trivia quiz <p> -Compare two artists using a trivia quiz <h> 71 . Warrior Lodge <p> If this quiz were in high school , it would win " best dressed " Warrior Lodge did an excellent job picking out vibrant images that make you feel as if you are part of the action when taking this WW2 trivia quiz . While great design alone does n't  make or break a quiz , it certainly helps , and I would definitely recommend getting a designer involved if you plan on investing heavily in your quizzes ( which you should <h> 72 . Wayfm <p> How do radio stations do marketing ? There 's so much content from so many different sources , it seems almost impossible to distill it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good solution , which is to create quizzes about particular bands that are part of the stations normal lineup . The one below is for Casting Crowns , one of the most popular christian bands , and it links to the stations online stream to listen for the song you get recommended to come on . <h> 73 . When I work <p> While I do n't  normally recommend quizzes " just for fun " this one was appropriate in November , when many companies participated in Movember. <h> 74 . Warrior Lodge ( again ) <p> I put Warrior Lodge on this list twice for a good reason its one of the top posts on the site of all time . Why ? I could n't exactly tell you , but I would guess it has something to do with the mix of special forces material and celebrity draw . <h> 75 . Kingdom Rush <p> So quizzes can be used to run contests . First , you make a quiz that rock on its own , second you use the email capture feature of Interact quizzes to collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be entered in your contest , third , give something away to one of those people who entered . Its subtly genius because you have the engagement of a quiz on its own , but then you tie that to a contest which also gets you longer term email subscribers . <h> 76 . StyleCraze <p> Back before quizzes were cool , StyleCraze discovered the draw that celebrities can bring to quizzes by simply creating a " Which celebrity are you ? " quiz that attracted more than 50,000 views . I 've written extensively about how to integrate celebrities into your quiz strategy , but the gist of it is that we all see celebrities so having them in your quiz makes it relatable. <h> 77 . The Daily Sheeple <p> Sometimes a freelancer really nails it and creates a post that gets circulated all over the place . That 's what happened with Daisy Luther and her SHTF quiz . After creating it for one client , it was then reposted on more than 50 other sites pointing massive links and traffic back to her client , who I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing an audience , Daisy knew that there is an entire subculture of people that exist who live off of doomsday theories . Her quiz is built just for those people and only for those people , which is why it was able to be spread to so many sites that focus on that subject . <h> 78 . Harrys <p> This is an excellent way to monetize a website sponsored content that is quite literally more popular than a lot of the non-sponsored content on the same site . Pixable created this mustache quiz as part of a promotion for shaving brand Harrys , and it ended up getting several thousand visits and being shared like any other post . The beauty of this quiz is that it creates a full experience for you and only hints at the sponsoring brand ( although you sure are n't  going to forget its there ) . I really like this , its a way of advertising that is neither intrusive nor disrupting yet effective . <h> 79 . Boston Ballet <p> I 've seen this type of quiz done a few times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea is that you make a quiz about a physical play ( they still do those , you know ) , and then offer a link to buy tickets at the end . This one pictured below ended up getting shared a few hundred times driving around 2,000 views and some strong sales originating from social media . <h> Car Quizzes <h> 80 . AICA <p> Whenever I need an example of a quiz that shows you can have a successful quiz about literally almost anything , I come back to this trucking piece . Created by Americas Independent Truckerss Association , the quiz has been taken over 20,000 times . Its built for big rig truckers , of which there are only 3.5 million , that 's not a bad ratio . <h> Real Estate Quizzes <h> 81 . Century 21 <p> Real Estate on social seems like a tough thing to do . Were talking about making a purchase you 'll spend 15 or 30 years paying off , and you make a decision about it based on a Facebook post ? Probably not or maybe you would , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups standpoint , social media can be used to make sure your firm is on the top of peoples minds when it does come time to make a home purchase . <p> That 's what Century 21 did with their Home Critic quiz , it asks if you 'd like to discover " Which home critic are you ? " The quiz is a simple four-question test with lots of pictures , nothing fancy or heavy . Its a simple engagement tool used on a landing page created with Kickoff Pages- and worked into the social marketing strategy for C21. <h> 82 . MatchLiving <h> 83 . RealSavvy <h> Sports Quizzes <h> 84 . Boston.com <h> 85 . Mystery Tackle Box <p> Fishing is the most under-rated sport . Its not dangerous , excellent fun , and can be done pretty much anywhere ( I promise I 'm not being sponsored by a fishing company ) . Mystery Tackle Box is a company that effectively created a " box of the month " deal for fishing . Part of their social strategy is quizzes , for which they used Interact . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , and each one did well , one quiz collected over 500 new email subscribers , another was shared more than 1,000 times , another led to 50 new free trial signups. <h> 86 . MarsReel <h> 87 . Trainer-Baade <p> I will admit that being an American with less knowledge of the world than I should have , I did n't  really know the concept of the pub quiz until after starting Interact . I am now enlightened , and thanks to partners like Trainer Baade in Germany , Pub Quizzes are now being put online for everyone to try ( after the event of course ) . This one in particular impresses me because its 40 questions long , and yet over 3,000 people completed it and commented with their results . Frank ( the editor ) even emailed me to say how much of a positive response he got . <h> 88 . Balls <h> Viral News Quizzes <h> 89 . Beliefnet <p> This quiz hit 100,000 views in literally three days , it was ridiculous . The biggest thing here is the full language immersion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95 countries ) , so no matter what language your audience speaks , you can reach them . <h> 90 . Eldeforma <p> here 's a prime example of sustainable quiz use on a website . Eldeforma is based out of Mexico and uses the international feature of Interact quizzes to make content about local politics , technology , and a variety of topics . They are what I 'd call " news chasers " which is when you create quizzes as the news unfolds . These quizzes do n't  have the same lasting effect as a quiz that 's evergreen , but for a site that drives traffic primarily from social media its a strong method for continually creating quizzes . <h> 91 . QuizCrunch <p> Quizcrunch.com is a quiz website built entirely with Interact quizzes , but you would n't know that unless you looked at the source code of the site . Its entirely possible to create a site full of quizzes , run ads on it and build an entire online presence by white labeling Interact quizzes , and we are elated to support that . Quizcrunch is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one with the best name ) . While creating a quiz website is probably not on the docket for most marketers , Quizcrunch shows that Interact quizzes do n't  detract from your brand at all or drive traffic away from your site , which is vital when every click could be a new customer for your business . <h> Political Quizzes <h> 92 . Gcorr <p> Relations with Native Americans is always a touchy subject . Whether its the Washington Redskins and their refusal to pick a more culturally acceptable name or the latest revelation of corruption on Native American Land , something is always amiss . The Methodist Church decided to get involved and see if people really know what 's going on with Native Americans using a quiz . Its both fun and eye opening , which is part of the reason for its success , becoming one of the Churches most popular social posts ever . <h> 93 . Tea Party Express <p> Hollywood + politics , what could go wrong ? Probably a lot actually . Fortunately that was n't the case for Tea Party Express , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opt-ins via the built-in lead generation . <p> After you answer the quiz questions ( there are 8 ) , there is an opt-in form to receive optional updates from the Tea Party Express . At this point they 've made a pretty good case for opting in with their goofy quiz , I mean , who does n't  want to know with far-right celebrity they are ? <p> Then you get your results , which are the picture of share-ability . Youve got a great picture that stares into your soul , and a flattering explanation that makes you sound like the savior of our broken world . What this led to is nearly one in four quiz takers sharing their results , the entire reason this quiz got so much traction . <h> 94 . McDonnell Trial <p> A no-name site built a quiz that was tweeted out by Rachel Maddow and more than 100 prominent reporters and journalists as well as links from The Washington Post and The New York Times . All they had to do was make a satirical quiz about a buzzing trial over corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trial revolving around the Governor of Virginia and was viewed nearly 20,000 times in one day . <p> This takes us to our next point using popular stories to get your quiz noticed . This example shows that you do n't  need any " brand recognition " to make a hit quiz using this strategy . <h> Intra-company quizzes <h> 95 . McKinsey <p> 17,000 people work at McKinesy &amp; Company , its a global organization with more than 107 offices . Its so big that the company has internal publications with a thriving readership just from their own employees . The main publication is called McKinsey Insights , and is sent out quarterly to all employees . As a game/engagement tool , McKinsey created a quiz to see if people really know about the publication . <p> This is a prime example of using what works for marketing in the outside world on your own company and employees to delight them . When you are as big as McKinsey , keeping employees engaged is crucial , and quizzes can be used for that . <h> 96 . Ericsson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interact as an internal tool . here 's the way I see it at a certain point in your company ( Ericsson middle europe has 5,000 employees ) , you have to start marketing to your own employees to keep them engaged and effective . One of the ways Ericsson does this is to hold conferences where large groups of employees come for education and fun , think of it like a carnival for adults who work in cubicles . <p> As part of the run-up for this years conference , Ericsson created the quiz below that not only helps people find out which part of the conference would interest them the most , but also was used to create custom badges and prizes for each employee based on their personality type . The quiz was a hit , and out of 5,000 employees , nearly 3,000 took the quiz . <h> 97 . The BakerySF <p> Sometimes I come across a site that uses an Interact quiz as a big portion of what is presented , and when its done right , that 's a beautiful thing . One such site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who share ideas . They use a quiz to help you find out how you might fit into the group before applying for membership . Its pretty cool , and a fun quiz , and adds to the appeal of the group . <h> 98 . ZTA <p> Fraternities and sororities have vast networks of alumni and active members . The more connected and engaged those members are , the stronger the organization becomes , and the more people donate . When Zeta Tau Alpha created this founders quiz , it immediately resonated with members , more than 12,000 took it and 3,000 shared their results in some form on Facebook and Twitter . <h> 99 . Oregon Cultural Trust <p> Every once in a while you create an asset that lives on long after its initial popularity . Weeks , months , or years later people still share it and link to it , helping to build your brand in the long run . This quiz from Oregon Cultural Trust is one of those posts . Yes , it was popular when first released , getting shared a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting is the weeks and months after the launch when it continued to get shared several times each week and brought inbound links from related sites . <p> One pain point I know content producers face is the ability to produce pieces that continue to bring in traffic after the initial spike , and with a well put together quiz , this is entirely possible . <h> 100 . Zagat <p> Combining the power of ratings and personal preference is a strong combination . Zagat is the original ratings company when it comes to all things food , and they are using their vast knowledge base to create fun quizzes like the pizza one below . While this does n't  exactly fit into the " made for employees " category , its a great quiz that could be taken by employees . <p> At the end of the quiz you get a result along with a link to check out the pizza place that 's been recommended for you , driving traffic to internal pages on the Zagat site from social sites where the quiz get shared and draws in new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you . My goal with this post was to pull in examples from all sorts of industries so that no matter what you do in your marketing job there would be something you could reference to get started . The hardest part of implementing quizzes is knowing what to do , you are already good at writing and creating visually appealing content , the missing piece is how to actually use the quizzes .

Of course some places are cheaper and closer than others , but the fact of the matter is that you could visit anywhere in the world with about a day of travel . That 's pretty spectacular . <p> I 'm a huge travel buff , and love going near and far to get my fix of different places and cultures . I just wrapped up planning my honeymoon that is slated for the summer , and right when I started thinking of where I might want to go I was bombarded with far too many places to try to slim down . I figured there are so many different places in the world with completely different experiences , how could you find out where you might want to go if you 're open to almost anything ? <p> A quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of a travel company this could lead your next client booking a destination with you that they have been suggested to visit through this quiz . Well , how do you go about making a quiz such as this and what kind of questions could you ask ? <p> To make a quiz like the one talked about in this article , head to tryinteract.com <p> If we 're going to go about this in the right way , our goal should be to match the personality of the quiz taker to a destination . We basically want to assign a few destinations to a certain personality , and then in turn write out a few questions that can make a general statement about our user to properly match them up . Another great idea is matching an action with a location , such as eat you way through Parisian cuisine ! ' or ride elephants through the jungles of Thailand ' to make the result a bit more intriguing . <p> So we need to make some classic personality question examples , but also add a travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are five different questions I came up with that match these criteria , and we 'll talk about their different answers you can choose from below . But first , take the quiz for yourself and see where you should travel ! <p> Let 's talk about some creative answers we can come up with through these questions . <p> In number one , this is a pretty straightforward question and can give us a large insight into what this person might want to do . Some good base answers might be sitting on the beach , hiking , eating , having a full night 's sleep or adventuring . Each of these answers gives a pretty straightforward description that could run through the users head , and I would say it 's pretty easy to just pick one . But just stating those answers might not be the most interesting way to answer the question , so let 's tag these answers with a bit of a unique travel twist . Here are the answers I came up with : <p> -Ive always wanted to ride an elephant -Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -Throw me in the water with the sea life ! -When 's lunch ? Dinner ? I want the local eats . <p> Each of these answers gives a little different unique perspective , and they are n't just a boring I like eating ' or I like snorkeling . ' They show a bit more personality than that , which is definitely a good thing . <p> Question number two , ah yes the simple one asking for a favorite color . Why should we ask this ? Well the goal here is to see if we can relate it to a certain area or activity . So we could relate blue back to the ocean , or green to the jungle or forest , orange or yellow to the beach and red to some festive food . This is one of those classic personality quiz questions , but we 're actually going to add some text on top of it to further help our readers pinpoint what they should answer . <p> -Blue like the deep blue sea -Green as the trees , please -The sun is yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different statements call for an answer to the original question , but ask it in a bit more of a creative way that actually might sway our readers to help us out a little bit in deciding what we should pair each answer to . <p> QUESTION SS <p> Question number three , the hometown information . We could take a couple of different approaches to this question , but I 'm thinking we want to learn more about what this person likes to do and help match that to what they may like while traveling . <p> -Right in the water surfing ! -At my local coffee shop with a great book -Up in the hills on a relaxing hike - Cozied up at home watching my favorite TV show <p> Each of these answers describes a specific action , and the taker of the quiz should n't have a tough time figuring out which one they would want to be doing the most at home . This allows us to gain some key info on their personality that will help us match with a travel location . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of day . I wo n't lie , this is a tough one to try to nail down . Basically the goal here is to create four different scenarios to match four different personalities , yet make it short and concise . Here 's what I came up with when I took a shot at it . <p> Each of these items can give us yet another clue into the individual 's personality , and mainly what type of traveler they may be . This could help us opt someone as more of an outdoorsy and go-get-it type , or someone that might stick around the grounds of the hotel and relax type . This is definitely information we 'll want if we 're looking to match them up with a location and an activity . <p> And finally question number five , asking us about food . This could be a no brainer to what location we would pin him or her , so here are some easy answers . <p> I feel like I do n't quite need to get into which destinations each of these foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll let you figure that out . <p> Alright so we have the questions nailed down , but what are our four destinations you can get ? Let 's break down the four different personality types we are getting from the quiz and match them to a location . <p> For the adventurer " Thailand . There is plenty to do here when it comes to the outdoors , including riding elephants , kayak rides on the ocean or in the rivers , or beautiful hikes to local peaks . Thailand is a fantastic country to visit for the adventure type . <p> The culinary explorer " Japan . Alright , so you may have thought I through a curveball there , should n't we be talking Europe if we 're going with food ? Well my locations this time around are leaning towards Asia a bit , and Japan has wonderful cuisine that is unique from sea life all the way to delicious BBQ . Many different cities in the country offer a wide variety of food , which is why I have no issues with suggesting that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hawaii . Yup , pretty self explanatory . If you 're looking to hang with yourself or your significant other and just chill by the beach with not much to do , then Hawaii is your go to place . Now do n't get me wrong , there exists plenty of adventure on the island , but it is quite the destination for just posting up and taking it easy . <p> And finally for the quieter traveler " Sweden . Yup , this one might be a curveball to you , but Sweden offers some unbelievably pleasant cities with amazing atmospheres . Delicious food , massive public parks and incredible coffee leads me to believe that Sweden might be one of the most peaceful and relaxing places I 've ever visited . I would easily recommend it to anyone looking to try get away from his or her life a bit and find your niche coffee shop or park bench by the lake to relax and breathe easy . <p> So what we 've done is nailed down a personality that can be discovered with just five easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they follow suit . This was an incredibly easy quiz to make , and could be really useful to find out where someone might want to go based on what interests them . We could also easily follow up with them with more information on their destination , especially if we collected their email at the end of the quiz . <p> Using quizzes on a travel site creates a fun , engaging way for us to give advice to a user in a no pressure way .

Not going to lie , I was pretty surprised that Drupal came in third behind just WordPress and Joomla . I had never worked with Drupal before and attempted to set up a domain and install it in order to make a guide on how to add a quiz . <p> I failed pretty hard , and after a couple of hours gave up and emailed and emailed one of our customers- Touchstone Energy Cooperatives . Their senior web developer , Sean , was kind enough to put together a guide on how they managed to put a very nice looking quiz into their Drupal site for an upcoming event . <p> Ill let him take it from here . <p> Drupal Instructions : <p> 1 . First , find the page you need to edit/insert the quiz . <p> 2 . Do this by accessing the Content ' area of your administrative toolbar in Drupal . <p> 3 . Next , find the Title of your page in which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' link . <p> 4 . Or you can simply navigate to the page in question and click on the Admin Edit/Content ' link to edit the page you are on . <p> 5 . Click on the Source ' button in your WYSIWYG editor toolbar to access the direct HTML source of the page . <p> 6 . Paste the embed code from interact directly in the Body of your editor . <p> 7 . Make sure to save your changes at the very bottom left of your editor page . <p> 8 . With the default settings of 800 pixels wide and 600 pixels tall , the quiz will initially look like this . <p> Optional Instructions : <p> 9 . If you need the quiz to span the whole width of your page , you can edit the source code little bit to make it wider/taller . <p> 10 . Go back into your page editor and adjust the width and height to something more appropriate . <p> a . In this case , the width of our main container was about 1000 pixels wide , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate new embed code on the interact website . <p> b . In order to compensate for the width adjustment , you may want to increase the height as well to ensure the scrollbars do not show up . <p> Note : - This may make the quiz much larger than you initially wanted . <p> c . I had to make the height 1000 pixels in order to not see the scrollbars ( maybe longer depending on your quiz ) . <p> d . In order to make the quiz smaller but still keep the scrollbars inactive , you would have to add or adjust the iframe CSS rules on your site to utilize transform properties . <p> e . You could potentially make the quiz fit into any container by altering the transform property to any size you like . In this case , I 've made it only 75% of the 1000+1000 pixel dimensions specified in the iframe , so it has some padding and fills out the page nicely without scrollbars being present . <p> So that 's how you put a quiz in your drupal site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other CMS options , but its not too bad , especially with this excellent guide that goes step-by-step.

How to Generate Leads Using Quizzes. - Click here to claim your spot Music-focused websites are like fresh air in an internet full of smog . They bring beautiful creations of sound to the forefront while educating and inspiring people . Music is a naturally enjoyable art , so it makes sense to integrate quizzes ( in my opinion the most enjoyable form of content ) , into the picture . <p> First , let 's classify what I 'm talking about when I say " music website . " This could really mean anything from an artists website to a concert promotion site to a music history content site . The only requirement is that the entire website is dedicated to the art of music . <p> Now , on to what this article is . Its a set of best practices for how to build and implement your music quiz so as to maximize the success of your quizzes . <h> Part 1 : Constructing a great music quiz <p> The main thing that sets great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey a sense of voice into the quiz . Its one thing to come up with a series of questions and make a quiz out of them , but its another thing entirely to make that series of questions into its own entertainment module . Let 's take a look at each element of a music quiz and learn from the best on how to optimize . <p> A full 80% of people will take one look at your quiz title and immediately decide if they want to commit their time to taking your quiz instead of reading that article about Justin Biebers latest antics . We 've compiled a short list of title suggestions that almost always perform well for music quizzes . <p> 1 . Are you a ? <p> ( see example above ) . This type of quiz is a knowledge test , which could be anything from quizzing people about their knowledge of your concert festival to seeing if they understand the intricacies of Baroque style music . For extra controversy points , add the word " really " to the title " Are you really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more in-your-face . <p> 2 . How much do you actually know about ? <p> Again , a knowledge test . These work well for music because there 's so much history and really interesting facts in the music world . All you have to do for this type of quiz is compile interesting facts about your particular area of focus and make quiz questions about them . <p> 3 . Which ( blank ) are you ? " <p> The classic personality quiz . You can insert pretty much anything into the ( blank ) space . " Which song are you ? " " Which rapper are you ? " are just a few we 've seen . This one tends to perform really well on social media as people can share their personality result with fun captions . <p> Creating quiz questions <p> The questions of your quiz are what set it apart from every other piece of content you 'll ever create . In the questions you 'll have the chance to speak directly with each person who takes your quiz in a one-on-one format instead of the broadcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it gives you a chance to build a relationship with your web visitors in a much more personal way than you are used to . <p> However , this opportunity can easily be squandered if your quiz questions are bland and boring . Here are some themes we 've seen to work really well when writing quiz questions . <p> Be yourself . - We have a tendency to formalize our online communication because of how many people might read what we write , but remember that quizzes are always going to be one-on-one no matter how many individuals take the quiz . If you need a little help being informal , author Ernest Hemingway said " Write drunk , edit sober " from which we derived the tipsy college student rule , which says you should write like the tipsy college student version of yourself ( you know you have one of those ) . <p> Let the people speak. - <p> The whole point of quiz questions is to let your visitors express themselves . In a study conducted by Time Magazine , it was found that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ourselves , its just natural that 's why your quiz questions should be short and allow people to answer the way they like without having to wade through your long-winded question . <p> Keep your questions short ( less than 100 characters is best ) and your quiz will be more well received . <p> Collecting email addresses <p> Quizzes can be a very effective method for collecting new email subscribers who can be nurtured into regular readers or paying customers ( if you have a music product to sell ) . Again , this is a big opportunity that must be handled carefully to maximize your results . <p> Quizzes use a method known as gated content , which means that the email address collection happens after the quiz questions and before the quiz results . Setting it up this way has boosted the average lead collection quiz to a 50% conversion rate ( half of people put in an email ) . <p> This method is effective because there is a built-in incentive to put in your email address ( you want to see your quiz result ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build in a secondary reward to maximize the emails collected . The example above from Baroque.org is doing a giveaway for all its new subscribers , others have offered discounts or given away digital products . <p> Crafting quiz results <p> After a person has decided to click on your quiz title , answered all the questions , and maybe even giving you their email address , its time for you to hold up your end of the bargain and provide a satisfying and entertaining quiz result . <p> On average , people spend three minutes answering quiz questions , so making your quiz results live up to expectations is a must if you want people to share your quiz . <p> The best quiz results do a few things very well , here 's what they are . <p> Be uplifting. - We ran a test of all the social shares that originated from quiz results and found that 75% of them were positive in tone ( meaning that they contained certain " positive " words like " great , awesome , excellent , etc . " ) One way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple ) of very good things about the quiz result you are displaying and just focus on that . <p> For example , if you tell someone they are most like rap music , then focus on how clever rap lyrics can be and how well they flow and ignore the the more negative connotations of rap music . <p> Be honest. - While its okay to skirt around the negative parts of a quiz result , you never want to just tell people they are great in quiz results without actual reasons to back it up . Quiz takers know when you are lying , and it does n't  end well . <p> Remember a quiz is meant to entertain. - Quiz results should follow the Shaq rule for social media ( NBA superstar Shaquille Oneal ) His rule is that 85% of everything he shares should be to make people laugh , 10% should be to inform or teach , and only 5% should be to sell . <p> This is a great ratio for quizzes in general , and specifically quiz results . <p> Have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content , an embedded song that matches your result , or a coupon link that can be used to buy a product , have some sort of follow-up in each quiz result . <p> Because each person gets a unique result that applies to their specific situation , this is the perfect opportunity to offer up something more , and since you have a very captive audience ( who wants to know why they got the result they got ) , this is a great place to offer more content . <h> Part 2 : Sharing and embedding <p> What 's the one worst thing that can happen to someone who visits your website ? They leave , that 's the worst thing . How crazy is it that some quiz builders force people to leave and take a quiz ? We do n't  even touch that here at Interact . <p> Weve come up with a system that I call the " closed loop " system , because your visitors are in a closed loop that always points back to your website . There 's a nice picture below that shows how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thisCreate a quiz and embed it on your site ( guide for embedding ) , the share that quiz out on social networks with all the social shares pointing back to your website , then when other people take your quiz and share their results , their social shares will also point back to your site where the quiz is embedded . <p> Now you 're thinking " great , that quiz about skin care looks really nice , but how do I share my quiz so it looks good on Facebook and Twitter ? " On that front I have good news and bad news for you . Good news you can share your quiz to look just like that example , bad news , sometimes it has to be done manually . <p> On Facebook : To get your quiz to show up like that example above you can do one of two things . If you have the quiz embedded on your site , just share the url of that page on your site , and Facebook should automatically pull the image and display it . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image ( or makes the image super small ) . In that case , you 'll have to share an image , and - in the description of the image share the url of the quiz . <p> On Twitter : Same story here , you can share the results of your quiz ( if you take it and click the " share on twitter " button at the end ) , but there wont be an image with the tweet , and tweets with image get 18% more clicks on average . To share the quiz with an image , grab the url ( where its embedded on your site ) and share it with a clever slogan and a picture ( note that at this point so many quizzes get shared that its not good enough just to share the name of the quiz I.E. do n't  share " How much do you know about Mozart ? " instead share " think you know about the greatest musician of all time ? think again " something like that ) . 
@@22713607 @2713607/ <h> 7 Awesomely Creative Ways to Use Quizzes on Your Website <p> So there 's this super awesome tool called Interact where you can make quizzes of all types . Youve signed up , and now you can make all kinds of quizzes of your own , but now what ? What quizzes should I make ? To help answer that question , here are some great ideas and examples of how they were used effectively . <p> 1 . Offer your assessment . There are a lot of pressing questions in life " What Kind of Coffee Should I Drink ? " " What Kind of Tea Should I Drink ? " ( if you had n't  noticed , I need caffeine right now ) . But seriously , there are questions that you can answer as an expert in your field and a quiz is the perfect medium to answer those questions . Create a short assessment that check knowledge of your area of expertise and offer some sort of follow-up at the end to build a longer lasting relationship . <p> 2 . Current event challenge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and VotoLatino created this super awesome quiz to see how much you know about it . The beauty with current event quizzes is that there are always more current events . Other good examples Ive seen have involved Crimea when that whole ordeal was going down and the Olympics last winter . <p> 3 . Industry-specific personality quiz . I love this example from FuelPlus , they created a quiz " Which Protein Shake are You ? " which is not only hilarious , but also an awesome idea . The personality quiz has been around forever , and its super addicting , but when you go and apply a personality quiz to your own industry , that 's pure genius . <p> 4 . Practice Test . The quiz that exemplifies this best is one that recently got amazingly popular " Could You Pass the U.S. Citizenship Test ? " which , sadly a lot of Americans could n't . Notre Dame recently created a quiz testing people on their knowledge of Catholicism ( fitting for a catholic school ) . When done right , tests like these are a challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should probably be able to do well on the quiz I might be surprised by my result . <p> 5 . Book/movie/event trivia . There 's always hype around the release of new movies and events the promoters spend hundreds of millions of dollars to make sure of that . Some of the best ones we 've seen have centered around large events testing knowledge of acts and such . In the days and weeks leading up to the release of a big entertainment form , people are looking for information on the event and will be overjoyed to have a quiz to pass the time . <p> 6 . Introspection quiz . Let 's get deep for a minute The inward-looking quiz can get super popular and help you learn a lot about your website visitors . One of the most popular consistently , which is available as a template here , is the " How Intuitive are You ? " quiz . Something about quizzes like these really gets to us , probably because we are all secret narcissists . <p> 7. - The **38;69;TOOLONG quiz .

They sell high-priced , high-powered software , but did n't  take themselves too seriously to build a fun quiz with potential and current customers .

@@22713609 @2713609/ <h> How to make a celebrity personality quiz <p> A quiz popped up on Yahoo the other day that I thought was so clever . It was " Which celebrity said this ? " and it was entertaining , shocking , and weird all at the same time . I work with quizzes all day , so normally am not that impressed by anything , but this one was just so cool that I could n't resist taking it , and that reminded me of the draw that celebrity quizzes have . <p> Back a few months ago we did a study to find out if celebrity quizzes were statistically more popular than non-celebrity quizzes , and they are , by a large margin . Now there could be a lot of reasons for this , but in general if you are bringing in famous people that makes your quiz much more relatable and that 's what 's important in the end . <p> However , the question becomes , how do you make a celebrity personality quiz that does n't  suck ? Its much easier said than done , trust me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that can act as a template to your quiz . <h> 1 . The cover <p> Celebrity covers are pretty easy because you can just use pictures of celebrities , but let 's go over the basics here . <p> 1 . The title . Basically just say " Which celebrity ( blank ) are you ? " you can replace the blank with pretty much anything . " Which celebrity is your soulmate ? " " Which celebritys style should you have ? " " Which celebritys decorating style should you have ? " ( for a decorating business ) . This title works well pretty much every time , so just use it . <p> 2 . A great cover photo . We actually did a study- - and found that people tend to click on pictures of one person who is smiling ( pictures of women slightly out-performed men ) . Make sure you have a nice high quality picture of a celebrity ( and be sure to acquire the rights to it as well ) . <p> 3 . Short description and button . The goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established with the quiz title as far as building up anticipation for the quiz itself . So if your title is " which celebrity are you ? " the short description should be something like " think you know ? well you do n't  but its imperative that you find out . " <p> 4 . Your logo . This just adds to people trusting/recognizing your brand . Quizzes get shared on social sites ( over 75% of overall traffic comes from social ) . So when that happens your logo will help spread the word about your brand . <h> 2 . The questions <p> 1 . Writing the questions . Writing quiz questions should be like talking to a friend at the pub . The questions should be natural , perhaps a bit overly personal , and fun . If you find yourself getting bored by the questions , you can be sure that others will find them boring . If you are wondering , go with the more edgy option . <p> 2 . Answer images . Put images on your answer . Answers with images are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly get , and that 's the ultimate goal . Pick good images that actually fit in the space and look nice . The top 100 interact quizzes of all time have at least one image question ( every single one has at least one ) . <p> 2.5 . Answer text . Same drill as the questions . Keep it short , use your personality , be nice . <h> 3 . Collect information <p> We could all use more subscribers , a healthy email list can propel your marketing efforts and virtually guarantee that you have an audience for new content . I wont talk your ear off about the importance of a list , you probably already know about that , but I will go over the best practices for collecting new email subscribers through your quiz . <p> 1 . Your logo . This is automatically placed here when you upload a logo for your quiz . Make sure you use a nice clean logo , not pixelate or weird version . Remember that you are asking people to turn over their personal information , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for information . When it comes to lead generation , honesty is by far the best policy . You should tell people exactly how often you will be sending emails and exactly what you will be sending . This example could be improved if Unidays had also included some sort of incentive for subscribing , like a discount or promotional offer . <p> 3 . Privacy policy link . Yes , its not on this example , but its important to include a link to your privacy policy so people can read through your terms if they wish . <h> 4 . The Results <p> Everything else leads up to the quiz results ( that 's not a metaphor , it actually all does ) . But figuratively , quiz results are where you get an opportunity to have people share your quiz and amplify its reach on social media . If you do it right , we 've seen up to 20% of quiz takers share their results , which is impressive , so listen up . <p> 1 . The title . A lot of times with celebrity quizzes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can add some flowery words but that 's not necessary . When people share their quiz results it will look like " I got ( my result ) ( title of the quiz ) " so the result title is in there . <p> 2 . Big ol picture . I mean , just look at that mug of Kanye West , how could you not share your results after seeing that ? But really , this picture is important , so follow the size guidelines on that . <p> 3 . Result description . Be nice , but not cheesy . People tend to share their results more when they are complimented , but if you just lie to everyone that does n't  help at all and actually decreases sharing . <p> 4 . Share buttons . Obviously you need these , you can customize the text that says " share your results " if you 'd like as well . <h> 5 . Follow up <p> 1 . Send thank you emails . If you collect email addresses , people expect to get a welcome email almost immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending this extra email in addition to your weekly email , its more weird if you do n't  send a confirmation than if you do . <p> 2 . Share the quiz again . There are a lot of good reasons for sharing content more than once. - What it boils down to is that social networks have restricted how many people will see each of your posts , so sharing multiple times will reach more people without really bothering anyone .

@@22713613 @2713613/ <h> How To Grow Your Email List Using Quizzes <p> A common issue that companies struggle with today is outreach . You can have the greatest product in the world with a solid build but if you ca n't get people to buy it , then what 's the point ? As a starting point , companies most always have to use a wide variety of outreach practices in order to gain eyes and users . This takes a lot of work , and obtaining users is n't magic . <p> One of these outreach strategies that we have found to be incredibly effective and have based our whole company on is quizzes . Yes , it might seem like something you would n't imagine working to gain users , but it actually does . We have some incredible data from some solid companies who have been able to collect thousands of emails by using quizzes . <p> Basically how this works is that you write up a quiz to put on your website and before the user who is taking the quiz is able to see the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our service there is an option to skip over this and not give your email , but we find that about 50% of people who complete the quiz input their email . <h> To make a quiz like the ones talked about in this article , go to tryinteract.com <p> Below is a single quiz from AFAR that gained them almost 6,000 leads . It is really well written and fun to take , while also keeping you engage to ensure that you finish the quiz . I love using this as an example for companies that are looking for help in how to create a great quiz . <p> Now this is just a single quiz , but it is definitely a success story on using the interests of your audience to make a fun quiz that people will take and complete . AFAR is a travel magazine that also runs a great website talking about different areas of the world , and how to travel well . When they asked their users Where Should You Go In 2015 , it rang a bell with a lot of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 20,000 views to the quiz , 13,534 people completed it and 5,826 people entered their email at the end . That 's a whole lot of emails that would n't have been added to their email list without the quiz ! Below is a data chart that visualizes these numbers a bit , with the darkest blue representing leads obtained with completions and views being the other two lighter blue circles respectively . <p> Being able to boast numbers like this is quite impressive , and just learning how much they were able to grow their mailing list is pretty great . <h> Why is this better ? <p> The one thing that quizzes do that you ca n't quite recreate in other forms of outreach is the ability to have a conversation . When you think about it , in a quiz like the one Afar made , what really is going on is a conversation between the content creator for Afar and the user . They 're asking a series of questions to give out advice , and it feels customized and personable . The taker of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response from someone who is more knowledgeable of the content then they are . <p> This overall creates a better circumstance for a visitor of the site to willingly input their email . Through the quiz a sense of trust is established , and that allows the user to feel more comfortable giving their email to see their result . If you 're comparing this to an article without a quiz , it most obviously works better because the chances of a user giving their email just by reading an article is much less likely . <h> What do I get if I 'm the company making the quiz ? <p> Well first if you choose the route of collecting emails , that is obviously a point of interest from the standpoint of being the creator of the quiz . But along with that , the data that you receive is another great asset to using quizzes on your site . You 're able to see how every taker answers each question , which result the most people get , and any information you ask for at the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emails of whoever decides to type in their email at the end of the quiz . But putting that aside , you really do get an interesting look into the users of your site by being able to see all the data from start to finish on the quiz . <p> If you curate your quiz in a manner of seeking specific information through questions , you can really craft them to give their own give specific data that you want , instead of just the results of the quiz . This is another unique ability that quizzes give you that would not exist in other areas of outreach . <h> Best practices for making a quiz <p> So what kind of guidelines can we use for making great quizzes ? As I mentioned above , you want to imagine that you are having a conversation with whoever might be taking your quiz . If you have this in mind , it will help you curate questions and responses that would be similar to if you were actually talking to someone . This helps create a humaness ' aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quiz to be smoother . To wrap this point up , when you 're formulating a quiz build it like you 're having a conversation . <p> Afar was able to do a lot of things right in their quiz , which attributed to their success . They made each response to the questions an image , and had six different options for every question . Not only does this give them a wide variety of data points to choose from , but it also creates visual consistency across the entire quiz . With these questions they also get even more information about that particular user because of the way they answered each individual question . They can also compare this to the final results to see how they were able to match up answers to results and if they felt they were being accurate . <p> Another thing I believe they decided to do right was the amount of questions they asked . Their total was seven questions , which fits right in the area of enough to get plenty of data to formulate a result , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of asking too many questions and not finish the quiz . <p> You could go back and forth on how many questions to ask given the nature of certain quizzes , but overall I prefer to keep them shorter than 8 questions unless it 's more of a trivia like quiz . With this many questions , most users will see that as standard and will not hesitate to finish . <p> Following a lot of the tips in this article will ensure that you are creating great quizzes for your website and have an even better response from those that are taking it . You want to learn your audience , put your quiz out there , and make sure that you are creating a conversation and fluid experience for your users . Quizzes are a great way to collect emails , and are a fantastic strategy for increasing the time that users spend on your site .

The reason it keeps working so well is because this quiz is a " must have " for both brands and consumers . From the brand side , a quiz offers a simple way to personalize a product selection , and personalized product suggestions sell 42% better than non-personalized . From the consumer side , this quiz idea offers an opportunity to purchase a product that is made for you , which takes away the fear of purchasing something that you 'll never use and wasting money . <p> On the site integration side , quizzes embed through a simple iframe code that works exactly the same as a YouTube video embed .

Quiz questions are awesome because its an opportunity for a short , scripted conversation to happen between the brand and the consumer that 's unique for each quiz taker . To maximize your potential here , follow a few simple best practices . <p> Culturally relevant . Quizzes are scripted , which can be a bad thing if the script does n't  feel relevant . Its important to know your customers here , if they are into music , have questions relating to music , if they are into travel , have a question about where theyd like to travel , and so on and so forth . <p> Personal . Its a conversation , treat it like a conversation . The way I recommend doing this is to think of one potential customer who you know would enjoy taking your quiz and write directly to them , that way you will speak conversationally and personally . <p> 6-10 questions . This is enough to get the scoring on your quiz to be accurate ( so the personality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so many questions that people get bored and leave . <p> Use pictures every time . In a study of the top quizzes built with Interact , it turns out that all 100 of those quizzes have at least one image question in them . Images add a visual side to your quiz that removes any notion that the quiz is n't fun , which is important . <p> 3 . Quiz results and product recommendations <p> This part is actually a few parts . <p> The name of the product . Pretty simple , but when people share their results it is formatted like " I got Jouer , What 's Your Makeup Brand Match ? " so that product title ( Jouer ) is an important piece of copy . <p> A picture . I do n't  have to tell you the images are important for selling products . <p> A description . The important thing here is to tie the questions into the result recommendation . As you are describing the product , you should explain why its being recommended in the context of the questions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use a link to the product page instead of populating the product right in the quiz results is to maximize social sharing . If you simply forwarded people to a product page at the end of the quiz , no one would share their results ( think about how much people share product pages , not much ) . <p> Social share buttons . Interact automatically adds Twitter and Facebook share buttons to every quiz result , and you can customize the share text to link back to the page where your quiz is embedded . <p> 4 . Sharing your quiz to get the ball rolling . <p> As the brand behind the quiz you 'll need to get things started by sharing the quiz on social ( and most likely purchasing ads to promote it ) . There 's a trick for doing this on Facebook . In words , you take a picture that represents the quiz , share that , and then in the description of the image link to the actual quiz page . <h> To make a makeup quiz , head to tryinteract.com or email sales@tryinteract.com

@@22713616 @2713616/ <h> How to use a quiz to promote your book ( with example from a NYT best seller ) <p> Books are the perfect content for quizzes because they all have characters ( okay not all , but a good majority ) . Ill be the first to admit I do n't  know much about the world of book promotion , but luckily we have an excellent example to work off of for this guide , " The Innovators " by Walter Isaacson the best-selling author of " Steve Jobs . " <p> So without further ado , here is your guide to creating a quiz that builds interest for your next book . <h> 1 . What to write your quiz about <p> Your book sorry , had to do that . Personality quizzes are consistently our top performing content at Interact , and if your book has characters , the title should definitely be " Which Character are You ? " If you do n't  have characters or its a non-fiction book , you can do a knowledge test quiz to see how much people know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes see is that authors do n't  think their book reaches a broad enough audience , and they want the subject of the quiz to be more inclusive . Do n't  fall for that ! Weve learned that " general interest " quizzes perform terribly , but quizzes that reach a specific audience do very well . Do n't  worry if your audience is only a few thousand , or even a few hundred if those people care about your quiz it will get the reach it needs . <h> 2 . Crafting the quiz title <p> 1 . The " Which character are you ? " quiz : For example " Which Innovator are you ? " for a book about innovators ( pictured below ) . <p> 2 . The " How much do you know ? " quiz : For example " How much do you know about UK history ? for a coffee table book about the history of the UK . <p> 3 . The " What type of ( blank ) are you ? " quiz : For example " What 's your business style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Writing the questions <p> Quiz questions are the most fun part to write , you have so much freedom with them and can really create something special for your audience , here are a few tips we 've seen to work really well when writing quiz questions . <p> Keep your writing personality <p> Most writers have a writing ego ( even I have one for blog posts like this one ) . You 'll want to keep that persona in your quiz to build continuity between the quiz and your book and connect with your audience online . Remember , you have a few hundred pages to connect with readers in your book , but only a few questions to do it in your quiz , so be personable . <p> Keep it short <p> I know your book is complex . Theres character development and intricacies that take pages to develop , the plot is thick and interwoven but stop for a second . No one wants to answer 50 questions about your book ( I say 50 because that 's happened before ) . Keep the quiz at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of questions will take about 2 minutes , enough time to build some rapport but short enough to prevent people from clicking away to the latest article about Kanye West . <p> Be conversational <p> A quiz is a unique form of content . You get an opportunity to speak directly to your reader , and have them respond in real time nothing else provides that opportunity . Take advantage of this unique proposition by using a conversational voice in your questions . The goal is to create a connection in a few questions that will lead to a relationship with the reader and eventually a purpose , so make sure to be personal . <h> 4 . Should I collect email subscribers ? <p> Interact quizzes can be used to build your email list , but its not always the right choice . Weve seen authors achieve opt-in rates of 50% or better on their quizzes , while others fail to get any new leads . There are a couple of reasons for such varied results . <p> Offer value other than just seeing the quiz results <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address . Maybe its a 15% discount on your upcoming book , or an opportunity to hear from the author that 's limited to email subscribers . Whatever it is , you need more than to just hang the opportunity to see the quiz results over readers heads to achieve really solid opt-in rates . <p> Have a plan for how you 'll follow-up <p> Do n't  just collect emails because you heard " there 's value in a list . " Have a full plan for how you want to use those email addresses before you even get the first contact . This could be a discount followed by a series of interesting articles taken from your book , or it could be an insiders list from you as the author . Make sure you know what you 're going to send , and that will help you craft the call to action for getting opt-ins in the first place . <h> 5 . Writing quiz results <p> This is what your readers have been waiting for ! Theyve answered all your questions and now its time for the big reveal , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it realistic <p> The key here is to follow up on your promise at the beginning of the quiz . If your quiz is titled " are you more like this character or this one ? " then you only need two results , but if its titled " Which Character are You ? " you 'd better have all the characters in your quiz results . I 've seen quizzes self destruct when hundreds of Facebook comments reveal that everyone gets the same result in a quiz its not good . <p> Be positive <p> Turns out no one likes a negative quiz result . We ran a test and found that 75%of social shares originating from quizzes are overwhelmingly positive ( judging by certain positive keywords contained in the shares ) . One easy way to make every result uplifting is to focus on the good parts of the character or readout you are giving and write the entire result based on those one or two attributes . That way you just avoid the negative . <p> Include a follow-on link <p> This one is real important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal when people finish your quiz they are invested and curious . Theyve just spent a few minutes answering your questions , many of which are quite personal , and now you are making a judgement on their life . This is the perfect place to provide follow-up content so that person can learn more about you , your book , and why you have the right to judge them . This all sounds a bit negative , but its really not , its just that you have an opportunity to continue a conversation with a potential customer , so you should do it by including a link . <p> Ideally , each quiz result has its own link . One idea Ive seen work is to include a link to learn more about the character that the quiz taker is most like and then also have an offer to buy the book on that page where the character is described . <h> 6 . Amplifying your reach through sharing <p> Have a closed loop ! The picture below shows what a closed loop is , and the closed loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our customers . The way it works is that you make a quiz , embed it in your site , and then customize the social share link so that it points back to the page on your website where the quiz is embedded . With this method you never lose any of your audience to social sites .

Disney gives us an unbelievable amount of content for quizzes that connect with our sentimental side , and reels us in from there . <p> Recently Disney released a mobile application called the Inquizitve ' app that hosts multiple quizzes you can take that are all related to Disney in some sort of way . The more quizzes you take , the more Disney can hone in on a profile for you of different personality traits and which Disney characters you 're the most similar to . Disney has some great content writers that create interesting and engaging quizzes , and are really doing well by entering this type of mobile entertainment . <p> These quizzes are fun , intuitive , and create great interaction between the wonderful world of Disney and our personalities . Well , what if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go about doing that ? <p> I 'm going to make a quick Disney themed quiz about some of their newer characters , and we 'll ask some personality questions to hone in on which of these three different characters you are most like . This quiz is a personality quiz , because there are n't right or wrong answers , and you should get a different result based on how you answer the questions that are given to you . <p> Before we break down the quiz and take a look on how I came up with the questions , answers , and how it was made , why do n't you take the quiz yourself and see who you get , and then we 'll break it down from there ! <p> First things first , we have to come up with our three results and their personalities . This is vital before we even come up with the questions we 're going to ask the takers of our quiz , since when you create quizzes you normally want to work backwards from results to questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Baymax from Big Hero Six <p> Baymax is the lovable , caring character from the now Oscar winning animation film from Disney . He is a big , marshmallow like character , and when you see him you have a sudden urge to just give him a big hug . He is a robot that was designed to be a nurse like character to help people in need , and does advanced diagnostics of sickness with the technology built inside him . <p> Traits to get Baymax : -Caring -Huggable -Loving -Loyal <p> Anna the Ice Princess from Frozen <p> Anna is the main character in the movie Frozen and is an optimistic , eccentric and lovable character . She discovers herself more and more through the movie and viewers are able to observe her impulsive tendencies to act before she speaks . She believes in the good in everyone , even if her sister Elsa has proved time and time again that she might not have the best heart for the world that they live in . Anna is goofy and hyperactive , and she might relate best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Traits to get Anna : -Extroverted -Goofy -Optimistic -Hopeful <p> And in honor of Pixar 's newest release hopefully this year , our last character you can get is Dory from Finding Nemo , as well as the new Finding Dory movie due to be released sometime this year . <p> Dory is actually an incredibly complex and interesting character . If you have seen the movie , you would know that she is a fish that suffers from short-term memory loss , and we find out this has caused her to be left alone since her other friends and family were most likely so fed up with her memory loss that they left her . She is kind of a tragic character in that sense , as she is aware that she ca n't remember too much , but we see that memory improve over the course of the film . She is incredibly supportive of Marlin in his hunt to find Nemo , and is super kind at heart and talks a bit too much . <p> Traits to get Dory : -Kind -Supportive -Friendly -Talkative <p> Alright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get matched up with , let 's come up with a few questions and see who they might point to . <p> Question 1 : It 's the weekend ! Where will you be found ? <p> -Hitting the beach with my friends ! -Catching up with my BFF -Working hard on my hobbies ! <p> Each answer correlates to a single character , so who do you think should be matched with what character ? Well I 've crafted these answers with a single character for each in mind . We 've established that Anna is the extravert , so I 'd match her hanging with her friends . Baymax is caring and hardworking , so I 'd label him working on my hobbies and being productive . So that leaves us with Anna being intentional and catching up with a friend ! <p> Question 2 : Pick your favorite color . <p> -Light Blue -White -Yellow <p> These are not quite typical colors that people would choose as a favorite , but each one does relate itself to a character . The light blue goes with Elsa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pureness of Baymax and color of his body , and the yellow reflects the color of Dory 's fins . <p> Question 3 : Your Ideal Playground ? <p> -Take me to the snow ! -The Ocean , absolutely -Anywhere in the Future <p> I would say that the correlation of these answers should be pretty self-explanatory , so I wo n't get into detail about them . But I do want you to take a look at this question , as it 's a bit of a different approach to a standard personality question . Sometimes it 's good to stray away from the which is your favorite ' or choose one ' types of questions . <p> Question 4 : I absolutely love <p> -To help people -Looking for the best in everything -To support my friends <p> I might be starting to get redundant in my explanations as they become clearer , but if you take what we 've learned about our characters you could probably guess which of these answers matches which character . Again , take a note at the question . What I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements is creating rhythm within the quiz itself . With a mix of normal questions , fill in the blanks , and straight up choice , we can create a nice flow of rhythm throughout our quiz to keep the user engaged . <p> Question 5 : Which of these words would you use to describe yourself ? <p> -Hopeful -Supportive -Hyperactive <p> This is one of the most direct questions we 're asking in this quiz , as it directly correlates with our profiles that we put on our characters earlier . With this question , we get one final push hopefully in the right direction to nail in who we are most relating too . The point of this question is to give a shoe in point and maybe a final push on the character that the quiz taker should really get , and it also acts as a great way to end the short quiz . <p> And with that last question , we have ourselves a great short quiz that can give you an accurate answer based on just a few responses ! <p> Making quizzes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit of organization . Most likely when you 're making quizzes like these Disney ones , you 're so familiar with the subject matter that no research needs to be involved . Being able to organize that knowledge is part of the fun of making a quiz for outreach on your website . So , channel that knowledge that you know about a subject and make a quiz today ! <p> To make a quiz like the one talked about in this article , head to tryinteract.com

A piece of content which outperforms similar posts by a minimum of 10x ( measured in unique visits ) without paying for any of that traffic ( must be organic ) <p> Now that that 's out of the way let 's take a look at how certain quizzes go viral ( according to my definition ) . <p> To unfold what causes some quizzes to become so popular while others only see a few visits , we compiled an excel spreadsheet of 1500 quizzes created using Interact and then did some clever things to find common traits among the most popular ones . <p> Heres what we found . <h> Part 1 : Naming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearly 50% of viral quizzes ( according to my definition of viral ) , that are created using Interact are of this title type . It works for anything , from Books to Food products , and is a title that tap into our natural desire to know more about ourselves . <p> The example below was created by a content site that focuses on military happenings . Their quiz about which hero you are took off , getting 88,000 views , and because it got so popular the quiz now ranks in search engines and gets consistent traffic . <p> To use this quiz title. - Focus on what interests your customers . If its technology then tell people what kind of smartphone they are , if its fashion then tell people which style icon they are . Find what interests the people who engage with your brand and write a quiz for them . <p> How much do you actually know about ? <p> This quiz title accounts for another 25% of all viral quizzes built with Interact . Its a compelling type of title because the quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges ( especially when you can take the challenge in five minutes online ) . <p> Take for example the quiz below " How much do you know about Iran ? " that touches on a touchy subject . We hear about Iran and the Middle East in general a lot in the news but do we really know anything concrete about that place ? The result was 7000+ views for a quiz created by an awesome non-profit organization supporting social entrepreneurs in Iran . <p> To use this title type. - Start with what you know . Namely , what your main industry is . For Berim , the non-profit behind the Iran quiz , is was easy because they focus on one country in particular . For others its not as easy , but think about the questions you receive the most and use those to formulate the subject for your quiz of this type . <h> Part 2 : Writing the questions <p> Be conversational <p> We found a strong correlation between the number of personal pronouns ( I , you , we , etc. ) used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got . In other words , when we speak naturally like we would to a friend within a quiz , it does better . <p> One quiz creator who has consistently created viral quizzes is Food52.com . A part of the reason for their success is the natural style in which the questions are written . Because each quiz feels personal and conversational , their quizzes end up with very personal and conversational sharers who appreciate the jovial tone of the quiz . <p> How to do this. - This one is like philosophy class , there is no right answer . What I can tell you is to relax and write like you are tipsy ( actually being tipsy is optional ) . Remember that quizzes are a one-on-one medium , not a mass broadcast to an audience . Speak like you would to a friend over drinks . <p> Design does matter <p> But not in the way you think . One problem I see people making is obsessing over how to make their quiz look amazing so itll get lots of views . In reality less is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the quiz to match your sites overall styling , and yes it shouldnt have clashing colors that make you look ridiculous , but you also want to take it easy on too much flare . <p> Take the quiz question below from Simon and Schuster for example . The design is pretty basic , there 's not really a lot going on , yet it looks great and is very appealing to the eyes . The picture is relevant to the question being asked , the answers are short and symmetrical , and the background matches the image while complimenting the answer choice color well . <p> How to do design. - If you do n't  have a designer , here is a guide to basic color patterns and the affect they have on us . If you plan on running multiple quizzes I 'd recommend getting a designer , and you can email us your designs , wed be happy to take a look . <p> Images are more clickable <p> On twitter , image posts get 18% more clicks than non-image ones , and that discrepancy carries through most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click-able in general , that 's science . Looking through Interact again , we found that a full 75% of viral quizzes ( remember viral means 10x normal traffic ) , have image questions ( where each answer choice is an image ) . <p> Take a look at the question below , which is pulled from a quiz made by The Kansas City Public Library ( yay for government institutions who have fun ! ) . This question is made more vibrant and really draws you in by putting an image to to each answer choice instead of just text . <p> How to do this. - Relevance . I do n't  care how cool your custom graphics are , only use pictures that actually show what you 're talking about . You do n't  need to be fancy here , actual pictures are great . That being said , use good pictures , here 's a list of places to get good pictures . Also , make sure to follow the sizing guidelines for your image questions , if you put six massive images on a page , it wont load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using quizzes for lead generation <p> Let me explain this one a bit . Interact quizzes are set up to have the option where you can put a lead capture box between the questions of a quiz and the results . When each person finishes taking the quiz you can present a targeted opt-in offer and then show the results ( its a lead capture gate ) . This can work amazingly well ( with opt-in rates over 50% ) , but it can also ruin a quiz if its not done right . <p> Make the call to action contextually relevant <p> With a quiz you get the opportunity to present an offer that is relevant to the exact content you are currently looking at , this can be super helpful if done right or not help at all if you screw it up . <p> Its not very complicated , all you have to do is reference the subject of your quiz in the call-to-action text and reassure people that they will only receive information that 's related to the quiz and not your generic newsletter . <p> Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their quiz talks about holiday decorations and marketing for small businesses , and this call to action says they will send you a holiday guide makes sense to me , and that 's all you have to do . <p> How to do this. - Just reference the subject of your quiz in the call to action . It does n't  need to be in-your-face or anything , but make sure that people know your email blasts will match up with what they 're interested in . <p> Have a compelling offer <p> A quiz lead gate has the built-in draw that the email capture comes before the quiz results . That alone is enough to get opt-ins in many cases , but its always good to have a one-two punch setup . <p> Take for example this lead gate from Gemalto . They start out by telling you to enter your email to see the quiz results , but then they also tell you about a challenge you can enter by signing up . Many times this sub-text and second offer is just as important as the initial call-to-action draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having a follow-up offer . <p> How to do this. - Your second offer should reference the subject of your quiz , just like the first . It can be a free giveaway , or a contest like Gemalto did , or even just an e-subscription to a relevant newsletter . The key is knowing which of these offers work . If you have data on what works from a different part of your site , use that , or A/B test a couple of different offers to optimize . <h> Part 4 : Crafting results <p> Be uplifting <p> 75% of tweets sent out from the results page of quizzes contain positive trigger words ( things like great , awesome , excellent , so on and so forth ) . Quizzes that having something good to say get shared the most and thus go viral more . <p> One of my personal favorite examples of being uplifting comes from AITA , a truckers association . Their quiz tells you what type of big-rig you are . Now nothing against big-rigs , but they are big and heavy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , AITA does a great job of making each quiz result very positive without being dishonest . <p> How to do this. - Focus on the positive and avoid the negative . Notice in the quiz description for the Mack truck that most of the talk is about being professional and reliable , leaving out anything about being big and slow . Think about the good and forget the bad when writing quiz results . <p> Follow up with targeted links <p> When a quiz taker gets to their result , you have an extremely interested audience . Theyve just told you personal information and you are now doling out a personality type of assessment of their knowledge that 's very , well , personal . <p> A little bit of text and a picture is n't enough to satisfy everyones curiosity , and having a lot of text in your quiz results is off-putting . That 's why it works best to have targeted links for each quiz result that lead to external pages where quiz takers can learn more about their results . <p> Take a look at the example below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of snack food and then included a link to a recipe for that snack food on their own domain . That way when the quiz goes viral the traffic will come back to them in a very pinpointed way . <p> How to do this. - There are two ways to provide targeted links . The first way is to work backwards and start with some articles youd like to highlight and use those to create your quiz results ( for example , Food52 could start with several recipes , make the recipes the quiz results , and craft an entire quiz around that ) . The second way is to insert the links after the fact to articles that provide more information about each quiz result . <h> Part 5 : Optimizing to be shared . <p> Have a closed loop , as shown in the simple triangle diagram below . You cant afford to lose any of the traffic that your awesome quiz gets , so do n't  . <p> How to do this. - First , create a quiz , then , embed it into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally , use Interact to set up the quiz so that social shares point back to your webpage where the quiz is embedded . That 's a closed loop , you wont risk losing traffic to Facebook or Twitter , or Interact . <p> That 's it , now you know how to make a viral quiz ( by my definition of viral ) . I tried to focus on lesser-known brands in this tutorial to show you that really anyone can create a quiz that performs very well , that 's the power of social media combined with the virality of quizzes . 
@@22713621 @2713621/ <h> How Red Lobster used a quiz to create their most liked Facebook post ever <p> As far as I can tell ( from looking through their Facebook feed ) , the most " liked " Facebook post from the Red Lobster for all time is the quiz in the screenshot above . It amassed 179,165 likes , which is a crazy amount for any post , and certainly surpasses your average status update . <p> I 'd like to analyze the quiz itself and see if we cant work backwards to figure out what led to this behemoth of a post . <p> The first thing to consider is how the post was shared in the first place . Facebook business pages require you to manually upload your posts photo along with a link . here 's a short set of instructions ( I put this first because its important . <p> 1 . Take a screenshot of the quiz or pick an image to share <p> 2 . Upload the image to a new Facebook post manually <p> 3 . Write a description of the quiz " Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now you can find out " <p> 4 . Include a link to the quiz ( use- bit.ly- or similar link shortener to track analytics ) <p> Making your quiz <h> Let 's dive into the process of creating this quiz . <p> 1 . Design elements . <p> While you get to choose what image to share with your quiz link on Facebook , the quiz itself is what gets people to click and take the quiz , building the connection needed to eventually have that person send a like or share your way which in turn gets more people exposed to the quiz . <p> As you can see in the screenshot below there are a couple of things that show up . First is the big picture that 's called the cover photo in the Interact quiz builder . The second is the title , and the third is the font style and button color . <p> 2 . Create questions to break the ice <p> Your goal is to get people excited enough about your quiz to share it and amplify the reach . The leg-work of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but let me explain . The best way to think about this is to realize that no other form of content besides quizzes allows you to ask people questions and actually have them respond . This means you can have a scripted conversation with each and every person who comes to your quiz , building a relationship ( using that word at its very lightest definition ) with each person that can be leveraged to get that person to share the quiz . The only thing you have to do is be yourself when asking quiz questions , but in case that 's a struggle , here are some things we learned from Red Lobster . <p> -Have a personality <p> The personality of the Red Lobster writer is that friend who asks you questions and actually cares about the answers . How to be that person in a quiz is difficult , but it mainly means just asking very specific and personal questions . Obviously you do n't  have to have that same personality , but its important to have some sort of distinct personality when writing quiz questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> -Dont ask too many questions <p> I was just looking at a quiz made with Interact that had 17 questions , and I did n't  finish it , even though I have a vested interest in each quiz made with our platform . The Red Lobster quiz has six questions , which lands it squarely in the sweet spot ( 6-12 questions ) . That 's enough time to build some rapport ( about 2 minutes of answering questions ) , but its not too long to the point where people will get bored and leave . <p> 3 . Build results worth sharing <p> The results page is the last page of your quiz , this is where people will decide if they want to share your quiz or if they like it enough to give it a " like " on Facebook . The goal here is to continue the connection you started working on with the quiz questions and build enough rapport to get that like or share . Here are a few best practices that The Red Lobster did an excellent job of . <p> -Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets , no one wants to hear they they are not great , everyone wants to hear that they are awesome . Take for example the quiz result pictured below for Shrimp Linguini Alfredo , its borderline kissing up with how nice it is , but somehow you still believe it , that 's the goal be almost too nice , but sincere enough to be believable . <p> -Keep it short . <p> Yes , people want to hear about how great they are , but not at the cost of having to read more than 200 words ( our recommended upper limit for quiz results ) . Again , this is something The Red Lobster does really well , they make sure to tell people how great they are without droning on . <p> -Have pictures <p> If you told me I was " Shrimp Linguini Alfredo " without a picture , I probably would n't care that much however , you add in a photo and all of a sudden I really want it ( and care a lot more ) . Make sure you use only high quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself in the foot with a quiz . <p> 4 . Have a promotion strategy <p> While the main thing is to just make sure you create a Facebook post that looks nice , there are a few other things to keep in mind if you want to maximize the impact of your quiz on social media . <p> -Reply to comments <p> No matter how big your company is , people will vastly appreciate if you reply to their comments . This is something The Red Lobster did an excellent job of , they took the time to go in and reply to as many comments as humanly possible ( there were nearly 5,000 so every one just wasnt in the options book ) . <p> -Post multiple times <p> Studies show that you should post things more than once to social media . - The main reason for this is that the biggest networks have created a system where only a small fraction of your followers ( sometimes as little as 10% ) will even see your post . Also , it turns out that even when people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Red Lobster posted their quiz multiple times , and while the first post got the majority of the " likes " and interactions , the subsequent posts combined to get the quiz more than 200k likes in total . <p> Quizzes do very well on Facebook . Red Lobster is a perfect example of a well-executed quiz that did pretty much everything right and reaped the benefits , reaching millions of people . We can all learn a lot from them , thanks Red Lobster for showing us the way ! 
@@22713622 @2713622/ <h> How to make interactive content using Interact <p> Interactive content lays somewhere between written media and tools on the effectiveness scale . You get the benefits of a pricey product without the investment . <p> But let 's define what were talking about here so I do n't  disappoint you and we both get on the same page . <p> Interactive content = content that has the ability for users to click and receive feedback while on the same page . The interactivity allows for This guide focuses on what most people would consider to be assessments or quizzes . <p> I 've personally witnessed companies getting massive ROI from interactive content , and Ive also seen people fall flat on their faces after investing heavily in interactive pieces . My goal today is to prevent any falling and give you the keys to creating interactive content that truly delivers . <h> Step 1 : Have a goal <p> Usually when a business fails with Interactive content its because they have no plan for what it will do . Its great to be on the trends and get your marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy or you 'll for sure fail . Here are a couple of goals to get your ideas going . <p> 1 . Lead generation . One of the most important things interactive quizzes can do is act as their very own lead generation funnel . You get a full few minutes of connection with a prospect as you ask questions and they answer , and then you present an opportunity for the prospect to stay in touch by putting in their information . This method works marvelously for many and is a strong strategy . <p> The example here shows a well-executed model for how to do lead generation within a quiz . The quiz itself is about holiday decorating , and the call to action text here asks if you 'd like to receive a holiday guide for fre by inputting an email address . They also include their logo to build more credibility which is excellent . <p> 2 . Personalization . One of the big web trends for the next five years is personalization . Now that we 've effectively filled up the internet with all sorts of content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Interactive content is one way to skip all the difficulty and just make personalization happen . <p> Take , for example , the quiz image below that hails from Forbes college quiz . They help potential students discover what sort of university would best fit their interests and then include personalized links to check out the Forbes college adviser tool to get even more information . <p> 3 . Contest . In some form , contests have been around literally forever , and with interactivity baked in you can make one heck of a competition . Let me start with an example here , the quiz below is from ViewsBank , a UK site that does market research . They built a simple quiz to determine what kind of monster you are for Halloween , and asked quiz takers to comment with their results for a chance to win a basket of Cadbury chocolate . <p> They ended up with over 1000 comments , and it was a smash hit . A big part of the reason for that success was the gamified nature of the contest , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get to find out what kind of monster you are ( an important question if you ask me ) , and then you can be entered to a contest simply by commenting . <h> Step 2 : Have a plan <p> 1 . Formulate . Just like any good piece of content , research and creation of the body is very important . When you stack it all up end-to-end , a quiz ends up being 600-1200 words including all the questions and results , so writing a quiz is similar in length to a strong blog post . If you work with a team , have them create the content within Interact to make it easier to keep track of everything . <p> 2 . Design . We have a full suite of design customization tools to make your content as unique as your business is . Everything is click-only ( no code needed ) , so you can handle it even if your not a front end developer or designer , but I recommend you get your design team involved in the creation process . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then you can still end up with a nice-looking quiz by following the color scheme of your website . <p> 3 . Share . Two things you must do for every interactive piece . One , embed it in your website ( using an iframe or javascript embed ) . Two , share on Facebook and Twitter . If you do those two things and work hard to get better at writing quizzes , you 'll have success on your hands in no time at all ( well , some time , but soon ) . <h> Step 3 : Have fun <p> 1 . Follow the pub rule . Invented by The Irish Post , this rule states that you must only publish questions and results to interactive content that would be acceptable to say out loud in a pub with your mates . This is important because of the conversational nature of interactive pieces . Its you having a chat with one other person at a time while they answer your questions , so treat it like that . <p> 2 . Follow Shaqs rule . Shaquille Oneal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a business sense ) has a rule for how he treats social media and marketing in general . He says that 85% of everything he creates is meant to make people smile , 15% is to inform them , and 5% is to sell products . By sticking to this rule , Shaq has developed massive social media followings , and when he does promote a product its extremely effective . <p> Your Interactive pieces should pretty much follow the Shaq rule , the goal is to be entertaining and reach new people on social channels , where fun rules the game , obviously you also want to have a purpose with providing information and promoting your business , but start with having fun . <p> 3 . Speak like a human . Let me set this one up for you . When we talk in our normal everyday lives , 60% of what we say is about ourselves , leading us to use a lot of the words " I " " you " " we " and so on , what I call personal pronouns . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good for quiz content , so I ran a test to see what kind of corellation there might be between speaking normally and getting more views on quizzes . <p> Turns out there is a strong connection between the use of personal pronouns in quiz content and getting more views . The chart below shows the upward trend in views as personal pronouns are used more in other words , just be yourself , its what your mom told you to do , its its wise advice for writing quizzes .

@@22713624 @2713624/ <h> 5 Things That Make a Great Quiz <p> We recently crossed the 1.7 million mark for leads generated across all quizzes created at Interact . Along the way we 've done a lot of tracking along the lines of what works and what does n't  , which led to the recent release of our quiz templates . However , there are some less quantifiable aspects of great quizzes Ive noticed that I 'd like to share . <p> Great quizzes are entertaining while staying closely related to the company . For example , we 've had a lot of success with retail quizzes like " What 's Your Style Personality ? " because these quizzes are naturally engaging ( Who does n't  want to know more about their style ? ) , but they 're also easily connected back to the host company ( you can put products in the results and send emails with personalized product recommendations ) . On the other side of the equation , you have scenarios where the quizzes are fun but not at all related to your product ( like " What Color are You ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no one gives a shit about ( like " How much do you know about social media marketing ? " ) . <p> The best quizzes are about you . If I had to give one reason why quizzes are and always will be popular , its that they tell you something of value about yourself . Sometimes that information is truly practical " What 's Your Biggest Strength ? " and sometimes its not practical " Which Puppy are You ? " but irregardless , the truly impactful thing is that you get to learn a bit more about who you are , which everyone is interested in . <p> A Quiz is only as good as its ( marketing ) surroundings . Quizzes live at the very top of your marketing funnel , and they wo n't do you any good if the rest of the pieces are weak . I still remember working with a client in the early days at Interact who generated 400 leads with a quiz and had no idea what to do with them . It was shocking when put in juxtaposition to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatic follow-ups and was driving value from 20-30 leads a month . We now actively screen our customers to make sure they have the elements in place before starting with us , because its a massive waste of time to put together a strong quiz only to have nothing come after that . <p> It has to be entertaining. - Quizzes live and die by their ability to attract attention in a primarily social internet world . Your quiz has to compete with cat pictures , baby pictures , and Kim Kardashian , if its not fun , you wo n't get clicks . Again , the quiz lives at the top of the funnel so its not like you need the quiz to be a hard-hitting fact sheet . <p> For quizzes , creativity is both over-rated and under-rated. - The same exact quizzes have been popular since the 1920 's . They used to be printed in magazines , now they 're shared on Facebook , with literally no difference in the questions/personalities . That means you should n't try to come up with a completely unique idea , rather you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the " creativity is over-rated " part . Now , once you decide what kind of quiz you want , you should get creative with the graphics/images and wording you use .

@@22713625 @2713625/ <h> How To Make A Quiz That Looks Like Your Brand <p> Quizzes have become a great way to create user engagement in your website , along with the ability to easily collect leads and grab user 's interest . But sometimes we 'll run into one big issue with quizzes : how they look . <p> To make quizzes like the one talked about in this article , head to tryinteract.com <p> You could have great content , interesting questions and fun results , but if the quiz does n't look good nor match your brand , why would you ever put it on your site ? Well , in this article I 'm going to show you how you can fully customize a quiz to blend perfectly within its platform . This blending property is key to not break up the flow and pull away from the brand you 've worked so hard to perfect . <p> In this example I 'm using a paid version of our software to make a lot of these customizations , but we also have a free product that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tryinteract.com and click the big orange button in the middle to quickly sign up and get moving on your first quiz . <p> For sake of example , I 'll use this general brand that I made up for this article . We 'll have a simple logo here , and a color scheme that we can follow . <p> We 're working with a logo that leans on the more modern and simplistic side , as well as a green brand with multiple angles that we can approach that green . So let 's get going . <p> I 'll approach this strategy in a couple of different ways . First I 'll be talking about how we can mess around with different colors to ensure we have a quiz that not only looks good , but also makes sense to the reader and blends in with the rest of the site . These will be the basics on making a good looking quiz that can be matched with any brand with just a few treats . After I talk about that , we 'll get into how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it is placed , so it does n't interrupt the user experience . <p> By making some minor tweaks to each of these things , you will be able to see how easy it is to make your quiz match your brand in no time . <p> First things a first , we need a solid center image . This really can vary depending on what your quiz is about , but I love the idea of not showing any boarders with this image for our particular quiz . I 'm going to find something I can put there that is set in a white background , so there is no break . I have this great picture of Baymax from the movie Big Hero 6 , so let 's throw him in there . <p> After we get our cover photo uploaded , let 's add our logo next . We want to make sure that our logo has a blank or white background , so it blends right in . <p> Next , you 'll see the option for background color . Since we 'll be implementing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep that white . I always try to keep the background of all my quizzes white , with very special circumstances allowing me to change the background color of my quiz . <p> For our font color , we have a dark grey that we 're working with in our color palette , so let 's go ahead and change it to that . That color for us is #525252 , so I 'll just click on Font Color ' and type in that number , or if I did n't have one in mind I would just use the color picker to find one . <p> Currently I 'm pretty happy with the font type that is present on the quiz , but if we wanted to change it we could easily doing that by selecting Font Type ' on the left side and then selecting Change ' which would bring up other options as well . <p> Another very important change we would need to make in order to have our quiz match our brand is the color of the call to action button . Let 's change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is # 5ABF96 . This really ties everything together with the logo in the bottom right corner , and is one of the most important parts in getting our quiz to sync up with our brand . <p> As for our last option of changing the text that sits inside the call to action button , it 's really up to the creator for what that says . I 'll go back and forth on different options depending on the quiz and the audience . On this one , I went ahead and changed it to Let 's Find Out ! ' to further push forward the initial question that 's asked at the title of the quiz . <p> So after all that , I 'd say the quiz is looking pretty good ! It 's simple and not busy , and you can definitely see the hints of our brand without it being too in your face or interruptive .

They either stick out like a sore thumb and interrupt the whole reading process with their nonconformity , or just break up the page into two different parts . The goal here is to make one smooth experience , not break the page into a bunch of pieces . <p> Notice how the quiz above does n't have borders , and it just sits right in the article . It 's not separate in any way , and it seems that all of its parts just come together to form the quiz . You can easily take the quiz and move on without thinking it 's a separate action . A good goal to strive for is making the quiz a complementary action for the reader , something they would do along with reading the article . <p> Quizzes that are placed within articles tend to have higher completion rates and more views than quizzes that are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly invited to engage with the quiz , rather than clicking on a link that takes them to a dedicated quiz page . <p> Looking at the numbers we have , we 've determined that on an average quiz embedded in posts , it takes users just under 3 minutes to take a quiz . We have a 60% completion rate from quizzes viewed , so from this you could determine that by adding a quiz to your page , for 60% of the readers , you 've just added an extra 3 minutes to the time they spend on your site and on your article .

@@22713626 @2713626/ <h> How to make an awesome travel quiz <p> Travel websites have a huge opportunity when it comes to quizzes . Because of the amount of research and planning that goes into taking vacation , a vast amount of content is consumed in the travel space . Even further , people are keen to find information from experts when it comes to traveling , entire businesses have been built on the premise of connecting experts to eager travelers . <p> I say all this to set the stage for how you can create awesome travel quizzes that not only grow your brand , but also genuinely provide a great value to your audience . In this guide , I 'll go over all aspects of writing and sharing travel quizzes that rock , using examples of quizzes built using Interact that went viral . <h> Part 1 : Writing your travel quiz <p> 1 . A title that catches attention <p> For travel quizzes , there are two types of titles that work well . One is a personality type quiz and the other is a multiple choice . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? " or " What type are you ? " if you run a blog that focuses on a particular area of the planet , you can do a " Where should you go in ? " quiz and if you are you are a general interest travel site you can just do a where should you go ? quiz in general . <p> The " What type are you ? " quiz focuses on travel , but can be adapted to your specific site . <p> The multiple choice one . Drawn from your expertise , this quiz challenges people to discover how much they know about your part of the planet . These quizzes work best if you can be specific " How much do you know about Cambodia ? " but can still work for general interest " What 's your travel IQ ? " <p> 2 . A cover image that draws eyes <p> The way Interact quizzes are set up , most of the space on the cover page is taken up by an image . That 's mainly because image posts perform much better on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This means that you 'll want to make sure that cover image is something that draws your potential quiz takers in . <p> After doing some research , we found that pictures of one person far outperform pictures without any people , and having multiple people in your cover photo is good , but not as good . For travel quizzes , pictures of people in scenic places around the world are perfect , in general go for professional quality photos over candid shots , you do n't  want to risk casting a shoddy image . <p> 3 . Questions that are conversational <p> Quick quiz , what sets quizzes apart from all other forms of content ? If you answered live conversations , you 'd be correct . Talking to your customers is an excellent way to build relationships , so youd better talk to your customers in your quiz . <p> The best thing to do here is be yourself , and I wont try to tell you how to do that , but there are a couple of tips for writing quiz questions I 'd like to share . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know first-hand the struggle to stay conversational when it comes to creating content . We get tempted to sound more professional because of how many people will be reading what we write , but being cordial is the death of a quiz . Basically just talk naturally , like you would to a friend at a bar , except to lots of friends , on the internet . <p> Second , remember your purpose is to entertain . There 's a rule that Shaq came up with that states you should make 85% of your content to entertain , 10% to inform , and 5% to sell products . Your quiz questions should be fun to answer . <p> - 4 . Results that educate and elevate <p> Start by delivering on your quiz promise . If you told people youd tell them where they should study abroad , do that first . Make sure to give a compelling explanation for why you gave the quiz result you did , but also be very positive . If you want your quiz to be shared , it must be positive . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares originating from quiz results were overwhelmingly uplifting . <p> 5 . Following up <p> Think about this , I just answered a series of personal questions about myself and have been given a result telling me what my personality is or how much I know . I 'm very keen to dig into whatever you tell me right now , because anything you say is very personal and applies directly to me . <p> This is why its absolutely vital to include a follow-up link in every result of your travel quiz . Take for example the quiz below , which was created by Pepperdine University . Its titled " Where should you study abroad ? " Studying abroad is a big deal , and where you do it is a large decision . They not only include a nice description of the place you should go , but also include a link to learn more in their community section . <h> Part 2 : Sharing your travel quiz <p> The great thing about travel is that beauty is a natural part of it . You know just how amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz much easier . <p> See , quizzes that get shared with an image get nearly twice as much traffic from social networks on average , and a good image can really take your sharing strategy to the next level . <p> When you first share a quiz out on Facebook and Twitter , grab the link ( use a shortener to track analytics etc ) , then grab an image that 's part of the quiz , and share it out with a clever headline ( use the title if you cant come up with something better ) . <p> You can also embed the quiz into your site to use as a blog post and then let people share either the blog post or their quiz results , which will help make sure all traffic comes back to your domain . Here is a guide on embedding your quiz . <h> Part 3 : Rinse and repeat <p> A blog called Food52 had created 5 quizzes before making a real hit . The first five werent bad , getting a few thousand views , but the sixth one really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With Interact , we give you the basic analytics to find tweak your quizzes and improve over time .

@@22713627 @2713627/ <h> How To Make A Quiz About Your City <p> Everyone has their own opinion about the city that they live in , whether it be good or bad . If I 'm being honest , I personally love Los Angeles . Sure , along with any other big city in America there are definitely things that I highly dislike ( refraining from using that hate ' word ) and things I feel could use a lot of improvement . But the longer I live here , the more I have grown accustomed to all the amazing things that Los Angeles has to offer . <p> To make a quiz like the one talked about in this article , head to tryinteract.com <p> That 's why today the example city we 're going to be using is Los Angeles , well because I know it the best . It 's also a pretty easy city to write about in terms of information , so that helps as well . <p> After deciding the city you 're going to write a quiz about , second you must decide what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to ask the users to identify some obscure things about your city that they might not know even if they 've lived there for a while ? Or are you taking an approach of knowing some trivia about the city ? Perhaps a quiz that has to do with its history ? <p> These are all different avenues you can go down while making your quiz , and that 's only a couple of examples . For my quiz , I 'm going to go with the basis of knowing some obscure facts about Los Angeles . This knowledge might come from a wide variety of subjects such as being a well-visited LA resident to knowing a little about the history of the city . <p> Before I go further , if you are from Los Angeles ( or even if you 're not ! ) go ahead and take the quiz below and then we 'll talk about how I made it . <p> So there 's a few different steps we want to take to come up with questions . <h> 1 . Find some unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The goal is to always ask interesting questions and keep the user engaged , but at the same time you do n't want to come up with questions that are too obscure because that might cause someone to dislike the quiz and stop taking it . <p> The question I thought up of that exemplifies this is What did the Hollywood sign originally say ? ' The answer to the question is Hollywoodland ' as this is actually originally what the Hollywood sign said before it deteriorated and was refurbished . This is an interesting question that sparks some thought in the user , but is n't too hard or obscure to deter them away . Another thing I like about this question is that if you do n't know it , it does spark the curiosity to attempt to answer so you can find out what the real answer is . <p> This can be another strategy to assure that you get a user to finish your quiz . With a quiz like this I personally suggest you have the quiz answers revealed at the end , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting question that the user does n't know the answer to , they 'll make sure to finish the quiz so they can find out the right answer and see their score . <h> 2 . History can be really interesting , so look up some facts ! <p> Honestly , sometimes Google can be your best friend in this . Every city has some pretty fascinating facts about their history . The best part about these kinds of questions is how easy they are to find . A quick search can give you a whole boat load of awesome history facts about your city , and you can create great questions out of them . <p> The example question I created using this method was What was the original name of Los Angeles ' with the answer being El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora Reina de Los Angeles sobre el Rio Porciuncula ' which translates into The town of our lady queen of the angels on the Porciucula River . ' <p> I wo n't lie , I find that to be a pretty interesting and hilarious fact . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not everybody would know , but you can easily make three other answer options that make the question a little more difficult . Speaking back on the interesting factor ' we were talking about earlier , this question definitely hits the nail on the head as the user would most likely be very interested into what the correct answer actually is. <h> 3 . Food , every city has unique eats <p> Playing with the passionate emotions that come with talking about the favorite food in a city can really strike a chord with a lot of the quiz takers . Everyone has their favorite local spot and favorite signature dish that exists across the city along with a favorite bar they visit by their apartment . Los Angeles is teeming with delicious food , and one of the most classic eats that originated in LA is In-N-Out burger . <p> In-N-Out is the favorite burger of 99% of California residents . Yes , I made up that statistic , but it seriously is the absolute best fast food burger you 'll find on the west coast . The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one was actually in Baldwin Park , and that led me to ask that particular question in the quiz , Where was the first In-N-Out located ? ' <h> 4 . Find your city 's niche thing <p> Los Angeles is known for its traffic problem , as we should be because it 's horrible here . A popular video that went viral on the Internet was an SNL sketch called The Californians ' where mega stereotyped Californians talked about , well California stuff . But basically the most prominent quotes from these sketches were when the characters talked about their LA freeway usage . <p> This was also hilariously accurate . We have some pretty impressive freeways here , and there are lots of them . I decided to ask a question based on these freeways , and which ones you would take to get from point A to point B. This was one of my favorite questions and it was Which freeways would you take from the Getty to Azusa ? ' The answer is the 405 to the 101 to the 134 to the 210 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names . Yes , we entitle our freeways that way . <p> I found this to be a niche thing that all Los Angeles residents can relate to and find humorous . It works as a perfect question because at the same time , a user might have a different way that they would personally take that route using four other freeways . This causes curiosity and confirms that you do really know your freeways if you get it right . <p> The preposition of this question also led me to ask users to identify the freeway interchange that the photo below belongs to . <p> This is the magnificent interchange of the 105 and the 110 . A lot of people have seen this photo before because it really is an impressive piece of modern infrastructure , but often times people do n't know that it 's actually in LA or that theyve driven through it before . This questions works out great because it tests that knowledge . <p> So we 've talked about four different subjects that you can approach to write a great quiz about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different unique qualities that make it awesome and different , so coming up with questions should n't be too hard ! <p> To make a quiz like the one talked about in this article , head to tryinteract.com 
@@22713628 @2713628/ <h> How to make a sports quiz <p> Sports are awesome , and the websites dedicated to them are beacons of light in a sea of internet junk . It makes sense then that these great sites should have the best form of content known to the human race quizzes . <p> Fortunately there 's a lot of material for sports quizzes " What kind of fan are you ? " " Which player are you ? " " Do you really know about our team ? " these are just a few of the vast possibilities when it comes to sports quizzes . <p> While the topics may be simple enough to come up with , there 's a wide variety of quality in sports quizzes , which is the result of some quizzes being built well while others fall short . <p> My goal with this guide is to give you some data-backed guidelines to help make the perfect quiz for your sports website . <h> Part 1 : Setting up a sports quiz <p> Before you do anything , you should know why you are running a quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by linking out to various articles based on the results shown ? Is it to collect new email leads by having a lead capture form in your quiz ? Is it to kick off a new campaign or promotion on your site ? Quizzes are fun by themselves , but if you really want to deliver value they also have to have a purpose . <p> Titles : Start specific , stay specific . Its never a good idea to try and reach everyone with a quiz you create . Its much easier to create a quiz that 10,000 people really enjoy than one that 1 million people really enjoy . What will happen if you try to reach a million people with your sports quiz is that they will not care about it enough to share their results , and might not even spend the time to take the quiz . <p> Let me give you an example from Boston.com , they made a quiz " What kind of Patriots fan are you ? " which is super specific to Patriots fans ( I 'm a Broncos fan and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , what the quiz did is reach a group of people who care deeply about the Patriots , and it was a success . <p> If your site focuses on a specific team , keep the quiz on that team , if you are a general sports news or entertainment site , focus on one team at a time and do n't  worry about not catering to everyone else . Its better to really entertain one group than to try and somewhat entertain everyone . <p> Questions : know your audience . Continuing on the idea of reaching one very interested audience at a time , make sure your questions are worded in a way that resonates with fans of whatever team you are focusing on . <p> In the Patriots quiz I mentioned above , the quiz questions specifically refer to Tom Brady and make subtle jokes about other teams . This creates a " grouping " effect that effectively connects all Patriots fans who have a common understanding of their team and its players . <p> The key to accomplishing a jovial quiz like this is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how they talk . Once you know those things , word the questions like you know your audience already talks and you 'll develop instant rapport . <p> Results and sharing . A quiz that catches on with either Facebook or Twitter can see hundreds of thousands of views in one day , in fact , social traffic accounts for more than 75% of all quiz traffic <p> Think of your quiz results as an " audition to be shared , " you have a small piece of text to be able to convince your quiz takers that they should share their results and amplify the reach of your quiz . There are a couple of ways to nail this " audition " <p> 1 . Be very kind . I say kind because " nice " is an over-used term that has connotations with false reinforcement . What I mean is to be genuinely positive with the wording of your quiz results . Focus on the good aspects of each result and describe them in detail . <p> For example , one of the quiz results in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full-head tattoo guy , which I 'll admit can be off-putting to people . However , the description only focuses on how loyal you are to your team , and avoids the parts about being a bit crazy for getting a full-head tattoo . <p> 2 . Have a follow-up . Provide a link to check out more information in each quiz result . Think about the mindset of your quiz taker when they get to the resultstheyve just answered some personal ( but still fun ) questions about themselves . They are very keen to hear what you have to say about them . Your little quiz result probably is n't enough to satisfy that curiosity , so having a link to check out more content or a video that applies to their personality type is much needed . <h> Part 2 : Sharing and maximizing your impact <p> The best social shares have images , on Twitter , tweets with images get 18% more clicks , on Facebook , the number is even higher . When you share out your quiz , be sure to add an image manually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add images to personal Facebook accounts , but not to business accounts ) . <p> Also , be sure to use the " closed loop " method we 've developed here at Interact to make sure you do n't  lose any of your traffic to those social shares . This method works in three easy steps .

With the staff 's attire , characters everywhere , and music accompanying your every step , it really does seem like you 've been transported into a whole new world . Disney tries very hard to take you out of your universe and into theirs . And let 's be honest , it works . If you somehow find yourself unhappy at Disneyland " well , that 's just impressive . <p> But what is the one device that we all constantly carry on us that can take us out of this curated world with just the swipe of our finger ? Ah yes , the smart phone . <p> No matter how hard Disney tries , they ca n't prevent you from easily whipping that iPhone out in line for Space Mountain to check on your friend 's photos or that recent comment on your instagram , and that is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of their world and back into your own , and that takes away from the experience they are trying to set up at the park . <p> This has actually become an issue . With distractions in the immersive experience , Disney can no longer keep your head in their perfectly crafted universe . It creates a tension between their world and your own , and that is negative on them . But what 's the solution from their side ? It 's not like they can just prevent you from using a cell phone at the park . <p> Well , what if they created their own mobile experience ? If they ca n't stop you from using your smart phone , they might as well make it a part of the experience as a whole . <p> Now you could say that all of this is an interesting examination that I 've made on what is going on between the mobile and physical Disneyland park experience , but Disney has created something in an attempt to enter into the mobile experience . So what they have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Let 's take a look at the app . It 's very well designed , and as you probably may have guessed , the entire premise of the app is centered around quizzes . Disney has loads of quizzes available for you to take , ranging from Which Disney Dog Are You ? ' to Where Should Your Disney Honeymoon Be ' and even includes Which Pretty Little Liar Are You ? ' which does n't necessarily directly have to do with Disney , but with one of their more mature programs that airs on ABC . <p> Every single quiz gives you a response based on the questions you answer , and every time you take a quiz Disney records your responses and creates a little character profile for you in your Me ' section . <p> I 'm not going to lie , taking the quizzes is pretty fun and they have some great writers working on them , because the subject matter is excellent . While you 're at the park , you really do feel like you 're adding to your Disney experience by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly have to do with the park itself , so sometimes you ca n't fully finish a quiz unless you 've spent time around Disneyland . <p> The questions are accompanied by nice images up top , and easy to press large buttons to answer the questions .

There must be plenty of avenues that Disney could potentially stroll down , so why quizzes as the first point of interaction ?

We have already seen how much quizzes have affected the social media world , and how their share and completion rates are much higher than one might think .

' which might be one of the earliest quizzes you remember being on your Facebook feed right when quizzes started to catch on . With an absolute load of content , Disney does n't have a tough time coming up with new quizzes across all their different forms of TV shows and movies . <p> I see this expanding quite a bit , with specific quizzes being reached out to certain audiences , including quizzes that are exclusive to the park , older classics and also brand new shows that are currently on the Disney channel . <p> Disney is just one of the many companies that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create interaction amongst its users .

@@22713631 @2713631/ <h> How to make a political quiz <p> Political quizzes are some of the best quizzes that get made . Its such a natural fit given the wide range of personalities that are present in politics . At Interact , politics is the subject of nearly 15% of all quizzes made and we 've seen several quizzes go viral , hitting hundreds of thousands of views . <p> The most common and popular form of political quiz is the political personality test . " Which candidate are you ? " " Which president are you ? " and so on . Not only do these quizzes benefit from the natural appeal of personality type quizzes , but they also have an added twist with the underlying rivalry of politics . <h> Write a title that stands out on social media <p> Quizzes get most of their traffic from social media , so optimizing your title to stand out is key . Luckily you have it pretty easy for political quizzes there are two things you can do . <p> 1 . The " Which are you ? " Quiz : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been made and re-made with success each time . Even better , this type of quiz is evergreen , there 's always elections going on , so you never lose . <p> 2 . " Do you really know about ? " Quiz : " How much do you know about Iran ? " for example , is a politically fueled quiz that really took off on social media . With this type of quiz you are going for shock value . Often with politics its surprising how little people actually know , and you can use a quiz to exemplify that . <h> Write questions that entertain on their own <p> 1 . Images/gifs. 100% of the top 100 Interact quizzes have at least one image question . If you look at the example below , I think that number makes a lot of sense the experience of an image question is akin to a lot of games where you click on items . This makes your quiz questions fun in their own right apart from anything else . <p> 2 . Personal questions . People really enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say in our lives will be about our own person . Let people tell you about themselves in your quiz . Sometimes there 's a hitch on how much you should ask personal questions , but remember that quizzes are anonymous and you can make your quiz more engaging by asking personal questions . <p> 3 . Ridiculous questions . I do n't  really mean " ridiculous " in the sense of the word as its pertained as absurd . What I mean is to let your guard down a bit and drop some of the political speak . Remember that a quiz is a one-on-one conversation with the person who is taking the quiz , so drop some of the formality and put on your toned down voice . <h> Collect information to stay in touch <p> Email remains one of the most powerful marketing mediums , and there are famous studies about how President Obamas recent campaign benefited greatly from a strong email marketing effort . That 's why we offer the opportunity to collect email addresses with our quiz builder , so you to can use this strategy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy , collecting thousands of contacts , while others barely manage to get a few new people . Fortunately , there 's a few distinct differences between good and bad email collection campaigns , here 's what they are . <p> 1 . Relevancy . Within a quiz you are able to have a discussion as you ask questions and the quiz taker responds in real time . This develops some small level of rapport , which can be leveraged when it comes time to " seal the deal " and collect an email address . However , you do n't  get to use any of that if your email call to action has nothing to do with the subject of the quiz . This is one area where our example quiz could actually use improvement . Instead of saying " Enter your email to see your results " it could be " Enter your email to get updates from famous Republicans " ( which is what the quiz is about ) <p> 2 . Draw . One reason quizzes can be so successful at lead generation is that they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeten the pot even more , you can add your own addition . Again , you want it to be relevant to your quiz , so for example in our quiz we are following it could be " Get exclusive updates from famous republicans . " <p> 3 . Trust . If you are asking someone for their information , they need to know you are n't  sketchy . Trust with political quizzes can come from your organization , the candidate you are representing , our your party as a whole , just make sure you mention your brand either with the logo or with your words . <h> Create results worth sharing so your quiz can be amplified <p> Quizzes can really only grow by having their results shared . Hypothetically , if one of every ten people takes your quiz and share their results , and that share drives more than ten people back to your quiz , and one of every ten of those people shares their results , you get a viral quiz , by definition . However , its up to you to write quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your reach for you . Some quizzes do this very well , here 's how . <p> 1 . Positive writing . Being uplifting in quiz results is positively correlated with getting more social shares . This is one area where political quizzes always seem to do well , but in case you were looking for specific pointers , here 's how the strategy works . Pick out one or two really good elements of each quiz result . For example , in the republican quiz we are following , theyve honed in on the fact that Dwayne Johnson is a " jock " type who is also a genuinely nice human . <p> Once you 've identified the good , focus on it and avoid the bad , do n't  even mention any negative elements of a quiz result . That way you are n't  saying anything that is n't honest , but still being very positive . <p> 2 . Simple sharing . There is a formula for how quiz results get shared . It goes " I got ( my result ) ( title of the quiz ) " make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 140 characters or you avoid over-complicating sharing . <p> 3 . Images . 90% of the top 100 Interact quizzes use images in the results . Quizzes are a highly visual medium and people expect to see a picture of their result , especially when its a personality type quiz . Make sure you follow the exact image specifications and use professional quality pictures . <p> Quizzes make a lot of sense in politics because of how many people are involved and how many issues are at stake which people do n't  understand very well . I 've personally seen political quizzes go viral and this guide is meant to give you the tools to make your own success story . 
@@22713632 @2713632/ <h> How to make a Facebook quiz <p> My normal , professional friends have been reduced to machines that cant help but post about what kind of Shrimp they are or which political candidate they are most like lately . If sharing quizzes were a disease , we would have an epidemic . <p> What does that mean for your business ? And more specifically for your marketing plan ? How do companies tap into Facebook quizzes ? <p> The answer is to get involved for yourself and create quizzes that bridge the gap between entertainment and practical marketing to increase the reach of your online marketing efforts . To accomplish this , you need a strategy or creating and implementing Facebook quizzes . Some companies choose to do one every week , others make one quiz and have it as part of their website as a permanent fixture . <p> Any way you choose to use a quiz , you first have to make that quiz and get it shared on Facebook ( the social network is responsible for more than 50% of all traffic to quizzes ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 2 million visits from Facebook , here are the keys to creating an excellent Facebook quiz . <h> 1 . Follow the 3 rules of writing for social media <h> First , use data to write a great title <p> This seems like it makes no sense , titles that get shared a lot on social media are super interesting and controversial , so why would you include data , which is sleep-worthy ? Well it turns out that companies who consistently produce amazing quizzes , like Buzzfeed and Zimbio , follow rules for writing titles . Check them out and be in the now . <p> Rule #1 : Challenge people <p> Titles containing the word " actually " get nearly double the traffic over those without . Our explanation is that people like a challenge , its a break from the norm and , well , challenging . Quizzes that can become little games where you can win or lose far outperform those that do n't  . <p> This one makes intuitive sense , think about two titles " What job should you do ? " versus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should Actually have " the second one just grabs you more . <p> To show exactly what kind of an effect this quiz title has on views , we took 1500 quizzes built using Interact and separated them into two categories ; one where the titles had the word " actually " and one where they did n't  . The change in average views is dramatic and really shows the power this kind of title can have . <p> Rule #2 : Name drop <p> The second kind of quiz title that always stands out on Facebook is the celebrity comparison title . Quizzes like " Which celebrity are you ? " from StyleCraze have reached more than 50,000 views almost entirely from social traffic . <p> Because we are exposed to so much celebrity talk on Facebook anyways , a quiz comparing people to celebrities is natural and the numbers back that up . <p> We ran a test to see what kind of an effect the celebrity comparison title could have on overall quiz views . Again we divided 1400 quizzes into two categories , one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quizzes got nearly ten times as much traffic on average . Now there are definitely a lot of reasons for that , and I 'm not saying that adding the word " celebrity " is an automatic way to get a lot of views , but in our study it did make a significant difference . <p> Rule #3 : Encourage introspection <p> The " Which ( blank ) are you ? " quiz is one of the oldest and continuously most popular quiz title templates . Its also an extremely versatile title you can use for almost every business . <p> This title template is also statistics verified . When a quiz title has all three words " which " " are " and " you " it gets an average of 1154 views per quiz compared to an average of 488 views when not all three words appeared in a quiz title ( for reference the average quiz on Interact gets about 600 views ) . <h> Second , speak naturally <p> Facebook is a social network , no one wants to hear your overly formal content pitch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worded like you normally talk it will get more views , and that 's science . To prove this science , we figured out how people normally talk . Most of the time we talk about ourselves ( about 60% of the time ) . When we talk about ourselves we use words like " I " " we " and " you " a lot . <p> Therefore , we ran a test to compare quiz views with the number of times those words are in the content of a quiz . Heres what happened . <p> Speaking like a human really helps . Now if you 're like " great , so just say " I " a lot ? " then think of it this way when you write a quiz question ask yourself if you would ask that question the same way if you were speaking to a friend at a pub , if you would n't then rewrite it . <p> Check out the example quiz question below . Its not over-complicated or overly goofy or anything like that , but it does flow nicely . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what you should be doing , its also the most effective way to drive traffic from Facebook . <p> So how does one be " nice " ? I 'm referring to the results of your quiz where you tell people how they scored or give them their personality type . This is where you want to be very liberal with uplifting words , because you are essentially giving a judgment to the quiz taker . <p> Writing positive quiz results does not mean lying , but rather focusing on the good and forgetting the bad . Take for example the quiz result below , its a big rig truck . Now the quiz writer could have said things about being big , bulky , and slow but instead they focus on pride , reliability and intelligence . That 's how you write kind results . <p> Now as I said before , I 'm not just saying you should be nice for the sake of being nice . We analyzed 2000 tweets that originated from quiz results ( tweets appear in the same format as Facebook shares ) . Our goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive , we categorized positive as containing trigger words such as " awesome " " great " " smart " etc . <p> A full 75% of the quiz results that got shared were positive . <h> - <h> 2 . Promote the quiz and stay involved in the conversation <p> When it comes to actually posting your quiz on Facebook , you have two options . The first is to share on your timeline , which is what you are probably most familiar with , and the second is to put the quiz in a Facebook tab , which makes it a more permanent part of your Facebook business page . <p> Option #1 <p> This is the most common option and also the easiest way to share a quiz on Facebook . When you share the quiz on Facebook the best way is to share an image of the quiz with a link and a custom snippet talking about the quiz . With Interact paid plans , you 'll be able to keep all your traffic by embedding the quiz on your website and setting the share link to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interact page . <p> Option #2 <p> You can actually embed a quiz into a custom Facebook tab ( guide for that here ) . This works well if you have a subject that makes sense to be a more permanent part of your Facebook presence like the example below where CalRecycle uses a recycling personality quiz as a permanent fixture on their page to keep fans engaged . <p> When embedding a quiz on Facebook , always be sure to link back to your website from the quiz results so you are still benefiting from that traffic . <h> That 's it , making a Facebook quiz is not that difficult ! Now go make a quiz of your own at Interact

I know that 's not a very precise definition of publisher , but it serves a purpose here . I want to throw some ideas out there on ways to use quizzes in your line of work . The reason being that I get a lot of inquiries about what kinds of quizzes content producers should be making and I want to provide some resources . <p> 1 . Create a quiz for your book . Author Coreene Callahan has written quite a few books , and she uses quizzes to promote them in places like the USA Today . Books and movies are the perfect candidates for personality quizzes because the characters in the stories serve as your personality types . All you really have to do is correlate some questions to the personalities and you 're done . <p> 2 .

Forbes put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of school you should attend , and then links the quiz out to their college adviser tool , which has been a staple on their site for a long time running . This example , like the book one above , is a method of promoting a product with a quiz . <p> 3 . ABC15 Arizona Quiz- News site ABC 15 Phoenix decided to have a little fun with their audience by determining which city people should live in . ABC 15 is constantly reporting on different cities throughout the state and using a quiz to guide people to one is an excellent use of material . <p> The method they used is guiding people to a specific area .

As a marketer in the industry you 're responsible for hitting ever-increasing quotas of new leads and it can feel like a hamster wheel of constant effort not leading to the results you want . <p> Today I 'm going to show exactly how five different higher ed institutions are generating new student prospects using quizzes . Then well walk through how you can do the same thing at your university . By the end of this article you 'll be able to create , implement , and promote a quiz that drives new students into your school . <p> This private school offers a variety of nursing and health programs . Each one fits a unique style , and different students enjoy different programs . The quiz they created helps prospective students find the program they are most likely to enjoy based on their personality traits . In order to see which degree is recommended , the student has to give their name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with students who take the quiz and talks to them about their recommended major . <p> Why it worked . The continuity of it all is what made this quiz such a success ( 50% conversion rate ) . A prospective student is on the Ei College website , takes the quiz , gets a call , and talks about their interests . These are all things the student wants , and the quiz makes it a fluid process . <h> How it generates new student prospects <p> Eastern International is n't shy about the fact that they are going to call if you if you opt-in . However , because there quiz solves such a real problem for prospects , that 's not an issue . They have been able to drive hundreds of new calls through this quiz because it is direct and to the point when it comes to helping out the student . <p> This University of Cincinnati quiz is eerily similar to the one from Ei College , and that 's not by mistake . It turns out you can pretty much just create a " Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to generate leads with positive ROI . This quiz from UC is for their school of public health , and helps students find the right major to fit their personality . <p> Why it works . UC does a good job of reconciling the quiz takers personality to their quiz result . They make it obvious that you are " Investigative " for example , and that 's why you are being recommended certain majors over others . <h> How it generates new student leads <p> At the end of the quiz there is a lead capture form for students who are interested in learning more about their recommended majors . Because these recommendation pages are personalized and speak directly to the person taking the quiz , conversions are strong . <p> Seeing a trend here ? " Ca n't decide on which degree is right for you ? Take our quiz and find out ! " This is literally the same quiz template as the last two , but applied to film school instead of health or nursing . There 's something very personal about deciding on a major , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Answering that question is an excellent thing to trade for a lead . <h> How it generates new student leads <p> The LA Film school plays the long game on their quiz . Instead of asking for a lead in return for the quiz results , they simply link to an application form where the prospect can turn themselves into a lead by applying . The reason for this <p> Harvard attracts new students because it is Harvard . What I mean is that you cant go more than a few days following the news or media without seeing some study conducted by Harvard . They are all over the place and that 's how they maintain their brand value . One of the recent additions to the vast repertoire of brand awareness campaigns is quizzes . Harvard runs polls that find really interesting facts about health in America and then turns those facts into knowledge quizzes that discover how much someone really knows about what 's happening . <p> Why it worked . It shows that Harvard is a leader in the world of health . For students thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain this quiz acts as yet another reminder of who is coming out with the latest research and findings . <h> How it generates new students <p> just a subtle link to check out the School of Public health site at Harvard . From there you can opt-in to get other articles and quizzes , but the connection is really meant to be optional . <p> Of course Stanford is doing something about the drought in California . <h> How it drives new student leads <p> Stanford takes a very traditionally " Stanford " approach to marketing using this quiz . Other than the fact that its made by Stanford and shared on their social channels , there 's really no direct connection between the quiz and the student , but at the same time there is . The reason Stanford attracts the top talent is because if its name , and quizzes like this are very subtle ways of showing that the University is a thought leader . <h> 4 steps to making a quiz that drives new students to your university . <p> So these quizzes all look excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all basically the same thing repackaged for each University , but what exactly is that " thing " ? What makes a quiz that converts well versus one that sucks ? In the interest of not over-complicating things and not boring you all to death , Ive broken down what makes an excellent higher ed quiz into five steps . <p> 1 . Solve a problem only a quiz can <p> A quiz is interactive content . Its a scripted conversation between two people you , the writer , and the prospect , a potential student for your institution . ( side note , I say scripted , but do n't  read into that as a bad thing . Check out legendary football coach Bill Parcels book The Score Takes Care of Itself to find out why ) Because a quiz is a bottled conversation , you have the ability to help answer questions that simply ca n't be answered without some sort of back-and-forth . <p> There are basically three of these questions you can answer with a quiz . <p> 1 . " Which degree should I pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student , and not one that you can answer without knowing something about the person . A degree is the key to a career , and students often ponder this question well after they even start school . A quiz can help make the decision by matching the students Myers-Briggs personality type to a major that fits the attributes of the personality . <p> 2 . " What job is right for me ? " This one works well for post-secondary school systems and such , where people are thinking more about careers than just the courses . The setup is virtually the same though , using personality scoring to match attributes to careers . <p> 3 . " Which school should I go to ? " For Higher Ed mentoring and counseling systems like Noodle , a quiz about where to actually go to school is a really cool thing to offer and a way to break the ice with potential customers . <p> 2 . Build trust through a scripted conversation <p> Again , scripted is not bad , scripted is a good thing when done right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would you rather ? " question that is both humanizing and thought provoking for the right person who is considering a career in the medical field and has to decide what they like and do n't  like about it . <p> By breaking down the barriers of interaction with quiz questions that ask for preferences , tastes , etc , you can begin to build the connection with a potential student that could end in them coming to your higher ed institution . <p> 3 . Ask for something very small in return for something very big <p> Lead generation is a barter economy . The prospect has something you want ( the rights and information to contact them ) , and you have something they want ( in this case the answer to the question your quiz answers ) . In an ideal higher ed quiz , you 've done such a good job of answering a hard question with your quiz that someones contact information is a small " price " to pay in return . <p> 4 . Follow up promptly and personally <p> The best Universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end of a quiz the prospect is very interested in your place of learning and wants to talk about it . If you wait hours to ever call , the person will likely have forgotten all about the quiz and no longer be interested . <p> You 'll also want to mention the quiz result that the person got . Often the student will have questions about the degree or career that 's recommended and if you 're there to talk about it , that 's the beginning of a longer conversation that could lead to a new student . 
@@22713636 @2713636/ <h> How to make a quiz for your food website or blog <p> Quizzes can be a huge boost to your food sites traffic . Food and beverage blogs and websites rely heavily on traffic to fund advertisements and sell products , so making a name for yourself is vital , and quizzes can help with that . <p> In this guide I 'll go over how to go about creating an excellent quiz for your site as well as ways to implement that quiz on Facebook , Twitter , and your own site . <h> Part 1 : How to make a food quiz <p> 1 . Picking a topic <p> Getting the right topic can make or break any quiz . One of the pioneers of great food quizzes , Food52.com , came up with just the right formula for picking quiz topics that are winners . They work backwards , starting with top performing articles or recipes . <p> Let me explain , Food52 will pick the top five cake recipes , and then create a quiz " What type of cake are you ? " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only get to re-use great content , but they know the quiz will be of interest since those articles already performed well on their own . <p> 2 Writing the title <p> With Interact , you can make two kinds of quizzes , a multiple choice quiz where users answer questions that have one correct answer , and personality quizzes , where users answer a series of questions before being presented with one of several personality types . <p> Let 's look at title templates for each type of quiz and an example of each . <p> For personality , the " Which ( blank ) are you ? " title : The one subject we rarely tire of hearing about is ourselves . We enjoy introspection and finding out what/who we are . That 's why titles like this work so well , even for food . <p> Take , for example , the quiz below , created by NextGlass to help spread the word about their drinking app . Its called " Who is your famous drinking ego ? " which is an adaptation of this title template . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if they are actually James Bond ? And its not just this quiz that performs well , quizzes with this title template get nearly double the traffic of an average quiz . <p> For multiple choice , " Which of these is true ? " controversy is a constant part of food . Whether its some new ingredient or a diet fad that 's taking Hollywood by storm , we are always coming up with some new way to keep the foodie affairs alive . <p> This is great news for your food site , it always gives you a way to make quizzes . All you have to do is take a controversy , like fad diets , and ask people to identify which one is real and which one is made up . <p> This quiz , from SenseAboutScience , was a hit and got the host site links from The Guardian , The Telegraph , and several other major publications because it hit on a controversy . <p> 3 . Preparing questions <p> The one thing that truly sets quizzes apart from any other content on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have them respond in real time . Its as if you are able to have a short conversation with all your visitors without ever uttering a word . <p> You want to take advantage of this opportunity and get to know your readers better so that when the time comes to ask them to opt in or purchase a product , they have a personal connection . <p> The absolute best way to do this is by speaking naturally . What I mean by speaking naturally is to talk like you would to a friend in a bar . This is called the pub rule , if your quiz question would n't be appropriate to ask to a friend at a pub , do n't  ask it in your quiz . <p> 4 . Writing Results <p> Every quiz result should be positive , and you should n't have to lie . If you had n't  noticed the pattern already , quiz results that get the most shares all have a positive tone to them . We even ran a test , and found that 75% of tweets originating from quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent . " <p> What that means for your food quiz is that each quiz result should be crafted in a way that does n't  sound ridiculous , but still exhibits positivity . Take for example the quiz result below which tells me Im Ice Cream cake . Not only does the result have an awesome image that makes me really want Ice Cream cake , but it also has a somewhat humorous and totally flattering description . <p> 5 . Following up <p> One big thing that people forget when creating quizzes is to keep the conversation going . Think about the user experience of a quiz your quiz takers answer personal questions and then are handed a result , which you describe to them in a positive way . <p> However , people are still primed for more , and are in a perfect position to continue the conversation . That 's why its important to have links in each quiz result to learn more and continue engaging with your brand . <p> When I discussed quiz topics earlier , I suggested to start with articles you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 's one good way to provide a follow-up . You can also provide links to personalized products if you have them . <h> Part 2 : How to share and embed your food quiz <p> Once your quiz is created , its time to share that thing with the world . There are several ways to do this and I 'll cover best practices for each . <p> 1 . Facebook . <p> When you initially share your quiz on Facebook , it will look different than when your quiz takers share their results . You are going to want to share an image along with the quiz title and a link to the quiz on your site . <p> Do n't  forget the image ! Sharing an image gets twice as many clicks and likes . <p> 2 . Twitter <p> Is basically the same method as Facebook . Weirdly , some quizzes do really well on Twitter but not Facebook , so make sure to do both . Grab the quiz url , which is available after creating a quiz with Interact , and share it along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share the cover image , tweets with images get 18% more clicks on average , and Ive seen it make even bigger differences than that . <p> 3 . Your site <p> Embedding quizzes on your site is slightly more difficult , not like science difficult , but like more than 10 seconds difficult . Luckily , we 've created an entire guide on that . 
@@22713637 @2713637/ <h> How to make a quiz widget <p> here 's the definition of widget from the most reliable of websites , Wikipedia . <p> In- computing , a- web widget- is a- software widget- for the web . Its a small application with limited functionality that can be installed and executed within a web page by an- end user . <p> So let 's look at how you can make a quiz widget that becomes part of your web page to increase interaction on your site , get more social shares , and collect new leads ( not a bad trio of things to achieve for your website ) . <h> Part 1 : Making the quiz <p> So here 's a good example of a quiz widget ( picture below ) . You can see its a page on Forbes.com and there 's a quiz there that can be clicked on and taken right within the page without having to navigate away . Because Forbes was able to put this quiz into a page on their own domain and utilize the authority that comes with being a Forbes page , this quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Google and the quiz has been taken over 133,000 times . <p> So how did this quiz get made in the first place ? You cant just write it like a blog article or record it like a video , there 's more involved . Luckily , it all comes down to a handful of simple steps which we will walk through together . <p> 1 . A good title <p> It all starts with a title . When some random person sees a quiz pop up in a Facebook news feed , 4 out of 5 times they will decide whether they want to click the link based on the title . Because quizzes do n't  have a huge amount of variation , there are a few types of quiz titles that just work . <p> 1 . The " Which ( blank ) are you ? " title : " Which room in a house are you ? " ( actual quiz with tens of thousands of views ) . This title can be adapted to virtually anything from trucks to clothing styles . Quizzes using this exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so give it a try . <p> 2 . " How much do you know about ? " " How much do you know about Iran ? " ( again an actual quiz with hundreds of thousands of views ) . This title challenges people to see if they can pass your test and appeals to the fighter in all of us . <p> 2 . Questions <p> Think about this , when else do you get to ask your prospective customers a bunch of questions apart from actual phone calls ? Granted a quiz does n't  have the same level of intimacy that a personal phone call does , but the outcome in both cases is that you learn about who is interested in your product . To maximize this opportunity , follow a few best practices . <p> 1 . think about what you can learn <p> As marketers any information we can get about our audience is supremely valuable . When writing your quiz , think about what you can learn by asking each of the questions . For example , take a look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does your website fall into ? " By asking that question I not only make my quiz better ( I can set up the results to pinpoint specific people ) , but I also learn some valuable information about my customers . <p> 2. speak personally <p> Remember that a quiz is a one-to-one method of communication , you are speaking directly to a person , not to a group of people who read your stuff ( as is the case for articles like this one ) . Let 's look at an example from our Forbes quiz we were investigating earlier . ( by the way this quiz has 133k views and holds the number one spot for the term " college quiz " which is no sweat ) . <p> The question picture below comes from that quiz and sounds just like something you might ask a friend who is soon to be heading off to school . That 's the idea , and its called the Pub Rule , which means you should never ask a question in a quiz that would n't be cool to ask a friend while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much <p> 6-12 questions is fine , anymore and people will get bored and leave . It does n't  matter how important it is that you have 50 questions in your template , no one wants to take that quiz . <p> 2.5 Lead generation ( optional step ) <p> 3 . Results <p> People share the results of a quiz ( or they do n't  share it , if its not good ) . Ideally you make quiz results that are good , and then you get shared . there are three things you need to maximize the chances of having good results . <p> 1 . A clever title <p> Because of the formula for quiz social sharing " I got ( my result ) ( title of the quiz ) " the titles of your results are equally as important as the title of the quiz . Luckily your best bet here is to just be honest and straightforward , no need for fanciness . <p> 2 . Positivity <p> Just be nice to people . No one wants to share a quiz result on Facebook that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share a quiz result on Facebook that says they should go to Harvard . A strong trend among quizzes built with Interact is that the ones with more positive results end up with more social shares , its just science . <p> 3 . A call to action <p> The biggest mistake you can make when creating a quiz is not providing a follow-up . What I mean by follow-up is a call to action inside your quiz results that links out to another page on your website where people can learn more about their quiz result and continue reading . Because quizzes are so addictive and people are quite curious to learn more about their quiz result once its given , links in quiz results have astronomically high click-through rates . <h> Part 2 : Putting it on your website <p> Quizzes embed into your site through an iframe the same way as a youtube video would work . This makes it simple to add a quiz to any type of website from WordPress to Wix to custom builds . <h> Part 3 : Sharing it out so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Facebook is the main driver of quiz traffic . The success of your quiz basically comes down to whether or not you can get people to share their results on the social network . however , before you start any of that , you have to share the quiz on Facebook for the first time . the example below comes from a high performing quiz created by country music nation , and they show how you can share a quiz on Facebook effectively . <p> All you have to do is come up with a clever caption to announce the quiz , upload an image that represents the quiz , and include a link to take it on your website .

Only thing is , you have to have stuff to send out in your email campaigns . Your customers might be interested in your product updates , sure , but will that really get a conversation going and be effective marketing ? <p> I 've gotten a lot of questions about how to use quizzes in email campaigns , so I 'm going to do a step-by-step walk through of how to send out a quiz using Mailchimp ( the other programs are very similar in setup ) . <p> Whew , now that we 've got that out of the way we can focus on how to get your quiz into your email campaign in a fluid and attractive way . What 's essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you are sharing a link to the quiz in a nice way . <p> In my example campaign below , I 've included a screenshot of what the quiz looks like along with a bit of text that explains what 's going on and a button that links out to my quiz . <p> 3 . Send it out <p> Once you 've got everything ready to go , you just send the campaign like you normally would , no rocket science here ( unless that happens to be your business ) <p> 4 . Traffic comes back to you <p> Visitors who click through to your quiz will get one of two experiences . The first one is a page like I have pictured below where the quiz takes up the entire web page and is the only thing on the web page . This is the default view for interact quizzes ( that are n't on the free plan ) . We set up pages like this so you do n't have to have a blog or website to run a quiz , you can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below here , where the quiz is embedded into my blog . This is the option I actually recommend , as it ensures you get people on your site and provides an opportunity for them to continue checking out pages on your domain . <p> - <p> 5 . Rinse and repeat. - <p> Not every quiz is a hit . We 've seen customers try three or four times before creating the quiz masterpiece that got 25,000 views . Use the analytics that Interact provides to see which questions were popular and which were n't , then try again . <p> Sometimes , it just clicks and you have a great experience . One person who had such an experience was Pam Mills from the Denver School of Hypnotherapy . <p> I just happened to stumble on Josh 's quizzes and thought they were not only fun , but they were also a good way to connect with my customers , so I downloaded the link to one of the quizzes ( what color are you ) and put it in our newsletter . I could n't have dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open/click rate that we have received in several years ! We even had some customers email us saying how much they enjoyed the quiz . I knew our newsletters were getting a little old and stale , I just did n't know how to spice them up , and now I do ! I would encourage everyone to either use one the ready made quizzes or to create one of your own industry specific quizzes . This is a great sight that I hope tons and tons of people use . Thank you Josh

@@22713641 @2713641/ <h> Using quizzes at events for lead generation : Everything you need to know <p> So you 're going to an event and want to use a quiz as a way to attract people to your booth and then collect some information from them to follow up after all the excitement dies down . Good for you , this is a good idea , ( or at least I think it is ) . However , there are quite a few things to think about if you want to get this right and pull it off with effectiveness . ( okay its not that bad , but there are some pieces to the puzzle ) <h> 1 . Create <p> I 'm going to walk through all of this with you to try and eliminate any difficulty ( hopefully I do n't  make it more difficult ) . In my scenario I 'm going to be playing the part of Gamer Packaging , a rigid packaging distributor who specializes in all aspects of packaging for the Craft Beer industry . Let 's dive in . <p> First , I design my quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look on an iPad like you see a preview of in the screenshot above . I want the quiz to be nice and visually appealing , but not overdo it . I also add my own logo to the quiz so people associate it with my booth . <p> I named my quiz " How does your package stack up ? " to be intentionally a bit brash , obviously that 's a choice you have to make when you decide the overall look and feel of your booth at the event , so pick a personality . <p> Second , I create questions. - <p> My hypothetical quiz is one that asks people how much they know about packaging on their products , with the end goal of getting them on my email list so I can send them more information about packaging and up-sell my own services . Now I do n't  actually know anything about packaging , so if you do , do n't  judge me . <p> For my example quiz ( which is embedded at the bottom of this post ) I decided to do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you either do this or just all image questions when we did a study of the top 100 quizzes ever made with Interact , we found that all 100 had at least one image question . <p> Third , craft results <p> In my quiz I chose to embed a short video on the results that has the founder of the company saying a few words about packaging and its importance to selling product . You can do images , text , have links out , or do a video like I did . <p> Fourth , Set up lead capture <p> This is what were all here for . Quizzes can be an excellent way to " break the ice " when it comes to asking for contact information from people who visit your booth . I know this because I 've run a table at a conference where we were using a quiz as a lead generation mechanism and brought in 30 solid leads in one hour before I lost my voice from yelling ( it was a conference with a lot of alcohol ) . You can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The email capture form is simple and to the point . It says exactly what we want to do ( send one email each week ) and it only asks for what I need ( name and email address ) . When it comes to lead capture , the best policy is honesty , tell people what you want to do with their information and provide a skip link in case they are n't  interested , that way you only get strong leads and do n't  have to worry about spamming anyone . <p> Fifth , tell people how they did- <p> So now that you 've gotten contact information from the person who 's taking your quiz ( and remember , they are doing this while there at your booth at the conference ) . You now have to tell the person what their result is . You can do this in a variety of ways . <h> 2 . Display <p> So we just spent a good amount of time finding/creating images , writing questions , crafting results , and writing a compelling opt-in offer to get people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to actually set up the display for the quiz at the actual event . <h> 3 . Follow-up <p> Capturing the persons contact information is just the beginning of the journey . The real work begins when you begin starting conversations with the prospect in the hopes of turning that person into a long-term paying customer . <p> Let 's go back to our example quiz . Let 's say someone scored a " Not bad , but we can help " and they also filled out the name and email address portions of the lead capture form . You 'll want to send an email the next day or within a few days addressing the person by name and referencing their quiz result . <p> For example : <p> " Hi John ( name ) , thanks for stopping by our booth last week at the Craft Beer Conference , we hope you enjoyed our quiz . Here are a few packaging designs to get your new ideas flowing , feel free to reply directly to this email if you 'd like to chat about design , were here anytime ! "

@@22713643 @2713643/ <p> - To create a quiz like the one shown in this tutorial , head over to- tryinteract.com . <p> It is one of my goals in life to become one of those coffee- connoisseurs who knows the difference between Brazilian and Guatemalan beans , but for now I rely on other people to tell me what coffee to buy . There are 130 million coffee drinkers in the USA alone . That means there are millions of other clueless coffee consumers out there like me . Us confused coffee lovers need guidance , and that is where your quiz comes in . A quiz on your website turns these bewildered buyers into confident clients . <p> dreamatico.com/coffee <p> A quiz will serve you in two major ways . First , it will personalize your product for customers which has been proved to- significantly increasing sales ; second , it is a quick and simple way to generate leads . It is ridiculously easy to create a quiz that will cater to your goals ; there are just 13 simple steps you can follow to produce a witty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Creating Your Quiz : The Process <p> Step 1 : What Kind Of Quiz Do You Want ? <p> You have two options , multiple choice or personality . " How much do you actually know about coffee ? " is an example of a multiple choice quiz ; and " Which coffee should you actually be drinking ? " is an example of a personality quiz . With witty questions and positive well thought out results either style of quiz can be highly successful . <p> Step 2 : Choose Background And Font <p> It is important to put some thought into background and font color . We have all had the unfortunate experience of visiting a website that thought that yellow font on a orange background was a good idea . The goal in this step is to make your quiz look simple and appealing to the eye . A light background should be paired with a dark font color , and- vice versa . You can also strategize with color combinations. - I chose a light yellow background and a black font , these are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz . <p> Step 3 : Upload A Cover Photo <p> Choosing a cover image can be tricky . To make sure the image is clear , it is recommended that the image is 900+400 pixels . You also want to pick an image- that matches with the content of your quiz . I chose a picture of smiling coffee because it made me happy ; and also because it tells whoever is going to take my quiz that it is about coffee and it will be fun to take . <p> eatingbender.com <p> Step 4 : Insert Your Logo <p> Putting a logo on the quiz is a easy way to increase your companys visibility . <p> Step 5 : Come Up With a Catchy Title And Description <p> You get to have a little fun with this , so try not to overthink it or make it too serious . Using a short quippy description tells people that your quiz is light hearted and intriguing . The title , - " Which coffee should you actually be drinking ? " , tells you exactly why you should take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) and what you will get from taking the quiz ( someone telling you the right coffee to drink ) . - Quizzes are everywhere , it is the quality of a quiz title and description that will set it apart and pull people in . <p> Step 6 : Write Fun Questions <p> Come up with 8-12 unique questions to keep people interested in your quiz . Good questions will be the motivation for people to share the quiz with friends . For a coffee personality quiz questions such as " How many cups of coffee do you drink a day ? " will be easy to correlate with accurate results . Image questions should be mixed in with text questions to keep the quiz from becoming boring . Pick a pattern , color , flower questions can be used sparingly to add a fun fluffy question to the experience . <p> Step 7 : Create Specific Results <p> Here is where you get to match customers with products to increase sales . A quiz for a company that specializes in coffee has an advantage because most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about what is available to them . With each result include an image of the matching product ( recommended size- 700+400 pixels ) . In the description , write a brief summary for the product and why the customer fits this specific item . Add a link to the item at the end of the description . <p> Step 8 : Correlate Questions To Results <p> If a person answers that they need caffeine to survive , match that answer with a strongly caffeinated coffee blend . If the person taking the quiz is honest with themselves while taking the quiz they should be matched with a result that they agree with , which is really a fun experience for everyone . From personal experience , I am much more likely to share a quiz with my friend if my result was scarily accurate . <p> Here is where you decide what information you want from customers and how you are going to get them to give it to you . " Enter your email to see your results ! " is a straightforward heading . For your subheading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they type in their email ; free newsletters , access to the latest deals , or coupons for new products are the perfect things to put in your subheading . If I just spent three minutes taking a quiz and it wo n't let me see my results without putting in an email , I will probably just exit the tab and move on . That is why you want to give people the option to skip this step , this creates trust between them and your company and they will be much more likely to take the few seconds to put in their email . <p> Step 11 : Edit Social Share Settings <p> This function allows you to control where people are directed to from your quiz . <p> If you are one of those people who can not stand lists that end in uneven numbers , you are out of luck because this is the final step ; however , it is also the step that takes the most strategy and time . Turning a list of emails into a list of paying customers is a daunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be simple . Using the results customers received to personalize their follow up email will show your customer that they are being treated like an individual , not like a name on a mass email list . If a customer received the result " You Are Supposed To Be Drinking Dark Roast Coffee " , you can send them coupons for dark roast products , links to blog posts on your website about the difference between dark and light roast , the list could go on and on . And when you finally run out of ideas , you can use this article that gives you 71 ( free , awesome , and actually usable ideas ) and get creative with your lead follow up . <p> If you are still having trouble visualizing what the quizzes look like in action , a coffee company based in Norway has created a quiz that is a perfect example . Fun fact about Norway : in 2008 , they knighted a penguin. - The quiz is titled , " Hvilken type kaffe er du ? " , which means " What type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions like " How do you start your day ? " and " What is your personality type ? " . Based on your answers it gives a result plus their phone number , email , and a link to their website . <p> The hardest part of success is taking the first step ( or something like that ) .

@@22713644 @2713644/ <h> Can You Answer These 5 Questions About Current Events ? <p> There are hundreds of different news outlets these days , and thousands of different platforms you can receive the news on . For myself , scanning the news and different outlets has become a part of my daily routine . There are plenty of mobile applications and web platforms that keep us constantly connected to what 's going on in the world around us . <p> Today we 're going to make a quick quiz about some of the pressing events and happenings that are going on to test the knowledge of how well rounded we are in our news awareness . <p> Before we get going , take the quiz I created for this and then we 'll talk about it . <p> How 'd you do ? Hopefully well ! Let 's dissect a bit into how I got to our questions and results , and how I decided to make the quiz the way it is . <p> My goal behind this quiz was supposed to be just a quick tester . So that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we really want our users to complete and not be daunted by a long quiz when they stumble upon it on a news page or within a story they 're reading . <p> First , I picked 5 major events of recent to ask questions about . I tried to not make the questions too obvious , but at the same time the goal was not for people to be stumped , but to have a simple test whether or not they 've been paying attention to recent news . Some questions might be more obvious to the common reader than others . <p> These five topics are currently trending to one degree or another , some being more major news than others . So how do we craft new and interesting questions about topics that are more widely talked about ? Or do we go the direction with asking very direct questions with some ? Let 's talk through each one and see what we come up with . <p> First Topic : Ebola Question : What is the current state of Ebola in West Africa ? Correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ebola has been a widely talked about subject for quite some time now when the disease became an epidemic in West Africa . After a few international scares , the disease is being effectively maintained in western countries , and the threat of an international spread has been talked down . But for citizens currently residing in West Africa , there has been a constant anxiety of what the disease was going to be doing , causing the shut down of some borders and travel restrictions of all kinds to the area . <p> If you 've been reading the news recently , you might have seen articles talking about how Guinea and Liberia have reported the fewest new cases since August . This of course does n't take away from the fact that the disease is still very active and taking ahold of lives , but it is encouraging news . <p> The tragic terrorist attack against the staff of the Charlie Hebedo magazine left many in shock , and brought together millions to march in remembrance and in a stance of free press and unity against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto them , Al Qaeda has recently claimed responsibility for the attacks made on the Charlie Hebedo headquarters in Paris . They have claimed to donate money to one of the shooters for terrorist operations , according to US Intelligence . <p> The thought behind this question was not to ask a direct question about the topic that might be too easy to answer , but to create a question that directly refers to a recent update on the widely addressed attacks . <p> Third Topic : Air Asia Flight 8501 Question : What key part of the Air Asia Flight 8501 was found recently ? Correct Answer : The Black Box <p> A major highlight of news outlets these past couple of weeks was the disappearance and crash of Air Asia Flight 8501 . The flight tragically fell into the Java Sea on its way from Surbaya to Singapore , killing all 165 people on board . This crash wrapped up a bad year in aviation , with this being the third major crash to claim hundreds of lives . <p> After any sort of crash , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a device that records all airplane activity and the voice recordings of the pilots throughout the flight . The data in this device is crucial into finding out what exactly happened to the plane and why it crashed . After a couple of days of figuring out how to pull it out of the water , divers were able to retrieve the box and send it to Jakarta to be analyzed . <p> As much as it hurts me to write out this one being a Pac 12 fan , Ohio State defeated Oregon to win the inaugural college football playoff . Each of the three games were the three most watched cable programs in television history , which is pretty impressive ( note that cable means non network channels , cable would include , espn , usa , tnt , tbs , etc . ) . <p> This has been widely talked about this year in the sports community because it is the first time there has been a playoff to decide who goes to the national championship , instead of the BCS system deciding who the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CFP committee , the number 2 and 4 teams made it to the final , with the number 4 team winning . If we were still on the old system , neither of these teams would have even been in the final . <p> A recent newsbreak that is being talked about is the measles cases that have been all linked back to Disneyland . This is pretty interesting news , considering the thousands of people that roll through the parks every day and measles is quite contagious . This has also sparked other debate due to a new uprising in parents not wanting their children to get immunized from diseases such as this . With both of these news items going hand in hand , the conversation about the topic has grown much wider . <p> So , what we have done here is taking five widely talked about topics and turned them into a simple engaging quiz to test how much people have been paying attention to the news . With simple engagement through quizzes such as this , you can increase viewership and interactivity on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this could potentially be a quick way to increase page viewership or collect a lead at the end of a quiz . Feel free to use the quiz that I created or make your own , it 's super easy . 
@@22713645 @2713645/ <h> How to make a quiz online in less than 5 minutes <p> So you want a quiz on your site to start collecting optins , but do n't  want to go through the process of writing it , figuring out how to implement it , and connecting it to your email program . In our research , it turns out that it takes nearly two days of having a programmer work to get a good quiz set up , two days that are expensive and time consuming . That 's why we 've created the easiest way to create and implement a quiz . <p> Step 1 : Come up with a subject <p> There are a couple of things to get right when it comes to the subject of your quiz . First and foremost , the quiz has to be relevant to your audience . Luckily , you can set up a quiz to appeal to a range of people instead of just a few , but that does n't  mean you can sacrifice the relevancy overall . To discover what kinds of quizzes your audience is interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> -Scour twitter by typing " quiz + your subject " into the search bar <p> -Send out an email with a survey asking people which kind of quiz they might be interested in ( out of a few options ) <p> Once you 've got a subject for your quiz , grab the quiz template that most closely resembles it . At Interact we 've got a lot of templates available so there should be one that matches what you 've got in mind . By using templates , you can drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to create a new quiz ( less than 5 minutes , I promise ) <p> Step 2 : Come up with a title that draws people in <p> Once you 've got your quiz template , its time to start editing it to match your style . We 've found that quizzes do best when they are written in the same style as the site from which they originate . Feel free to use your voice , your humor , your snarkiness . <p> Much ado has been made about how to write titles- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some things do work better than others . Generally you want a title that 's very personal for a quiz and promises to reveal something about the quiz taker if theyll take the time to answer the questions . Check out this graphic showing the way that Buzzfeed has named their quizzes in comparison to others and you can see that making things obsessively personal is a sure-fire way to get clicks . <p> I personally still like the Upworthy method of writing down 25 possible headlines and then choosing the best two or three and split testing them . By writing down an enormous number of possible titles , you 'll be forced to think outside the box and get creative . <p> Step 3 : Lay out fun quiz questions : The sweet spot for the number of questions on a quiz is between 6 and 15 . When writing quiz questions , be absolutely sure to avoid cliches . By cliches I mean the " never , sometimes , all the time " set of answers . The modern quiz has to constantly fight against its natural association with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of their schooling days when they are taking your quiz . <p> Once you 've selected your quiz template , you can edit the questions to match your style of writing . All questions are editable but you do n't  have to edit them . <p> Step 4 : Connect your email list to collect optins ( optional ) <p> One amazing feature about Interact is the ability to collect optin email addresses before showing the results of your quiz . Interact quizzes integrate with all the major email marketing programs . All you have to do is sign in to your account and select the list you 'd like to use . I would personally recommend setting up a new list just for your quiz . That way you can send targeted emails to quiz takers who optin based off the quiz itself . <p> Step 5 : Set up your quiz results so people want to share them <p> I 'm proud to announce that after working with over 1000 quizzes , weve finally figured out the optimal way to set up quiz results . First , you want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want a short description ( that is always positive ) and third , you want a headline to each quiz result that 's highly shareable . The goal with the results of a quiz is to get your quiz takers to share what they got so you can drive more traffic back to your quiz . <p> For the image , faces work great because people like to see other people ( is n't that funny ) . For the short description , use persuasive writing techniques to make your description as believable as possible without being insincere . For the headline to your result , refer back to writing headlines . <p> All results can be edited in the same module where you edited your quiz questions in the previous step . Many templates will already have images and descriptions , so all you have to do is edit if you 'd like to . <p> Step 6 : Embed your quiz everywhere <p> When you finish creating your quiz , you 'll be taken to a page that has an embed code and social share buttons . I would encourage sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be very popular on facebook , but flop on twitter or vice versa . Weve got guides for embedding your quiz into a facebook tab and into a wordpress post to make thing easier . <p> So that 's it . Create a great quiz in just five minutes and use it to get more optins for your site .

@@22713647 @2713647/ <h> How to make a Valentines Day Quiz for your site <p> Love it or hate it , Valentines Day is a big deal that brings with it an enormous amount of social shares and search traffic which you can potentially benefit from with a quiz of your own . <p> I 'm going to demonstrate the best practices for creating a Valentines Day quiz using an example from LastHopeK9.org . I 'm doing this for a couple of reasons first , it shows that you do n't  have to sell chocolates or flowers to benefit from the holiday hype . Second , I really like dogs , they are great , and you should definitely consider adopting . <h> 1 . How it looks ( design ) <p> Pink . obviously . That 's not really a requirement , but not a terrible idea . I like this example from Last Hope Rescue because they do a lot of things right on the design and cover page . Let 's break down the elements for simplicity . <p> -Cover photo <p> ( the part below that has a paw print on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of every quiz , its also the image that will get shared if someone just posts a direct link to your quiz on Facebook . Take it seriously , make sure its the right size , put your brand in there , create a custom image , do what you have to do to make this image special . <p> -Colors <p> It does n't  have to be pink , and in general I actually recommend that you just follow your brand colors when creating quizzes . The goal with quizzes is to make them appear just like any other piece of content your company might produce , not to make them super unique ( only because this generally leads to better results ) . <p> -Title <p> Why is this in design ? Because it shows up on the front page of your quiz and is also part of what gets shared when someone posts the quiz on Facebook or Twitter . 80% of people scrolling through a feed will read your title , but a much smaller percentage will actually click through and take the full quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it for you . Here are two title templates that pretty much just work for Valentines Day . <p> 2 . The " Who is your ? " title " " Who is your ( Furry ) Valentine ? " also works for " Who should be your Valentine ? " and things like that . <h> 2 . How it feels ( questions ) <p> Would you like to talk to people who visit your website ? What about people who just happen to visit your Facebook page ? Now you can ( in informercial voice ) . Quiz questions are the perfect place to hold a quick chat with people who frequent your site or social properties , and an opportunity to build some comradery with people before you go and ask them to buy stuff from you ( or adopt a dog ) . <p> Here are the things you should do in your quiz questions . <p> -Have images . We ran a study and found that all 100 of the top quizzes ( ranked by hits ) had at least one image question in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , image questions look pretty cool , and they certainly liven up a quiz , which is probably the reason for their success . <p> -Speak like a human . There 's an entire blog post on this subject if you really want to dive in . If you want the quick and dirty version , think of it this way you are hanging out with friends at a pub , how would you talk to them ? Now write your quiz like that . <p> -Keep it short . 6-12 questions , this will take 2 minutes or so to finish , no one wants to spend longer than that , and shorter just looks like you did n't  try . <h> 3 . How you reach people ( results ) <p> Quiz results are precious ground . This is the main place that people who take your quiz will share it from , and if you do n't  get it right no one will share their results and you 'll end up wasting time creating your quiz in the first place ( and no one likes wasting time ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images . For pretty much the same reason as the quiz questions should have images . Also , when quiz results get shared the social share will include an image , a link , and the title of the result , with the image being the most noticeable obviously . <h> 4 . The initial foray ( sharing ) <p> This is the first time anyone will see your quiz , and its usually done on Facebook . You can also embed your quiz , but that 's a different article . I 'm including this because sharing your quiz on Facebook as a business is not nearly as easy as it should be , thanks to some strange settings they have . here 's the instructions . <p> 1 . Take a screenshot of the quiz or pick an image to share <p> 2 . Upload the image to a new Facebook post manually <p> 3 . Write a description of the quiz " Have you ever wondered what kind of Cheese-y couple you are ? Now you can find out " <p> 4 . Include a link to the quiz ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@22713648 @2713648/ <h> 5-Step Checklist to Ensure Every Blog Post is Engaging <p> Just over 50,000 people have taken Interact quizzes to date , and trends are starting to emerge concerning which ones are truly interactive and which are n't  . While not every blog post is going to be a quiz , and it should n't be , there are certain guiding principles of engagement that apply across all content . <h> 1 . Does the post answer a pressing question ? <p> I like 500 Startups analogy of the vitamin vs. the antidote . A vitamin is nice to have , but an antidote is necessary to stop poison from spreading through your body that will kill you unless it is stopped . The quizzes that have been most successful are antidotes . While no case is as extreme as preventing death ( unless you are writing about that ) , the principle applies still . Here are a few examples of what we would consider to be antidotes . <p> Quizzes that worked : <p> - " Where are the Holes in Your Marketing Plan ? " answers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want ? " <p> - " Why Isnt your Budget Working ? " figures out why the user is n't able to save money like theyd like to . <p> - " What is My Writing Personality ? " helps the writer find their voice and be confident in it . <h> - 2 . Does it feel personal ? <p> Its not so much whether the topic applies directly to every reader as it is that the post must give off the vibe of being written for every reader . This one is more about knowing your audience than anything , the authors who have created the best content on Interact are the ones who have really learned who reads the content on their site . This goes beyond just interests and likes , into the realm of personality . If a site covers movies , the readers might be mostly middle-aged people from rural areas whose other - interests include hunting , fishing , and the outdoors . If you know this as a writer , your examples , stories , and persona will appeal to people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> - " What Kind of Natural Beauty are You ? " connected with the audience of a beauty blog that was also interested in green and toxin-free living . <p> - " Are You A Suitcase Entrepreneur ? " resonated with an audience that was business-savvy but also like traveling. <h> 3 . Is the tone conversational ? <p> Not conversational in the sense that lots of questions are asked , but rather a less formal tone . Its easy to hide behind big words and formal talk when discussing - a subject , but it was Ronald Reagan who said that if you cant explain something in laymans terms , you do n't  know it well enough . The formality must fit the audience , it would n't be appropriate to write in a story-telling style on CNET , but the quizzes we 've seen really draw engagement have been less formal overall . <p> Quizzes questions that worked : <p> - " I am aware of how to keep my personal information safe when surfing the internet " simple fill in the blank question and simple wording . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encryption , but did n't  . <p> - " Do you have a clear plan for how you will generate revenue ( i.e. , what you will sell , who you will sell it to , and how to reach them ) ? " Revenue is not a complicated subject , but the author still explains it , just to be safe . In a real-life conversation , if you werent sure if someone knew what revenue was , youd explain it too . <h> 4 . Is there room for an easy response ? <p> A quiz requires responses by nature , but its surprisingly easy to create them in a way that does n't  illicit a natural interaction . A call to action is important , but if every blog post has a strong call to action it can be off-putting to readers . Rather , make the theme of the post or quiz something that can be debated or answered . <p> Quizzes that worked : <p> - " What Kind of Beer is Right for You ? " Naturally leads the quiz-taker to ask why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Kind of Link Builder are You ? " Piques some curiosity and with well-placed links to read more opens the site up . <h> - 5 . Leave a chance for a sequel <p> Many great movies have sequels , a planned approach by the studio who was anticipating the success of the first movie . Great blog posts are the same way , if the topic really hits home , it leaves room for a follow up . <p> Engagement is a science as much as it is an art . There are principles that emerge over time with lots of testing that seem to guide interaction across the web . This simple checklist is a way to make sure the basics are covered . To sum it up , pick a topic that resonates with your crowd , answer a question , and leave room for further discussion . 
@@22713649 @2713649/ <h> Easy Tips to Make a Great Looking Quiz <p> To design a free nice looking quiz for your site , hop on over to tryinteract.com <p> So , not all of us are designers . And often times we try to create things for our websites , personal lives , or blogs that we would like to look good , but just do n't quite make the mark . We get pretty close , we have the right content and layout , but something is n't quite right . Well nearly 100% of the time , there are two simple things that are making it that way : <p> Typography and color . <p> If you can figure out how to deal with both of those aspects successfully , you 'd be surprised at how much better your work will look by tweaking a few simple things . <p> Typography is its own animal , so we 'll talk about that later . For this post let 's take a look at color . <p> Often times we want to follow the brand of our company , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to follow in our work . Using a few tips I have below , you can easily create a quiz with a nice color scheme that not only matches the look you 're going for , but is super simple to create . <p> I 'll start out talking about this with a single chart , which has some great examples of multiple colors that look well together . <p> Now there is one thing I 'd like to point out about what you see above that is particularly important - the color of the text . <p> If you are doing a colored background , I always recommend staying away from any colored text , especially if you do n't  know what you are doing . You should use either black or very dark gray text , or white text . <p> Now if you 're working with a white background , obviously you can use a darker shade of any color and it will be fine . But with color backgrounds , you want to stay clear away of using another color as the text , as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain . Sometimes content will simply stop being read solely because it is to hard to read , even if the reader does n't  acknowledge it directly . In the user experience realm of things , we always want to make sure that we are pleasing the user in the best way we can , and when it comes to content being read we have to make sure there is no strain on the eye . And the easiest way to do that is with picking either black or white text , depending on the background color . <p> Let 's walk through making a quiz for a company I made up the logo for below . <p> So taking a look at the logo we see that the primary color is a darker blue , and it has an accent of green . So if we want our quiz on our company website , we want it looking similar to the branding that the company has . How can we design our quiz to be mainly blue , but maybe accent the green as well ? Or do we even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit . <p> So there 's no doubt that blue is the primary and base color of the branding . Let 's use that as our color and see what we can do . <p> here 's a a stock colored version of a quiz : <p> If we go in and tweak some of the colors that we are able to and change them to our companys blue , we can get subtle yet great looking results . <p> By just changing the color of the title and the button to take the quiz , we have successfully yet subtly made the quiz our own . <p> A lot of people will often make the mistake of feeling like they have to overbear the color in their design to make sure it matches , but in reality much more subtle changes that match the brand are stronger . <p> Now again sometimes you 're being called to make things a more dramatic way , in this case we could be called to really make it blue. - Well how should we go about doing that ? <p> If we are looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have to figure out a couple things . <p> First , the color of our text . With any sort of darker color background , you have to have white text . Its the only that can look good and be really legible to read , so I always recommend white text on any sort of colored background as I mentioned earlier . <p> With the background being blue , we really have that color out of the way , so it in turn allows us to be able to try to accent that green somewhere . The button that allows us to take the quiz is the perfect place to do that , so let 's add it there . <p> Since the background is now blue and so is our logo , we need to have that changed . I placed a background behind the logo so it can still be used and is visual . You have to keep something like that in mind when you 're looking to use a background that might affect how the logo would appear on it . <p> So when you wrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like this : <p> We were able to implement a nice looking background color and even accent the green from our logo to make a quiz that completely matches our brand and looks great as well . <p> So understanding basic uses of color and how we can implement them properly , we can easily make a good looking quiz that follows our style guides . Understanding these simple concepts can help you immensely in creating beautiful quizzes . 
@@22713650 @2713650/ <h> 3 Ways to use quizzes in your content marketing <p> Weve seen people build a simple website , fill it with quizzes built using Interact , and drive hundreds of thousands of visits all in one day . There is a science to making viral quizzes , and once you get a handle on it , its entirely possible to make your own quiz website . <p> However , for businesses , and specifically the marketers who are responsible for driving growth , simply having viral quizzes is pretty useless . <p> Quizzes are only useful if they fit into your marketing strategy and add value beyond just being cool or fun . They have to deliver value and add to your key metrics , just like any other form of content you produce . <p> To help connect the dots between a fun quiz and a value-add content piece , I 've pulled out three examples of ways to use quizzes in content marketing . <h> 1 . Grow your email list <p> An email address is the first step in developing a customer relationship that ideally ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ akin to getting your foot in the door , after you 've done that , the rest is up to your marketing automation software and good old personal nurturing . <p> Quizzes collect emails using a method known as gated content . Essentially you are putting a gate in front of something people want ( in this case quiz results ) , and asking for an email address to reveal what 's behind the gate ( your quiz results ) . <p> I 've created a nice little graphic below to show how the flow works . Within the Interact app , you ask your quiz questions , collect emails , and show quiz results . The email addresses you collect can be sent directly to your marketing automation program ( the example below works with Marketo ) , or you can collect the emails within Interact and export them to your program . <p> This method works really well , 50% of people who finish a quiz that 's collecting emails put in their information , and Interact users currently collect nearly 17,000 new leads each month . <h> 2 . Sell personalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products ( like the ones that Amazon constantly bugs you with ) , sell 300% more than non-personalized ones . This makes sense , we 've done a terrible job of re-creating the " shopkeeper " experience online ( you know , where the shopkeeper recommends products to you ask your parents about it if that makes no sense to you ) . <p> Personalization is a huge opportunity for product sellers , and quizzes can help . <p> One great example I saw of using personalization for product promotion came from Elephant Pants , a new kind of pants that have something to do with elephants . They made a quiz that asks you if you want to find out which kind of the pants you should buy . Then the quiz links out to a Kickstarter campaign where you can pre-order your personalized pants . <p> The Kickstarter campaign was a success , raising over $7,000 to create the first line of Elephant Pants . <p> Making a quiz like this is n't difficult . I 've seen the same concept copied for Hookah , Fake Nails , Books , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz with the personalities replaced by products . <h> 3 . Personalize your website <p> So you read my last suggestion and you 're like " Okay , great , but I do n't  sell products " not too worry , we have an option for you too ( we try to be inclusive here at Interact ) . For you we have the personalized content quiz . <p> I 'm going to start this one by going to the example . The example is from Forbes , who used a quiz to personalize their college recommendation tool . The tool asks you to " Find your perfect Match " college , and then links to more content , personalized based on which college is your match . That sounded very unclear , so there is a picture below . <p> Regardless , the way this quiz works is by starting with your great content and working backwards to a quiz . Pick out a few of your best pieces that make sense to work together in a quiz and make those pieces the " personalities . " then make a quiz . Simple . 
@@22713651 @2713651/ <h> Interaction Tip : Talk to a Person <p> Why do some quizzes get so much more attention than others ? There are lots of reasons , and today well look at one in particular who you 're talking too . The internet does this thing where it makes us forget that other people are reading what we write . This leads to many posts being written to no one in particular and the wording is cold and insincere . When readers glance at articles like that there is no connection , its like reading a textbook ( and who likes reading textbooks , seriously ) . <p> Instead of writing to an audience , pick a person and talk to them . Depending on your level of understanding as to who your customers are , you may actually know what this person likes and dislikes or what style they prefer . Even if that 's not the case , and you 're making an educated guess , write to a person and commit to it . There 's a scientific reason this works when we feel a connection with another person Oxytocin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gives you that feeling of love and taken cared-of-ness . So talk to people like they are people and you 'll get some Oxytocin flowing and connect with your audience much more personally . <p> here 's a great example of a quiz that talks to a person . The person in this case is a blogger who is just starting out and would like to learn more about their own style so they can capitalize on it . 
@@22713652 @2713652/ <h> 4 Simple Design Tips To Increase Conversions On Your Website <p> Often times companies have well designed websites with great user experience and a nice visual flow , but for some reason ca n't quite get people to click on links or buy a product . There can be a lot of different factors that lead to this user behavior , but you would be surprised on how some simple visual design changes can change how often a user decides to click on a button or learn more about a product . <p> Below are some solid tips on just little things ( I 'm talking they 'll take you 20 seconds to change or recognize on your website ) that can surprisingly increase your conversion and click rates . Along with it is some some real data to back up the claims so you do n't think I 'm full of it . <h> 1 . What color is that button ? <p> Button color . Does it really make a difference on how many people click through ? You would think no since that does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's also been a lot of talk about the color button Orange converting the most " which may be true " but let 's talk about it for a second . <p> Now here 's the thing I have with changing the button colors " it relies a lot on context . Stating simply if I change my button color from blue to red I 'll convert more people ' does n't quite make sense , because that button is set inside the context of the website around it . All of these details play into the effectiveness of a button . <p> In order to make a button effective , it should stick out as a separate object on the page . It should look clickable , and tell the user what it 's going to do . This is way more important than any single color change , especially since I do n't know what kind of context you 're working with . <p> Which button do you think is better ? <p> Let 's go with captain obvious here , it 's easily the one on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it 's just so subtle and simple in it 's changes . This is more or less what I 'm talking about " getting the button to stand out . Is your web page or brand dominantly the color blue ? They do n't make the button a lighter/darker blue ! Make it orange , or a color that wo n't fit ' in the page so users know it presents a different action . <p> You might have come into this article learning about how orange buttons are supposed to convert the most against other colors , and the reason that is true in mostly all contexts is that orange stands out the most . The only website I could imagine where an orange button would n't work might be the University of Syrcause 's site , because they 're quite literally the Orange . ' Here at Interact we use orange buttons , but that 's because our site is largely blue . Orange stands out the most in it ! <p> If you want to wrap up this section with the final tip after that mini-rant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless of course your website or brands main color is orange . Then it obviously makes sense to go for a different color . The goal here is to pick the color that stands out the most , and clearly communicates to the user that it is a separate action . Except yellow , do n't ever use a yellow button . <h> 2 . Single Column Layout <p> Now I will say that there 's a time and a place for multiple columns , especially blogs . But , when you 're promoting a product or working on the home page of your site , you should always be using a single column layout . It 's less distracting to the user , keeps them focused on just one area of content , and all they have to do is the simple task of scrolling down to learn more . <p> One site I love reading articles on excellently displays this , and that 's medium.com . With they 're preset design on how user 's articles will look , it truly is distraction free reading . <p> See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the user " it 's one area of content that you can pretty up and make all about your product or service , and it 's a single canvas for the user to focus on . <p> You do n't need multiple columns because you do n't need your user to go anywhere else then that homepage , and the last thing you want to do is distract them with somewhere else to go . If you ca n't get the main point across on your home page , then you have an issue you need to figure out . <h> 3 . Simple Registration Form <p> There are few web related things I hate more than overly complicated sign up forms . Especially in the start up world I see unnecessary sign up forms all the time . No , you really do n't need my mother 's maiden name in order to sign up for an A/B testing service . <p> Okay I ca n't say I 've ran into an A/B testing site that has asked for that , but I have seen multiple examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . I 'm all about getting the user through with as little information as possible . <p> Here at Interact , we ask for three things when you sign up " username , email , password . No separate lines for first and last name , nothing to scare the user away , but just three lines , three things to fill out , and boom " you 're at your dashboard in our site . It takes 10 seconds . <p> Here 's our simple sign up form compared with another complicated , yet well designed form . Also , the use of captcha on that form dropped it 's conversion by 20% , so do n't use those for your website unless you absolutely need to for whatever reason . <h> 4 . Get your point across quickly at the top of the page , and repeat it below <p> Latest statistics show that you have 15 seconds before half of the users that visit your site drop off . And to be honest , I feel like that 's a pretty long time , depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's the design tip ? Make the top of your web page get the whole point across to by summarizing everything else on the page , and if the user wants to explore more they 'll start scrolling down . <p> I actually think most companies do this really effectively these days . You need to wrap up your product in the form of a sentence or two , and then have a call to action form or button at the top . Everything below basically acts as an argument for why a user should perform the action they first saw at the top of the page . <p> With that in mind , you never know which one of your product points is going to convince them to sign up , so make sure you have multiple avenues down the page to get them to your sign up form . <p> In speaking about Principles of Persuasive Web Design , Peep Laja observed the conclusion that even though modern web times call for a much more scroll oriented experience , parts of the page that were above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the fold it fell to just 20% . <p> That statistic alone makes it crucial that you get your point and action across in those first few hundred pixels ( top 600px is what I recommend ) . If not , you could be losing quite a bit of your audience who is n't quite interested enough to scroll past that . <p> So , we have learned 4 simple things to help increase conversions on our site .

@@22713654 @2713654/ <h> How to cut your lead generation cost in half using Facebook ads and quizzes ( Interview with TheFoundation.com ) <p> Today we have the special privilege of speaking with Caleb , director of marketing at The Foundation . Theyve used Interact to generate thousands of leads using Facebook ads and are bringing in new email subscribers at the cost of $3.80 apiece , resulting in over 400% ROI . They have figured out how to " print money " using Facebook ads , and they were kind enough to share exactly what they did to get there . <h> How did you go about coming up with your quiz ? <p> Its all about understanding your customers , understanding human drive , what it is that they want . <p> To begin with I did some research on how Buzzfeed does their quizzes and then started to come up with a quiz title based on how we do our marketing . The Foundation teaches people how to start a software business , its a six-month course . Our target audience are employees who want to quiz their job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a legit way . <p> Based on that demographic , the original quiz title was " What is your entrepreneur type ? " we ended up refining it down to " Do you have an entrepreneurial mind ? Most people do n't  . " <p> On the title change I needed to get the quiz done fast , so I thought of it in terms of okay , how can I get this 80% done and then take it to other members of our team for refining ? . That way I can get it to 100% percent , or at least an MVP and launch-able . <p> Our title gets into peoples minds , makes them think a little bit . <p> How did you go about creating the quiz itself ? The questions and results , etc . <p> I 'm really into psychology and personality tests . Things like Myers-Briggs , Strength Finder , Enneagram , all that kind of stuff . So I have a basic understanding of how these things work . So I made five different quiz results , entrepreneurial styles , based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation . <p> Note from Josh : The Foundation did an excellent job of injecting personality into their quiz . Every question feels like you are talking to a consultant , and someone who youd enjoy speaking with . <h> How did you turn Facebook ads into profitable leads ? <p> My first recommendation is to pay someone who 's job is to run Facebook ads . Honestly I think itll save you way more money in the long run because it really is a hard skill-set . There 's a whole technical side of Facebook ads . There 's both the marketing and copy aspect and the technical aspect and you really do need both , so that 's where the Facebook ad expert comes in . <p> the people Ive worked with I found through our network , if you do n't  have that network you can just Google it . One good agency is BlackBox media in Austin , Texas . <p> Facebook ads , getting started <p> We started off with a $200/day spend for a week with the first version of the quiz . So he made two ads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one for the newsfeed . After we got some results of $2.50 per lead , which is unheard of , like very very very good we started ramping it up big time . <p> For copy we used the title of the quiz " Do you have an entrepreneurial mind , most people do n't  find out here " and we also used the whole paragraph of copy for the quiz description . Its gotten 19 shares which is unheard of for an ad , there 's comments on it where people are discussing stuff because its controversial . <p> Do you use the quiz cover image for the ads ? <p> Yes , its a cartoon image of a blindfolded guy throwing a dart at a target . <p> How did you target people with your ad ? And who did you target ? <p> The key for Facebook advertising is to be very targeted , narrow it down to a small group . This quiz has been really good with the startup interest group that we created in our Facebook ads portfolio , people who are interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well continue to expand out , but the whole thing is to get it working with specific groups of interest . <p> How did you tweak the ads after they were up ? <p> Couple of things . <p> 1 . The first thing I did was I looked at the analytics in Interact to see which questions were way off-balance . For example , if one of the answers was only getting like 5% of the clicks it needed to be changed . So I simplified all the answers to optimize for completion rate . <p> 2 . Then I created two landing pages for the Facebook ads . One for our homepage traffic and one for our adwords traffic . Then I set up different lists in Aweber with an intro sequence to watch the engagement . Then I placed a 1+1 pixel from my adwords code and Facebook ads code in each quiz result respectively so I could track completions on the ad rather than just doing it manually . <p> to speak to the technical side of Facebook ads . When we made the two landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group and both of the costs per click went up , almost double what the old one was . So we paused those and are re-combining those back into one . <p> What to do after you get the lead . <p> It really depends on what your product is and how much money you make . You want to know how much each lead is worth to you . Currently we are working on adding some lower end products so that we can get a faster return . Right now we do n't  do that but we have a high-priced course so I now how much leads are worth . <p> We used to pay around $6 on Facebook , now we are holding steady at $3.80 now we can get 263 leads a day on Facebook with a $1000 spend versus just 166 like before . If we put a value of say $20 per lead ( that 's not exactly what ours is , but you can see the value ) . With the new quiz cost per lead we are getting a 426% ROI versus a 233% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say to people who are trying to figure out how to make it work for them they really just need to know how much a lead is worth to them so they can know how much to spend on them . It does n't  really matter how many leads you are getting , what matters is how you are nurturing them and what they are converting at . What is the actual economics behind the business ? <p> I made a spreadsheet for us that shows conversion rates from traffic to lead to applying for a program to purchasing . I can put in our conversion rates there and see where the opportunities are . Get serious about the numbers and analytics if you are having trouble with making lead generation work for you . <p> Have you seen if there 's been any change in quality of the leads coming through the quiz ? <p> Its pretty high , its profitable so I have n't cared too much about that yet . What Ive been paying attention to is the follow-up sequence . Normally we get 25-30% open rates on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads were getting 58% open rates on the first email . that first email we send is a direct response email , there 's not any links in it , its just Dane ( co-founder of The Foundation ) introducing himself . He just says " Hi , its really great that you find out your entrepreneurial type , my question for you , is have you ever thought about starting your own business ? It just gets a conversation going and our support team literally replies to those emails personally . <p> those become really good leads because there is a personal connection . We can sell them on their deepest fears and desires and personalize the sales process . <p> What words of warning/advice do you have for people just starting out with quizzes and Facebook ads ? <p> Just start . <p> Do n't  make excuses , do n't  make your quiz more complicated than it needs to be . That 's not saying to release something that sucks , but do n't  go for perfection at first either . Start with a small ad spend and start testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have excellence in your marketing and are n't  moving people with your words and your ask , then its not going to convert . <p> The actual content and quality of the quiz is a lot less important than the words and marketing that gets them to the quiz . I spent less time making the quiz than I did creating the ads , making the landing pages , and making the ads look really good . Make sure the quiz is good enough that they do n't  regret taking it , but do n't  obsess over it . <p> Final words of advice . <p> For most businesses , you need to spend more time looking at the numbers . If you 're getting 400 leads a week and you 're spending $350 a month on Interact , then you are spending $.25 per lead plus ad spend . The goal would be to pay three dollars or less on ad spend . Some people can pay more or less . We are happy if we pay anywhere between $3 and $7 per lead . <p> You have to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot if you are getting more leads . You have to look at where the economics break down . Its simple when you break it down and look at your numbers , your funnel . It does n't  have to be some big emotional thing of why isnt the business working ? Its actually probably really simple if you break it down and look at the numbers . 
@@22713655 @2713655/ <h> How to make an online assessment <p> Online assessments can turn a static website into one that is personally relevant to every visitor . This is huge if your business relies on human connections ( which almost all do ) . Because an assessment is very similar to a quiz , its possible to use the Interact quiz builder to make your assessment , and we 've seen many excellent examples of just that . But before you jump right in and get started I wanted to offer up some tips based on what works for assessments . <p> This guide will follow a quiz from our friends at Psychologiques , a group that 's doing excellent work in the counseling world . We will look at what they did ( almost all of which is great ) , and extrapolate some best practices so your assessment will be perfect . <h> 1 . Make it to the point <p> An assessment is not the time to drum up interest in your business or upsell products . Its a time to answer a real question that 's pertinent to your core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their quiz . Its just called " Mental health assessment " and that 's exactly what is being offered . <p> This is an example of a place where doing too much is definitely a bad thing . Trying to mix your assessment with an advertisement for your business will always end badly . Do n't  worry though , the assessment will still help get people in the door when you offer an opportunity to get in touch at the end . <h> 2 . Be appropriately formal <p> Weve seen assessments be particularly popular in health and wellness businesses where getting the level of formality right is very important . Let 's look at our example quiz again , it uses pretty formal language in the questions which is appropriate for a subject as serious as mental health . <p> If they had made a quiz full of GIFs and cat pictures , you 'd be pretty off-put by that , and appropriately so . Remember that an assessment is n't a quiz , its not meant to a marketing play for your business , rather its meant to genuinely help people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  really need to worry about losing people who do n't  finish your assessment . If a person is even somewhat interested they will answer your questions ( no matter how boring ) . <h> 3 . Have thorough questions <p> The worst thing you can do with an assessment is give inaccurate results , and inaccurate results stem from not asking enough questions . Remember that with an assessment there is something of great value at the end , and asking more questions wo n't lead to people not finishing the assessment . <p> As far as actually setting up the scoring system for an assessment there are two ways to go about it . The first is to set up each question to have a correct answer , and tally up the scores at the end and give an outcome based on that . To do this , use the multiple choice quiz builder . The second is to use a slightly more intricate personality scoring system to give an assessment . I wont get into that here in detail , there 's a full blog post on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up <p> When you get a quiz result like " Therapy would probably be helpful " you want to know more immediately . That 's why its excellent that this quiz provides both a phone number and a contact form to follow-up . I also like that its done tastefully here , they did n't  just slap a phone number on there and say " call us . " Rather , they gave a nice description in semi-formal language and then provided an opportunity to follow up if the person is interested . <p> Assessments are exceptionally useful online tools . They give you the power to screen people before ever getting on the phone or meeting in person , which not only creates a connection but also saves you both time . In our experience these kinds of assessments work well for health and fitness businesses , as well as for business consultants who use them to find their customers needs . Whatever your case , I highly recommend following the tips drawn from the assessment Psychologiques set up . 
@@22713656 @2713656/ <h> Incredibly Effective Technique To Get Leads Online <p> The issue a lot of websites have these days is getting people to actually buy products through them . You could have a well designed , robust website with great user experience , but if you ca n't sell the product what 's the point ? <p> That 's where the idea of gaining leads come in . The idea here is that instead of focusing directly on a goal of getting users to funnel all the way through your site and buy a product , you quickly and simply have them hand you a piece of their information . Most commonly this comes in the form of their email . With this you can actively begin communicating with them and establishing a relationship with your brand . <p> To make a quiz like the ones talked about in this article , head on over to- tryinteract.com . <p> Normal retail conversion rates vary from 2-3% . So that means that for every 100 people that visit your website , only 2 or 3 of them actually buy anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting out , chances are you 're experiencing a rate even lower than that , hovering around 1% . If that 's true , you could have the technique and skill to get 1000 users to your website , and only 10 of them actually follow through to buy anything . That 's no good . <p> So what 's the incredible technique to get that rate up ? <p> Quizzes . <p> Yup , all those quizzes you 've seen online recently actually can have a lot of value to companies that are using them . Often times these days companies send out weekly newsletters with updates on their product , or general news about the company . The amount of subscribers on these newsletters is crucial , because every time you blast out an email , you are reopening the conversation with anyone who is subscribed to receive emails . <p> The idea here is that you create a quiz that relates to your company or product , and then at the end of the quiz you ask for the email of the quiz taker . Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's one new lead you just gained that you would n't have had otherwise . <p> So that sounds great and all you say , but does it actually work ? Well we have some crazy and interesting data with our customers that will easily convince you that it does indeed work . <h> Country Music Network 51,356+ Leads Collected <p> The Country Music Network made a quiz called How Well Do You Know George Strait ? ' testing users on their ability to answer questions about this country star legend . They found incredible success with this quiz , boasting 66,896 views , 55,444 completions , and 24,162 collected emails . That gives them an 82% completion rate , and a 44% conversion rate on leads collected to quizzes completed . And if we 're being honest here , that 's incredible ! <p> A second successful quiz that they created is called Think You Know Alan Jackson ? ' which also raked in some great leads for them . They had 49,827 quiz views , 39,035 completions , and 13,023 leads generated . That gives this quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And finally , a third quiz called Which Grammy Award Winning Country Song Are You ? ' also did incredibly well in this regard . To throw some more numbers at you , they were able to get 27,612 quiz views , 22,999 quiz completions , and 7,865 collected emails . Doing some math that gives us an 83% completion rate , and a 34% conversion rate on emails collected . Below is a chart that wraps up all these numbers in a more visual sense , with each circle representing the total number for the above stats . <p> In addition to these they obtained 6,306 more lead in- a couple other quizzes I did n't mention , which led me to the total number just shy of 150k above . <p> Just by using these quizzes and their outreach resources , CMN were able to collect just over 45,000 emails to add to their database . That 's an amazing amount of additional outreach they have to work with that would n't exist if it were n't for these quizzes . <p> Now what if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on quizzes ? Does it still work for you ? My answer is a resounding yes , and here are a couple examples of quizzes that obtained fewer views but still converted plenty of leads . <h> Afar.com " 5,826 Leads Collected <p> Afar.com made a fantastic quiz asking the question Where should you go in 2015 ? ' They got an overwhelming positive response , and stirred up quite the conversation on their website from users that had taken the quiz . <p> To talk about their statistics a little bit , the quiz was viewed 19,505 times , had 13,534 quiz completions , and ultimately collected 5,826 leads . Percentage wise that puts the quiz at a 70% completion rate , and a 43% conversion rate for emails . <p> They found success in a well-thought and well-timed quiz . I said it above and I 'll say it here again , without this quiz they would have 5,000 less subscribers to their email list , and that is a big number for the marketers of their website . <h> BioLite " 4,879 Leads Collected <p> BioLite created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed so well . This quiz boasted one of the highest conversion rates I 've seen for a quiz through our site , gaining 4,879 leads on 5,613 quiz views . Which is quite crazy because that means this quiz boasts an 86% conversion rate for leads ! That 's more than most quizzes get on views to completions , so BioLite really knew what they we 're doing and who they were targeting with this quiz . <h> Kingdom Rush Trivia Contest " 3,042 Leads Collected <p> This quiz idea was a great one " Kingdom Rush ran a quiz contest , and gave awards to some of the users that completed the quiz and used their email to contact them . They set up a process that had users take the quiz , give Kingdom Rush their email , see their results and then find out at the end of the contest if they had one . The catch was that you had to give them your email in order to be entered into the contest , and so through this they were able to collect over 3,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,000 people viewing it . In my opinion this is a great and clever way to add emails to your database , and it has clearly worked for them . <h> So , why should I do this too ? <p> Now that we 've seen all these examples and I 've been able to show you companies that it has worked for , how does this tie back in to gaining more customers for product ? <p> When a user visits your website , statistics say you have about 15 seconds to gain their attention before half of those users drop off . If you 're concerned about a conversion rate of 1% , maybe it 's time to try a new technique to at least get something instead of nothing out of the people that visit your website . The solution we found is that if 98% of the people are n't  going to buy a product , we should at least try to get the emails of 20% of those people so we can follow up and hopefully turn them into another customer . Leads provide another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as a business you always want to strive to gain customers in whatever way you can . <p> We honestly believe that quizzes can be a great solution to this issue . When they 're well created , worded properly and relate to the demographic that the website is trying to reach , success through a quiz is imminent . They grab the attention of the user quickly , and can even keep them on your site for minutes instead of seconds . This establishes longer viewership and the beginning of a relationship that you as a company can pursue if you collect their email . <p> So we think you should try it , and what do you have to lose ? Something is always better than nothing . <h> To make a quiz like the ones talked about in this article , head on over to tryinteract.com. 
@@22713657 @2713657/ <h> How to Make a Quiz About Which Credit Card You Should Get <p> Nowadays there are hundreds of different credit cards , with many reasons why a single consumer would want to obtain of them . Different types of rewards , points , cash , or low APR are many of the different avenues in which banks try to get you to use their services through credit cards . <p> If we were attempting to make a quiz that would analyze a users answers and choose a certain credit card or type of credit card they would want to obtain , we would have to ask them plenty of questions about what they 're interested in and what rewards and bonuses they might be wanting to get out of the card . Ultimately there are a lot of different reasons that someone will get a credit card , but we can zoom in on a few to get a really good idea . Let 's see how we might go through this process with making a quiz in mind . <p> First , we need to cover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is taking the quiz . A few of the things we want to know might be : <p> What kind of rewards are they looking for in the card ? <p> Do they ever carry a balance ? <p> Do they know/what is their credit score ? <p> How many credit cards do they currently have ? <p> Which bank do they currently bank with ? <p> When we lay out what we need to know about the consumer , it makes it easier for us to create the questions that will be on the quiz . These things we need to know can easily be translated into questions with multiple answers . <p> 1 . What kind of rewards are you looking for in a credit card ? Cash Travel Points <p> 5. - Which bank do you currently bank with ? Bank of America Chase Citi Wells Fargo A Credit Union Other <p> These questions are let us know who their bank relationship is with , whether or not they have a good credit score , and generally what they 'd be looking for in a card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool of credit cards , but a few more specific questions might help us out in choosing a card or two specifically for them . <p> If they like to travel , knowing which airline they mainly travel with who obviously be a huge help , and could even almost point us straight to the card we should recommend to them . If they 're looking for just cash rewards , then we can zone in easily on the cards that offer that . If they want general points they can shop with or transfer around , we can make assumptions based on that . Knowing whether they spend the most on travel , groceries or gas can also lead them to view specific cards . Here are a few ways we can word out those questions . <p> 2 . What airline do you mainly travel with when you fly ? American Delta United Southwest Other <p> 3 . Which of these do you spend the most amount of money on ? Travel Groceries Gas <p> So far , we have 8 pretty solid questions to ask our quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out a credit card or two . If we were to settle with the questions we currently have , how to we curate the answers to match as well as we 'd like ? <p> Well we need to pick our answers first . Maybe we are part of a specific bank and so we need to list the credit cards our bank has to offer . I 'm going to go across a few different types of banks , with some credit cards that I 've had or enjoyed as examples . <p> Let 's have each answer spit out one card for simplicity 's sake . Sometimes in cases like this quiz , we might want to have the answers suggest multiple cards with each person 's results , but for sake of the example we 'll only do one . <p> So let 's talk about how we would do the matching . Since we 're only going towards one specific card , answering only a couple questions a certain way would land us on a single card . <p> If they are interested in cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the cash cards we have listed and make it harder for them to receive a points based card . From there , we could look at current banking relationships and which category they spend the most in to determine which card they should get . Some cash cards offer extra percentage back for certain categories , so we could appeal to the user that way . <p> If a quiz taker states that they carry a balance , we could almost immediately go to our Capital One Low APR card , since that is the card we 're focusing on for people who need that option with their credit . <p> If a person states they travel , then we can use which airline they choose as a means for giving them a certain card . If they generally travel across the board , we could point them towards a points card that has available transfer partners to certain airlines as it 's a more general travel point card and is a bit more flexible . <p> So now that we have the logistics out of the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of images , proper words and making sure the user understands each question well , we can create a quiz that ensures completion . <p> When we start building the quiz , we are creating a personality quiz . What that basically means is that every question we have does n't have a completely correct answer , but an answer that pertains to the person taking the quiz . <p> When we 're writing our quiz title and description , we want it to catch the reader 's attention in a clear way . Normally having the title state a question that the user might be asking themselves is a great way to make sure they click through . With the description , we want to provide some reinforcement to our title . <p> We then can create the questions and add correlated responses to them . It 's mostly obvious which answers should point to which card , but there are also some to think about a bit more . If someone indicates that they have a lower credit score , I set up the quiz to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives them a more likely chance to qualify . If your credit score is average , in the upper 600s or low 700s , you could really go for any of these cards in the right circumstances so I actually have them correlate to no response at all . <p> After sorting the responses , we have a great quiz that can be used to see which credit card correlates to your needs !

@@22713662 @2713662/ <h> How to make a quiz for your non-profit website <p> Non-profits have a tough job , they bring awareness to some of the most pressing issues our world is facing , yet they are almost always under-funded . At Interact , we 've been fortunate enough to work with some amazing not-for-profit companies to help bring attention to their causes . Today I 'd like to share some tips for non-profits looking to get attention on social media using quizzes . <p> Step 1 : Build a topic around your core causes <p> When coming up with a quiz idea , focus on the core issues your non-profit addresses . Sometimes this is easy , if you focus on only one thing , but other times its difficult if your group deals with a variety of things around the world . Let 's looks at a couple of examples to help clarify . <p> The first comes from Berim.org , a site dedicated to helping social entrepreneurs in Iran . Their quiz is titled " How much do you know about Iran ? " and was a pretty simple choice given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a unique strategy with this concept because even though their non-profit focuses solely on one country , that country is often misunderstood by the world population . <p> The quiz is very eye-opening and many people remarked on twitter that they were surprised by how little they knew about the country that is the topic of so much discussion . This quiz concept works very well if your group works on an issue that is either not very well known or just plain misinterpreted in the public eye . <p> Moving to the complete opposite side of the spectrum , let 's take a look at an example from Amnesty International , an organization that takes on a myriad of global social issues . They created a quiz " Which social justice advocate are you ? " that is a personality type quiz in which each quiz taker is paired up with a well-known ( or obscure ) global advocate . <p> The concept here is to pick a few of those most prominent areas that Amnesty is working on and highlight them with a quiz . With a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shear number of ideas to choose from for a quiz , so they stuck with the most pressing ones for the quiz . <p> Step 2 : Write a strong and assertive headline <p> Headlines make a massive difference for quizzes because the title is often all that gets shared on social media ( which is responsible for 75% of quiz traffic ) . Based on crunching numbers from 2500 Interact quizzes , two title templates have stood far above the rest . <p> 1 . " How much do you actually know about ? " for example " How much do you actually know about North Korea ? " this title is a multiple choice template that challenges your readers to find out if they really know as much as they think they know . Quiz titles with the word " actually " in them get twice as much traffic on average . <p> 2 . " Which ( blank ) are you ? " for example " Which social justice advocate are you ? " This one plays to our natural narcissism . We just like hearing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells people about themselves . <p> Step 3 : Create quiz questions that establish a connection <p> No other form of content can compare to the questions of a quiz . This is where you get an opportunity to talk with each web visitor individually , even if millions of people take your quiz . This is valuable time in which you can build rapport with people who may eventually become volunteers or donate . <p> When writing quiz questions , remember to keep it light . Let your personality and quirkiness shine through and speak like a normal human . We ran a test and found that the best quizzes use a lot of personal language , like " I " " you " and " we " these are words we use a lot when talking to friends , so if you keep your writing style similar to the way you actually talk , the quiz will benefit . <p> As far as logistics go , we 've found that somewhere between 6 and 15 questions work best . Less than that and you do n't  have enough time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bored and move on . Also , its best to have at least a few image questions , and its optimal to have a mixture of text and image questions . <p> Step 4 : Craft quiz results that encourage and educate <p> Quiz results should be made 85% to put a smile on peoples faces , 10% to educate , and 5% to sell . Your primary goal with a quiz is to reach people on social media , and the things that get shared on social media are the things that make us smile . <p> When writing your quiz results , be sure to have an overwhelmingly positive tone , provide a strong explanation of why the result is being given , and keep it honest ( no buttering people up ) <p> Step 5 : Follow up and repeat <p> Think about this , when people read the results of your quiz , they are being given an assessment based on some rather personal opinions and answers to your questions . If there is ever a time when readers want to know more , its in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so important to provide personalized links to each quiz result . These links can lead to contact forms for following up , or to more content based on the particular result , but the important thing is to have them . <p> One of the biggest benefits to using quizzes in your content is the personalization they provide . Quizzes provide a way for you to continue conversations with interested visitors in a pointed way . <p> Interact loves working with non-profits and offers a 50% discount to any registered not-for-profit entity .

@@22713666 @2713666/ <h> How to use quizzes in your marketing <p> On August 1st 2014 , independent tv show studio c launched a quiz titled " Which Studio C Character are You ? " using Interact to build the quiz . Within a week the quiz had received 100,000 hits and garnered more than 1000 comments on Facebook . It provided a huge boost in both viewership and engagement for the show . <p> Studio C is just example of a brand benefiting from quizzes lately , every few days another marketing team comes up with a brilliant way to use a quiz and drives huge traffic . Content producers are getting scrambling to get involved , but creating quizzes is not quite so simple as writing an article or recording a video , there is scoring and logic and images that must be placed correctly to maximize the reach of your quiz . <p> Luckily , the best quizzes have a lot of common themes , and here at Interact we are constantly analyzing our portfolio of over 2500 quizzes to find out just what makes an awesome quiz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then walk through three case studies of quizzes that really nailed it when it comes to going viral . <h> Part 1 : The secrets of awesome quizzes <p> 1 . Getting the topic right <p> Before you can even begin writing a quiz , you need a topic what 's it going to be about ? The right topic will resonate soundly with your audience and drive social shares . After reviewing all the quizzes that have been made on Interact , here are some suggestions on getting the topic right . <p> Go after a small-ish audience . Do n't  try to reach all 7 billion people with your quiz , that 's not going to happen ( sorry ) . Instead , find an audience of people who will really care about your quiz and cater to them even if its not a massive audience . <p> My favorite example of this being carried out well comes from Faquier County , Virginia , a place you 've never heard of unless you 're from there . The local newspaper created a quiz titled " Where should you live in Faquier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of transparency , there are only 80,000 people living in Faquier county . However , one week after launching the quiz , 25,000 of those residents had taken the quiz . <p> To put that in perspective , poll data shows that only 50,000 of the residents voted in the last election . If you make a quiz for an audience who cares , you 'll get traffic . <p> Speak to one person . Expanding on the last point , you 'll want to craft a topic for one person . Think of someone who will really enjoy your quiz and speak directly to them . This will help you understand who your audience is and what they expect out of the quiz . If you ca n't think of one person , you 're probably doing it wrong . <p> Know your audience . If your primary reader is really into fishing , do n't  make analogies about arts and crafts , make analogies about reeling in huge fish . ( We have a fishing tackle customer ) . Knowing your audience means writing a quiz that resonates with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a story to tell , tell it to your audience . <p> 2 . Crafting a quiz title <p> A full 80% of people will decide if they want to take your quiz based on the title you give it ( no pressure ) . Since quizzes usually get found on social sites , the title is really the only thing people see before clicking through . Lucky for you , there are a few kinds of titles that consistently perform well , no matter what the industry . <p> The " Actually " title : " How much do you actually know about the world cup ? " this is a knowledge test quiz . You will set up various questions that have one correct answer , and at the end quiz takers will find out how they did . However , the word actually triggers a challenge response from people and they will be more inclined to take your quiz because no one wants to back down from a challenge . <p> Could you pass the ? title : " Could you pass the U.S. citizenship test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again just a knowledge assessment , it really hits home . For American citizens , we really should be able to pass the citizenship test , but can we ? We also had the University of Illinois create a series of quizzes about famous historical documents , stuff like " Could you pass 8th grade history right now ? " These quizzes are goofy , but also rooted in real concepts , which makes them awesome . <p> The " Which ( blank ) are you ? " quiz : This is the personality quiz , adapted to any industry . It can be anything from " Which hookah are you ? " to " Which movie character are you ? " many of the most popular quizzes are set up in this format , and all you have to do for a quiz like this is come up with various personalities ( whether those are products or people ) and link your questions to those personalities . <p> The celebrity comparison title : " Which celebrity chef should cook for you ? " there is an innate connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ourselves in them . You can draw on that connection to gain quiz views by making a personality quiz with celebrities instead of products or personalities . <p> New ! The " Can we guess your ? " title : " Can we guess your age ? " This title is just beginning to creep up and has had its first few successes . This is once again a personality quiz , but instead of wording the title as " Which are you ? " its reversed so the quiz seems to be guessing which you are . <p> 3 . Writing engaging quiz questions <p> The quiz questions are my favorite part . This is where you get to hold a full conversation with quiz takers and really get to know them . Until quizzes , no other form of content could really offer this kind of interaction , and its awesome . Here are a few ways to maximize your questions to build rapport with visitors . <p> Be yourself . This is the biggest one to remember if you are goofy , be goofy , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a quiz that has no personality to it . People like talking to people but hate inputting information into a computer . The biggest difference between a quiz that goes viral and a survey that you have to pay people to take is how much fun a quiz is and that fun stems from injecting personality . <p> Do n't  talk too much . When writing quiz questions , do n't  go crazy . We had one customer create a 98 question quiz that ended by telling you what kind of Gatorade you are . Who wants to sit through 98 questions to find out what kind of Gatorade they are ? Ideal quizzes have 6-12 questions , that 's enough questions to build a connection with quiz takers but not so many that people get bored . <p> Be edgy . Quizzes get shared on social media . You know what else gets shared on social media ? Cat pictures and the Kardashians . You need to write quiz questions that are going to prevent people from clicking away to look at cat pictures and Kardashians . One effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A good example comes from a guy who made a quiz about North Korea . Let 's just say the " dear leader " would n't be too happy with the way the quiz is written , but its hilarious and made me want to continue answering questions . <p> 4 . Creating share-able quiz results <p> The results of your quiz present an opportunity to take the quiz and amplify its reach . The quizzes that end up with millions of views all have excellent results that are set up for sharing . I 'll explain what that means by going over the elements of share-able results . <p> Be kind . We typically share things on social media that make us look good . Give people quiz results that make them look good and youll get more social shares . To be kind , pick out the best elements of your result and focus on them . For example , if you tell someone they are like Amazon in the " Which company are you ? " Quiz , focus on how efficient the company is . <p> Do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people up in the hopes of getting more shares . As per the previous point , focus on what 's actually good about your quiz result instead of just telling people how great they are with nothing to back that up . <p> Prepare to be shared . There 's a formula for how every Interact quiz gets shared . " I got ( my result ) ( title of the quiz ) " so " I got Amazon which awesome company are you ? " When you write your quiz , be sure to name both the quiz and each result appropriately so that when you do get shared its an effective share that drives traffic back to your site . <h> Part 2 : Three quiz use cases to boost your marketing <p> 1 . Forbes : Use a quiz to provide personalized content recommendations <p> Publishers spend tons of money producing content that has a 24-hour life on Facebook , gaining thousands of visits , but then struggles to get more than a few new clicks after a week or so , despite a huge investment that went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . You can set up a personality type quiz , and in each result include a link to an article that fits the quiz takers personality . <p> That 's exactly what Forbes did with their college quiz " Which college is right for you ? " for each result they included a link to the Forbes college adviser , a tool that Forbes invested a lot of money into but has gone somewhat dormant . Quiz takers are interested in finding out more about their personality type at the end of your quiz , so provide a personalized content recommendation to find out more . <p> 2 . Amnesty International : Use a quiz to highlight lesser known parts of your work <p> For the last 50 years , Amnesty has worked hard to bring world issues into the light for the world to address . They used a quiz to help accomplish that and so far more than 25,000 people have taken the quiz . Its titled " Which social justice advocate are you ? " and is a personality quiz with great world peace leaders as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has " characters . " TV shows , movies , books , etc . Just set up a personality type quiz that has one character as each result and watch it run . Make sure to follow the " be kind " rule on this one . No one wants to share a result that makes them look like the dumbest character in your book . <p> 3 . Staples : Use a quiz to personalize product recommendations <p> E-commerce sites can use quizzes to provide personal recommendations to every single visitor . There was a study done which found that providing personal recommendations improves sales but 37% . Setting up personalized products like Amazon is expensive and time consuming , but with a quiz its pretty simple . All you have to do is set up a personality type quiz , but replace the quiz results with different products . <p> Staples did exactly that to promote a suite of apps theyve released for small business owners . The quiz was " Are you a workaholic " and the personality results ranged from " yes , definitely " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included a link to download an app from Staples that would help the quiz taker no matter what position they are in . <p> This model can be replicated with virtually any site that has a variety of products . Weve seen it done from everything from Hookah to Clip-on nails . All you have to do is set up a quiz with your products as the results and include links to buy the recommended item . <h> Conclusion : Get Involved <p> Because of social media , quizzes can blow up almost instantly and get hundreds of thousands of visits in mere days . Its happened time and time again , and it can happen for your site too . After looking at more than 2000 quizzes , we pulled out the best elements of each one and shared them with you . Now its your turn to take the reigns and create an awesome quiz . To get started , head to tryinteract.com ( the first quiz is on us ) 
@@22713667 @2713667/ <h> How to make a pub quiz for your website <p> The pub quiz is a staple in European pubs , in the UK alone . more than 22,000 quizzes occur each week , and quiz nights consistently bring in the largest sales for many pubs . A few times recently , customers of Interact have contacted me asking how to turn their pub quizzes into online versions they can share with people who do n't  make it to the in-person events . <p> After giving some tips , we had our first success story from Trainer Baade in Germany , their 40-question online pub quiz was taken 7,847 times and 45 people chimed in to comment on the quiz not bad for an online secondary , and they also reported that the quiz increased the in-person attendance for subsequent quiz nights at their actual pub . <p> So it works pretty swimmingly , now let 's get down to how creating a pub quiz to put on your website and social media actually works . There are a few steps to perfection . <h> Step .5 : Come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz done but just want to put it online , in that case skip this step . If you are looking for a quiz idea , here are a few that our customers have come up with for your use . <p> -Famous faces quiz : " Do you know who this is ? " can be applied to politics , sports , or entertainment <p> -Sports quiz : " How much do you know about your team ? " is just one example , you can also quiz people about the events that occurred within a year for a sports league . <p> -News quiz : - Theres always news , so this is an evergreen topic for your pub quizzes , especially online where its easy to aggregate news and make questions about it . <h> Step 1 : Formulate the questions for an online format <p> In an actual pub , teams write their answers in , but online you cant do and provide the correct answers immediately ( you do n't  have someone there to score every quiz ) . That means in your quiz you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the correct answers that are obviously one of the choices for each question . It helps to have a good knowledge of the subject when thinking of wrong answers , but if you really do n't  know about the subject , just Google it and find some similar but wrong answers for each question . <h> Step 2 : Input questions and answers to Interact <p> This parts not rocket science once you know what kind of questions you want to ask . The Interact quiz builder just have an input where you type in the question and the possible answers , checking a box for the correct one . ( just like the screenshot below ) . The difficult part is writing questions if you do n't  yet have them , and I 'll go into that below . <p> Tips for writing quiz questions <p> This is a bit odd because I usually tell people to follow the Pub Rule , which says that you should n't ask any quiz question that you would n't ask in a pub , but since were already talking about a Pub Quiz here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the real tips I have for writing your quiz questions . <p> -Act like you 've had a few : No one wants a well-scripted Pub Quiz question brashness and a bit of goofiness are definitely in order for a good set of questions . <p> -Use images : there is a strong correlation between images in quizzes and the amount of traffic they end up getting . Make sure you use high quality images , we have a list of free sites for finding images here if you want a hand with that . <p> -Shorten it up : - In a live Pub Quiz setting there 's a lost of alcohol and competition to keep people interested . Online , when only one person is taking a quiz at a time , you do n't  have those same benefits so you need to shorten the quiz up . Ideally that means around 10 questions , but sometimes it can be more ( our example quiz here has 40 ) <h> Optional , show correct answers after each question <p> One additional thing you can do for each quiz question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately after they answer the question . Sometimes this helps keep people interested throughout a quiz , but other times it prevents people from finishing your quiz , so if you really need people to get to the results I 'd recommend not showing this screen . <p> When you do show this screen and reveal the correct answers immediately after each question , you get a chance to explain why that answer is either right or wrong . This is an important place to be somewhat thorough as you do n't  want to piss people off by not fully explaining the correct option . <h> Step 3 : - Show the results of the quiz <p> Based on how people answered the quiz questions , Interact will automatically calculate and print out the score of what the person got . Then you also get a chance to add an image and give the result a title and description . With the Pub Quiz format , its not imperative to really include anything except that link I mentioned . You want to make sure and link out to your website . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real Pub Quizzes on their social media profiles , these links pointing back to your site can get people to your domain and in the door for your next physical event , without them people might not ever associate the quiz with your site or Pub . <h> Step 4 : Share on your website and social profiles <p> We have a whole tutorial on how to embed your quiz. - We also have a guide on how to share your quiz. - I 'm going to embed the quiz that we 've been following right here in this post because that 's by far the best way to see how it really works . Feel free to take it , but its in German . <p> The advantage to having the quiz embedded on your site rather than using a link we provide you with is that you get to have all the interaction ( comments and such ) be on your website where people can search around , read other posts , or buy things from you . The screenshot below is from the Trainer-Baade quiz we 've been following ( that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite popular with the comments and people really enjoyed it . <p> That 's the basics of making a successful online Pub Quiz . If you 've run them successfully in person it should be a breeze for you , and adding them to your online presence can really boost your in-house attendance and in turn bring in more revenue . 
@@22713668 @2713668/ <h> How to make your first quiz <p> Over and over again amazing companies sign up to make quizzes but get lost somewhere between excellent idea and superb outcome . There 's a lot to account for between design , writing , and sharing of the first quiz , and given that many marketing departments have n't used quizzes yet , it can be quite daunting . This guide is designed to show you how the process works for setting up and running that first quiz campaign so hopefully it wont be a burden for you . <h> 1 . Writing the quiz <p> This is where most of the grunt work happens . A lot must be done to create quality quiz questions and results , and a good amount of questions we get from customers revolve around how to write effective quizzes . Luckily , there is a basic formula that the best quizzes follow , and your creativity can round out the rest of the operation . <p> Writing headlines <p> The " Which are you ? " This is your typical " Which handbag are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies . We ran a test to see how well this type of quiz works and found that when the three words " which " " are " and " you " appear in a quiz title , it gets more than twice the traffic on average versus all Interact quizzes . <p> The news quiz headline : " How much do you know about ? " I call this one the news quiz headline because it originates from the news sites of old when internet broadcasters would publish things like " How much do you know about last week ? " <p> As news has evolved , innovative sites like The Huffington Post have taken the reigns on the ever-popular news quiz and brought it to new heights . The quiz pictured below is titled " How unaware are you ? " and is a year-end review of 2014 with a snarky twist . <p> This type of quiz is by no means limited to the news however , and we 've seen everything from " How much do you know about the AR-15 ? " ( machine gun ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " ( at a wedding ) <p> The entertainment title : " Which celebrity are you like ? " We get exposed to so many celebrity references on the daily that its very effective to create quizzes that involve celebrities . <p> Writing questions <p> The thing that really sets quizzes apart from everything else in the world of content is the ability to connect directly with the people who are on your website through questions . You are able to ask questions and immediately get answers from your visitors and then provide a result based on how they answer . This is as close to a real human conversation as it gets with online content . <p> Also , with quiz questions you have the opportunity to use a massive amount of visuals , and pictures truly can speak a thousand words . The question example from The Huffington Post below is very well done , let 's go over the key elements of a good quiz question . <p> First , each question should fight its own battles . Every single question of your quiz has to compete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for granted that people will finish your quiz . The cheat way to do this is to just use pictures as the possible answers , this makes your quiz much more game-like right from the start . <p> Second , speak like a human . Remember that part about quizzes having the unique advantage of being hyper-personal ? To fully benefit from that , you 'll need to write like you would to a person in a one-on-one scenario . One of our earliest customers was from Ireland and they came up with the " Pub Rule " which says that you should never write a quiz question that would be weird to ask a friend at the pub . <p> Third , do n't  talk too much . The top 100 quizzes average 8 questions and none goes over 15 . That range will take your audience about 3 minutes to finish the quiz , which is an ideal amount of time for not losing their attention to something more interesting on the internet . <p> Writing results <p> If the quiz questions are what makes quizzes unique from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make quizzes become so viral compared to all other forms of content . Quiz results are where you tell people how they did or what their personality type is , and its where they have a chance to share the quiz and drive more people to take it . The best quizzes that end up with hundreds of thousands of views have results that entice sharing , and they all have a few things in common . <p> First , they are kind . I use the word kind because it insinuates a certain method of acting that is genuinely uplifting . The reason for this is that we use social networks as bulletin boards to broadcast our successes while we shew our failures away with no proclamation . Since most quiz traffic comes from sharing on social networks , you must make your quiz results appear as successes , even if they are not . Take , for example , this quiz result ( pictured below ) of me failing a Huffington Post quiz . Even though I 'm called a nincompoop , I still get a Gif of Clint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Second , follow up with prospects . Think about this . Youve just asked someone a set of very personal questions through a quiz and are now giving them a quiz result . Of course that person is curious to see what you say about them , it does n't  matter that it comes from an online quiz . However , just a simple bit of text is usually not enough to satisfy the curiosity of quiz takers . You need to give something more , and that something more comes in the form of a link . For example , if you tell someone they do n't  know much about the years news , then link to a list of the top news stories for the year . <h> 2 . Designing the quiz <p> Design is a huge part of quizzes . The main thing that sets the quizzes of old apart from what 's popular now is the way they look . After paying hyper-close attention to the design on quizzes that have amassed over 5 million views , here are the things that stick out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scroll down a bit and you 'll see how quizzes get shared on Facebook and Twitter . One thing that is extremely prominent on the top two social networks is that the cover photo of the quiz is featured strongly . You want to pick a photo that features people ( study on why ) , and a photo that is high quality so your quiz looks professional . <p> Second . use images in your questions . Every one of the top 100 quizzes built using Interact ( which total over 3 million views ) , has at least one image question . What I mean by image questions are questions like the one above from The Huffington Post where the answer choices are represented by images instead of just text . When quizzes were largely repopularized in 2014 by sites like Buzzfeed , a big part of the reason for the renewed success was because of the use of images over text . Make sure to use images in intelligent ways to maximize your chances of success . <p> Third , match your brand . Since content marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web has exploded with articles , infographics , videos , and quizzes . Its honestly gotten out of control to the point where its now an arms race to create the most effective content in volume . One thing you cant afford to do when investing this amount of time and money is to have all your various forms of content look different . With Interact you get full control over the colors and fonts on your quiz so you can make each quiz look exactly the same as all your other content and prevent the loss of customers who may think your quiz belongs to someone else . <h> 3 . Sharing the quiz <p> Once the quiz is done , its time to get it out into the world . Youll be presented with a screen that looks like the one below , with a smorgasbord of options for sharing . It can be a bit much at first , so let 's break it down . <p> Facebook <p> This social network controls more than 50% of quiz traffic , it ca n't be ignored . <p> To share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . The first thing is to click on the Facebook button on this embed page of the Interact quiz builder . This will shear the title of the quiz along with the cover image onto your timeline . However , Facebook will sometimes block this for business pages to prevent spam . In that case what you 'll want to do is actually take the quiz yourself and share the quiz through the result that you get . This will result in something like what I have pictured here <p> Twitter <p> While not the leader in quiz traffic overall , some quizzes get the majority of their views from Twitter . To share a quiz on Twitter as a brand , you have to do a little bit of work ( but not too much ) . Because Twitter wont automatically pull your quiz cover photo or results photo , you have to share a link to your quiz along with an image that 's automatically added . Check out this PBS quiz tweet for an example of a well done tweet . <p> Your Website <p> The best way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on your own website . Once a quiz is on your website , you can edit the social share link to point back to the post on your site that includes the quiz , so all traffic comes back to you . To embed a quiz on your site , you can choose between a javascript and an html link to embed the quiz . There 's a whole post on that here . <h> 4 . Analyzing the results . <p> Leads <p> The easiest way to prove the value of your quiz campaigns ( and get budget approval for more quizzes ) is to generate new leads through the quiz itself . These are customers who give you their contact information ( email address , name , etc. ) in return for seeing their quiz results and perhaps some other incentive . <p> Quizzes can be extremely effective for lead generation , and some companies ( like the one pictured below ) have been able to achieve 50% opt-in rates on their quizzes . You can set up your own lead gate like the one pictured below using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom message so your customers know its from you . <p> This does n't  work all the time though , in general , if you have good success with email marketing in your business its smart to use your quiz to collect leads , if you do n't  traditionally use email marketing , it does n't  make sense to start with a quiz . <p> Social shares <p> While not directly turned into revenue , it looks pretty sweet when a quiz gets shared all over the place . Interact will give you a raw number of how many people have shared your content on social sites , and a views counter will indicate how many people those shares are reaching . <p> One of the coolest examples Ive seen came from The Red Lobster , who 's shrimp quiz got nearly 200,000 likes on Facebook ( pictured here at 119k ) . Each of these likes acted like a little beacon for the quiz , propelling it to reach hundreds of thousands of people . <p> Big Data . <p> I just wanted to put that word in here because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I think is hilarious . When you put together an Interact quiz and share it , you will get some big data to work with . The readout will look something like what 's pictured a bit below . There are a few key inputs to pay attention to . <p> First , how people answered . You 'll get a breakdown of how people answered your quiz questions , so for example if you ask " What does your business do ? " you 'd get a readout of what your customers do for a living . You can use this information to target your content and calls to action directly towards the actual people who are on your website . According to Hubspot , personalized calls to action convert 42% better. - Knowing how to personalize those buttons and offers is the hard part which can be taken care of with a quiz . <p> Second , how your quiz is doing . When you are investing resources into creating quizzes , its vital to maximize your ROI . Knowing how many people finish your quiz and what percentage actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement . " If you ca n't measure , you cant improve " Youll get a readout of these statistics so you can improve each quiz . 
@@22713669 @2713669/ <h> 5 New features to make your quizzes even more awesome <p> We keep a list of every single feature request we get at Interact . If you ask for something , it will be written down and ( hopefully ) built . Thanks to everyone who requested the five features we 've implemented recently , here they are in all their glory . <h> 1 . Immediate response questions <p> Sometimes you just want to tell people they are wrong ( or right ) , without having to wait through all the questions of a quiz . That 's why we implemented immediate feedback multiple choice questions . With this option you can give people a quick answer as to whether they got each question right and also provide an explanation of the answer . <p> There have already been many great examples of providing immediate feedback , and one of my favorites comes from Gemalto . They made a quiz to determine if people can tell the difference between science fiction and real technological breakthroughs . Its a great quiz , and they even created custom graphics for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate feeback on because the questions are each unique , there 's not really a flow to them where it makes sense to wait until the end to give a determination of right and wrong . <h> 2 . Custom call to action colors <p> This is a little feature that can make a big difference . Hubspot did a study and found that personalized calls-to-action increase conversions by 42% , and part of personalization is color scheme . <p> For example , this quiz below from TravelAlerts uses an orange start button to match their largely Orange color scheme . With this step , you can now customize pretty much every aspect of your quiz to match whatever color scheme you have . <h> 3 . In-app lead capture <p> While we do our best to add new email providers to our system ( we now support Marketo ! ) , we still do n't  have all of them . That 's why we recently introduced in-app lead capture . Basically that means you can acquire leads within Interact and save them in an excel spreadsheet to be downloaded and exported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a nice solution for email programs that do n't  have APIs we can connect to , so you can still use the lead capture feature on your quizzes . <p> P.S. this has been quite a success so far , it was just introduced a few weeks ago and already 17,000 new leads have been collected . <h> 4 . Closed loop to keep your traffic <p> One thing we constantly obsess over is how to ensure great ROI from quizzes , and a big part of that is driving social traffic back to your domain where sales funnels start . Our solution to making sure Facebook and Twitter viewers end up on your website is to create a closed loop . <p> What happens is you create a quiz on Interact and embed it on your site , then you set the share url to be that blog post , and when people share the results of your quiz it will end up like this . " I got ( my result ) ( title of the quiz " myblogpost.com <h> 5 . Picture questions <p> Sometimes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't enough room to make a 1000 word quiz question , you can now put pictures as your questions . Of course you can still add text , but the picture is what 's really important . <p> There are a lot of things you can do with this , you can put a picture of an item and ask people to identify it , you can have the picture accentuate the question in same way ( like the one below ) . Or the picture can be part of a puzzle that must be solved with the questions answer . <p> That 's all for now , if you have feature suggestions email sales@tryinteract.com 
@@22713670 @2713670/ <h> 3 Easy ways to make your content Interactive <p> I was playing a game called concept over the holidays this year . In the game you place markers on various pictures on a board in an effort to convey a concept to the other players . As the person who knows what the concept is , its extremely silly to watch people to desperately to guess something as simple as " Lion " without knowing what you know . Once the concept is revealed there is inevitably a collective sigh as everyone realizes how ridiculous their guesses were . <p> With quizzes I often feel like the person who knows the concept while potential customers guess wildly at how the interactive pieces are put together . Quizzes ( interactive content ) are a concept that seems complicated to do until you know how they are formed , and then they are really simple . <p> Because marketers often assume quizzes are complicated , theyll hire out developers to handle the formation of pieces ( we 've seen several Elance postings asking to replicate Interact quizzes ) . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive , and secondly , if you have a good success you have to go back to the developer to replicate the quiz . <p> Rather than go through all that trouble , let 's look at how you can build amazing interactive pieces from your existing content portfolio without so much hassle . <h> Example 1 : Zagat <p> The original food ratings company continues their reign as the top recommender of all things food by creating interactive pieces that tie in their existing content . That sentence basically means that Zagat is using quizzes to create social media worthy content out of their existing restaurant pages . <p> Now I want to take a step back and think about this quiz idea for a second . Zagat as a company could simply share the various restaurant pages they have on social networks and drive engagement that way , but its not exactly a groundbreaking idea . What they did instead of was feature the various pizza places in a quiz format and they ended up with an interactive piece that was not only great for Facebook and Twitter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit into the strategy behind how this quiz got built , we see that its a 5-question personality type quiz that 's been adapted to the pizza world . The questions have to do with food , but also start to get you thinking about how these random questions ( like what kind of trends you are into ) can help decide what kind of pizza you should eat . <p> At the end of the quiz is a link to check out the recommended pizza place . I personally have so much respect for this because pizza is delicious . But going back to my first point about creating content that 's worth sharing , its much easier to share a quiz result that says you are recommended Margherita at Julianas than to just share Julianas pizza parlor . These quiz results bridge the gap between wanting to share your favorite pizza joint and actually having a good reason to share it . <h> Example 2 : Forbes <p> Forbes invests in the quality of their content . They have some amazing tools on their site that are n't  super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such tool is their college adviser , which tells you which schools you should apply for based on a set of criteria . A tool like the College Adviser is n't cheap , and I can think of more than one startup that focuses solely on doing exactly what the college adviser does . <p> After investing heavily in a tool like that , Forbes is incentivized to drive traffic and users into it . One way they are doing this is with an awesome quiz called " Find your perfect match " The quiz asks a variety of questions and then provides a link to the college adviser tool , which is pre filled out based on which quiz result you get . <p> The quiz plays out more like a game than anything . Its full of images and pop culture questions that look like something youd see on a game show . These questions are n't  overly difficult to make , and this quiz took less than three days to create ( not working full time on it ) . Most of the images are of popular culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the quiz can recommend one of the sets of schools in the quiz . <p> Once you get to the results the average quiz taker is pretty curious about what this all means . After all youve just answered questions about which celebrity you want to hang out with and now you 're being told what kind of college you should go to . That 's exactly why this quiz makes perfect sense though , because the results link out to the college adviser tool from Forbes , which recommends specific schools . The quiz itself is just a top of the funnel tool to get people from search engines trying to find " college quiz " and gives those people an entertaining tool to play with that links to the end product the Forbes College Adviser tool . <h> Example 3 : Red Lobster <p> The Red Lobster is a forward thinking restaurant that is constantly innovating their content . Every year they do an endless shrimp promotion where they offer unlimited gourmet shrimp at a reasonable price . They have all kinds of delicious shrimp offerings , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of promoting each kind of shrimp on its own , The Red Lobster made a quiz to find out which kind of shrimp you are most like . <p> The strategy did n't  take any extra content work , the types of shrimp were already in place and being heavily publicized as part of the campaign , the quiz was a re-purposing act . <p> The questions are simple but profound . The quiz looks more like a serious personality test than a fun Facebook piece , but that 's part of what makes it so special . You are finding out what kind of shrimp you are , but the quiz asks how you find inspiration , its goofy but amazing all at once . <p> Once you find out what kind of shrimp you are , you 've become very involved in the quiz because of how seemingly serious the questions are . If you read the results descriptions , you 'll find nothing but positivity , and that 's no mistake . Turns out when you are nice to people that translates into sharing . Over 200,000 people like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook posts in the history of The Red Lobster . <p> The strategy used by The Red Lobster is available to so many brands who are running social campaigns . Whether its different types of shrimp or different brands of golf clubs , companies often have a variety of - product offerings that can be turned into a quiz rather easily with some personality type magic . Quizzes have much more social sharing power than the products themselves and can help propel your brand into the social world . 
@@22713672 @2713672/ <h> How to make an entertainment quiz and improve user interaction <p> All kinds of good things happen when you increase on-site time . People subscribe , share , click on ads , buy things , the list goes on . Its a constant challenge to get that average visit duration on the rise , and a quiz can help . <p> In this guide I 'll go over some basic principles for creating an entertainment quiz that is irresistible to your readers and increases engagement both on your site and on the social web . Ill be tying in examples from BBC and Raechel Ray that have combined to reach over a million people . <p> 1 . An obvious quiz title <p> What I mean is , make it clear that your quiz is a quiz . We do n't  have exact numbers to back it up , but we 've seen quizzes be the most popular article on sites from Forbes to The Washington Post and everything in between . When you 're writing a quiz title , make sure people know they will actually get to engage with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here are some examples . <p> " What kind of clutterer are you ? " From The Raechel Ray Show , this quiz promises to tell you something about yourself . In this case that something is also somewhat significant ( its always nice to identify our own problems ) . The general template used here is the " Which ( blank ) are you ? " template which promises to tell people something about themselves in return for a few minutes of their time . <p> " How much do you know about BBC Proms ? " Again , the only real way to answer this question is by asking questions , in a quiz . The reader is promised an opportunity to see how they stack up against the knowledge of the site in a battle of wits . This title template the " How much do you know ? " template , works really well for entertainment news . There are always big events happening , and you can make quizzes about them . <p> 2 . Questions that act on their own <p> Quiz questions should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forcing people to answer drab questions with answers like " somewhat , always , and maybe " your quiz questions should be fun to answer on their own . <p> Be speaking naturally ( using your writing voice ) and using a lot of imagery , you can make answering quiz questions a fun activity on its own . Since it takes about two minutes to answer every ten quiz questions on average , making this part of your quiz entertaining is a must . <p> 3 . Results that are built to be shared <p> We share things that are positive . At Interact , we ran a test of tweets that originated from quiz results and found that the majority were overwhelmingly positive in nature . In other words , do n't  tell people they are not good or inferior in any way . After all , they are here to consume entertainment content and are not keen on being put down . <p> However , do add value in your results . Shaq came up with a rule for entertainment . He said 85% to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell . You can still provide links to other content or products and give a real explanation , but focus on brightening someones day . <p> 4 . A strategy for the social web <p> There are some pretty hard-set rules for maximizing your twitter and Facebook shares , here they are . <p> Have images . Tweets with images get 18% more traffic , and Facebook posts have an even wider gap . <p> Share the title and a description . Your title is the hook , your personalized description is the reel to pull people in . <p> Get a discussion going . Quizzes with at least five comments have a much longer lifespan as people come back to weigh in on the discussion . That means you might have to respond to some of the comments yourself to get the ball rolling . <p> Weve seen quizzes " go viral " within hours of being posted and continue to stay popular as top content on entertainment sites and blogs .

In an ideal world , all of your marketing would carry the same styling so that every interaction with your brand cements your companys logo into potential customers minds . Many people are visual associate-rs , meaning that when they think of your company , the first thing that comes to mind is your logo and styling not what you actually do . Feed into this by customizing your quiz to look like your site . <p> Follow basic design guidelines . The main elements we recommend editing are the colors and images on your quiz . To help with picking out good combinations , we 've created this design sheet which shows a variety of text and background combinations that look nice when paired together . <h> Part 2 : Writing Your Quiz <p> Picking quiz topics <p> The topic of your quiz is the starting point for your success . Choosing what your quiz is about means deciding who its for and where you plan for it to be shared . In general , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz topic . <p> Target your audience ( or the audience you want ) . Let me give you an example to explain . When Staples created their best quiz , it was titled " Are you a workaholic ? " and it was created for young business owners who , on average , work 60 hours per week . Staples needed a way to reach a younger audience and chose a quiz as their method to do that . <p> Do n't  try to reach everyone . If you try to reach everyone you will reach no one . For example , there was a newspaper in Faequeir County , Virginia that created a quiz for the residents of the county , which only number 60,000 . The outcome was that 10,000 of the residents took the quiz , a very healthy percentage . If you reach one group and do it well , you 'll get enough traffic . <p> Writing Quiz Titles <p> Up to 80% of people decide if they should click on a quiz based on its title ( the other 20% look at the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing time into writing . I recommend using Upworthys method and writing out 25 different titles and then picking the best to actually use , but in the interest of time we did that for you here are the winning formulas . <p> The " Actually " headline . " How much do you actually know about the world cup ? " This is a simple knowledge test , edited to become a challenge , and who does n't  like a challenge ? This title can be applied to pretty much anything , and all you really have to do is take your title and add the word " actually " . <p> The Celebrity comparison title . " Which Celebrity do you sound like online ? " We have a global obsession with celebrities because we project ourselves onto them and feel good about ourselves because they are famous and that makes us feel famous too . This title can also be applied to pretty much any subject " Which Celebrity would live in your house ? " " Which Celebrity do you dress like ? " it goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " title . " Which superhero are you ? " " Which chair are you ? " " Which hookah are you ? " this is a great one for E-commerce sites . You can set up a quiz like this , and have the results be products you carry , then offer a discount to buy the product you are . <p> Writing Quiz Questions. - <p> The thing I really love about quizzes is their ability to connect you directly with your website visitors . Its so difficult to " humanize " the people who spend time on your web property , and a quiz gives you a unique opportunity to do that . Given this advantage , here are a few ways to sound more human online and create that connection with your visitors . <p> Let your personality shine . I like to tell people to use the pub rule . The pub rule means that you should ask questions as if you are at a pub with some friends having a good time . Do n't  be afraid to get a little edgy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think of one person who would really enjoy your quiz and talk directly to them . This will help you sound more human and loosen you up . <p> Avoid cliches . The last thing people want when taking your " fun " quiz is to think of the quizzes they had to take while in school . Do n't  have answer choices that are " always , sometimes , never " or write questions like your boring professors in college . <p> Writing Quiz Results <p> The results of your quiz is where the real magic happens . This is where you 'll be able to have people share your quiz , click through to your website , or buy products from you . You want to make sure and get this part right here 's how . <p> Be positive . Even if you tell someone they 're not very smart when it comes to your quiz topic , or they are most like Fat Albert when it comes to celebrities , there are ways to be upbeat about it . In general , pick out the best attributes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on how funny he is . <p> Stay honest . While you want to stay positive , that does n't  mean you should lie to people . Your quiz takers will know if you are just blowing smoke and wont appreciate it . The key to pulling this off is to start with facts and end with facts . <p> Prepare for sharing . People will share your quiz if its a good one ! Now you need to be ready for it . There is a formula that works with quizzes and sharing it goes like this . " I got ( my result ) ( name of the quiz ) " for example " I got newtopians , what 's your customer type ? " make sure to name your results with this in mind to maximize social shares . <h> Part 3 : Sharing and driving traffic to your quiz <p> On Facebook . Facebook owns the lions share of quiz traffic ( on average about 50% ) . Weve created two ways to share on Facebook and optimized those methods for maximum traffic generation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an image along with a link to check out your quiz . With interact , you 'll send people to a page that 's dedicated to your quiz and your quiz only , so you do n't  risk sending people to a page where theyll be tempted to click on other peoples quizzes . <p> 2 . In a custom tab . The other option for sharing on facebook is a much more permanent one . Facebook allows you to embed html in custom tabs and you can place your quiz in one of those . Check out this example from UC Davis . This option is a bit more difficult , so I created a step-by-step tutorial on it , which you can check out here . <p> On Twitter . Twitter is the second leading source of traffic for quizzes . The formula here works the same as on facebook where you 'll share the result of your quiz along with a call to action for other people to take your quiz . With twitter , a company called Buffer has created some good guidelines on when to tweet and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your quiz . <p> On your blog or website . Quizzes embed into your blog or website the same way a youtube video does . If you have n't embedded a youtube video , then no worries , we 've created this handy dandy guide for how to do that . <p> In an email newsletter . Many of you send out email newsletters and do an excellent job of keeping those subscribers interested and happy . Good news ! you can share your quiz in an email newsletter . While quizzes do n't  embed directly into emails , you can share a link back to your quiz , either embedded in a blog post ( see above ) - or on a dedicated page like the one seen below . When you create a quiz with interact , you 'll get a link you can share anywhere , including in an email newsletter . <p> That 's it ! Creating quizzes is n't as complicated as it first seems . All you need is to follow some simple guidelines and you 'll have a quiz that 's worth sharing and takes your content marketing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as the advice , were taken from Interact , which you can use to make your own quiz .

@@22713674 @2713674/ <h> How to do e-commerce in a quiz <h> Two types of quizzes to help consumers save time online or in-store shopping <p> I was in the market for three appliances recently so I hit the stores excited to see what was new in the appliance arena . After roaming down the long and winding washer-dryer alley , my initial excitement fizzled to confusion . When did laundry machines get so complicated ? Steam or no steam ? Stainless steel or diamond drum ? Cold wash or tap cold wash ? Information overdose shut down my hard drive and clouded my judgment . All the fancy features started to sound like bells and whistles and I began to focus on the easy stuff : What color would look good in my laundry room ? Not the best way to choose reliable appliances , for sure . <p> When I got home , I devoured the sites of different brands to help me figure out what I needed and what all these fancy features meant . While online shopping is more convenient , if you 're anything like me ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend hours sifting through all the content on your favorite appliance brand 's website . And if you 're not loyal to a brand , well , good luck with that ! <p> This got me thinking about how a simple quiz could guide me in the right direction . I 'll describe two ways in which a quiz can help consumers asses their needs and filter through the variety of models so they can avoid feeling overwhelmed by all the options , whether they are shopping online or in-store . <h> An e-commerce quiz that highlights popular features - <p> If you have an e-commerce business or your site caters to consumers who like to gather information before heading to the store , then a quiz can help add some quality interaction between your product line and the consumer . <p> If I go back to my experience with laundry appliances , a quiz could have helped me filter some of the online information in a more digestible fashion , especially since some brands offer appliances with features that would rival those of a subcompact car . <p> Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or better yet , replace the salesperson who does n't know his LG from his ABC . <p> Remember , the idea is not to confuse consumers with all the features and models available in the quiz questions , but to clarify some of the superior options and - suggest a few models that might interest them . <p> I focused the questions on some of the main features that distinguish the models . Washing machines come in two basic categories so the first question narrows down the options for the consumer and helps them focus . <p> The next question gives some concise information about some of the great features available in the different models . The quiz offers the details in bite-size portions . <p> If the consumer wants to read more about one of the features , they can go back to the site and seek that specific information once they know that feature has value for them . <p> The next question narrows down the options some more . <p> Price is also a factor with big-ticket items and every consumer appreciates being directed to options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz can incite consumers to enter their email to get informed about potential savings and seasonal rebates before giving them their results . <p> This extra information about potential savings is not about a particular model , and the consumer may have missed it on the website , so this would be an opportunity to send it to their inbox . <p> And now for the results : <p> The quiz is brief yet it focuses on the most popular features along with some of the more common things that customers want to know. - And there is a follow-up opportunity at end allowing the client to take the next step . <h> An assessment quiz to help consumers assess their lifestyle needs- <p> My own recent shopping experience got me thinking about what other kind of information a consumer might need that could also go into a quiz . <p> When it comes to big-ticket items like appliances , let 's face it , most people want to keep their appliances for a long time so they need to make the best choices from the start . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dryer , the Maytag man commercial was big . Not only did I need to figure out the right size , features , color and price , but I also needed to assess my laundry needs in my current lifestyle . <p> I had visited a few stores and soon realized that not all salespeople are well-versed about the features and benefits of the different models . And not one of them asked where I planned to put my washer and dryer . I put a deposit on a top-load washer only to go home and find out that the overhead space would n't allow the lid to open all the way . <p> Look how this assessment-style quiz helps the consumer think about things that will affect their choices and influence their decisions based on their own particular laundry needs . <p> This type of assessment quiz helps the consumer think first about what their needs are and reduces that overwhelm factor that- can happen when browsing a bunch of models online . <p> These are the type of questions that a salesperson wo n't necessarily ask but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the features that speak to them and forgo the features that speak to their wallet . All that value delivered in a quiz . No salesperson required . <h> Another spot for a quiz <p> In one store , I came across a computer screen where I was able to watch a how-to video on the different features of a stove . I thought this would be a great spot for a quiz allowing consumers to take the quiz as they browse or while they wait for a salesperson. - They can stock up on some of the right questions to ask by taking a simple quiz . <p> A consumer can take the quiz on this screen as they browse . <h> Which quiz would work best for my e-commerce business ? <p> If you 've got an e-commerce business and you want to help consumers discover some of the most popular products , create a quiz that helps them filter through the products more easily by highlighting the most sought-after features . Or create an assessment quiz that will help online shoppers assess their needs and feel better informed about their choices .

All the traffic in the world might make you some quick cash by selling ads , but wo n't even begin to build you a sustainable business . Thankfully , we are constantly being impressed by the downright amazing ways in which Interact customers are using quizzes to build up their businesses . Let 's dive right in and look at how you can ensure ROI from your quiz . <p> 1 . Personalize your blog content . If you blog regularly , you know just how quickly content gets lost . Once that post falls off the home page , its pretty much gone forever unless it ranks well for obscure search terms . However , if you are anything like me , each blog post requires hours of work and a huge time investment , its a shame to let that go to waste , especially if those posts are nicely set up for lead generation and feed right into your funnel . <p> Food52.com , one of the most delectable food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever way to resurrect excellent posts . They run fun quizzes like " What after school snack are you ? " where the results include Fudgsicles . This seems like just another goofy quiz , but in reality , the quizzes are designed to highlight blog posts that include recipes for each result genius . <p> 2 . Delight your own employees . We spend so much time creating content for prospective customers weve never met , but how much time do we put into creating content that is meant to simply bring joy to our own employees ? Ericcson , a giant telecommunications company that knows the value of excellent employees , decided to run an entire campaign directed at its own talent . <p> Titled " Which strategy hero are you ? " the quiz highlights internal wellness programs by helping people find their strengths and then providing opportunities to grow in those areas using company-sponsored workshops genius . <p> 3 .

@@22713681 @2713681/ <h> How to make a matching quiz using Interact <p> Matching quizzes are one of my favorite types of quiz . There 's not much thinking involved , and they are super fun ( ideally the fun to thinking ratio is very high ) . In addition to being great fun , matching quizzes tend to be very popular with audiences who appreciate the simplicity . <p> In this guide I 'll go through an example of an excellent matching quiz that we can learn from and then cover the essential elements of making a compelling matching quiz that 's optimized for social media . <h> Part 1 : An example from Hollywood <p> Our matching quiz example comes courtesy of Warriorlodge.com , a site dedicated to all things military . Theyve made a conscious effort to have quizzes be a big part of their marketing , and have developed some great ones . <p> The quiz I 'd like to focus on is titled " Can you name these military movies from a partial poster ? " this quiz really caught on with Facebook and has received over 10,000 visits . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  get two lists of items and then become tasked with pairing up the two sides . Rather , each quiz question is a piece of a movie poster and then you are given several movie titles and are tasked with picking the correct one that matches the image . <p> Each matching question gets its own screen so there 's not too much going on at once . This will help your quiz takers stay focused and be less likely to leave without finishing the quiz . <p> Immediately after answering each question you are informed of whether or not your answer is correct . Again , this is a feature that encourages people to stick around . The instant gratification acquired by knowing if you got the right answer without having to wait is awesome ( think about if you had that in school , how much less anxious you would have been ) . <p> You can also wait until the end of the quiz if you want to make people answer all the questions before doling out the correct answers . <p> At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result showing how many they got correct in the quiz . In these results you can also include a link to more information or additional content that quiz takers might be interested in . <h> Part 2 : How to make a matching quiz with Interact <p> To demonstrate just how easy it is to create a matching quiz using Interact , I 'm going to make one just for this tutorial . <p> 1 . Start with multiple choice . Interact has two options for making quizzes , multiple choice and personality . For our matching quiz , there is a correct answer ( a match ) for each question , so we want to select multiple choice , which will let us do that . - 2 . Design the quiz . Every quiz you make has fully customizable design . I recommend choosing a style that fits your quiz type . My example quiz is going to be about cars , so I went with a sleek and strong theme kind of like you 'd see on a sports car . We also have a guide for designing quizzes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff ( created by our in-house designer ) . - 3 . Give your quiz a title and description . Not a whole lot to say here , we do have a guide on how to name your quiz if you 'd like a nudge in the right direction . For matching quizzes you really ca n't screw up the title unless you overthink it and try to get fancy . Just name the quiz what it is . Also pictured in this screen is the option to show correct answers immediately after each question . I strongly recommend you do this as in our tests we found that quiz takers like having this turned on . - 4 . Write the questions . Now its time to get onto the actual matching part of our matching quiz the questions . You can do either image questions or text questions , and you have those options for the answer choices as well . I recommend using images for the questions on matching quizzes as this tends to flow better . I pulled in an image of a Jaguar and then asked people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer choices are in text and the correct answer is ticked with the " correct answer " option . ( note that the image is small here but will be full-sized in the actual quiz ) . - 5 . Set up quiz results . Since we are already telling people if they got each individual question right immediately after they answer it , I 'm not going to list the correct answers again in the quiz results . Rather , I will just give a printout of how many answers were correct out of the total . I also have the option to add images and text to these results . I 'm going to choose to just have a short snippet of text and a headline with the outcomes . One important thing you 'll notice on these results is the link to check out more about the car that 's in my quiz . Always include a link to your website in quiz results , many of these quizzes become very popular on social media , and you can miss out on the traffic if you forego these links . 
@@22713682 @2713682/ <h> 3 Ways Travel Sites Use Quizzes to Reach New Customers <p> The travel industry is competitive . Going on vacation is expensive and people tend to spend ridiculous amounts of money vacationing around the world . For the brands who compete in the travel space , there is a constant struggle to stay innovative and stand out from the competition . That 's where quizzes come in , with their interactivity and stickiness , quizzes can really put you one step ahead of the competition by entertaining perspective customers while driving new leads . <p> Weve seen some awesome examples from companies that have utilized quizzes in their marketing strategy and would like to highlight those examples so you can replicate them for your own travel site . <h> Part 1 : Three ways to use quizzes in the travel business <p> 1 . Quiz idea #1 : Where should you go ? <p> Going on a big vacation is such an investment of time , you want to make sure you 're going to the right place before spending all that money . Who better to recommend a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can provide a credible voice telling people where they would enjoy going on vacation . <p> Using the Interact personality quiz maker , you can set up different destinations as personalities and then correlate peoples interests to different places on the planet . Then , in the results you can provide a call to action for each destination . For example , a link to learn more about the destination if you are a travel content site or a link to book travel if you provide packages for that . <p> 2 . Quiz idea #2 : How much do you know about ? MindWare has an innovative business . They combine global expeditions with conferences so you can learn and travel at the same time . One of their upcoming events is a Safari in Africa combined with a few keynote speakers and days of learning . To drum up interest for the event and increase their social presence , Mindware worked with Interact to create " How much do you know about Safari ? " which asks fun questions about the African plains . <p> Check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea #3 : Where should you live ? <p> The quiz the helped launched the massive rush of quizzes recently was " Which American City Should You Actually Live In ? " which has been replicated many times with nearly equal success . People are curious about their living decisions and you can capitalized on that as a travel site . If you do reviews , you can tie the results to review pages of the recommended place , if you do travel planning you can link to pages where people can book flights and lodging in their recommended place to live . <p> This quiz seems to be the same as the first example here , but the difference is in the kind of user you will attract . Whereas with the vacation quiz you will attract an audience that 's already searching for a place to go , with this quiz you 'll be reaching a group of people who are curious and can be turned into leads over time . <h> Part 2 : Tips for writing travel quizzes <p> While in general travel quizzes can be written like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do have some specialties that I 'll go over in detail in the following few bullet points . <p> Choose from the three titles above ( but add your own spin ) . These three examples have tested to work very well . While I 'm sure there are other topic choices that can become very successful , these have done well time and again . At least for your first quiz , stick with one of them . <p> Write like you would to a friend . Travel is usually done with family and friends . When looking for travel recommendations and research , we want to feel as if we are in good hands . Write your quiz questions and results in a personal and fun tone like you would if you were recommending a place to go to a friend . <p> Create results with sharing in mind . While your quiz will provide direct ROI when people click through your results to check out offers on your site , the main way a quiz can really expand your business is through social traffic . When people finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fun and share-able snippet to put out on Twitter and Facebook . Make sure your quiz results are optimized for that meaning they should be fun and make the person sharing look good . <p> Go hyper-visual . Travel is an industry that 's dominated by visuals . When we go on vacation we come home with hundreds or thousands of pictures that we insist on sharing with all of our friends who really do n't  care that much . Make your quiz visual and beautiful to give people wanderlust . <p> Travel is an industry with lots of competition and that means there 's also lots of money up for grabs as people spend billions each year researching their travel destinations . You can use a quiz to make the travel search process more enjoyable and pull away from your competition .

Instant gratification is the name of the game , and Interact will let you make that game . In this short tutorial , I 'll walk through just how to set up your first correct answer quiz . <p> 1 . Choose the multiple choice option. - <p> Correct answer quizzes fall under the multiple choice category . You can do either true/false or a full set of multiple choice answers . Technically your questions can have unlimited answers , but I recommend sticking with 4-6 responses to each question . That will give you enough options to have good alternatives and make the quiz somewhat difficult without inundating people with tons of answer choices . <p> 2 . Set up the quiz design <p> Design makes all the difference ( ok , not actually all , but a lot ) . A good looking quiz is more likely to get shared on social sites and on average gets a lot more views . If you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive . <p> 3 . Select the " show correct answers " option <p> There 's a radio button to show correct answers immediately after each question . There 's also an option to show all the correct answers at the end of a quiz , but right now were worried about giving immediate feedback so well focus on this option . All you have to do is select that option and move on to the next step . <p> After writing each question , you 'll have a chance to explain yourself . This is your opportunity to tell people why the correct answer is right ( and they are so very , very wrong ) . Seriously though , let people down easy , insulting your quiz takers is a sure-fire way to ensure it never becomes a popular quiz .

These fonts are available on all paid subscription plans , and they look great ! <h> 1 . Helvetica : The classic clean font <p> Helvetica was invented in Switzerland , I know , I 've been to the brown brick building which housed the design studio in which it was born . Being Swiss , its a very classic and proper font that plays nice in a lot of scenarios and does n't  really clash with anything . <p> This is a great font for E-commerce and content sites , especially since many of them use Helvetica in all their content . Using Helvetica will often allow you to nearly perfectly match the rest of your content with your quiz . <h> 2 . Ubuntu : The tech font <p> Ubuntu is that third operating system that is n't windows or apple , and is loved by developers and hipsters . The font named Ubuntu takes on the same characteristics as the operating system and works very well for tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope and uncovering new things . <h> 3 . Monteserrat : The fancy font <p> Monteserrat is an exotic island in the Caribbean , which is fitting for a fancy font . Its not crazy curly or anything , but like a caribbean island , this font is tastefully different . <h> 4 . Oswald : The strong font <p> Oswald sounds strong , and it is strong . This is a great font for entertainment sites , as it matches well with meme fonts and high contrast situations . This font looks great in moderation , but I would n't recommend it if your quiz has a lot of text . <h> 5 . Lora : The news font <p> I have no story for this one , which is ironic because this font is most commonly found in news settings .

@@22713687 @2713687/ <h> How we helped Birchbox sell $7,260 worth of Facemasks using this quiz <p> In my college apartment , with a weak phone signal on a Friday afternoon I picked up the phone and called Neil Patel . He was kind enough to answer and talk with me about an idea I 'd been kicking around in my head . I wanted to create a product that would allow anyone to make a quiz and use it to generate leads . <p> To my surprise he told me that hed thought about this idea and there was no one currently doing it . ( if he did n't  know of anyone doing it , there was no one doing it ) . He sent me a link to a quiz on a Golfing website that asked you about your style of game and then recommended a Golf club for your personal style . <p> Its been over a year since that conversation , and Interact quizzes have now been used to help customers sell hundreds of thousands of dollars worth or products . <p> Today I want to share the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space online . They created an absolutely stellar E-commerce quiz that was taken over 11,000 times and led to $7,260 in sales . <p> First off , the quiz was featured on the Birchbox magazine . Embedded right into the CMS , which runs on wordpress , using the Interact iframe . I mention this because the team responsible for this quiz was the Birchbox Marketing team , and one of their main concerns was making sure it would n't take IT resources to get it set up . <p> Then you get into the questions , and this is where things get interesting . You see , this quiz is not actually that unique . One of the very first quizzes created with Interact was called " What 's your skin type ? " and it had virtually the same questions as this Facemask quiz . The point I 'm trying to make here is that its not exceptionally difficult to set up quiz questions that have the right logic for accurate quiz results . <p> And the results , where the magic happens . After answering just five questions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads because the focus is on selling products , and when someone purchases a product their contact information is collected anyways . <p> And where the money comes from . Each quiz result links to a specific product ( a recommended Facemask based on the quiz results ) . This part gets really cool because recommending personalized products makes a massive difference when it comes to sales , increasing conversions by up to 42% . <p> Personalizing product recommendations is not easy . I did some research and found a few companies that offer a personalization engine for E-commerce sites , and they start in the low $100,000 's . The price of this quiz for Birchbox was less than $1000 , that 's quite a deal . <p> Before we even started Interact , I knew that using quizzes to personalize products could be an extremely effective way to make more sales based on the recommendation of Neil Patel . Today , companies that I admire , like Birchbox , have begun using quizzes to drive sales in a very personal way . <p> To make a quiz and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quizzes are free up to 500 hits , so there 's no obligation until it starts making you money ! 
@@22713688 @2713688/ <h> How to build a long-term quiz marketing strategy <p> How many times have you done this you find a sweet new tool on the internet and get completely enthralled with it . Within the first week you 've logged tens of hours building content with the tool and its the coolest thing on the internet in your opinion . Two weeks later , you 've forgotten about the tool , you get a " come back ! " email from the tools owners , but youve already moved on . <p> Unfortunately this scenario plagues many people , we are all captivated by new " shiny " things and love discovering tools , but we do n't  always follow through . Now this only matter because some of the biggest successes come not on the first or second try , but on the 10th or 20th try , as has been the case with Interact users . Sometimes it takes a strategy that goes beyond just building out a quiz you saw online or have had in the back of your mind , sometimes you need a long-term approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 've seen to work with our portfolio of 10,000 quiz builders , here are the keys to a long-term quiz marketing strategy that really works . <h> 1 . Have a schedule <p> This one is a must-have for any sort of content marketing . Marketing people have way too much going on to not have schedules . If you decide to do a quiz once each week , stick to it and deliver that quiz every Friday afternoon ( or whenever you set the time ) . I would recommend doing a quiz once every two weeks based on what we 've seen our customers have success with . Any more than that and your audience ( and you ) will tire of making quizzes , any less and you 'll get out or rhythm too easily and stop making quizzes . <p> That being said , we do have customers who have amazing success making quizzes every single week , but think about how much time will need to be allotted to making each quiz ( on average it takes 45 minutes ) . <h> 2 . Have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people stop making quizzes is because they just run out of ideas . Many people come to us with an idea for one quiz , they make that one quiz and its very successful , but they have no other ideas so do n't  make any more quizzes . This is a shame , especially when you spend time learning how to make the first quiz and then lose that time . Here are a few ways to keep coming up with ideas . <h> Capitalize on trends <p> Stuff is always happening in the world , and that stuff is constantly changing . You can build quiz ideas around these events that gather so much attention . For example , when the mid-term elections were going on , the quiz below was released . The quiz mixes politics ( hot topic ) and currently popular republicans in the media ( another hot topic ) . The quiz was very popular ( in the realm of 20k views ) , and could be replicated next time an election rolls around without being redundant . <h> Utilize your past successes <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other form of content is their ability to intelligently provide recommendations to web visitors . Take for example the quiz below , which will determine what kind of recipe you are and then link to an article on the hosts website that actually has that recipe . <p> This might seem genius , and it is , but the method is simple . You start with popular articles on your website ( in this case a few recipes ) , then you craft a quiz that helps people find the right article for their personality bam , quiz idea . <h> Answer real questions <p> If you run out of fun things to do , you could always just be helpful ( kidding , sort of ) . If you do a quiz right , it can actually be used to answer some pretty big questions . Forbes did one recently that was designed to help prospective college students pick the right place to go to school . Now that is a seriously big question , and I really hope that no one based their entire college decision off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a real question is still there . <p> Every business has big questions that are answered with your product ( otherwise there 's really not a business , I think ) . Find out what those questions are , and you 've got great quiz ideas . <h> 3 . Treat each quiz like a project <p> You have a process for how to create new things , and it probably works excellently , but I 'll share the process one of our clients follows to make their quizzes . <p> First , formulate the quiz content . This is either done inside the Interact quiz builder or just in a word document . All the questions and results are mapped out and decided on with the content team . <p> Second , build the creatives . The graphics department is responsible for sourcing or building all the creative pieces ( images or gifs ) that are needed for the quiz . <p> Third , put everything in the system . Put all the content into Interact and build it out . <p> Fourth , get approval . I really like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an imaginary person ( in their case the managing editor at TIME magazine ) . Then , before you release any quiz ask yourself if you 'd be okay with the managing editor of TIME taking the quiz . If not , try again . <h> 4 . Assign someone to be in charge . <p> Someone has to take the lead on every project , and the same is true of quizzes . If you do n't  assign someone to do it , no one will . This does not mean that a whole team ca n't be involved ( they should be FYI ) , but it does mean that one person is responsible for delivering each quiz on time and completed .

@@22713690 @2713690/ <h> How to make a multiple choice quiz that no one can resist taking <p> I will never forget sitting down to take my Economics 101 final in college and seeing multiple choice questions with answers ranging from A to F. The look of panic that was on my face must have been priceless . As I sloughed through the plethora of answer choices , trying desperately to find the correct one , I made a vow to avoid multiple choice tests if at all possible for the rest of my education ( and I did just that ) . <p> Recently , multiple choice quizzes on Buzzfeed have been seeing millions of visits ( much to my spite ) . So what gives ? why do people actually enjoy taking these multiple choice quizzes that roughly in the same class as the horrible quiz I suffered through in college ? <p> That 's exactly what I 'll be diving into in the following 1000 words or so ( sorry for being long-winded , I promise this will be more interesting than Econ 101 ) . Without further ado , here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suck . <h> Part 1 : Writing the quiz <p> Selecting your topic. - <p> 1 . Go small . Do n't  try to reach all 7 Billion people on earth with your quiz its impossible to reach them all , I tried . To illustrate what I mean , let 's look at Faquier County Virginia , a county with population of just over 60,000 people . The local newspaper created a quiz about the countys geography and shared it out . 10,000 of the 60,000 people in the county took the quiz . Address a specific group of people , even if you do n't  think its a large enough group and make a quiz just for them . <p> 2 . Use Shaqs rule . NBA All Start Shaquille ONeal created an amazing formula for sending tweets that also applies to quizzes . He says that 80% of all his tweets are meant to entertain , 15% are to educated , and 5% are to sell you something . Your quiz should mostly exist to entertain , being informative and pushing your products should be small pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 15% of your quiz that is meant to inform ( according to Shaq ) should also be the backbone of your quiz . All great quizzes start with a real issue and then disguise it as something pure fun . Take for example the " Will you survive when the S*** Hits the Fan ? " This is a seemingly ridiculous quiz , but it also helps you find out if you could survive if something was to go terribly wrong ( which does happen in this crazy world ) <p> Writing your quiz title <p> 1 . Use the Upworthy method for excellence . Upworthy is a phenomenon of our times a website who 's entire existence revolves around re-naming content scraped from around the web . You cant argue with the stats though ( 50 million hits last month ) , and thus its smart to follow their advice for writing headlines . They recommend writing 25 different titles for each post before choosing one to actually use . That seems like an absurd amount , but once you get to number 21 you 'll see why its also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are goofy , some are dumb , and some are pure gold . <p> 2 . Present a challenge . Many of the top performing multiple choice quizzes are posed like this : " How Much do You Actually Know About The World Cup ? " by posing your test as a challenge instead of just an assessment makes it seem a lot more fun . <p> 3 . Make it very personal . Let 's face it , we all care deeply about ourselves . Play off of that by making your quizzes apply directly to the people taking it . " How Smart are You ? " is an excellent example . <p> Writing the quiz questions <p> 1 . Short and sweet works best . Do n't  have too many questions , 6-12 works best . Do n't  make your questions too long either . A good example question is " What one is right ? " <p> 2 . Hand over the mic . We love to talk about ourselves . A full 40% of all the words that come out of our mouths are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of talking about ourselves ) . Write the question answers in a way that lest your quiz takers voice their opinions . <p> 3 . Spark some thought . Never , ever write questions where the answers are ( sometimes , always , never ) . You are better than that . Write quiz questions that spark real thought by digging deep or just bringing up a new perspective . For example , " Who Started the Internet ? " is an interesting question people probably have n't thought of before . <p> Setting up the quiz results <p> 1 . Prepare for sharing . Prepare to have your quiz results shared . The formula works like this " I got ( my score ) ( name of the quiz ) " which would look like " I got : You are a genius . How smart are you ? " Anticipate how that will look to maximize social sharing . <p> 2 . Stay honest . You want to start with honesty . Do n't  tell people they are something they are n't  . This will cause your quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole . <p> 3 . Give credit where credits due . While staying honest , be nice . If someone is smart ( or dumb ) , stay positive . Remember the goal is to get shared so do n't  be mean or no one will share your results . <h> Part 2 : A couple of excellent examples <p> 1 . " How Much do You Actually Know About the World Cup ? " - The United States advanced in the world cup today , Americans are excited about soccer ( football ) for the first time pretty much ever , nationalism is at a local maximum . That make this quiz fit in perfectly with the times , and gives us a blueprint for making future quizzes . The blueprint goes like this ; when there is a major national or international event that does n't  come around very often , make a quiz to see how much people know about it . That way you 'll latch on to the press push surrounding the event . <p> 2 . " What 's Your Content Marketing IQ ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide great value without being super boring . I work in marketing and know how complicated it can be which is another reason for the appreciation I have for this quiz . Multiple choice quizzes can be used to help people find out what they need to learn . This one gets borderline educational , so be careful not to bore your readers away . <p> 3 . " Will You Survive When the S*** Hits the Fan ? " This is one of my favorites just because its so far away from being a school test that youd probably be fired if you were a professor and administered this quiz . Fittingly , it was created by a survival site The Organic Prepper ( an excellent site for everything survival rated , you 'll be prepared for the Zombi Apocalypse after reading it ) . <p> Seriously though , the quiz nails it . Its got a personality , it provides real value ( how prepared are you if something were to go wrong ? ) , and it has share-able results . ( who does n't  want to brag about their survival skills ? )

Be blunt about what you 'll be sending out <p> Its better to have people not subscribe because they are n't  interested than to lie and have people unsubscribe later . <p> 3 . Only ask for what you need <p> Do n't  ask for information you wont be actively using .

Do n't  lie to people though , focus on the good things about the quiz result that you recommend and play up the good things . <p> 2 . Include a personalized link to your site <p> Each result should link to a different part of your site that is specifically geared towards that personality type . <p> 3 . Keep it short <p> Results should n't be more than a paragraph , save the long-form content for your own website . <h> Part 5 : Autoresponder sequence <p> Quizzes should be connected to an autoresponder for best results ( unless you are calling all leads ) . here 's an example autoresponder sequence . <p> 1 .

To help , we have an entire list of stock image websites that are completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all kinds of cars , do n't  ask me why they have those , but its awesome . <p> When planning images for your quiz , account for having 6-10 questions , that 's the sweet spot in terms of quiz questions , any more and its a long quiz , any less and you leave people wanting more . Make sure to pick large images so they have quality and then scale them down to 900x400px using photoshop or paint on your computer . <h> Step 2 : Design your quiz <p> We provide a full suite of options for designing each quiz you make with Interact . This provides you with the flexibility to match your sites styling or go crazy and make a red quiz like I did in the example below . Not a whole lot to say here except to make sure you use the " custom logo " option so that when your quiz goes wild on social media and gets reposted all over the place it will still be attributed back to you . <p> Another important thing to think about when designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content from . Mobile and tablet traffic accounts for roughly half of all quiz views and a busy design is confusing on those smaller devices . Try to keep it as simple as possible . <h> Step 3 : Write your content <p> With our example quiz this is n't exactly difficult , you put pictures of cars into the Interact quiz builder and then create options for the result ( car buffs please do n't  hate me for this example question ) . The difficult part here is coming up with alternative wrong answers that are reasonable enough to be seen as potentially correct . Shouldnt be tough for yall with the expertise . I always recommend that you write at least a total of four answers ( one correct , three incorrect ) for each question . That will make it a fun game but not so many options that people get bored reading all the choices . <p> Once you have the question set up you can preview and publish to see what it will look like in production . This is a good chance to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can always make adjustments to your quiz as you notice ways to make it better . <h> Step 4 : Connect it all up <p> Now comes time to do the " grunt work " of inputting the rest of your questions and images to the Interact system . This is actually really simple and you just follow the same principle as the first question that is above . <p> One thing we have n't covered is what to put in your quiz results ( the part where you give an overall score , etc . ) . Because we are giving people their outcome after each question in this quiz , the results are not as important , but they are still a good gateway to get quiz takers onto your website and clicking around . To keep the engagement high even after the quiz is over , include a link in each quiz result to check out more content . For example , if someone scored poorly , point them to the beginners guide to cars , if they scored highly , point them to the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Your quiz can go anywhere which is nice because successful quizzes end up on forums , social sites , blogs , and everywhere in between . Its always good to start by embedding the quiz on your own site , which can be done wit a simple iframe or javascript embed code . I have an example below of the quiz we 've been working on embedded into the Interact blog . The cool thing about doing this is that you can change the social share links to point back to the webpage where your quiz is embedded so you never lose any traffic to the black hole that is social media .

@@22713700 @2713700/ <h> All You Need To Know About Writing A Quiz About Football <p> Arguably , the largest and most popular sport in America is football . The sport exists almost largely and exclusively exists in our country ( besides some other leagues , like Canada ! ) and almost everybody knows at least one if not a few of their friends that are diehard fans of their local team . <p> For myself , I actually like college football more , which might make some of you immediately stop reading this article , but bear with me here . The point of this post is n't to talk about the sport itself , but to discuss how we can write about it , and make relevant questions that might capture user 's attention . <p> Coming up this weekend we have the NFC and AFC championship games , and for those who do n't follow the NFL too closely , it 's the conference championship game for each of the two conferences in the league , and the winners go on to play in the Super Bowl . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colts from the AFC , and the Packers and Seahawks from the NFC . So what kind of quiz could we create surrounding this event ? We could choose to either create a quiz testing the knowledge of our users and ask quiz like questions about the four teams , or we could make a quiz that pairs them up with a team based on the way they answer a few questions . Let 's go ahead and create a quiz considering the latter . <p> This can be a shorter quiz , because we do n't want to drag it out too long . What we need to do here is create 6-8 questions that might give us some insight of what kind of a fan a person really is , and if they still match up with their team by answering the questions . I 'm leaning towards having the lower end of questions in our spectrum , so let 's come up with some questions that we might be able to use . <p> We can also title the quiz something interesting that might grab the viewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really belong as a fan of your conference finalist team ? <p> 1 . Which is your favorite quarterback ? ( This can be a no-brainer for fans who know their team ) 2 . What kind of city would you prefer to live in ? 3 . What kind of weather does your team prefer ? 4 . Favorite color ? 5 . Are you all for the run , or like to see the ball up in the air ? 6 . Who is your least favorite amongst these people ? <p> So with just these six questions , we can make an adequate quiz that can actually give us true answers on which team our viewer 's lean towards . We want to create four answers for each question , with each one nodding a point to a respective team . <p> I think it 's pretty self-explanatory which answer should nod to which team on this one . <p> Question Number Two : We have two coastal teams and two teams from the Midwest , so our answers could take that into consideration . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as that would generalize out a bit too much . We want to make this quiz a bit more fun , and I would even go ahead and say it 's okay if some of answers nod pretty heavily towards the team they are connected to . <p> Coastal and Snowy ( referring to Boston , where the Patriots play ) Coastal and in fact I enjoy the rain ( referring to Seattle , where the Seahawks play ) Cheese ? ( Referring to Green Bay , where the packers play ) I just like seasons ( referring to Indianapolis , where the Colts play ) <p> Question Number Three : We can create four humorous answers that would refer to each of the teams pretty exclusively . If it 's raining , we actually do better ( Seahawks ) If it 's snowing , that 's honestly fine ( Patriots ) The colder it is , the better we play ( Packers ) I prefer a climate-controlled environment ( Colts ) <p> Question Number Four : Each team has a color that defines them pretty well . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red white and blue , while the packers exclusively hold the yellow and green brand , the Seahawks have been having fun with pastels recently and the Colts have always run free with their signature blue . Yellow tickles my fancy ( Packers ) I 've recently been into pastels ( Seahawks ) I prefer the blue of a thousand seas ( Colts ) The Colors of the Greatest Country on Earth ( Patriots ) <p> Question Number Five : This question pertains to actually how the game is played . The Seahawks pose a duel threat with an amazing running back along with a talented QB , while the Patriots led the league in passing yards per game , with the Colts a bit behind them . The packers were also second in the league in rushing , so that puts them a bit towards the running game as well even though Aaron Rodgers poses an incredible threat in the air . Let 's create some answers with this knowledge . Put that ball in the air as much as you can ( Patriots ) I prefer the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colts ) Why pick one ? I love both ( Seahawks ) I like a strong arm , but the game is best on the ground ( Packers ) <p> Question Number Six : Each person may have a specific foe of some notables that they may not like , and in this question and answer we can try our best to match up which fan of which team would be most likely to pick someone that they like the least . <p> Pete Carroll " the coach of the Seahawks . Patriot fans may not like him very much because their team is playing against them . And if you 're a UCLA fan like me , you absolutely do n't like him . Tom Brady " a lot of people may not like Tom Brady too much , just becausewell just because . In this context , Colt fans are sure to pick him since they are taking him on in the game . What even is a Seahawk ? This answer obviously favors Packers fans because they 're playing Seattle . But in all honesty , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favors the Seahawks fans that might be taking the quiz , because they know very well of the Packer 's Cheesehead . <p> So now that we have all of our questions laid out in a simple fashion with each answer correlating to one team , it gives us an easy way to figure out which team the user relates most with . This is a very straightforward quiz , and if you 're a true fan of your NFL Conference finalist team , you should be able to get them . Give it a try ! <p> So we 've discussed a very straightforward quiz today , with each answer having a specific correlation to a team . You can use the research and advice found in this post to make a similar sports quiz of your own , or go ahead and use this one . <p> It 's pretty easy to use some simple research of a top you want to make a quiz about , and then make it interesting enough to ensure that the user finishes the quiz and sees their results . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a quiz like this . Having it only be six questions long also ensures notable progress in the bar across each section , encouraging the user to complete the quiz and find out their result . 
@@22713701 @2713701/ <h> All the ways to customize an interact quiz <p> One of the best things about Interact quizzes is that they can be customized to look any way you want . That means you can match your sites style , branding , and user experience so your customers can feel comfortable taking your quiz and focus on how much fun it is . Because we keep releasing new ways to make your quizzes look awesome , I created this post that will continually updated as we roll out new customization options . <p> ( Note , all of these customization options can be accessed under " edit design " in your dashboard , or in the interact quiz builder ) <p> 1 . Adding a logo . You want your brand experience to be the same across all platforms . Why would you sacrifice that by using a quiz that 's got an interact logo plastered on it ? ( not that we do n't  have a nice looking logo ) . What I 'm saying is that you work hard to establish a brand identity and you do n't  want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branding . We like to keep things simple when it comes to logos , and your brand appear in the bottom right hand corner just enough to be seen but not so blatant that its annoying . <p> For best results , upload a . png file , if you do n't  know what - a . png file is , ask Bill in IT ( it just seems like everyone in IT is named Bill ) . <p> 2 . Custom cover photos . The quiz above pretty much nails it as far as cover photos go . We did a huge study of quizzes and found that photos of one smiling person attract the most clicks . Gender and age do n't  really matter , but do n't  use any weird photos or pictures of your kids or anything like that . Once again , upload a high quality photo ( blurry pictures look super jank ) , the recommended dimensions are 900x400px . <p> 3 . Changing background colors . You can make the background of your quiz any color you want in just two clicks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous territory . Did you hear about the designer who made a bright yellow quiz ? Me neither , because he got fired and switched jobs to become a professional football player not a bad outcome I guess . <p> Back to reality , our designer made this super nice list of ways to combine font colors and background colors to make something that does n't  look hideous . <p> 4 . Customizing font color- I kind of covered this one in the previous chart . In general , stick with white or black text . Slight variations ( like light grey or light blue ) can work but do n't  get crazy . <p> 5 . Font style ( coming soon ) - Weve picked a few different fonts that look great and fit well with different types of sites . More on that to come soon .

@@22713703 @2713703/ <h> The Best Quiz Maker <h> How to go about making a quiz ( 4 steps ) <p> 1 . Picking a topic that works. - Quizzes can work for any industry , we 've had everything from Retail Brands to Hospitalsc build quizzes using Interact . The key to finding a topic that resonates is to understand who your audience is . Here are a couple of tips for how to do that . <p> Write the quiz for one person.Think of one person , a specific person who would really get a kick out of the quiz you are building . Are they a potential customer ? Would they share your quiz ? If you ca n't think of anyone who would like your quiz , then you might be doing the wrong thing . On the other hand , if you can think of one person , odds are there 's a lot of others just like that person . <p> Write for a very interested audience . There was a quiz made just for people living in Faequeir County , Virginia , a county with population of just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your overall audience is n't very large , if they are hyper-interested , you can create a quiz that gets healthy traffic . <p> 2 . Writing the quiz title. - Titles make a massive difference . The same piece with two different titles can see hugely different amounts of traffic . Quizzes are a bit different from typical posts because they are a one-to-one medium rather than an article where you are just talking to people . Given this advantage , here are a couple of quiz title templates that work very well . <p> The " Actually " Title : Here are two versions of one title . " How much do you know about Apple ? " or " How Much do You Actually Know About Apple ? " That one word changes everything . Instead of this being a boring knowledge test , it becomes a challenge to see how smart you are . <p> The Celebrity Personality Title : Again , here are two versions of a quiz : " What 's your personality ? " vs . " Which Celebrity is Most Like You ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but add in a celebrity and it becomes so much more intriguing . <p> Do you really ( blank ) ? For example " Do you really know how to fish ? " this one is again a test of knowledge , but it comes off as a personal assessment of how great you are . <p> Which ( blank ) are you ? " Which Cheese are You ? " or " Which Truck Are You ? " these quizzes are another version of the classic Meyers-Briggs personality quiz but with weird or odd objects super-imposed . <p> 3 . Creating your quiz questions. - The questions of a quiz are your opportunity to have a conversation with every single person who takes your quiz and build some chemistry so theyll feel a connection with your brand . Here are a few ways to seem more personable online and create those connections . <p> Speak like yourself ( but like your tipsy self ) . The internet is a place for blowing things a little bit out of proportion . We often turn to it out of boredom or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I 'm getting at with all this is that you should make your quiz questions fun to read and fun to answer . <p> Get very personal . We very much like to talk about ourselves . Make your quiz questions fit into that desire . Ask questions that make your quiz takers think . <p> 4 . Writing the quiz results. - The results of your quiz are where the magic happens ( the magic being when people share your quiz and drive traffic back to it ) . There are a couple of tricks to make this happen more often , here are the things we 've learned . <p> Use psychology to be positive . In a 2008 Harvard Article on positive psychology , they say that positive psychology involves positive emotions and personal strengths . Pick out the positive emotions and strengths of each result , no matter what it is , and focus on those . <p> Be honest . Positive psychology only works when its based in truth . As you can see below , even if you tell someone they are a cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and used . <p> 5 . Generating new leads ( optional ) . - Quizzes boast a 50% conversion rate , meaning that half of all people who finish a quiz will put in their email address to receive updates ( that number is averaged across 1000 quizzes weve run analytics on ) . Once again , there are some best practices to follow when doing lead generation for your quiz . <p> Make the offer relevant . One of our highest-performing quizzes of all time is one about Microsoft Excel . The quiz generates leads for a newsletter about Microsoft Excel , and the lead generation form asks if people would like to opt-in to learn more about Excel not bad . <p> Make a trade . You are asking for people to hand over their information , in return they will be expecting you to give them something . Make that something worth it . <h> - Three examples of quizzes in real life <p> 1 . ZGallerie <p> Zgallerie is a home furnishings brand with a loyal following . They created a quiz to help potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and its been a smash hit . People are in love with the brand , the quiz , and their results . <p> 2 . Forbes <p> Forbes has used Interact to create a college quiz for the last two years . This quiz gets 250,000 visits a year , and fuels a tool they 've created that helps you compare colleges . It has also led them to a #1 ranking for the term " college quiz , " a term that entire companies have been formed around . <p> 3 . Red Lobster <p> The Red Lobster created their most " liked " Facebook of all time using interact . Its the Shrimp Personality quiz you see below , and it racked up nearly 200,000 likes in a few weeks , a testament to the enormous power of quizzes . 
@@22713704 @2713704/ <h> How to make a quiz for your marketing business <p> This guide will follow an example from Booker.com , a site that does marketing for small brick-and-mortar businesses , and made a great quiz . <h> Part 1 : Creating/Writing the quiz <h> Topics : <p> Picking a topic for your quiz is different than coming up with ideas for blog posts because a quiz can encompass so much more . You can use a quiz to help readers find the perfect blog post to read , learn something about themselves , or answer a question . <p> In general , the best quizzes are introspective and answer important questions . <h> Title : <p> Quiz titles are responsible for drawing in 80% of your audience . Now I know people throw around stats like this all the time , and its hard to believe , but give me a second to explain . A vast majority of quiz traffic ( over 75% ) comes from Facebook and Twitter , and when you share quizzes on those networks the quiz title is pretty much all you see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ( sorry for the Rachael Ray reference in an article about marketing and sales , but let 's not kid ourselves , she is an excellent saleswoman ) . So titles are super important , but how do you come up with one ? The key is to use the quiz logic to your advantage in order to create the most compelling of titles . Only quizzes have the ability to really delved into what your audience is doing and give them a personalized result , and your title should reflect that . <p> Let 's look at the example below from our Booker case study , its titled " What 's Your Holiday Theme ? " and is a quiz to help spa owners decide what way they should decorate their businesses . The quiz title works well because it helps the Booker audience with something that 's important to them ( holidays are a big season for pampering ) , and it also ties into the current season ( holidays ) . <p> If you can get your quiz to answer a real , burning question on your customers minds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a current event or big happening , double points ! ( were not actually keeping score ) <h> Questions : <p> Each question should be its own game , serving as entertainment without any outside help . That way , when you pile a few questions together you get a full interactive and enjoyable experience that delights your readers . To make sure his happens , do these things . <p> Make it fun : A great quiz question is one you want to answer just because its enjoyable . The example below is a great example of this . All it says is " Which Photo do you like best ? " and then goes on two show some fun and goofy pictures . The great thing about quizzes is that you can use the correlations within the personality scoring system to make this a question that legitimately leads to different results . <p> Speak to a person : One thing that a lot of people forget when writing quizzes is that they are n't  talking to an audience . Only one person will take your quiz at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public address . I always tell people to think of one person who they know would really like their quiz and speak directly to that person . Writing like this will set the tone for your entire quiz and ensure the questions are on point . <p> Get personal : - Continuing off the last point about speaking to a person , do n't  be afraid to ask personal questions in your quiz . People like talking about themselves ( 60% of what you 'll say your entire life is about yourself ) , and quizzes that ask personal questions do very well . <h> Lead generation : <p> If you skipped to this part because your boss wont stop telling you to " Get more ROI from content , " then I have good news for you . Quizzes can achieve 50% opt-in rates , but that 's only if you do it right . Let 's look at the example from Booker and go over best practices for a lead generation form on your quiz . <p> The call to action on this quiz is two-fold . First , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is great because it ties into the quiz content that surrounds it . Second , you 'll get to see your quiz results , which works well because you 've already invested time into taking the quiz and do n't  want to walk away empty handed . <p> Now the original reason why quiz calls-to-action work so well is because quizzes are a form of gated content ( where there is an opt-in " gate " before the quiz results ) . However , that alone wont get you an amazing conversion rate , you should also sweeten the pot with a freebie offer that is correlated to the topic of your quiz . <h> Results : <p> This result is the reason someone clicked on your quiz , answered all of your questions , and maybe even put in their contact information but no pressure . <p> Actually , writing quiz results is pretty simple , you just have to be a nicer version of yourself ( not that you 're not already a nice person ) . Quiz results should be very positive , and we have data showing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post a negative result on Facebook , would you ? ) <p> To stay positive , pick out one or two things that are genuinely good about each quiz result and focus on them , avoid anything that might be negative . This way you can remain honest and also feed peoples desire for affirmation ( we all have it , do n't  lie to yourself ) . <p> The other thing to remember with quiz results is to include a link for more information . Once you show someone a quiz result , they are very curious about what it all means , and would actually welcome a link to click on , do n't  miss that opportunity to continue engaging with potential customers ! <h> Part 2 : Sharing/promoting the quiz <p> So I 'm just going to drop this here and leave it for you . We have a separate guide that runs through all the ways to share a quiz on various social networks as well as embed it on your site , but the important thing to remember is this diagram below . <p> setting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " closed loop " sharing system which is extremely important with so much quiz traffic coming form social networks .

@@22713708 @2713708/ <h> The Complete Guide to Lead Generation Using Quizzes <p> Quizzes have been dubbed " a ridiculously effective lead generation strategy " ConversionXL- I can personally attest to the power that a quiz has for generating new sales prospects . The best way to explain this power is to understand that quizzes have amazing sharing power and they have a built-in mechanism for enticing prospects to opt-in . <p> Let 's break down those massive assertions real quick before we go over how to actually create a lead gen quiz . Okay first , the part about getting shared a lot . Quizzes were 8 of the top 10 posts for last year , and in our own studies we 've found that people like to share quizzes because they are so much more personal than other forms of online content . <p> Second , the part about getting people to opt-in . Quizzes present their lead gen form between the quiz questions and quiz results . Doing it this way gets you two advantages . First , you can make the call to action relevant to the quiz ( I.E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) second , the person wants to see which result they got , and even though Interact defaults to having a skip option , opt-in rates still top 50% on average . <p> Those are the reasons . I wish I could tell you with 100% certainty that if you make a quiz and follow the guidelines below that your quiz will go viral and also bring in a bunch of new leads , but I 've realized that there is still a wildcard factor to quizzes , sometimes they just take off for no reason I can foresee . However , what I can guarantee is that if you follow this formula your quiz will be a success , meaning it will be shared and bring in new leads at a higher-than-average pace for your content . This is what I call the " non-viral quiz formula that sometimes goes viral but always performs " <h> Step 1 : Make your quiz <p> Pick a good topic <p> When your quiz gets shared on Facebook , the main thing that shows up is the title . Nearly 80% of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the quiz ( that 's quite logical ) . Because quizzes are all so similar , there are a few " title templates " that just work well all the time . <p> For Personality Quizzes <p> Which ( blank ) are you ? " Which Friends Character are You ? " this type of quiz appeals to our desire to learn more about ourselves , and is based off the original quiz , The Myers Briggs personality quiz . To be quite real with you , 75% of quiz traffic goes to quizzes with this type of title , its by far the most appealing . <p> What type of ( blank ) are you ? : " What type of traveler are you ? " this is really quite similar to the which ( blank ) title , but is a bit more targeted . For example , the traveler quiz limits you to types of travelers rather than being a quiz that discriminates between travelers , adventurers , and backpackers , something like that . <p> For Assessments <p> How much do you know about ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes it works best to do a quiz where correct answers exist . For example , if you are a magazine about cars and you know your readers have a strong interest in automobile history you could do a test on that . People feel compelled to share their results ( especially when they do well on the quiz ) <p> Can you pass the ( blank ) test ? " Can you pass the networking knowledge test ? " Another strong case for quizzes is in the assessment area . You can do a quiz like this and give people a certificate if they pass , leading to more people sharing and amplifying the reach of your quiz . <p> Personality types <p> For my example lead generation quiz I 'm going to do a personality type quiz titled " What 's your party personality ? " ( shout-out to Evite for the idea ) . Ill walk through the pieces and best practices for making a personality quiz if you are n't  interested than skip to the bottom for just the lead gen part . <p> So here 's the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . Be kind <p> No one wants to share a negative statement about themselves . In fact , we ran a study and found that nearly 2.3 's of tweets originating from quiz results contained some sort of positive trigger word like " great " " excellent " or " awesome . " The key here is to make your positive statement convincing , which can be done by telling the truth . For example , my " crazy guy " quiz result says " parties literally do n't  start until you walk in " which is a compliment , but also true of someone who is known as " the crazy guy . " <p> 2 . Have fun <p> Remember that a quiz is mostly for fun . We follow the Shaq Rule for quizzes , which says that you should make your content 80% to entertain , 15% to educate and 5% to sell . Since we are pretty much using up our selling portion by collecting leads , your quiz should be all fun . <p> 3 . Include a follow-up <p> Quiz results are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " socialite " result if you get " crazy guy " as your result . That means you have an opportunity to speak to people in a much more targeted way , and part of that is providing follow-up opportunities . This can mean you include a link to a guide explaining the personality type further or a link to get a discount on products or really anything that is exclusive to that particular personality type . <p> 4. 3-5 sentences <p> You want your results to have a decent description , but you do n't  want to go on and on . A typical viral quiz made on Interact has one paragraph results , about 3-5 sentences . <p> Questions <p> This is by far my favorite part of a quiz . In the questions you get to have a conversation ( albeit scripted ) with your web visitors . This gives your quiz a massive advantage over the competition , and this part of your quiz should be taken very seriously to maximize success . <p> Heres what to do . <p> 1 . Pictures <p> The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from thinking about quizzes they had to take in school . That means having goofy pictures . We found that all 100 of the top 100 Interact quizzes had at least one image question in them . When adding images , make sure they are high enough quality or you risk losing some of your quiz takers trust , and in turn they wo n't want to provide their lead information later on . <p> 2 . Conversational <p> Remember that you are only ever talking to one person at a time in your quiz . You can make your tone personal without worry . In fact , one of our customers from Ireland said they only ask questions that would be okay to ask of a friend in a pub we named that the Pub Rule , everyone should follow it . <p> 3. 6-10 questions <p> This many questions will take about two minutes to answer , that 's the right amount to not bore people . <p> Lead generation form <p> This is the part we 've all been waiting for , so how does the whole lead generation thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your quiz and the results ( after you answered the questions , before you see your results ) , you can ask for information from the quiz taker . Here are the options . <p> -Name ( first and last ) <p> -Email <p> -Company name <p> -Zip code <p> -Phone number <p> -Also include your own privacy policy link . <p> I 've included a screenshot of the setup process here , and I want to focus on the " email heading " and " email subheading " pieces . This is the message that people will see when the lead generation form is presented , and is your call to action , below the image are some tips on how to write the CTA . <p> 1 . Your logo <p> Before you start writing , make sure your logo is uploaded to the quiz . This reassures people of who they are dealing with and gives a visual representation of your company . Make sure its large enough , the Interact size is 250x150px . <p> 2 . Honesty <p> The biggest thing when asking for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with it . In my example I want to send personalized party recommendations by email . I could even improve my text by saying how often I 'm going to be sending emails , the more transparent you can be here the better . <p> 3 . An offer <p> Do n't  just ask for information with no reasoning behind it . Of course the concept is that you are withholding the quiz results , but there should be an added element to your ask . This element should be directly related to the quiz , if you are doing a quiz about various products , you should offer a discount for subscribing , if you are doing a quiz about personalities , offer to send personalized content . <h> Step 2 : Collect leads that you know about <p> Now I have email leads that I can actually use really effectively . I know that Bo Jangles is the " Crazy Guy " party personality and I have his email address to send personalized messages to after the quiz . Ideally what you do is set up different campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin being nurtured along . The leads will be in a nice format for importing to your program . <p> So that 's it , I wo n't spend time talking about what to send your leads once you have them , that 's for another post . Hopefully you now have enough information to get started with your first lead generation quiz ! 
@@22713709 @2713709/ <h> How much value do quizzes actually add to your company ? <p> Quizzes provide value in two ways . The first is by bringing in new sales leads ( you can collect emails , names , phone numbers , etc. using your quiz . ) The second is by selling ads based on the amount of traffic a quiz can bring to your site . <p> I 'm going to go through exactly how two of Interacts customers created strong ROI from running quizzes . <h> 1 . New sales leads <p> Interact quizzes have a built in feature to collect leads and add them to your marketing automation program . One of our customers who has had excellent success using this feature is Skilledup , a content site that does in-depth tutorials . <p> They have a tutorial about Microsoft Excel , and embedded a quiz into it . The screenshot below shows the opt-in screen of the quiz . This screen comes between the questions of the quiz and the results and can be skipped by people taking the quiz . <p> And here 's the quiz as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a guide that was getting strong SEO traffic before the quiz but was n't delivering leads . The quiz was an attempt to spice up the page to increase the amount of time people spent on it but more importantly to get targeted leads ( since Skilledup knows where these leads are coming from , they can send them to a list specifically about Excel ) . - <p> Since embedding the quiz , it has been completed 24,746 times , and 6,413 people have opted in to receive email updates despite the obvious " skip this step " button on the quiz . ( this screenshot comes from an internal Interact database ) <p> Now according to Marketing Sherpa , a new email subscriber can be worth anywhere from $2 to $100 dollars . Since Skilledup is in the digital products space , I would assume its near the low end of that spectrum . <p> Worth of leads collected ( assuming $2 per lead ) : $12,826 <p> Interact cost over 12 months at $350/mo : $4,200 <p> Return on Investment : 305% <h> 2 . Ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a case like a lawyer , which I will do . You see its always a bit difficult to really calculate ROI from what 's known in the advertising world as " pageviews . " That 's why Ive done my best below to equate the traffic that Forbes college quiz gets to actual ad dollars . <p> here we go. - <p> Our test subject is Forbes college quiz . The college quiz got 60,000 hits in the first week . That was in July 2014 . Since then the view count on the quiz has ballooned to 151,000 , or roughly another 3,000 hits each week since then ( its now February 2015 ) . <p> The first step in figuring out how much that traffic is worth is to search the term " college quiz " in the Google Keyword Tool . This gives an idea of what other companies are willing to pay for ads that target the term " college quiz . " <p> So for every person who clicks on a college quiz ad , the approximate revenue created is $1.32 . As you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ads for that very term on their college quiz page . <p> So hypothetically Forbes gets $1.32 for every person who clicks on that ad , and according to SEOchat- the average click through rate is 1.5% across all adsense powered pages . That means for every 1000 visitors to this quiz page , 15 should click on an ad . <p> So now let 's figure out how much money Forbes has made off of this quiz page . The first week they got 60,000 hits , and if we plug that into our calculator , that means they made $169.71 a day , or $1187 for the week . <p> However , things certainly did not end there . The quiz ranks #1 for the term " college quiz " which means its getting consistent traffic , nearly 3,000 new visitors per week . <p> So each week they are bringing in another $254 in ad revenue ( revenue from the additional 3,000 hits ) . Given the search position for the quiz page , - this traffic has been tremendously consistent over the last seven months . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month Forbes needed the $350 a month plan with Interact , and then for the next 7 months theyve needed the $150/mo plan ( based on their traffic stats ) . <p> Total Interact spend by Forbes : $1400 <p> Total Ad revenue from the quiz page : $2965 <p> Return on Investment : 211% <p> I rest my case . <p> Now I realize that this is an approximation , but its certainly possible to make money from running quizzes , and its been done time and time again with Interact .

They are simultaneously extremely popular and primarily only shared on social media .

@@22713715 @2713715/ <h> How to make quizzes that deserve views <p> For the last four weeks , Food52 has been consistently cranking out quizzes that garner 10 's of thousands of views . Each Sunday without fail they release a quiz and within minutes it begins to spread on Facebook and Twitter , continuing to drive traffic right up to the next quiz . It seems they have mastered the art of quiz making , and so we decided to discover just what it is they are doing . <p> Here is how Food52 is creating killer quizzes like clockwork . <p> 1 . They make their quizzes hyper-relevant . Food52 is a foodies paradise , with recipes and pictures galore . The way they are able to manufacture such potent quizzes over and over again is that they are using the best of their existing content . Let me unpackage that a little bit Food52 has thousands of recipes on their site from years of content creation . Each quiz they make helps you find a recipe that is right for you . They create the quizzes by picking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis for the quiz . <p> This is a method of re-purposing great content , which I am a proponent of . Essentially they are re-surfacing great articles from the past by using a quiz to draw attention to them . Food52 knows the recipes were popular in the first place , so they are taking less risk with their quiz knowing that it will be popular . <p> 2 . They create questions you want to answer . Quizzes are 85% - to entertain , 10% to inform , and 5% to sell . Sure , you are directed to check out an article that matches your personality after taking a quiz , but that 's not the only thing Food52 quizzes do . They create fun and thought-provoking questions with their quizzes that you want to answer . They also do a great job of keeping their quizzes short , the longest one theyve got is 10 questions . <p> The best questions are a bit brash and forthcoming . They get the quiz taker thinking and engaged with the quiz , as well as excited to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like your fun friend who 's a bit strange and is constantly asking off-the-wall things . This is called the Pub Rule , named after the Irish Post who said that you should never write anything that would n't be appropriate to say in a pub with your mates . <p> 3 . They craft results that are irresistibly share-able . Its a thing of beauty to look at a stream of tweets from very intelligent hard-working professionals who are excitedly sharing what type of cake they are . <p> Food52 understands that you must create snippets that are entertaining . Social networks are a popularity contest , the number of re-tweets or shares we get on a post can make or break a day . Every Food52 quiz result is designed for maximum likes and re-tweets . <p> While there is still no " viral button " that will magically turn your site into a traffic machine , there are tactics you can use to maximize the - probability of success .

@@22713716 @2713716/ <h> How content should be driving sales <p> This post will be more meta than I would like . It addresses an age-old question of sales-marketing alignment that I do n't  claim to have an answer to . <p> However , at Interact , 75% of our leads come from content marketing , and our sales team handles those leads , closing deals up to five figures annually . We have a rudimentary process for creating content for sales , and while formulating that process I 've learned a few things . Here are the top findings . <h> 1 . Targeting with marketing <p> There 's a myth that I myself have bought into before . The myth is that marketing cant target the customers you want , and the only way to really reach the right people is by cold outreach . While I still think cold outreach is the way to pinpoint people as accurately as possible , I have come to realize that its also possible to target using marketing . This sort of targeting is vital in order to cross the chasm . There are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing . <p> VP Social Media . Metrics are more foggy , but usually revolves around follower counts . <p> VP Lead Generation . If exists , definitely has a quota for SQLs each month . <p> Go where they are . One of the verticals we target at Interact is higher education , and in order to reach more marketers in that space we 've done guest pieces for marketing blogs targeted specifically towards marketers in higher education . The example below has driven three trial signups and one customer with an LTV of $1,500 . That 's a case study , and by no means enough data to guarantee <h> 2 . Qualifying leads <p> Ask for more information . One of the temptations I 've had is to ask for too little information , fearing that potential customers wo n't opt-in because of my forms asking for too much information . While that is true , those " potential " customers who do n't  opt-in because you ask for a company name are almost all junk . It turns out that mid-market and enterprise customers are used to filling out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ask for things like a phone number or company name . Now I 'm not saying to ask for those things just because , if we werent calling our customers I would n't ask for phone numbers , but its also not a bad thing to qualify leads . This also saves salespeople time , and allows them to focus on the good customers . <p> Incentivize good leads . From the marketing side , bonuses are an excellent tool for incentivizing leads that actually lead to revenue . If you can track your contacts with a CRM all the way to money , send kick-backs to the marketers responsible for those leads , and let them know what kind of leads are converting , this leads to a really nice positive feedback loop for the types of new contacts that actually lead to money . <h> 3 . Calling inbound leads <p> Is not cold calling . We make a lot of calls at Interact , but they are never hard sells . The hard sell approach completely does n't  work . <p> Ask questions . Ask prying questions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The easy one to start with is " Why did you sign up for our product ? " Everyone has a reason and that 's a great jumping off point for drilling down to the real problem that your customer is trying to solve . The team at Groove sends an email to every single customer that signs up asking " Why did you sign up ? " This first email gets a 41% response rate- which is pretty insane . The same concept can be applied to calls , an easy ice-breaker question is " Why did you sign up ? " <p> Start on common ground . " What were you thinking of doing with our product ? " this is pretty similar to asking why the person signed up , but without the forward tone . This is another simple way to start a conversation without going for the hard sell . Keep asking " why " until you deduce what 's really leading the person to want to use your product ( its probably to make money or save money ) . <h> 4 . Tracking what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a printout of traffic sources and the trials started from those traffic sources . Some of them are a bit murky ( like SEO ) , but others ( like guest articles ) are fairly easily repeatable , and can be doubled-down on . Tracking everything incentivizes a focus on what 's working and alleviates questions around what the hell marketing is doing . <p> Be open to new opportunities . I 'm guilty of locking in too much on one strategy after it starts to work . There are so many channels for marketing , and new ones like quizzes are constantly coming up . <p> Hopefully that rant helped connect the dots between sales and marketing . Between marketing automation systems , analytics , and common sense , its pretty simple to stitch together that pieces that make up marketing and sales funnels , and once you know what the levers are , its much easier to move them .

@@22713720 @2713720/ <h> How to write quiz questions that make readers want to keep on clicking <p> Quizzes have exploded in popularity recently , they are obscure and goofy , while also providing real advice from time to time . We love them , and I 've watched quizzes get hundreds of thousand of views in mere days . The real " magic " of a quiz comes from its ability to connect with your audience on a personal level . Where most content ( articles , videos , etc ) is one-to-many ( you talking to a crowd ) , quizzes are one-to-one ( you talking to one person ) . <p> This conversation occurs within the questions of your quiz , when you are crafting questions and letting people respond as they choose . The goal here is to build a connection with each person who takes your quiz . Think of it like a small business owner who chats with each customer who comes in to hopefully turn passers-by into long-term paying customers . <p> Your quiz can achieve that same effect , but only if the questions do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quizzes get made using Interact , some themes have stuck out when it comes to writing excellent quiz questions . Here they are . <p> Use your personality . Think of your quiz as a conversation between you and every single person who takes the quiz . You get an opportunity to create a connection with a website visitor through your quiz that 's unlike any other form of content . Let your personality shine , be fun , be goofy , be serious , whatever is natural . Your quiz takers will know if you 're trying to hard to make the quiz feel personal , so go with what 's natural and be yourself . <p> One of the top performing quiz makers using Interact is a food blog called Food52 . They make a new quiz every single week , and they average about 20,000 viewers per quiz . Every single quiz produced by Food52 is inherently human , meaning that you feel like your holding a conversation with someone while you take the quiz . <p> The quiz questions are personal , but the pre-populated answers are also personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question that might be off-putting from a stranger . Food52 understands that people enjoy talking about themselves and provides a platform for that to happen . <p> Follow the pub rule . The Irish Post is a London Newspaper that has become legendary at Interact for creating a quiz that reached a full 25% of the Irish people living in London . They have a rule at the Irish Post , and the rule is that no piece of content can be published until it passes the " pub test " meaning that if you were to read the content in a pub you would n't be booed out . <p> For quizzes , the same rule applies , quiz questions should be conversational , like questions youd ask of a friend in a pub , not scripted questions and responses like you saw in school quizzes . <p> The main thing to keep in mind here is to be a bit brash . At a pub you have a drink and the questions can roll off your tongue . Do n't  be too reserved in your quiz questions or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many questions. - While you need enough questions to make sure your quiz is accurate , keep in mind that most people do n't  have a very long attention span ( two minutes is pretty average for online ) . That means anywhere between 6 and 12 questions is ideal . Any more than that and you 'll lose people who get distracted by cat pictures . <p> Keep every question on-theme. - Great quizzes have a theme . Whether its a superhero quiz or a shark quiz , every single piece of the quiz content revolves around the theme and promotes it . Each question you write should be on the theme and help drive home the theme . For social media quizzes ( where traffic comes from Facebook and Twitter ) , the goal is to get social shares out of your quiz results , and making every question build up to the results by being on theme will help with that . <p> In general , if in doubt gear towards fun .

People keep doing dumb , funny , sad , and happy things around the world and news sites are the first to report on events and keep people informed . One popular form of news story is the News Quiz , where the host site tests its readers on current events or really any subject of interest . <p> At Interact we 've been lucky to have some of the worlds largest news organizations as well as no-name sites create News Quizzes that have gone viral in some sense . Below I 've picked ten of my favorites for your viewing pleasure . ( stay tuned at the end for a guide on how to make your own quiz ) <h> 1 . The Telegraph <p> Social interactions : 255 <p> Pageviews : 12,000 <p> For a site as large as The Telegraph , having the ability to create specific quizzes for different segments is crucial to continuing a dominant position in the news industry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all sorts of purposes . The one below is part of their real estate division , and was highly shared , driving tens of thousands of pageviews from social media back to The Telegraph . <h> 2 . Huffington Post <p> Social interactions : 875 <p> Pageviews : 22,500 <p> The poster child of internet news ingenuity , The Huffington Post does news quizzes very well . This one in particular was published on December 29th 2014 and by January 1st 2015 it has amassed more than 22,000 views . I attribute the success to a well-timed publishing ( end of the year ) and a bit of snarkiness that made it a hit with the social media crowd . <h> 3 . Kut ( NPR ) <p> Social interactions : 1,200 <p> Pageviews : 8,500 <p> I think karma has made NPR our most successful news quiz client . We now work with branches of the site ranging from Seattle to Texas to New York , and each quiz an NPR affiliate makes is better than the last . Their latest rendition is this Beer , Coffee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also relevant to the current news with oil prices catching headlines all over the world . <h> 4 . NPR <p> Social interactions : 525 <p> Pageviews : 8,000 <p> NPR again , this time with a more traditional approach to the news quiz . The Record is a weekly wrap-up of what 's going on around the world , and as part of the segment the Seattle branch of NPR has started creating quizzes to test viewers knowledge . So far they 've had really good success getting the quiz results shared as people compete for prowess in their knowledge of current events . <h> 5 . SCPR <p> Social interactions : 2,200 <p> Pageviews : 19,000 <p> Another public news company absolutely nailing it with quizzes , Southern California Public Radio has begun augmenting their live broadcasts with online quizzes . For example , the quiz below is about pizza , and it went live simultaneously with a one-hour radio segment about pizza . <p> The result was a massive amount of traffic to the website , and if you 'll give me a minute I 'd like to dive into why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is naturally a passive entertainment system , at least since we now have a million other forms of entertainment . So if someone is listening to a radio show about pizza places in LA , odds are they are also doing something else on their phone or computer at the same time . <p> If SCPR wants the full attention of its audience while they listen to the show , it need a supplement , and quizzes turned out to be the perfect solution . <h> 6 . Berim <p> Social interactions : 3,200 <p> Pageviews : 31,000 <p> Iran is in the news a lot , and almost always in a negative light . Berim is an organization that focuses on helping entrepreneurs in Iran . Berim created a quiz to help shift the perception of Iran that 's usually portrayed in the media by making a quiz " How much do you know about Iran ? " <p> It was a hit , quiz takers were often shocked by how little they actually knew and werent afraid to share that surprise on Twitter and Facebook , leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 . Unknown <p> Social interactions : 4,500 <p> Pageviews : 14,000 <p> The ISIS news has now died down a little , but at its peak you could n't even look at a news site without hearing talk of the terrorist group wreaking havoc on the world . Someone who wo n't be named for privacy created the quiz you see below titled " Who Said it : ISIS or Hamas ? " and what happened next was crazy . <p> A flurry of tweets and shares by everyone from David Rubin to the Israeli Embassy of New York took the web by storm as opposing sides battled over the issues at hand . To be honest it got a little scary given the sensitivity of the subject and the people who were getting involved ( a former British army general even chimed in ) . <p> Again this quiz was quite literally created by someone random and it blew up , it does n't  take anything to launch a quiz if you bring up a strong issue . <h> David Rubin <h> 8 . Unknown <p> Social interactions : 1,300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the weirdest phenomenon Ive seen happen with quizzes . There was a trial for the Governor of Virginia over some scandal and a political satire site decided to create a quiz mocking the ridiculousness of it all . Then all of a sudden it got picked up by The Washington Post and a bunch of reporters including Rachel Maddow . The quiz took off and made the host site famous for a day . <h> Rachel Maddow <h> 9 . Portland Monthly <p> Social interactions : 4,200 <p> Pageviews : 34,000 <p> Before it was cool to make news quizzes Portland Monthly was making cool quizzes . They also show us one of the smartest ways for local news sites to utilize quizzes . Being local and somewhat limited in your target audience is an advantage when you know how to use it to your advantage .

The quiz they made was titled " Portland IQ " and was created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm , reaching 34,000 people and remaining one of the most shared posts on PortlandMonthly.com for all of 2014. <h> 10 . LBC <p> Social interactions : 422 <p> Pageviews : 18,000 <p> Another well done year-in-review quiz , Leading Britains Conversation is a fun news site that 's using quizzes as interactive pieces for a variety of concepts on their site . They did one on political candidates and this one to end the year , quizzes can be used all over the place on news site . <h> Now how to make your own news quiz <p> Right , so a lot of these quizzes are basically the same thing just adapted to different stories and angles . That means we are able to put together a nice guide for you to work off of when making your quiz . Let 's dig in. <h> 1 . Decide on a subject <p> The newsduh . But that 's not the only subject for news quizzes ironically . The most popular quizzes are typically one of three types <p> -The wrap-up . Like the Huffington Post year-end quiz above , this type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain amount of time . <p> -The comparison . Like the ISIS or Hamas quiz above . This quiz asks you to choose between two groups . It works well for politics or for foreign affairs that people might not be so familiar with . <p> -Big issue test . Like the Iran quiz above , this type of quiz takes a very controversial or just outright popular issue and asks you to see how much you really know about it . Whether the quiz taker does well or fails theyll have something to talk about . <h> 2 . Write a title <p> When people share their quiz results on Facebook and Twitter , the title is feature prominently and is the primary reason their friends might click on the quiz and take it . Do n't  take the responsibility of writing good quiz titles lightly . here are three titles that consistently perform well for News Quizzes . <p> - " How much do you really know about ? " <p> - " Who said it ? " <p> - " Which character in the news are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a quiz is my favorite part personally . In the minute or two that people are answering your quiz questions , you get a chance to speak personally to each and every person who it taking the quiz , an opportunity that is all to rare in content marketing . There are best practices with quiz questions , check them out . <p> -Images help <p> All 100 of the top 100 Interact quizzes have at least one image question like the one you see below . Images make your quiz more game-like and provide an enjoyable experience for people on your site , it just works . <p> -Talk like a human <p> I did a whole massive article on why this works . The short version is that people can identify with you ( and your quiz ) when it actually sounds like it was written by another human being . Since quizzes are a one-to-one medium instead of a broadcast , talking like you would to another person really makes a difference . <p> 4 . Build results <p> here 's a secret that 's not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traffic is if people share their results . A quiz gets 10x more traffic when it gets picked up and goes viral on social media ( as compared to just being another post on a blog ) . <p> -Compelling title <p> The default setup for social shares coming from quiz results is " I got ( my result title ) ( title of the quiz itself ) " that means your results titles are nearly as important as the title of the quiz itself . There are a few approaches you can take here , ranging from humorous to serious depending on what fits your style best . Whatever you do , stick with it . The Huffington Post example below calls me a " nincompoop " which could be seen as offensive , but its not , because the entire quiz has been fun and lighthearted . <p> -Hero image <p> Or GIF . The image is important to bring home the idea of what your quiz result is . Also , this image will be shared on social media sites when people put their quiz result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> So we tend to share good things about ourselves on social sites why would you tell people about that test you failed or losing your job ? Quiz results with positive tones get shared more in general , but the opposite also works when you make a satirically negative quiz . 
@@22713722 @2713722/ <h> How do quizzes work ? This post explains it all <p> Quizzes can do amazing things . Drive traffic , generate new leads , increase your social presence just to name a few . Here are Interact we get lots of queries from marketers who have heard about these great things but want to know how it all works . Quizzes are not the most simple form of content , they are probably the most complicated to be honest . In this post Il be answering some of the big questions about the basics of quizzes namely how the scoring system works , how you go about embedding quizzes into a website , and how quizzes get shared through social media . <h> Part 1 : How the whole scoring thing works <p> One of the most difficult parts of quizzes is setting up a scoring system that works . Spoiler alert quizzes ( specifically with personality quiz remember when Ellen did n't  get herself on a queen of comedy quiz ? ) Even so , here 's a quick explanation of how the scoring works . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing the different personality types . Once you 've got them created , its time to create the questions . For each question there will be several answers . Each answer will add one point to a different personality type . At the end of the quiz , the personality type that got the most points will get shown . <p> For example . <p> My different results are : <p> -Lion <p> -Tiger <p> -Cheetah <p> Question 1 is : <p> How fast can you run ? <p> A. Basically the same speed as a bullet ( cheetah ) <p> B. Not that fast , but I can still beat you up ( lion ) <p> C. Pretty fast , but I also have the reflexes of a cat ( tiger ) <p> Each question in the rest of the quiz would be set up like question one , and at the end whichever big cat got the most points from answers would get shown as the result . here 's what that will look like when its all said and done . <p> Scored quizzes ( definitive answer ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in school ( but hopefully that are n't  so dang difficult ) . The scoring for these is much simpler . Each question has several answers , and one of those answers is correct . When you are creating the quiz , all you have to do is check the box for whichever answer is right . <p> The results will display a score as well as which answers you got right and wrong ( that parts optional ) Check out an example below . <h> How they get onto your website <p> The next part of quizzes that gets confusing is how you go about embedding them into your site . If you 've worked with wordpress to a large extent or done work with embed codes before , disregard this section if not , welcome . <p> To help paint the picture of what 's happening when you add a quiz to your site , let me explain what 's actually going on . When you embed a quiz on your site , its actually taking a web page that 's hosted on our servers and adding it into the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant take over your site or anything weird like that ) . <p> So what happens is you grab a piece of code that looks like the one below , then copy and paste it into your site as html . In wordpress , you press the " text " button at the top of the post or page builder , and most content management systems will have an option to copy in html . <h> How they get shared on social media <p> Unless you 're not on Facebook ( I applaud your effort if you are n't  ) , you 've seen someone posting quiz results that look like this . <p> These quizzes have officially infested social media , if there existed a task force for social media pandemics , now would be the time to call on them . The " secret " behind why these quiz results get shared so dang much is much simpler than you 'd think . Really there are two reason ; first , each result is specifically about the quiz taker and we like sharing things that are about us , it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets shared , it also encourages other people to go and take the quiz themselves since the quiz title is like a self-contained call to action . <p> Setting this up when you create your quiz is really simple , what ends up getting shared goes like this " I got ( my result ) ( title of the quiz ) " all you have to do is come up with clever ways to name your results . <p> So that 's it , I did my best to answer some questions that I get asked a lot . Hopefully this cleared some things up for you about how quizzes work and you 'll be able to get up and running with your own quizzes soon .

@@22713723 @2713723/ <h> How to make a knowledge test using Interact <p> So a good knowledge test can go viral . If that seems odd , I agree with you . A few days ago , the UK Trade and Investment Group ( UKTI ) created a quiz titled " Think you know what the UK 's famous for exporting ? " that absolutely rocked , sparking all kinds of social conversation and thousands of views in a few hours . We are going to break down what they did and how you can follow in their footsteps , but first , the results : <p> I 've divided the quiz into four parts below , and well go step-by-step to learn how you can replicate the success of the British Government when it comes to making knowledge tests worth sharing . <p> ( yes that 's the real prime minister of the UK , I do n't  know why his twitter handle is @Number10gov ) <p> here 's how it all goes down <h> 1 . Create a hook to get people excited <p> Also known as the cover page of your test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test using Interact . I took a screenshot of the cover below and marked it up with four elements you must get right if you want people to click on your test when it shows up on Twitter or Facebook . <p> 1 . The title is 80% of the battle <p> 80% of people will read a title while scrolling through their Facebook feed , but a much smaller percentage will actually click on a link and read a post ( or take a quiz ) . Weve done some extensive testing on which kinds of titles work for tests , check it out . <p> -The " How much do you really know ? " title : For example " How much do you really know about Alan Jackson ? " is a quiz that got 55,000 hits and performed very well . We 've consistently seen quizzes with this title outperform the average . <p> -The " Think you know ? " title : This one appeals to peoples inner narcissism , where do DO think we know about everything , and you 'll have to prove us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UKTI used , and it worked out pretty well . <p> 2 . A photo will draw people in <p> We have a full list of sizes for all images here , for the best looking quiz , follow those instructions precisely . <p> The photo you see was custom created for this quiz I recommend either getting your graphics department involved or using one of our free stock image sites to find yourself a really nice cover photo . In general cover photos with people tend to attract more clicks , but as UKTI showed us , that 's not always necessary . <p> 3 . The short description is the icing on the cake <p> This area is used to convert people who are on the brink . The approach taken in our example quiz is to reiterate the challenge presented in the title , and that is a generally solid approach to take . I 've seen others go a different route and say something like " Are you as smart as you thought ? " which is a similar type of prodding . Whatever you do here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 2 . Write questions <p> 1 . Pick questions that people actually care about. - <p> This is n't grammar school , no one has to answer your questions if they do n't  want to . On this particular quiz from UKTI , the average quiz taker spent 3:25 taking the quiz ( answering questions ) . That is n't because anyone was forced to take the quiz , but rather because its filled with fascinating questions about the trading habits of the UK . <p> Also , and this is a bit of a rant , please speak plain English when writing quiz questions . No one wants to decipher your smart people talk , and they will leave before really trying to understand a confusing question . <p> 2 . Create amazing graphics <p> Every question on the UKTI quiz were following has a custom graphic to go along with the query . Think about this , if I ask you " How many people live in Iceland ? " just by itself versus if I ask the same question and include a beautiful landscape picture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a study and found that 100 of the top 100 quizzes built with Interact have at least one image question ( yes I said all of them ) . It just makes for a better experience and I think this is one of the big reasons that a knowledge test like the UK Government one can get shared so much . <p> 3 . Keep the answer choices simple <p> This is not the place to use flowery language . People appreciate a simple quiz , use your creative and writing skills on the titles and questions , leave this part in plain english . <h> 3 . Answer those questions <p> 1 . Explain yourself thoroughly <p> We expect instant gratification . Its everywhere in our lives , from social media where we get mad if our friends do n't  instantly " like " our latest post , to tests , where we want to know if we got the answer right without having to wait . That 's why provide the option to show the correct answer immediately after each question of a test . <p> You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question is , whether the person got it right or wrong they will be curious and want to know why they got the answer they did . <h> 4 . Give a satisfying result <p> 1 . Score/title <p> The social share from a quiz result looks like this " I got ( my result ) ( title of the quiz ) " so the result title is nearly as important as the title of the quiz itself . I do n't  have hard data on what to make your quiz titles given the vast variety within them , but I can tell you that its best to be honest but positive with the way you write these . <p> 2 . Another great image <p> See a trend here ? Tests that do well are highly visual and often get the design department involved . I 'm not super excited about the image in the quiz result of the UKTI quiz , but it does the job . Ideally youd have a custom image that has to do with the result remember this image will get shared if someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they got the result <p> I you 're going to give your result a title and not just a score , you should explain why its called what its called . <p> 4 . Include a link to your site <p> I made this its own section because its really important . Oftentimes people will take your quiz on a dedicated page without every visiting your website , so having this connection back to your site is vital to driving traffic from your quiz . If you do n't  do this , people may never really " get " where the quiz came from . You should also personalize the link in each result so they point to different pages on your website that are dedicated to that particular quiz result . <p> 4.5 Let the people share <p> The reason any quiz goes viral is because a bunch of people collectively decide to share it , its that simple . If you do n't  provide them with an option to share , they probably wo n't ( out of sight , out of mind ) . Share buttons for Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot to worry about here , but its still worth mentioning . <p> 5 . Show the answers again <p> Its always good to reiterate the answers in the quiz results . People will spend more time on the page if you show them which ones they got right or wrong again , and this will lead to either more time on your website or a person being more likely to share the quiz . This is a setting within Interact that you just have to turn on . <p> And to wrap it all up , here 's the quiz in its entirety for your enjoyment . 
@@22713725 @2713725/ <h> The Ballerinas Guide to Marketing <p> Ballerinas are n't  known for their strength . They are famous for grace and poise while performing extremely demanding moves , if you do n't  believe me , try pirouetting for an hour and see how tired you get . How is this possible ? ballerinas perform physically demanding routines without falling from grace and make it look easy . The trick is gravity , and physics . Ballerinas use the natural forces to make difficult routines easier . They understand how to utilize existing resources to do difficult dances without working too hard . Marketing should be done the same way there are tricks that can be used , undetected by - your audience to make marketing more effective and drive sales . Here is the short list of secrets . <p> 1 . Use Comparisons : - A man walks into a local suit store and buys a good quality three-piece for $999 . Immediately after making the purchase , the store attendant begins up-selling $100 dollar sweaters and caps . It might seem absurd to try and sell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suit , but the rule of comparison takes effect and the man walks out of the store with a new sweater and top hat in addition to his suit . See after spending nearly a thousand dollars on a suit , a one-hundred dollar sweater seems reasonable . However , if the man were presented with the sweater first it would be comparatively expensive . <p> The most obvious place to use comparisons is on a pricing page . Think of the last time you saw a pricing page with only one paid option . They do n't  usually exist because of the comparison effect . For example , check out the Squarespace pricing page below . They have three options and are obviously pushing the middle one . It seems like a bargain in comparison to the most expensive option but is n't the most basic . <p> 2 . Expensive = Good : - At a rural shop in the Arizona desert , Denice sells authentic Native American merchandise to tourists . There is one item that 's been on the shelf for months and just wo n't sell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells her employee to change the price by 50% just to sell it . The employee ( who must have been in the sun too long ) accidentally increased the price by 50% it nearly immediately sold . Denice could not make heads or tails of this situation , so she tried the same tactic on another product it too sold right away . <p> What Denice is experiencing is the expensive = good phenomena that has been implanted into our consumer mindset . Because more expensive things are usually higher quality or better , we tend to think that all expensive things are better . Obviously this does n't  work all the time , you cant sell a product with a set price for a 100% mark-up and expect results , but in general expensive is equated with quality . <p> 3 . Reciprocation : - In 1938 , the Sudan was in the midst of an economic crisis , people were living on the streets and poverty was at an all-time high . The government was nearly insolvent . They sent $5000 to Mexico . Why would a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country that is okay ? Drugs ? Ransom ? Debt ? No , none of those . You see , in 1935 , three years earlier , Mexico had sent the Sudan aid when the country was being invaded by Italy , and the the Sudan was returning the favor . <p> This story might seem ridiculous , but it exemplifies the power of reciprocity . You do something for me and I feel extremely obligated to do something for you . For online companies , giving away free products and information in exchange for contact information or permission to follow-up is a very powerful way to generate leads . <p> 4 . Social Proof : - In a random and very unscientific survey , a janitor , two teachers , and a student were asked what they thought of the fake laugh tracks that often accompany TV shows . They all expressed disdain for the fake laughing and said they would prefer it werent there so why is it there ? The answer is social proof . If people are laughing ( even if they are fake ) then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one wants to be the first customer . People want to know their friends and authority figures have already used and tested out a new product or service before jumping in themselves .

@@22713726 @2713726/ <h> How to make Facebook Quiz that drives massive traffic <p> On February 15th , 2014 Portland Monthly Magazine released a quiz titled " What 's Your Portland IQ ? " within seven days the quiz had been shared more than 2500 times and had accumulated 10,000 views . The best part is that the quiz was created by an intern who was assigned to do " something fun " and came up with the quiz . It was the top article on the site for a month running . <p> Portland Monthly is n't the only publication to benefit from the viral success of online quizzes . In fact , eight of the top ten articles for 2013 were some form of a quiz . The lions share of quiz traffic comes through social , with Facebook clearly leading the way . That 's why its very important to create quizzes optimized for Facebook here 's how to accomplish that . <p> Step 1 : Create memorable quiz titles . <p> Present a challenge . " How Much do You Actually Know about the World Cup ? " In reality this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " actually " it seems like much more than that . <p> Compare to someone famous . " Which Celebrity Would be Your Best Friend ? " This is just a personality quiz , but by adding a layer of pop culture , it becomes relatable and intriguing . <p> Make it personal . " What 's Your Content Marketing IQ ? " <p> Step 2 : Write quiz questions that are worth answering . <p> Spur some thought . Do n't  be afraid to ask some deep questions on a goofy quiz . By injecting some real thought-provoking questions you 'll get the readers mind focused on your quiz . <p> Keep it short . Do n't  have more than 15 questions . 15 questions take about two minutes to answer , which is the upper limit of your readers attention span . <p> Get a personality involved . In the way your questions are worded . A little snarkiness never hurt anyone . Your quiz will be much more memorable if its written in a way that 's enjoyable to read . <p> Step 3 : Make quiz results that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to share things that make them look good , this dates back to the narcissist in all of us . Feed into our natural desire to be the envy of all our friends by telling people they are awesome in your quiz results . <p> Do n't  be fake . This might seem hypocritical after my last point , but you must base your quiz results off of something real to avoid people becoming dis-enthralled by your quiz results . The example below is a great example , the quiz is literally telling people that they are a truck , but it somehow rebounds and turns that into a positive thing . <p> Prepare to be shared . When people share your quiz , it will look something like this . " I got ( my result ) ( name of the quiz ) " make sure your quiz results fit well into this model so that when others share your quiz they will drive even more traffic back to your site . <p> Step 4 : Share and embed on Facebook . <p> Tabs . Quizzes can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into full detail on here . As you can see in the example below from UC Davis , doing it this way keeps people on your Facebook page to take the quiz so you do n't  lose control of them on another page . <p> In the newsfeed . You can also share your quiz in the newsfeed , this option works best if you plan on running multiple quizzes or do n't  want the same one to stick around permanently . 
@@22713727 @2713727/ <h> 5 things to do with the results of your quiz <p> When a user reaches your quiz results , you have their full attention in a way that is nearly unparalleled in content marketing . People are extremely curious about their quiz results because they are based off of personal information and the quiz result affects the ego of the person taking the quiz . <p> That means quiz takers are in a perfect position to continue interacting with your brand after seeing their results . Its your responsibility to provide an easy and attractive further interaction so that people will continue looking into your product or service . <p> 1 . Promote an app . <p> Apps , whether on the web or for mobile , need a bit of a push before they take off ( unless you get quite lucky ) . You can harness the entertainment power of a quiz to help get your app the exposure it needs to really get noticed . <p> We recently worked with the Red Cross to create a quiz " Do you actually know how to swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result provides suggestions based on how much you know about swimming safety along with a link to download the Red Cross Swim App , which turns learning how to swim into a game . <p> 2 . Offer up more content . <p> Personalized content recommendations receive 300% more click-through over non-personalized . A quiz is the perfect filter to give each person a follow-up piece of content that applies directly to them . <p> We worked with Forbes to create a top colleges quiz , and they provide a link to check out college recommendations based on the type of college that fits you best . The quiz they made works in tandem with their top college adviser , and they included a link in each different result that includes a search term based on the type of person you are . <p> This was a simple way to provide a personal experience to each person who takes the quiz without expensive software . <p> 3 . Show a video . <p> Videos and quizzes run in the same vein . They are both designed primarily to entertain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the conversation going . <p> Check out this example quiz titled " Which American City Should you Live In ? " where we embedded a video into each city result that talks about the city and what kinds of activities go on their . <p> 4 . Offer a personalized product. - <p> Quizzes are a perfect way to provide a personalized product recommendation for each and every person who comes to your site . Instead of spending years developing a site that offers up personalized products , just make a quiz . <p> We worked with Hookah e-tailer Hookah and Shisha to create a quiz " What kind of Hookah are you ? " that provides a Hookah recommendation based on your personality type . Each quiz taker is provided with an image and explanation of which kind of Hookah is best for them along with a link to go and purchase that product online . <p> 5 . Build a full landing page . <p> The results builder is pretty robust , in that you can essentially build a full personalized landing page for each result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mystery Tackle Box did with their quiz , using each result as its own page that explains the product and offers up a link to purchase it . <p> You can create a page with images , styles , links , and discount codes so the experience is just like you 'd offer up on your website.

At the time everyone thought they were crazy and even Universal struggled to fill in all those hours of the day . Little did they know that in the next century 24-hour news stations would spring up all over the country covering everything from local heroes to global catastrophes . As the world of content evolves , news stations are also transitioning into new-age producers of all things breaking . One trend in particular is the rise of the quiz . In 2013 , 8 of the top 10 news pieces were some form of a quiz , and quiz traffic has the ability to eclipse articles because of their share-able nature . As a news site it can be difficult to come up with good topics for your quizzes , so here is some help from our customers . <p> 1 . Where in Faquier County do you belong ? From local news site Faquier now , a small company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It s a simple questionnaire but it got people talking . Facebook commments ranged from " I cant afford to live in North County " to " The quiz got southern Faquier , that 's where I live ! " It was an absolute joy to watch the comments roll in as community members from the county gathered around the proverbial water cooler that is Facebook to weigh in on their result ( which was the part of the county they should be living in ) <p> In a county with population of just 60,000 , 3000 took the quiz on the first day it was live . It was a smash hit and the top article for the news site two weeks running . <p> 2 . Test your Portland IQ . From Portland Monthly Magazine this quiz tests visitors on their Portland Prowess .

Which Iris Tribe Living in London are You ? By the Irish Post , this quiz is much more unique . It applies specifically to Irish people living in London ( of which there are just over 100,000 ) . There are different groups of Irish people living in the grand city , and the quiz helps determine which one you are .

As technology evolves within content marketing , its important to stay up to date so you do n't  lose eyeballs . That 's where these quiz ideas come in handy . 
@@22713729 @2713729/ <h> 5 Rings to Rule Content Marketing <p> Content is extremely potent when used to drive people from interested party to sold on your solution . The difficulty for many of us when creating content is how to organize all the great works produced into a manageable format for driving sales . ( Which is the holy grail of marketing at the end of the day ) The web design book Convert has put together an amazing five-step program for content that I 've summarized below . <p> Step 1 : Talk to those who have a problem : - These are prospects who have the problem your product provides a solution to . They are searching for solutions , but have n't yet identified the one theyd like to use . At this point the best thing to do is be genuine and helpful . For example , if I wanted to reach people searching for hair loss treatments , I would write articles such as " Steps to Regain Hair " or " Hair Thinning , what 's Causing It " <p> Step 2 : Introduce your brand as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solution and are actively searching for a brand to fill the void . Possible content ideas in this step include " My Product Vs . Theirs , How They Stack Up " or " The Top 5 Solutions for Hair Loss " Its difficult to write articles like these and stay impartial ( after all , - your solution IS the best ) , but honesty and transparency are key . Do n't  lie about what your product can offer . <p> Step 3 : Present the Specific Benefits of Your Offering to People Who Are Interested : - This is where ( subtle ) bragging comes into play . A case study of a Fortune 500 company using your product or some user testimonials compiled into a post will do very nicely . This is where a lot of the " selling " of your brand happens . <p> Step 4 : Your Brand is at the top of the list , now what ? - Drive home the benefits . Sometimes this will mean a savings calculator like this- or an emotional appeal like this- - this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tipping point . <p> Step 5 : Let 's Make the Deal ! - The sales page , not traditionally considered a content page , but it should be . Signup pages need tools of content to be great , social affirmation , customer logos , and comparisons all do nicely . This is a a great signup page that uses embedded tweets , and FAQs to reaffirm customers who are on the brink of signing up . <h> What to watch for : <p> 1 . Bulge : - If one ring is a backstop that is n't effectively leading prospects through to the next step , there is a problem . <p> 2 . Proportion : The larger the ring , the more content that 's needed for the step . It would be weird to have 25 sales pages and only 10 articles talking about the problems your product solves . 
@@22713731 @2713731/ <p> When the web was created it was anonymous and fun , but as we begin to spend more and more time online , anonymity no longer has the same appeal . We want to feel like websites we visit are more than just content placed out there for the whole world . <p> Quizzes can be a part of that personalization . Using the logic of - a personality quiz , content producers can provide links to articles and content that are built specifically for each person who visits the website . <p> Instead of continuing to stumble over words trying to explain this , let 's look at a few examples where this was done well . <h> 1 . Forbes . <p> Forbes used a quiz to personalize their college advisor tool . The quiz was titled " find your perfect match " and helped prospectives students get a better idea of what kind of college they should attend . At the end of the quiz , people would be given one of several results , which were things like " small , rural , northeast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a link to check out the college advisor tool , and that link was pre-set to sort the college advisor tool based on the quiz result , genius ! <h> 2 . The American Red Cross <p> " Do you actually know how to swim ? " is quite the question to ask , but its also an important one and The Red Cross decided it should be asked . Their quiz asks a series of questions before giving people their outcome , along with a personalized link to learn more , sign up for lessons , and download the Red Cross Swim App . <p> Each quiz result is unique to the quiz taker who receives it , and points to a page on the Red Cross website to learn more . Let 's get technical for a second and talk marketing automation . Now each link in these Red Cross quiz results is unique , so if you have a cookie on your visitors from previous encounters , you can add a parameter for those unique pages , which will only be visited if they come through the quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great way to effectively divide people into groups based on what kind of help they should really be getting when it comes to swimming . <h> 3 . Amnesty International <p> How does an organization as big as Amnesty International personalize world issues ? With a quiz of course ! Their awesome quiz uses a personality type template to provide people with the social justice advocate they are most like , the site has a lot of content about these advocates and the quiz helps narrow all those articles and videos ( which are excellent ) , into something more personal .

If you just talk about the products all the time , that 's super boring , but if you do n't  , then your content wont deliver the results that it should . One solution that bridges the gap meaning that it is good content but also talks about the products , is an Ecommerce quiz . Check out these four companies that used quizzes effectively on their sites . <p> 1 . Which Hookah are You ? From Hookah and Shisha . This massive online store is the Amazon of Hookah , they have hundreds of different products . I 'll admit I do n't  know much about Hookah , but their quiz is pretty convincing .

A good question that a lot of people want the answer to . Using quasi-scientific methods , Beskincare created a quiz to find out what skin type you are . Its simple enough , with ten questions that ask about your habits and condition , resulting in your skin type answer . <p> How it generates sales : At the end of the quiz , each quiz taker is presented with a skin type and a matching product recommendation that can help with their condition . For dry skin there is a moisturizing blend , for oily skin , a drying blend . These product links go to pages where the personalized product recommendation can be purchased . <p> 3 .

For a lot of brands this is not the case . Either they do n't  have a loyal social following , or Facebooks algorithmic changes are limiting the natural reach of their posts limiting how much of the audience actually see each update . <p> Big brands , just like small brands , have to work hard if they want to stand out on Facebook , and more often than not it comes down to one person ( or small group ) to create content that will go viral . If that person is you , then welcome , I 'm glad you 're here , let 's get right down to it and look at how great brands use quizzes to rule Facebook. <h> 1 . The Red Lobster Endless Shrimp Quiz <h> Facebook Shares : 8836 <p> You know the difference between getting a personal invite to a party rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand you know someone personally wants you at an event whereas on the other there could be hundreds or thousands of others who got invited , much less appealing . <p> When The Red Lobster created their endless shrimp quiz " What Type of Red Lobster Endless Shrimp Are You ? " it effectively turned the general Facebook invite of the endless shrimp promotion into a personal invite for everyone who took the quiz . Now I know that sounds weird , but let 's take a look ( and see what the heck any of this has to do with getting shared a lot ) . <p> The quiz starts life as another Facebook esque quiz that is meant to draw people in ( which it turns out quizzes are quite good at ) Its an enticing quiz title that you cant resist if you are a fan of The Red Lobster or Shrimp ( or both ) , and its certainly worth a click . <p> Where it gets interesting though is in the results of the quiz . In my example I got Garlic Shrimp Scampi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got that result , and its a doozy . I get all warm inside as the description of what kind of shrimp I am flatters me ( and because I 'm thinking about eating the shrimp ) . <p> More importantly though is the fact that I now have a personal reason to go to Red Lobster . When I sit down at the restaurant , I 'm going to know exactly what kind of shrimp I want and I 'm going to be thinking about the shrimp the next time the inevitable " What do you want to eat ? " conversation happens . <p> So there 's two things that make this quiz share-able . First , it makes you look good , and since social networks are basically canvasses for painting an optimal picture of our lives , flattery works well . Second , its personal , and it gives you a real-ish connection to the brand . <p> The campaign worked extremely well , nearly 200,000 people have " liked " the quiz to date , and it continues to build brand awareness for The Red Lobster even after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Type Quiz <h> Facebook Shares : 3236 <p> If you 're not sure what HostelWorld is , that 's okay ( Guessing you 're over 30 ? ) If you are looking to stay in a Hostel and need to book online , HostelWorld is the first choice for literally anywhere in the world . I know this because I was looking up a hostel in a remote part of El Salvador ( like really remote ) , and HostelWorld totally hooked it up . ( check out the picture of the spot ) <p> HostelWorld had a similar social media conundrum to The Red Lobster , in that they have these super cool awesome spots all over the world , but any given person might not care that much about an amazing spot in the middle of nowhere in El Salvador , so what do they post on Facebook ? Their answer ( which worked really well ) was a quiz titled " What Type of Traveller are you Actually ? " <p> The quiz itself is probably the most game-like experience Ive encountered in a travel quiz to date . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they do a great job of making those pictures hilarious . This is vital to their quiz because travel is a very socially driven experience , and every single question of this quiz has to compete with a news feed filled with baby pictures . Hostelworld nailed it , and over 90% of people who started this quiz finished it . <p> If you thought the results would be a let-down after all those great questions , think again . The title of my result is " The YOLO Fiend " while I both identify with that result and think its awesome , its also something worth sharing . <p> Its as if I just clicked on ten pictures and am now being celebrated for my choices ( you cant see it , but the minions are jumping ) . This sort of over enthusiasm is what led to the HostelWorld quiz getting shared so much in the first place . <h> 3 . NPR Accent Quiz <h> Facebook Shares : 2302 <p> This quiz changed my perception of NPR . As a young person in college my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the most mundane topics we could think of , like how the street looked today , going on for several minutes with painful detail . <p> This is no longer how I treat NPR thanks to this quiz , theyve effectively proven they can be fun . <p> Accent quizzes have been popular forever , but were recently re-energized by the New York Times dialect quiz that was their top post of 2013 . The draw of the New York Times quiz and this NPR quiz is that they divide people into groups they identify strongly with ( how much of an accent you have ) . One group is " in " and the other is " out " and both sides feel they need to defend their position on social media , which results in a win for NPR . <p> While the subject of this quiz is awesome , we 've gotten to the point where simply making a quiz with a catchy title wont cut it ( because there are so many quizzes ) . That 's why NPR backs up their catchy title with excellent questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The point is to make your quizzes like a game , it shouldnt feel like you have to fill out a questionnaire to get your results , each and every question should have its own interactivity and personality to it . <p> Now I finished the quiz and get my results . This is where Im supposed to share the quiz and get my friends to come take the quiz . Results pages like the one pictured below led to thousands of people sharing , so let 's try to figure out why . <p> First , there are very distinct levels in the quiz . This reaffirms the previous notion that the quiz would divide people into groups who can identify with their quiz result . By sharing the results , you are either identifying with Northwesterners or identifying as not a Northwesterner . People get very territorial and this spurred on the sharing . <p> Second , its humorous . Again , props to NPR for injecting fun and a bit of snarkiness into their content . I mean , I got " Level 2 : Bertha " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my result , that 's some solid situational humor . <p> The key to nailing a Facebook quiz is not to have a massive existing audience or pay to promote the piece all over the place rather , some well put together interaction within the quiz and a touch of flattery in the results will achieve you some excellent share-ability . I hope these tips have helped clarify the quiz creation process , all of the examples above come from Interact , you can head over there to create a quiz and get your own massive Facebook sharing .

One of the ways we do this is by getting our brand out of the way so that you can keep all of your marketing unified under your style and your logo . <p> Every single Interact pro account has the ability to add their own logo to a quiz rather than have the Interact logo . ( you can also upload a blank logo if you prefer a completely clean look ) <p> In addition to just adding your logo , you can also change all the colors of your quiz including the background color , call to action button , and font color . Using this set of design elements in tandem , its possible to match the style of virtually any website or blog . <p> When it comes to sharing your quiz out and making sure you do n't  lose prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the best experience and interaction with your brand that 's possible . <p> If you share a quiz on social media ( Facebook , twitter , G+ , etc ) using a direct link , or from the results of your quiz , it will share a page that looks like this . <p> Notice the distinct lack of related quizzes or other content around the quiz . By default , on all Interact pro plans the share links will go to dedicated pages like these where there 's a quiz and nothing more shown . That way you do n't  risk losing customers who begin taking other quizzes or going to interact . <p> If you choose to embed your quiz in a web page like this one , you can send social traffic back to the blog post . <p> In your interact dashboard , under " edit quiz " you can change the link that social shares point to . Just type in the URL of your blog post where the quiz is hosted and the link will point back to your domain . <p> This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your prospective customers because they are now on your domain and can click on your related articles or sign up/purchase.

At Interact we 've done our absolute best to listen to our large clients , including The American Red Cross , Forbes , and CBS to build the absolute greatest enterprise quiz tool on the market . In this guide I 'll walk you through the elements that set apart our Enterprise quiz builder from the average quiz tool and then give some specific examples of how large companies have been utilizing quizzes with success . <h> Top 5 benefits of Interact Enterprise <p> 1 . Custom branding <p> This is by far the strongest benefit of the Interact quiz builder over most other options . With Interact , you can upload your own logo and put it on each quiz . There is also no " powered by " link on Enterprise quizzes , so it becomes fully white label . Brand continuity is important , especially with content that gets a lot of social traffic ( like quizzes ) . Your quizzes might be the very first interaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control over your branding makes a world of difference . <p> 2 . Full design control <p> Virtually every element of an Interact quiz is editable in our Enterprise edition . Starting with the cover photo and background color , all the way through the font style and call to action text , it can all be changed to match your brand style . Again , as you work to maintain your brand continuity , we do n't  want to get in the way of that and offer full control to you . <p> What this allows you to do is get the creative department involved without asking too much of them and slowing things down . They do n't  need to write any CSS or other code and can use the click and select options in the quiz builder to completely customize the design . <p> 3 . Ability to embed quiz and keep social traffic <p> When you make a quiz and embed it in your website ( using a one-line javascript embed ) , you keep all the traffic , even when the quiz gets shared on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works . What happens is that you control the links in the social share text of your quiz and can point those links to a blog post or web page where your quiz is embedded . That way you " close the loop " and avoid leaking traffic . <p> 4 .

When you hear the word " quiz " its probably associated with school and the tests you had to take there . Now universities are re-approaching quizzes from a different angle a fun one . More than 100 universities around the world use Interact to create fun quizzes as a marketing tool to reach new students . Today I 've selected three of the best to pick apart and discover what they did right and wrong . <h> 1 . UCLA <p> UCLA has won a lot of championships , its a school that prides itself on athletic and academic prowess ( I know , I went there ) . With over 107 championships to choose from , their national championship trivia quiz is a perfect place to start when drumming up interest in the school . For perspective students , learning about the rich athletic history of the university is an excellent way to market the school itself . <p> The quiz content itself is simple and thought-provoking . The school did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many ) , considering that there 's a lot they could ask about . Overall the questions fun , and this quiz had a 95% completion rate . <p> Where I think UCLA could really improve is in the quiz results . While they do provide a simple result , which can be very effective for driving social shares , I think they could have included a call to action and image to really complete the results and make them stick . For example , if someone does poorly on the quiz , UCLA could include a link to read more about athletics at the University which could be the first domino in a chain of events that leads to the prospective student applying . <p> Overall I would grade UCLA at a B- . Their quiz is solid and ended up being taken thousands of times , but with a little more planning in the results it could have been something truly great ( just like the school ) . <h> 2 . University of Illinois <p> An awesome professor at the University of Illinois who has a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my professors ? ) made a great quiz full of Gifs and funny images to help students understand where they are in terms of public speaking ability . Getting up in front of crowds is one of the most under-taught but over-important pieces of an education , props to U of I for making this quiz . <p> The quiz questions are excellent full of fun and relevant photos . However , on some of the questions there 's a bit too much going on . When you have nine different gifs moving all at once , it creates some sensory overload that can be annoying and distracting . Also , having that many images can take longer to load and slow people down who are accessing from mobile phones or slow internet connections . I 'm being picky though , Illinois did a great job of making a sensitive subject like public speaking fun and visual with their questions . <p> As with the quiz questions , Illinois really nailed with with highly visual results . They also are upbeat with their copy . A couple of things they could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just being super positive with the quiz results and providing a link to learn more about public speaking . Both UCLA and Illinois are missing out on opportunities to follow up with eager and interested prospects by not including links to learn more in their quiz results . <p> Overall , I give the Illinois quiz an A- its pretty close to being excellent but is missing a few key features like a link to learn more . Also , it goes a bit too far with Gifs which slows it down on older devices . The positives are great though , very visual and fun quiz . <h> 3 . Hillsdale University <p> Remember when you learned the Bill of Rights in school ? The document is fairly integral to our nation ( sarcastic ) , and its contents are discussed in politics all the time , yet do you really know what it says ? That 's what this quiz aims to find out . From private Hillsdale college , the quiz tests your prowess as an American politics buff and provides immediate feedback on how you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we took the quiz here at the office , there was some heated debate as to which answers were correct . That 's a good sign Hillsdale created engaging content , but I do wish they would have thrown some images in here and there . All ten questions on the quiz are pure text , which got a bit bland by the end . <p> I really enjoyed the Hillsdale quiz results . Props to them for having a sense of humor in the midst of an otherwise boring subject . When my result told me Im probably not a citizen I let out an audible chuckle . They were also smart to include the correct answers ( an automatic feature within Interact ) . Only thing I wish theyd done is include a link to the actual bill of rights or at least an article talking about the document . <p> Overall I 'd give the Hillsdale quiz a B+ its a great effort , and our team definitely got hooked on taking it , but it lacks the visual prowess to be an excellent quiz . <p> Quizzes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the ones that are being given in classes . These quizzes are fun and you want to take them rather than being forced to take them . Hopefully the examples above can help you create an awesome quiz for your university , 
@@22713741 @2713741/ <h> The Blueprint for a perfect quiz <p> The top 10% of quizzes created using Interact get 90% of the traffic . These pieces of perfection are receiving hundreds of thousands of views and blowing up servers . This naturally leads us to wonder what it is about those quizzes that caused them to have so much success . <p> We got out our statistics hat and ran some numbers to try and discover what exactly was causing these quizzes to go viral . Here are the secrets to creating the perfect quiz . <h> Part 1 : Design <p> Quizzes are highly visual . They have images as questions , images as answers , colored background , and logos on printed in the corners . All of this can be a lot to take in and its easy to over-design your quiz to the point where its just too busy . To help alleviate much of the difficulty , we created a nice infographic to show the important elements of a quiz and how to craft yours just like it . <h> Part 2 : Content <p> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with content that people will actually care about . Let 's break down the different elements of quiz and go over the best practices that have lead to some quizzes doing very well . <p> 1 . Quiz titles- <p> Titles are extremely important for quizzes because most quiz traffic comes through social shares , and on a social share you really only see the title of a quiz and an image before deciding if you want to take the quiz or not . <p> After analyzing all the top quizzes , here are a free title templates we found to work very well . <p> The " Which ( blank ) are you ? " title : " Which famous author are you ? " This is probably the most versatile of all title templates because it can be used for virtually anything , all the way from " Which mascot are you ? " to " Which kind of hot dog are you ? . " <p> To use this title , just think of several people or products youd like to use as the " personalities " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of those personalities based on the way in which they answer the questions . <p> The " Actually " title : " How much do you actually know about donuts ? " This title begins life as a simple knowledge test , but then you add the word " actually " and it becomes something much more . I 'm kind of joking but kind of not , while adding one word really does n't  make a difference , the fact that you have now turned a boring test into a challenge does make a difference in how the quiz is perceived . <p> The celebrity title . " Which celebrity hairstyle should you get ? " We all hear about celebrities , like it or not , and adding the word celebrity to your quiz title can increase traffic by 2x for some quizzes . To mix your brand into the quiz , write corresponding articles for each result and link out to them or offer a product that the celebrity uses which can be bought in your store . <p> NEW ! The " Who did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Hamas ? " has the internet debating furiously the last few weeks , and they are n't  the only quiz to have success with the " choose the correct one " model . A quiz like this begins life as a knowledge test , just like the actually quiz , and then it morphs into a competition between the results . <p> 2 . Quiz questions <p> This is where the real magic happens . In no other form of content to you have content producer and content consumer interacting directly through questions and answers . When you create a quiz you get an opportunity to speak directly with customers and get to know them a little before presenting your value proposition . <p> To make the most of this awesome opportunity , keep these few things in mind . <p> Speak from the heart . By which I mean do n't  get scared because a lot of people will take your quiz , let your personality shine instead . Speak in a conversational tone and leave your ego at the door . <p> Hint at the goal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what 's to come , but you should n't give away the results . Make sure that each questions correlates with the quiz results , otherwise cut out the question . <p> Keep it short . Do n't  have more than 15 questions , any longer than that and people will get bored and click away to look at more pictures from the Grammys . <p> 3 . Quiz results <p> You got someone to click on your quiz , and answer all your questions now its time to get them to click " share " and spread your quiz around to friends . That 's where the results come in . While I focus on the sharing element , do n't  go and shout at people to share your quiz , the prompting has to be subtle , here 's how to get that done . <p> Be nice . We generally share things on social networks that make us look good . If I take your career quiz and you tell me that I should be a janitor because I 'm no good at anything , I 'm not going to share that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a janitor because I enjoy helping people and taking care of the environment , I 'd be much more likely to share . <p> Do n't  lie . People can see right through you if you create quiz results that just tell everyone they are amazing for no reason . Like I did in the previous point , pull out the good parts of your quiz results and focus on those rather than making things up . <p> Prepare to be shared . This might sound goofy , but if you are n't  ready for the way your quiz will get shared , it wont look good when people do share it . The way Interact quiz shares work is like this : " I got ( my result ) ( title of the quiz " " so " I got Janitor what should your career actually be ? " make sure you name your quiz and quiz results to fit into this formula . <h> Conclusion <p> That s it , now you know how to make the perfect quiz just like the top 10% of Interact users . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@22713742 @2713742/ <h> Best Practices for Creating Assessments ( 4 Steps ) <p> Lead generation ( either by sending to a cold list , promoting with Google ads , or promoting through syndication ) <p> Lead scoring ( by segmenting leads based on their scores ) <p> Interactive assessments stand out against other forms of lead generation because they are new , different , and fun . Weve seen an average conversion rate of 40% on our assessments , meaning that 4/10 people who click " start assessment " end up becoming leads . We also integrate with all marketing automation systems so you can tag the leads based on their assessment score and follow up appropriately . <p> There are 4 parts to setting up an assessment . <p> 1 . Subject <p> Deciding what to make an assessment about is the most important part of the whole process . When deciding on an assessment title , you have to keep two things in mind . First , the assessment has to be appealing to the right audience . It must tell the quiz taker something about themselves so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be closely related to a a business problem you solve . Here are some examples to give you an idea of how this works . <p> " How mature are your ITSM processes ? " for a company that helps with process management <p> " Are You Internet of Things Ready ? " for a company that provides tools for managing internet of things enabled devices <p> " How Robust is Your Data Center ? " for a company that sells data management services <p> " Can You Pass the Hardest Finance History Test Ever ? " for a company that sells virtual data rooms to finance professionals <p> " Can You Identify These Dog Breeds ? " for an animal care non-profit <p> Hopefully you can see how these successful assessments connect the dots between engagement and practicality . <p> 2 . Questions <p> We recommend 6 to 12 questions for each assessment . This number of questions will take 2-3 minutes to answer , which is the sweet spot . To be more specific , we say 7 questions and 2 minutes is ideal to get prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long that they get bored . <p> When writing questions you should follow two rules . <p> Show your expertise : Make sure you are conveying that your company has solutions to offer for the problem your assessment is related to <p> Follow the " tipsy college student " rule : Remember that an assessment is a one-to-one form of communication . You are asking questions and one person is responding to them , like a scripted conversation . You should speak less formally and with more levity , because that will help to build rapport , which is important when you are going to be asking people to enter an email address . <p> 3 . Lead Capture Form <p> After a quiz taker answers all the questions in your assessment , theyll be presented with a lead capture form . This is where you are able to generate leads that connect up to your marketing automation system and are tagged by quiz result so you can follow up appropriately . There are two vital parts to the lead capture form <p> Give a relevant reason to opt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they do opt in ( other than just their quiz results ) . This form should be relevant to the topic of the quiz . For example , a quiz about how mature your processes are can promise to send more information about how to reach the next level of maturity by opting in . <p> Also , let people know how much and through what methods you 'll be contacting them , just to put their mind at ease <p> 4 . Results <p> After someone opts in , they are immediately shown their results . They will be very curious at this point , so you 'll want to make sure to give a satisfying outcome . Here are the three essential elements of a good assessment result . <p> A quick outcome title that tells me how I did : This is also the result title that will be sent to your marketing automation system , so make it short , but descriptive <p> A short description of the outcome : Tell people what their particular outcome means . Keep it short ( 3-4 sentences ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn more : Include a link to learn more or download information related to the particular outcome . 
@@22713743 @2713743/ <h> How to Write an Engaging Quiz <p> A great quiz can drive traffic , email signups , and links to your site ; but a poorly written quiz will damage your reputation . Weve crunched numbers on over 20,000 quiz takers to discover the most important aspects of a quiz that engages and entertains an audience . Here are the top four most important things to remember . <p> 1 . Be Personal : - Its no secret that we are obsessed with ourselves . Whether your quiz tells the taker what personality type they have or if they should start a business , addressing personal issues leads to the most interaction. - 2 . Give something away : - Were not talking about a free ipad , but rather intellectual knowledge . If your quiz promises to tell the taker how they can improve their marketing and at the end you simply give a link or worse yet only a score , you will have disappointing visitors . Make sure that the promise in your quiz title is properly carried through in the results . <p> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun to do a quiz on the latest fad or newest technology , topics that do n't  last perform worse in the long run . If you want your quiz to constantly attract attention and pull in leads , its got to be evergreen . <p> Topics that are not long-term : <p> -The newest video games <p> -The latest iphone <p> -The newest hit songs <p> Topics that are long-term : <p> -Relationships <p> -Technology ( in general ) <p> -Marketing and sales tactics <p> These are just examples , but the point is to ask yourself if anyone will care about your quiz in three months . If they wo n't then its probably not a very good idea . <p> 4 . Keep it short : For every question beyond #10 you will lose 2% of your audience . People want results and they want them now , not ten minutes from now after answering your fifty question quiz . The sweet spot for most quizzes is 6-12 questions . 
@@22713745 @2713745/ <h> How tourism companies reach new customers on Facebook using quizzes <p> Traveling is amazing , the experiences , the memories , the views , the people , its all got a magical vibe to it . Your job as a marketer in the tourism industry is to convey that amazingness to potential customers and make an impression that web visitor wont be able to forget . <p> One great way to do this is with personalization . If I know of a specific place to go within a country I 'm considering visiting and feel a personal connection to that place , I 'm more likely to make a trip out of it . That 's where quizzes come in . Doing a small informal survey , I found that among people I know who travel , the pre-travel planning often lasts months or even years . During that time people often know they want to go on vacation , but sometimes do n't  know where or what specific activities to do . <p> Using quizzes , you can subtly become part of that planning process by getting shared on Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article IS : A step-by-step set of guidelines to Facebook travel quiz strategy that will be successful . <h> Part 1 : Essential elements of a tourism quiz that deserves to be shared <p> The subject : Needs to appeal to our need for a personal invite <p> Think about the last five parties you went to for each one you most likely received a personal invite . It would be odd to attend events you werent directly invited to , and most of us do n't  . <p> That translates to tourism , if we feel like we are personally invited to go somewhere , that place is much more appealing . Take for example the quiz below created by Discover Jordan , a tourism site for the country of Jordan . They created a quiz titled " Where should your next adventure in Jordan be ? " that fits right into our desire for a personal invite . <p> Their method works pretty much anywhere , just use a personality test to help people discover where they should go in your part of the world . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures your tourists take , then think about how many images your website has . Tourism is a very visual industry , we like seeing natural and man-made beauty while on vacation . <p> It might seem obvious that you should have lots of images in your quiz , but its an important thing to not forget . Check out this question from the Jordan quiz mentioned above its basically all pictures and looks awesome . Including pictures of your destinations inside the quiz is a nice subtle way to build up anticipation before you even tell people where they should go . <p> The results : Need positivity <p> The goal of your quiz is to reach more people on Facebook who may be shopping around for travel destinations . Quiz results that are positive and uplifting get shared three times more than quiz results that are not positive . <p> Take a look at the result from the same Discover Jordan quiz we 've been following . Its not over-the-top positive about your result , but it does make you feel good about yourself . <p> The results : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz taker a result ( somewhere they should go ) , provide an opportunity to keep the conversation going . That could mean a long-form article about the recommended spot , or a link to book vacation packages , its up to you , but the important thing is to have that link . <p> Take for example the quiz result below , created by Visit Blackpool . Its a personality quiz telling you which attraction you are most like . In each result there is a link to book a visit to see " your " attraction . This makes perfect sense , once I found out which thing I am most like I obviously want to check it out , and the quiz provides me with the opportunity to do just that . <h> Part 2 : Strategy for sharing and getting people on your site <p> The key : Close the loop <p> You want to get social traffic from your quiz , so it does n't  do you any good if you make a quiz only to see the social shares pointing to a website domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interact quizzes to run on a closed loop . You create your quiz , share it out on all the social networks , and point the share links back to your site where the quiz is embedded . <p> The quizzes are white labeled and look like a part of your website , so there is no leakage of traffic to another domain , not even ours . 
@@22713746 @2713746/ <h> Interact Case Study : PBS Animal Misfits quiz is a perfect compliment to their TV show <p> If you do n't  like cute animals then this is not a case study for you . PBS partnered up with Interact to create an enormously fun quiz as part of the promotion for their Animal Misfits episode . It was a great success and a truly enjoyable quiz to take , and it also worked to promote the episode . <h> Strategy <p> The type of quiz PBS did falls under the " website personalization " category of quiz . The goal here is to create a personal connection with each potential viewer by connecting them with a misfit animal before the show even starts . That way , when the show starts , viewers will be eager to find the animal they are most like . <h> Execution <p> The idea for the PBS is great , augmenting a show with a quiz is a way that quizzes have been used for decades and it quite literally never gets old . However , a good idea on its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in how they went about executing the quiz . <p> First off , the quiz is full of animal pictures . This might seem all to obvious , but I 've witnessed great quiz ideas crash and burn because they just did n't  use the visual assets they had available . <p> Then , as the quiz progresses from cover to questions , each individual question is playful and fun , almost like a gameshow . This is a good example of PBS knowing their audience . People who are watching TV shows are looking to relax and take a load off , not answer actual difficult questions . By adding fun images and GIFs to each question , they compliment the entertainment value of the show itself . <p> Once the quiz is completed , you get your result , which is funny because its a picture of a cute animal , but also practical for PBS because each result links to the show itself . A couple of things they did well are making the result descriptions upbeat and positive while also remaining informative , and linking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content . <h> Implementation <p> PBS used the " closed loop " quiz sharing method perfectly with this quiz . The quiz quiz itself is embedded in the PBS website through an iframe so it appears as part of the natural content . Then , when the quiz gets shared , the social share links point back to this webpage where people can go and take the quiz , from there the process starts over again closed loop . <p> Additionally , the quiz was also shared through the official PBS twitter and Facebook accounts to get the ball rolling . The important part of any quiz embed is to make sure you do n't  lose any traffic , so those shares also link back to the page pictured below where the quiz is part of a webpage on PBS.org <h> Long-term strategy for quizzes <p> Running quizzes for weekly shows is a great way to use them in a consistent way . A lot of work goes into coming up with content for weekly shows , so augmenting each show with a quiz is an excellent strategy to make the most of that production effort . 
@@22713747 @2713747/ <h> 300 &gt; 1200 : A Tale of Two Outreach Campaigns <p> A few months ago I wrote a post titled " 1200 Outreach Emails Got Me This ? " which sparked great conversation as well as suggestions on how to improve my email outreach efforts . The suggestions were taken seriously and implemented here are the new results . <p> Instead of sending 1200 emails with limited targeting , I worked hard to send much more targeted emails to prospects I knew would be interested in Interact , and here 's what happened . <h> What I Learned : <h> 1 . I had to find the right people : <p> The main reason one in three emails resulted in a signup was that I spent a massive amount of time collecting information about who I should be targeting with my emails and how to reach them . I even created an optimal target ( I apologize for the cheesy stock photo ) <h> 2 . I had to do my homework : <p> In the days before the internet , President Teddy Roosevelt would spend hours studying people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not as smart as Teddy Roosevelt , so why should I do less research than he did ? Before sending any emails out , I spent some time reading through recent posts by the target and getting a feel for their style . In each email I was sure to point out what I liked about their writing , which turns out to be a great icebreaker . This is n't flattery or blowing smoke , its genuine compliments on real quality content . People are intuitive and can tell if my compliments are canned or insincere , so I was sure to really do my reading and find something I legitimately liked about each authors writing . <h> 3 . Focus on the benefits : <p> " We cant take credit for who we are " Andrew Carnegie . Interact provides quizzes that help content marketers capture more leads , only problem is , I was trying to sell the product by telling marketers that their current methods of lead capture were not adequate . - My method was essentially equivalent to telling these people that they were failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get better at it not a great way to start a conversation . Instead of telling people they need my product to improve , I changed the approach to begin talking about how quizzes can be a great addition to the already stellar content that is being produced on their site . ( once again this is a genuine compliment as all the targets I was reaching out to have far larger audiences than I 've been able to muster ) . <h> 4 . Consistency is still Key : <p> Startups are still intensely frustrating , mainly because growth is so darn sporadic during the early stages . One day seven new people including The Washington Post sign up and then no one converts for the next seven days ! The only way I 've found to power through this is consistency . Getting on the computer and phone every day to talk with prospective customers , listen to their needs , and help them understand our product . <p> Here is the ROI of hyper-targeted email outreach compared to the less-targeted outreach of my last post .

@@22713750 @2713750/ <h> Inbound Sales : The Productivity Template for Closing More Deals <p> One of my earliest influences in the sales world was Jessica Steel . She was one of the first employees at Pandora and their VP of Partnership Sales for seven years . I interviewed her for a website I used to run interviewing successful people , and she shared some insight into what a day in the life of an enterprise sales executive looks like . <p> I do n't  remember everything from the interview , but what I do remember is how she used to prioritize what to work on every day . She kept a list of the top deals that needed to be closed , and every single day she would go down the list , doing whatever she could to work on each deal before moving on to the next . <p> Once a deal closed it would be crossed out and the next one would move to the top . <p> This is an obvious but genius way to keep priorities straight . Its so easy to get muddled up with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the squeaky wheel gets the grease . ( meaning that whichever prospect bothers you the most gets paid attention ) . <p> The problem with having no plan is that you 'll get to the end of the day without following up with a $10k/year deal , instead having answered questions for a bunch of potential $1k/year deals . The ROI on your time drops because there 's no priorities . <p> Based on Jessicas advice , I 've put together a model for our inbound reps to follow in order to maximize their time and not always be bouncing from loud customer to loud customer . <h> 1 . Follow up with top prospects . <p> These are people close to closing . With inbound that probably means they are talking with their team or perhaps getting approval from a higher-up to make a purchase . This is by far the most delicate time in the sales process . Its far along , so typically there 's already been a significant investment on our side ( 10+ touches ) . If a deal is lost from this column that hurts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first ) thing the reps do each day . <p> Typical check-ins here involve sending resources or relevant examples to the prospect based on previous conversations . I 've found that if you continue offering free help in this period that really aids in building trust and the deals tend to close . <h> 2. 20 Calls into the Pipeline <p> Inbound sales get so much easier when we pick up the phone . Its not the most common thing in inbound , with many companies choosing automated email sequences to nurture prospects along . <p> However , I 've found that conversations with people in our pipeline ( made contact but not closed ) , are very helpful in understanding objections and fears about purchasing that just do n't  get conveyed well over email . I encourage reps to spend as long as possible on the phone with each person because the longer the conversation the more likely they are to reveal what they are actually hoping to get out of the product . <h> 3. 30 Emails into the Pipeline ( prospect if needed ) <p> After making calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to less-ripe prospects that have gone cold . We keep a database of deals that just never closed ( usually had a trial and never upgraded ) . These emails generate good conversations and often will lead to a prospect just coming back and upgrading . <h> 4 . Create sales materials/learn the product <p> This is something unique to Interact . Everyone on our team creates content in some way or another . Sales reps are responsible for creating slideshares and videos for our accounts to help educate prospects . This is the last thing for the day , and as reps get more and more deals in their pipeline this becomes a less prominent part of the day . At first ( the first month or two ) , reps create a lot of content ( a slideshare and present it to all other salespeople every single day ) . This not only helps the rep learn , but also creates material for sending to prospects at appropriate times . <p> That 's our process for now , it certainly is a work in progress and I 'd love to hear your thoughts on it . 
@@22713751 @2713751/ <h> How agencies use Interact to create quizzes for clients <p> So one of your clients requests a quiz to be made , and then another and another . You look into building each quiz from scratch and all the feature requests start adding up to a huge project . That 's when you go searching for another solution on Google and ( hopefully ) find this article . <p> Here at interact we 've worked with a bunch of agencies who have created hundreds of quizzes for their clients , each one as unique as the brand its made for . In this guide I 'll walk through the exact steps agencies use to successfully create excellent quizzes that put a smile on clients faces . <h> Part 1 : Setting up an account <p> With Interact , you can set up an account as the agency and then create individual quiz campaigns for each client . Every campaign can have its own branding and design so it will be completely unique to the client its made for . <p> Choosing an account will depend on how much traffic your clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio as you do n't  want to go over the limit . <p> Once you have an account setup , you 'll get a dashboard view like the one pictured below that will give you quick stats on your whole portfolio of quizzes as well as individual quiz stats to keep your clients updated on how well things are going with their campaigns . <p> Once you 've got your own account , just click the " create new quiz " button to get started with each campaign . <h> Part 2 : Creating a quiz <p> Interact supports the creation of two types of quizzes , multiple choice and personality . Multiple choice is going to be your standard " How much do you know about ? " quiz and personality is your typical " Which ( blank ) are you ? " quiz . We have guides on making those ( click here for personality ) ( click here for multiple choice ) . For now though , well focus on the most important features that are applicable to making quizzes for your clients . <p> Step 1 , branding. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know , we used to be an agency ) . That means their quiz must carry their logo and branding or else it just wont fly . That 's why we created the Interact quiz builder so you can edit all the main design and branding elements on each quiz individually ( so it can be unique for each client ) . <p> This screenshot shows the design editor . Youll have control over the logo ( that 's in the bottom right corner ) , as well as the background color , font color , and the color of the big button that says " take quiz " . Check out the example below of a quiz made by an agency for TotalLandscapeCare.com that uses the design editor to make a landscaping-style design . <p> Step 2 , content . <p> The second thing clients want control over is their quiz content . A good quiz can get hundreds of thousands of views and its very important to get the content just right so the client has a great experience with their quiz . With the Interact quiz builder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content until it is perfect . All you have to do is type in your questions and results . <p> This picture is a screenshot of the results portion of your quiz . As you can see each result or personality type can be edited with its own image and description . Interact supports image questions and image answers as well as images in the results . We 've found that having relevant pictures makes a huge difference when it comes to social traffic and shares so you can make a quiz that chock-full of images . <p> This example created by BlueHouse for ColoreScience shows how to use images effectively in a quiz . They have one image that aligns with each quiz question and then use simple text answers to there 's not too much going on at once . This makes for a really fun but professional feel , which is exactly what the ColorScience brand is . <p> Step 3 , linking out. - <p> A third thing clients find very important is the ability to have quizzes link back to their main websites . Quizzes get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get spread around , so its important to link back to the source so quiz takers have an opportunity to connect with the brand who created the quiz . <p> This example , created by Red Alien group for Kiss Communications has a link back to the Kiss website in each quiz result . For even better results , you can ask the client to provide a separate link for each quiz result so you can provide quiz takers with a personalized link depending on which result they get . <h> Part 3 : Sharing and embedding for your client <p> This is the most important issue for nearly all of the clients we 've worked with making quizzes . When quizzes get shared , its important that all the traffic from social shares etc. ends up on the root domain of your client . For example , if you are working with colorescience.com you want all the social share traffic to point back to a blog post or page on that domain where the quiz is embedded . <p> That way , when people are done taking the quiz they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase , sign up for a newsletter , or continue checking out the brand . <p> In Interact , its easy to embed quizzes into any webpage ( click here for a guide on that ) . Once you 've done that you 'll need to change the link that gets shared on social sites to be that page where your quiz is embedded on the client site . <p> Just paste the link into your Interact dashboard and its done . This can be repeated for every individual client . The end result will be that social shares point to a blog post on the clients website that has the quiz embedded . Just like this one below . <p> Interact was built with agencies in mind , we work with many of the worlds top design and advertising groups and together we make clients happy with beautiful and custom-designed quizzes . As the agency you can sign up using our self-serve platform starting at $49 a month and provide a quiz service that looks like it costs thousands a month . 
@@22713752 @2713752/ <h> Make a fun ( and useful ) quiz for your University <p> First off , I must address the elephant in the room . School systems are to blame for giving us that twisted feeling in our stomachs when we hear the word " quiz " Every one of us has gone to class to hear " pop quiz " and suddenly decide that we need to go home sick for the day . <p> Okay , now that that 's over , I would like to commend the scores of universities who have stepped up and begun reconstructing our perception of quizzes by creating fun and innovative new uses for the quiz . Let 's take a look at three such uses that might spark your idea wheel to make something great for your school . <p> 1 . Pepperdine : Where should you study abroad ? <p> Pepperdine is just plain cool because nearly all second year students at the University study abroad in places like London and Florence . Continuing on their coolness , they help students pick which place to travel to . <p> In search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well the questions convey " cool " and could n't find any fault . Pepperdine did an excellent job of mixing up the questions , keeping them fun , and actually finding out valuable information from their quiz takers to provide an accurate result . <p> After clicking on delicious pictures of food ( which is great fun ) , you are presented with your ideal place to study abroad . Again , Pepperdine executed perfectly , they include a beautiful image , a fun explanation , and most importantly a link to sign up for the study abroad program . That little link is so important , without it the quiz would just be fun , but with it the quiz is fun and useful . <p> The method Pepperdine used is fairly copyable for most universities . Because schools have so many programs , you can nearly always find a topic for which to create a fun quiz . For Pepperdine it was study abroad programs , but this would also work for clubs , sports , or even classes . <p> 2 . UC Davis : Which Famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook page there is a permanent quiz titled " Which famous aggie are you ? " which is awesome . The UC Davis quiz is admittedly simpler than the Pepperdine one , but it still accomplished something useful and is great fun . <p> The quiz is strategically placed on the student Facebook page , where prospective and current students are likely to visits . For high schoolers considering UC Davis as a college , the quiz gives them a personalized tie to the school , and for current students , the quiz acts as a built-in school pride booster . <p> If I had to pick one bone with the UC Davis quiz , its that there is n't a follow-up link like the Pepperdine one offered . Its always important to continue the conversation after a quiz . However , they did an excellent job of creating a relevant and enjoyable personality quiz . <p> 3 . Georgia Tech : How GT are you ? <p> Georgia Tech has created several great quizzes and uses them to run contests . Originating from the student Facebook page , these quizzes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " to " Which Mascot are You ? " the school produces the quizzes and has students tweet out their results . Then they give away prizes to one of the students who shared the quiz . <p> This is a fun type of contest you might expect to see from a company like Coca Cola , and its great to see from a school . This method is probably the most replicable for your school . You 'll need some fun topics that your student body will click with and then just track the tweets that go out . <p> Our thanks to these awesome Universities for providing examples of how to use quizzes in a non-terrifying way .

@@22713754 @2713754/ <h> How McDonalds Used Trash to Build Their Brand <p> In 1955 , no one knew what McDonalds was . Ray Kroc had just purchased the rights to the corporation from the McDonald brothers and was running the original McDonalds store in San Bernardino , California . Ray knew that McDonalds could grow , but with existing competition from A&amp;W and Kentucky Fried Chicken and a limited budget , breaking into the fast food market was a daunting task . <p> Mike Mooslin , now the founder of Color me Mine , was a young employee at that original McDonalds in 1955 and worked closely with Ray Crock at the original location . Very early every morning before people were awake , Ray would send Mike out into the neighborhood around the restaurant with empty McDonalds wrappers to be thrown into the gutters . Then , at lunch time he would send Mike back out , dressed in - McDonalds uniform and clean-up gear to clean up the wrappers as people were out-and-about getting lunch . <p> The rest is history and McDonalds is the largest fast food chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guerrilla marketing of Ray and Mike turned an unknown single location into the conglomerate McDonalds is today . <h> What We Can Learn : <p> When Youre Cool Everyone Wants to Know Why <p> Ray understood that McDonalds would n't be cool unless everyone was eating it ; however , everyone was not eating it . They had to create an illusion of universal popularity in order to get their neighbors into the store . By spreading wrappers everywhere , it seemed as if the whole neighborhood was eating at McDonalds and it was the new hot spot . <p> How to Apply this today : <p> Reach out to - key players in the market you want to reach and get featured some way or another . The method does n't  need to be traditional , just get your name attached all over the place and people will assume your company is worth checking out . For example , at Interact we wanted to reach a group of marketers who were all acquaintances . We spent a lot of time pitching the leader of the group on using a quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days the other members of the group began creating their own quizzes without us prompting them . <p> Saturate One Market First <p> Every day Mike would spread wrappers in the same neighborhood and later pick them up . After a while it became routine for the residents around the McDonalds to see Mike outside cleaning up . Over time , McDonalds became the go-to spot for lunch , but just within that small area . The restaurant built a loyal following and later was able to expand , but only with the strong base that established in that original small market . <p> How to apply this today : <p> At Interact we learned this one the hard way . Our marketing efforts tried to reach several different verticals all at once when we first started doing campaigns . The result was mediocre results in each area and nothing remarkable anywhere . It turns out that marketers and beauty sites love our product ( a weird combo , yes ) . Now our focus is 80% on those two verticals and 20% exploring new areas , with much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest fast food chain in the world , there 's no way they would pull off a sneaky trick like littering their own wrappers around the city , right ? That 's exactly what they did , and it worked . The lesson we can learn from their success is that in the beginning pride and unwillingness to try new things in marketing can only be detrimental . <p> How to apply this today : <p> Do n't  be afraid to try embarrassing marketing tactics . Mike felt awkward and strange throwing trash on the ground and then picking it up every day , but he did it anyways . There is a world of possibilities outside of your comfort zone that just might be the key to unlocking a marketing plan that works . <p> *The accounts in this story are taken from a conversation with Mike Mooslin.

You see , this quiz was released just a few days before an apartment right next to the one where I live exploded from a drug lab disaster , which resulted in a fire and huge damage to property .

Amnesty International <p> This group does so much good work around the world that its difficult to narrow down just one area to really focus on and feel a connection to as a person who is looking to potentially donate .

At Interact , we designed our quizzes to provide an optimal experience no matter what device you are on , and the result is a fully responsive quiz module that works on everything from iphones to TV screens . <p> Fortunately , all Interact quizzes automatically respond to varying screen sizes , but there are still things you can do to make sure the quiz scales down nicely as the screen size changes . <p> First , know when the size changes . Interact quizzes resize in steps based on the size of the window in which they are being displayed . The biggest one is any screen that 's larger than 960px wide , which is almost all laptops and desktops . Then there are two different steps down for varying sizes of tablets , and then a final small size made for iphones and android phones . <p> Second , make sure your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 100 characters <p> Quiz questions : Should also be less than 100 characters <p> Quiz answers ( to the questions ) : Should each be 80 characters or less <p> Quiz results : Should be between 200 and 500 characters <p> Now these are recommendations based on what fits well on the smallest device , which then scales up as the screen gets larger . When dealing with quizzes , which get so much traffic from mobile , it works well to think mobile first .

@@22713766 @2713766/ <h> The Insane Power of Consistency in Content Marketing <p> In high school I bought and sold laptops for a " living " ( with almost no expenses and $1,000 a week in income I thought I was rolling in it ) . The way it worked was that I would find people who had just bought a new laptop and wanted to get rid of the old one and also make a few bucks . I would purchase these laptops for $100-$200 , fix them up and re-sell for $400-$600 . It was an excellent gig . <p> The way I would find new people to purchase from was through Craigslist , by posting in the computers section that I was looking for used laptops . This experience with Craigslist was where I first learned about the power of consistency . If I posted a new ad every single night after school I 'd receive 1-2 new leads each day . If I stopped for a little while that would slowly drop to 1 a day , and then one every other day . When things were going well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and since the leads only stopped rolling in slowly I would n't notice , until the deals stopped flowing . <p> Then I would freak out and start posting every day again , but like any sales process , there was a cycle that took 1-2 weeks to close for each deal . It was like the old frog in a boiling pot analogy ( sorry , I grew up in the sticks ) . I would not notice the leads slowly decreasing until it was too late . <h> Repeating the same mistake 7 years later <p> Youd think that because this story sticks out so clearly in my mind I 'd never repeat the same mistake . Alas , history tends to repeat itself , and 7 years after my laptop marketing experience I ended up repeating myself with Interacts marketing strategy . I 've always been partial to content marketing , and I used a strategy called " boring content " to build up Interacts inbound leads and it worked . We were getting 900+ signups per month on the product . <p> Only problem was I was n't doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Taking advice from advisors I dove into sales , reading 25 books and watching 100 's of hours of tutorials over three months . That meant I stepped away from content marketing to focus on sales ( I tend to only focus on one thing at a time ) . The month after I stopped creating content we still got 800-something trials , then it was 700-something , then 600-something . It was the same situation , the ramifications werent immediate , but they were pretty rough . ( luckily my sales bet paid off and revenue increased enough to hire a full-time marketing person who is now crushing it . <p> However , its the same story , re-building that base of leads will take time . <h> Why am I telling these stories ? <p> Because they both illustrate the power of consistency in content marketing . In both cases , it took a while ( over a year ) to build up a real base of leads coming in from inbound strategies . In both cases I stopped being consistent for one reason or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was bleeding leads until it really hurt . <p> It really sucks to have to battle back after slipping up on lead generation , but its also amazing to have a strong flow of new prospects coming in without having to hustle every single day to find new people . <p> It takes a long time to get inbound going , but it also takes a long time to get outbound really going . I was watching a sales chat hosted by SAASTR the other day and they were talking about investing in outbound for the long term . Only thing that sucks with outbound is that you have to constantly hunt for new leads , even after you scale it up . With inbound you obviously ca n't stop , but you also have an established base . <p> To illustrate the power of consistency , I 've added a graphic of every Interact blog post over time . Most posts do n't  get a ton of traffic , but they also get very consistent traffic . That 's because my strategy has been to answer real questions with content , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <h> It takes time for content to kick in <p> But it does take a while for content marketing to make a difference . At Interact it took about a year , and in the example below , from Everywherist , it took 2.5 years ! There are a variety of reasons for this time , including but not limited to : getting better at writing , building more links , having a more established domain , etc . <p> In both the illustration of the Interact blog and the Everywherist diagram below , a lot of the posts get very steady traffic over time because they are evergreen in subject . This is awesome , but it also usually means that its going to take a while for your base of content to build up to a point where you 're seeing real amounts of traffic . <p> Consistency is the key to a lot of things , it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at anything , which breaks down to 8 hours per day for 3.5 years . Content is no different , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that you should stop learning and getting better , which I 'll write about next time . 
@@22713767 @2713767/ <h> The science behind making a Buzzfeed quiz <p> Buzzfeed is the king of consistently creating quizzes that yield millions of views , and 75% of those views come from social sites , with Facebook being the largest driver of traffic . After looking at a lot of quizzes , we 've come up with the top five things you must do to have a chance at viral success check them out . <h> 1 . A title that stands out from the noise. - <p> Over 80% of people will look at your title and decide if they want to take your quiz without any further input . That means you should really focus on the title first , instead of worrying so much about the rest of the quiz . Here at Interact , we may not have quite the traffic , of Buzzfeed , but we have seen over 3 million visits to our portfolio of quizzes , and have found that three title templates really stand out . <p> First , the " Which ( blank ) are you ? " title . We ran a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I compared 227 quizzes with titles that contained the words " which " , " are " and " you " with 227 quizzes that did n't  have any of those words . These quizzes were selected at random from a set of 2775 quizzes . <p> The average number of views for a quiz that contains all three of those words is more than double the average for quizzes that have none of those words . <p> Now this finding , as with all the findings in this article is a correlation , not a causation meaning that there is strong evidence to suggest that using the " Which ( blank ) are you ? " title will lead to more quiz views , its not guaranteed . <p> A great example of the " Which ( blank ) are you ? " title comes from The Red Lobster , who made a quiz " Which Red Lobster Endless Shrimp Flavor are you ? " to promote their annual endless shrimp promotion . <p> The quiz was a hit on Facebook , racking up 78,000 likes in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent job on Facebook and has a loyal following built up , but they also make sure every post is compelling , which this quiz was . <p> Second , the " actually " title : - I 'm not saying that adding the word " actually " to your quiz title can increase the average views by 69% , but it can . Again , I took a subset of 1375 Interact quizzes and divided them into two categories , quizzes where the titles include the word " actually " and quizzes where the title does not include the same word . <p> The average views for " actually " quizzes is 1305 , whereas the average for quizzes without the word " actually " in the title is 770 . <p> That 's a distinct and statistically significant difference . <p> Third , the celebrity comparison title : " Which celebrity are you like ? " again , we did a test comparing quizzes with the word " celebrity " in the title against quizzes that did n't  have the same word . This test has the most drastic results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a theory for why celebrity quizzes performed so drastically better than non-celebrity quizzes . I would assume that most celebrity quizzes are going on entertainment sites that get a lot of traffic that 's very generic . In other words , most of our customers who run marketing agencies probably did n't  use a celebrity title , whereas the newspapers and magazine websites were more likely to . <p> However , I think non-entertainment sites can learn a lot from the celebrity study . There are ways to use it . For example , if your quiz is " What 's your office personality ? " for a co-working company , you could change it to " Which celebrity is your office personality like ? " which would turn a normal quiz into a celebrity quiz . <h> 2 . A cover image that attracts minds. - <p> Did you know that our minds are hard-wired to look for faces ? Neither did I until I read a Time article about it . Turns out its our natural impulse to pick out faces , its an innate thing so that babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  run off with a wolf pack instead of their parents . What that means for your quiz , however , is that you should use a picture of a person as the cover photo . <p> The way that Interact quizzes are set up ( after many iterations ) is that a majority of the real estate for the quiz cover is taken up by an image , so finding a nice picture of a person that actually relates to your quiz content is huge to the success of the quiz . <p> To help out with that , we 've compiled a list of stock image sites that are completely free and you can use for your quiz . Make sure that you pick a picture of a person who is relevant to your quiz , nothing is worse than a random cover image that really has nothing to do with the quiz itself . <h> 3 . Quiz questions that are conversational <p> Talking naturally in your quiz can increase views by 1000% just by speaking like you normally do in real life ? Let me explain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about ourselves a lot in real life . A full 60% of what we say is about ourselves , and when we talk about ourselves , we in turn use words like " I " " you " and " we " a lot . <p> Let 's call those words personal pronouns , because they are pronouns and personal . Then , let 's compare quiz views to the number of personal pronouns present in the quiz content . <p> The result is drastic , it makes a big difference in quiz views if we speak naturally . This ties into the natural magic of quizzes . I think of quizzes as a portal between quiz writer and quiz taker . Unlike virtually every other form of content , quizzes allow for a direct interaction between two people . Instead of writing an article in anticipation of hundreds or thousands of people consuming the piece , you are writing a quiz in anticipation of one person answering your unique set of questions one at a time . <p> I think the " Pub Rule " sums up the conversational aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a - quiz question , in its exact wording , to a friend at a pub , do n't  ask it in your quiz . This rule was created after the Irish Post was able to reach an astounding 25% of the Irish people living in London with one quiz they invented the Pub Rule . <h> 4 . Quiz results that encourage sharing <p> So what does it mean to " encourage sharing " of course you want to have people to share your quiz . What it means is you should write quiz results in a way that actually makes your quiz takers want to share your quiz . So what do we want to share ? Mostly things that make us look good , Facebook is really just a big message board for our accomplishments , and your quiz should feed into that . <p> Again , I wanted to test the hypothesis that positive quiz results would lead to more social shares . To do this , we collected 2000 tweets that originated from Interact quiz results and analyzed them for positive trigger words like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An astounding 3/4 of tweets contain one of our positive trigger words . In general quiz results that feed the ego of your quiz takers will get shared more . <p> A great example of this comes from HostelWorld , the number one booking site for Hostels around the world . Their quiz results were titled with things like " The YOLO Fiend " and then filled with hilarious and positive descriptions . The result is more than 40,000 views , with 90% of the traffic coming from Facebook and Twitter. - <h> 5 . A plan for how sharing will work <p> The best quizzes can see the future , and prepare for it . Your quiz will be shared on Facebook and other social sites as long as it does n't  suck , which it shouldnt if you follow this guide . Let 's look at how your quiz will show up on Facebook ( when a quiz taker shares it ) . <p> The formula goes like this " I got ( my result ) ( title of quiz ) " so in the example above , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lessons to Refresh Your Skill ! " and the title is " Do you actually know how to swim ? " When the social media team at The Red Cross put this quiz together , they made sure that each quiz result fit well with the title of the quiz , and the results were excellent , with thousands of Facebook shares and vibrant discussions stemming from it . <p> Do a pre-quiz check to make sure all the results will show up nicely on Facebook when your awesome visitors share your quiz . <p> Well that 's it , those are the keys to making a quiz like Buzzfeed , and ensuring the greatest chance of success .

" Quiz that has 3.5k shares , so it is a popular quiz . <p> Step 2 : Find quizzes to gain inspiration from <p> Now I 'll go look for quizzes that are similar to that popular one I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking , and how they are formatted . I usually pull together 3-5 quizzes that I like so I can get a feel for what types of things are working well across all the different examples . <p> Step 3 : Write out your quiz questions and results <p> Ill input the results into Interact first ( the personalities ) . For the purpose of this guide , I 'm going to set up a quiz that is very similar to the concept we researched in step one . Coming up with good quiz questions and results can be challenging , so I 'd encourage you to think about what someone who is taking the quiz would want to be asked , and also look to the examples you found in step one for inspiration on what kinds of questions to ask . <p> Step 4 : Write your quiz lead capture call to action <p> For this example , I 'm going to let people know that theyll be getting our Free 7-day email course on how to use quizzes as lead magnets . Theyll also get to see their results if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . This call to action works well because it adds value beyond just seeing the results ( they also get to receive the email course ) , and it also says what I 'm going to send them ( the 7-day email course ) . <p> Step 5 : Create a quiz follow-up sequence <p> You can connect your Interact quiz directly to a list in your email marketing program , so you can kick off a sequence whenever someone subscribes to the list that you set up for the quiz . The most important thing about this follow-up sequence is that the first email starts with " Thanks for Taking Our Quiz " so that people know you 're connecting with them in response to their opting in to the quiz . <p> Step 6 : Embed your quiz on your site <p> I usually recommend that you use our iframe embed code to put the quiz on your site . You can use the direct URL to your quiz , but the issue with that is when you set up the Facebook ad is has a tryinteract.com attribution on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Step 7 : Create an ad for your quiz on Facebook <p> Set up an ad targeting an audience that you have defined as effective for conversions . Lookalike audiences are great , and ideally you know the cost per conversion when you use other lead magnets so you can directly compare that cost with what you spend to get a conversion with your quiz . <p> Step 8 : Track your results in Facebook and Interact Analytics <p> You can see real-time results in both Interact and your Facebook analytics . You can add your Facebook pixel to your Interact quiz so that you can track conversions to who sees the results ( that would be a conversion , since you have to opt-in in order to see your quiz results ) . I recommend setting a goal for what you want to pay per lead and run the ad to see if you can reach that level , if not then re-think the quiz idea or come up with a new one . <p> That 's it , you can easily set up a quiz campaign with follow-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . Try a variety of different quizzes , and you 'll find that there will be one or two that really convert well while others might not so much .

@@22713773 @2713773/ <h> Demand Generation Using Quizzes : A Step-By-Step Guide <p> If you work in marketing , there is a challenge that 's always pervasive . The challenge is in engaging cold contacts who you want to sell to and getting them to connect with your brand and opt-in to further communications . This is a critical step in the sales funnel , and as outlined below you can see it sits near the top of the funnel for most technology companies ( funnel diagram borrowed from Marketo ) <p> So that 's where quizzes come in , you put quizzes in front of the right audience and they WILL engage , because no one can deny the power of a quiz . I 'm not being tongue-in-cheek either , because quizzes really are undeniable . <p> Let 's take a look at how the process works . <p> ( there 's a graphic below for those who prefer a visual format ) <p> Step 1 : Arrange traffic sources <p> Who will you put your quiz in front of ? Quizzes are great and engaging people , but they are n't  magical , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by themselves . There 's a short list of common methods for driving traffic into quizzes . <p> -Google Adwords : This is one of the most consistent and most popular . Using a quiz as the endpoint of your ad is a great replacement for traditional landing pages , and since it still collects leads , it is a healthy alternative to an ebook or white paper . <p> -Email list : Either an opt-in list or a cold prospect list using the word " Quiz " in your subject line grabs attention . In one case I 've talked to they got a 20% click-through rate off of a cold contact list for their quiz <p> -Web Link : Adding a link to the quiz on your website , to your email footer , or as a blog post is a great way to get consistent , organic traffic into it . Note that you wont be able to control the prospects who see the quiz this way . <p> -Social ads : Linkedin , Facebook , Twitter all networks have proven effective to drive the right prospects into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controllable channels but if set up correctly can drive leads at a very low cost . <p> Step 2 : Set up your quiz for that traffic <p> Quizzes have to be both captivating and practical . You do n't  want to make a quiz that 's " just for fun " because the leads you get might not even care about your business . You also do n't  want the quiz to be TOO dry , because then it wont even be appealing in the first place . There are two methods for doing this . <p> The key to a strong quiz is using the visceral element of a quiz with the concrete relevance of real content . <p> Step 3 : Write questions to build rapport and interest <p> Once someone begins taking a quiz , they usually finish it ( 75-90% ) completion rates on average . You can stay at the high end of that range by writing questions that connect on a personal level . Quizzes give you the unique opportunity to speak directly to the person at the other end of the internet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human . <p> *One company we work with actually gets together and has drinks before writing their quizzes in order to maximize the fun effect of the content I recommend that off the record . <p> Step 4 : Capture leads within the quiz <p> With Interact , you can set up a lead capture form directly inside of your quiz and connect that form up to your marketing automation program . When you do this right , it converts at 50% or higher , meaning that half the people who finish a quiz end up opting in . There are two really important elements to this . <p> First , give a reason for opting in . If you are going to send people a follow-up series with how to use their personality advantageously in business , then just say it . <p> Second , be honest about how you 're going to contact people . It really does n't  hurt to say " Well send you a free email course over the next three months " or " We send one newsletter per month . " <p> Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz and puts in their contact information , theyll expect to see immediate results . In this section you want to cover a couple of important aspects . <p> First , give a satisfying answer . After someone goes through a quiz , they want to see a real result that gives an actual outcome . <p> Second , include relevant links . Remember where the quiz fits in your sales strategy . You 'll want to link out from the quiz results to other resources in the hopes of moving people on to the next step . <p> Step 6 : Follow up based on quiz results using marketing automation <p> The great thing about quizzes is that they not only deliver leads , but they deliver leads that have progressive profiling , meaning that you know something about the contacts . What you can do is set up a follow-up sequence based on which result someone gets . ( I.E. " Your Quiz Result is ( blank ) " as the first email that gets sent out .

Its embarrassing and unfortunate to have this happen , and when your quiz could reach tens of thousands of people , its vital to make sure your text is read-able no matter what kind of background you have . <p> Welcome to the Interact guide to making awesome-looking quizzes that will get you gobs of traffic ( traffic not guaranteed ) <p> The first and main thing you need is read-ability . Yes , quizzes are great fun , but you have to be able to read the questions and answers before they can be fun . That 's why we put together this super fun graphic showing the various options of font color and background color that go well together . Fun fact , black text on a light-yellow background is the most read-able format to ever exist on the face of the planet ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , I applaud you -theres a lot more good stuff to learn on this bottom part of the page . The next point I 'd like to cover is the quiz cover ( see what I did there ? ) here is what a quiz cover from Interact looks like . <p> We use images on cover photos because of a study we conducted showing that images have a dramatic effect on click-throughs . Picking a cover photo boils down to this if it adds to the cover than use it , if not , do n't  use it . The example on the left asks which American City you should be living in , so it makes sense to have a picture of an American city , a generic picture of a smiling person would n't have the same effect . <p> On to the quiz questions themselves . Much debate has been made over how questions should be set up , should they be super fun and full of life ? or should be they as simple as possible in order to get quiz takers through to the finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers ( mostly content producers , marketers , and news sites ) , is that its more beneficial to have people complete your quiz than to try and entertain them every step of the way . <p> That 's because your results are where you can present offers , get people to share your quiz , or collect leads . The job of your quiz questions is to make sure as few people leave as possible . <p> This point is one that gets a lot of discussion and feedback . There is a general perception that everything must be extremely pretty and colorful to maximize the amount of people it can reach . The quiz layout we 've chosen is very simple , which makes it work better across all devices . The one thing I would recommend is choosing a custom background color to match your site . Brand consistency is very important , and providing one set of colors across all your content , even quizzes , can help with that . <p> The next chronological step in your quiz is the lead capture form . This is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take your quiz , which can be amazingly valuable . Weve created this portion to be intentionally basic , so as not to distract from the point . On this page , your words are as important as your design . The only real element that 's vital here is your logo , which reaffirms potential prospects . <p> Finally , let 's talk about quiz results . This is the big deal , where you get to promote sharing , amplify the reach of your quiz , or present targeted offers to quiz takers . The key here is to focus on what matters , namely the result description and image . Pick an image that 's relevant , pair it with a short result description , and you are good to go . Provide the appropriate social sharing options to reach more people . <p> Conclusion : Keep it simple , do n't  try to do too much , match quiz style to your site . Its tempting to create a flashy , overly dramatic quiz , but we 've found that you want just enough flair to draw people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every element , and whether its necessary , if not than get rid of it

@@22713778 @2713778/ <p> Earlier today Apple made some big announcements regarding a few of their products , and actually rolled out quite a bit more than most people predicted . They took out rumors about the new MacBook being delayed by announcing a brand new 12-inch model that has been dubbed as the New MacBook . ' <p> The technology inside is pretty incredible , and they 've managed to shrink the MacBook even further by making this new mac the thinnest model available . Introducing new USB-C ports , Apple is looking again to set a new standard for merged ports in their hardware . <p> But the main feature of the event was the company delving deeper into the Apple Watch and more details on its release . We got a first look of the watch in action , and all the technology that 's inside it . It opens up a new door for Apple with a new industry that they 're venturing into . They have three different types of their watch that you can choose from to buy . <p> I crafted together this quiz that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want , so go ahead and take the quiz and we 'll talk about it below . It helps you out in just 5 questions , so its quick ! <p> To make a quiz like the one talked about in this article , head to- tryinteract.com <p> If you 're interested in getting the watch , you might be wondering which one you should get . We 'll see if I end up following through with my desire to get one ( I mean let 's be honest it might solve a problem that does n't exist , but it 's so dang cool ! ) but there are actually more options of the watch then I initially thought they would release . <p> So how did you do ? Maybe just the cheapest sport is best for you ? Thinking of making more of a fashion statement and the mid-tier watches are a bit more up your alley ? Or perhaps you were recommended the highest value 18k gold Apple Watches and you may not realize your desire for a true luxury product . <p> To refocus this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogs , I want to dive into how companies can effectively use quizzes as a non-intrusive aspect of their tech blog articles without it fitting into some preconception fad or cheap gig . Gathering the right content together and actually making quizzes that give high quality results can be a great way to increase engagement on your website and even generate leads if you wanted . <p> Tech blogs have become widely popular in recent times , and consumers visit them frequently and loyally all across the Internet . Often times these blogs attempt at keeping you engaged by listing more articles to read or trying to point you somewhere else in the site after you read an article , which make sense if they 're trying to continue having them use their site frequently . <p> But beyond those strategies , there is n't much going on to keep users interested . That 's why we stand by quizzes to fill this perfect gap that is created by lack of engagement , especially the ones that have good content that a user would actually like to see the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see straight through a quiz that is just trying to get you to take it , and other times it 's easy to see well written quizzes that actually answer legitimate questions a user might have . If we can strive towards making quizzes that fit into that latter category , we can have a lot of success with using quizzes as an engaging platform . <p> I 've mentioned this in other articles and it fits perfectly to be talked about here as well " through the data we 've collected we 've determined that when there is a non-obtrusive quiz on a web article , it actually increases the time the user is on the page by about one minute . And to those who do content marketing for blogs , that is a pretty dang long time . It opens up opportunities to build trust with your users , and if you want to go towards the avenue of collecting leads it can get you those precious email addresses to add to your mailing list that would n't exist without the quiz . <p> So why does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article work ? Well there 's a few reasons , let 's talk about them . <h> 1 . It presents relevant information that people are actually interested in <p> It 's true , the Apple Watch is a hot topic right now and people are searching the Internet looking for more information on it . If we add a quiz like this to our blog , we 're effectively taking good use of all that traffic and buzz that is naturally going through the World Wide Web on the product . <h> 2 . It 's seamless and does n't interrupt the experience <p> This comes down to more of a branding and placement issue . If you can successfully implement a quiz that blends in with the page , it wo n't interrupt how the reader responds to the article . If they 're uninterested in the quiz , you want them to be able to just move on past it . You do n't want the quiz to act as a stopping point by creating a break , you want it to actually be a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it actually adds to the content instead of taking away from it . <p> Effectively you get another aspect of the article that can be interacted with by users , and it 's a seamless transition that they can take the quiz and then move on in the article . <h> 3 . It gives high quality , honest results <p> Another thing we want our quizzes to do is to actually give results that we spent time looking into . It 's easy to sniff out cheap quizzes that are there for an email address or something else , and I feel it 's equally as easy to tell if a quiz is genuine and will actually give you a response you would n't mind knowing . <p> We want our quizzes to give relevant information that can actually help the user , and this quiz does , at the very least , adds another suggestion in the users head on whether or not they 're going to get the watch and what kind if they do . <h> 4 . And finally , it also benefits you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metrics . You get a whole plethora of data that can be rereleased to the same audience which might create interesting speculation , and each time a user takes the quiz you get to learn a little bit more about who is using your site . <p> You also have the option to ask for an email address before the answers are given out , and our stats say that about 50% of people who complete quizzes give their email address . So if you got 500 people to take the quiz , that could potentially be 250 emails to grow your mailing list with . For content providing companies , this can really be a big deal on establishing a relationship with your readers . <p> In my quiz I tried to demonstrate a way in which you can use a trending object to not only create traffic that will flow through your site , but even add a little value to those users that visit as well . It 's a quiz that is actually interesting , and gives you a real , useful result . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the content interesting and worthwhile , I think you 'll be pleasantly surprised at the positive response and value you 'll receive in regard to your quizzes .

@@22713779 @2713779/ <h> How some real estate agents are winning at lead generation using quizzes <p> Competition for leads in the Real Estate space is ridiculous . A friend of mine ( who is one of the most friendly people I know ) decided she wanted to become a real estate agent and got her license . I was sure shed instantly be successful and be a top agent , but after about six months she gave up and moved on . <p> I do n't  know the exact reasons for her lack of success , but I do know that if she could n't pull it off it must be extremely difficult to find qualified leads in Real Estate . <p> Her story is my inspiration for creating this guide . You see , we 've had several real estate companies achieve amazing results using quizzes to generate leads , and I want to walk through an example with you so you can use the same method to bring in hot leads for your real estate business . <p> Each of the brands listed above used an Interact quiz to bring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quizzes are , this gave them a distinct advantage over the competition . One of the major reasons for the success of these quizzes is their strong affinity for being shared on social media . Its pretty difficult to make lead generating content that is worthy of sharing , but quizzes pull off that combination with ease . <p> Without further ado , let 's look at an example from Million Dollar Listings Josh Flagg . His quiz brought in 3400 new leads in the form of email subscribers who could be nurtured along into long-term customers well break down the exact method used here so you can do that same thing . <h> How to make a lead generation quiz for Real Estate <p> 1 . Make it interesting and useful <p> Remember the part about these quizzes getting shared on social media ? The key to making that happen is a topic people really care about and find useful . For Real Estate , you can basically use the same exact quiz all the time . <p> " What 's your ( blank ) style ? " <p> So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What 's Your Home Style ? " " What 's Your Business Style ? " the thing to think about is what your potential customers are into . Now Josh Flagg knows that his audience is really into business , so making a quiz about business style is perfect . The quiz done by Century 21 , however was " What 's Your Home Style ? " which fits in better with a broad home buying audience . <p> 2 . Establish a connection <p> Inside a quiz you can have a conversation with people . This is absolutely unique to the quiz format , and a beautiful thing when done right . The main thing you want to get right here is just sounding human . Sometimes that means being a bit goofy , sometimes that means being a little crass , whatever it you have to do to establish a connection with the quiz taker , do it . <p> The questions of a quiz are where you have to build up enough of a relationship with the person taking the quiz to justify asking for an email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have very little time that 's why I recommend being almost overly friendly . <p> 3 . Be straightforward when asking for information <p> Now we get to the good part where you actually bring in contact information for people who can turn into customers . There are exactly three keys to a strong lead capture form within a quiz . <p> Tell them why to subscribe . " to see your results and become a real estate guru " this is pretty compelling . If I 'm trying to learn from Josh Flagg and his quiz tells me that hell teach me if I opt-in , I 'll want to opt-in . <p> Tell them what you 'll be sending. - This opt-in form tells me I 'll get one email a week , which is much better than not saying anything at all . One email per week is not that much , and if I 'm interested in the content I 'll happily subscribe , but if you do n't  say anything at all I will wonder when you are going to email me and how often . <p> Tell them its optional. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your success . If you force opt-ins that opens up all kinds of issues , but if you let people skip , you know that anyone who subscribes is really interested in getting your emails . <p> 4 . Illicit an emotional response <p> Extensive study has shown that we basically just share things that we have an emotional response to . Those emotions could be fear , happiness , elation , surprise , or a bunch of others . The key is to make people feel something when they are interacting with your content and that will lead to more sharing . <p> The absolute easiest way to do this with quizzes is by making people happy . Since you are giving the quiz taker an assessment and at the end are writing a paragraph or two about that person , you have the power to make them happy , sad , or downtrodden based on what you say about them . <p> It seems a bit ridiculous , why would anyone care that much about a quiz result ? However , look no further than the string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz results . <p> People are furious about the results they got on this quiz , which is just a silly and fun piece of content . The point I 'm trying to make here is that quizzes have the power to make people respond with emotion , and you can use that for good . Take for example , the Real Estate quiz we are following , here 's a short excerpt " You do n't  stop until the job is done . Your clients appreciate that you do n't  stop until you 've made the sale ( or purchase ) . " Wow ! that feels really good , even if you do n't  really know me , you said kind things about me . <p> The key to getting more social shares is to be really nice . The results of this quiz were shared more than 600 times , and that 's not by accident . <p> 5 . Follow up to continue the conversation- <p> A quiz is a conversation , but a short one , and on the internet people forget conversations as quickly as they have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email shortly after the person takes the quiz and continue the conversation . <p> That 's exactly what Josh Flagg did with his quiz , a few minutes after I took the quiz he sent me an email asking what kind of Business Personality I had , and it was a great continuation of the quiz . <p> Real Estate is a tough business , if my friend couldnt make it , I would n't even dare try but to those of you who are brave enough to stick it out and be successful , I salute you and hopefully this guide provides some actionable help so you can make your own lead generating real estate quiz .

@@22713785 @2713785/ <h> How To Make A Quiz About Your Favorite Country ( Mine is North Korea ) <p> Before you start reading , why do n't you take the quiz down below before we break it down . See how much you actually do know about the DPRK ! <p> Recently North Korea has created quite a stir in the media . With Sony 's database systems being hacked and the release of a lot of information with it , the government itself had determined that a group of North Koreans were behind the attack and tightened up sanctions against the country because of it . All was from a movie called The Interview ' into which two comedic characters played by James Franco and Seth Rogan are recruited by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong Un on their trip to the hermit kingdom to interview him . <p> This is a widely talked about subject as it seems about once a month North Korea is doing something to get themselves into the media . Whether they detail a desire to nuke the United States , the fact that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ databases of South Koreas banks , you can expect the country and Kim Jong Un to pop up on your daily news reading at least once . <p> With all this attention , I feel like there is a lot of different material we could create a North Korean quiz on . You could do bizarre facts about the country , the lives of the people there , the way they have been building in Pyongyang , or the erroneous true facts about the Dear Leader himself , Kim Jong-Un . I 'm going to go ahead and choose the last idea I presented , because an interesting , fun , shareable quiz could easily be created with that idea . So let 's collect ourselves to make a quiz called How well do you know the Kim family ? ' <p> To make this quiz , first we need to get some great facts on the Kim dynasty . If you are n't familiar with who that is , the father of present day North Korea is Kim Il-Sung , who ruled the country at its beginnings after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jong Il , and the third and current leader of North Korea is his son , Kim Jong Un . There are many great facts about all three of the men , so let 's write them down below and see how we could make questions out of them . Now I 'm not saying many or any of these claims are true , but we 're going to list them like they are . <p> 1 . Kim Jong Il never flew . 2 . Kim Jong Il is 5 feet 2 inches tall . 3 . He drank $750,000 worth of cognac each year . 4 . Kim Jong-Un admires and is great friends ' with Dennis Rodman. 5 . Kim Jong-Un became head of the state at age 28 , and is currently the world 's youngest head of state . 6 . Kim Jong-Un has a Nike sneakers fetish . 7 . Kim Jong-Un attended school earlier on in life in Switzerland . 8 . There are estimated to be 34,000 statues of Kim Jong Il in the country . 9 . Kim Jong Il holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 38 under par with 11 holes in one . He then immediately retired from the sport . 10 . He is known as the supreme leader , dear leader , and generalissimo . <p> Alright , so now that we have ten facts about the Kim family , let 's go ahead and turn them into questions we could ask in a quiz . <p> 1 . What kind of travel was Kim Jong-Il deathly afraid of ? 2 . What was Kim Jong-Il 's height ? 3 . How much cognac did Kim Jong-Il drink yearly ? 4 . Which basketball player does Kim Jong-un admire the most and calls himself a great friend ' of ? 5 . At what age did Kim Jong Un become the head of state in North Korea ? 6 . Which sneaker brand is Kim Jong-Un 's absolutely favorite ? 7 . Where did Kim Jong Un attend elementary school ? 8 . How many statues of Kim Jong-Il are there estimated to be in the country ? 9 . What is the score of Kim Jong-Il 's best round of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call any of the leaders ? <p> Now when it comes to the results , on a quiz like this you have to have a little fun . Since the subject matter is unique and slightly ridiculous , we can create a bit of humor into what we call people who get certain scores . Let 's just take a look at the two extremes . <p> Let 's start with the lowest of answering between 0 and 2 correct . I found an image of DPRK citizens crying after Kim Jong-Il 's death a few years ago . This is a bit of a humorous image to us , because we could n't fathom over crying or being that upset when a leader of our country has passed away , but to them it was a 100% serious matter . Since this is the lowest answer , I called the individual a Shameful Citizen . North Korea has been known to have shamed its citizens when they do something wrong , and so that is how I perceived the country would treat the individual who did n't know anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , those who score between 9-10 correct , I called them Pyongyang Elites . All of the people who live in the capital city are privileged ' citizens since they are blessed to live in such a highly sought after place . <p> So now that the quiz is laid out and we spent the time creating it , one of the bigger issues we 've seen in marketing is getting the traffic to be funneled through your website . If this quiz becomes quite popular , it will most likely be shared many times on Facebook . The thing is though , how can we manage to get that traffic coming from Facebook to our website rather than simply taking the quiz , seeing the result and then leaving ? <p> The unique thing we have about this quiz is its subject matter . North Korea can be a really interesting topic for people because of how bizarre the country is to us in the western world . After some of the mind-blowing facts we present in our quiz it might be easy to get someone to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe something along the lines of Liked these mind-blowing facts you just learned ? Well we 've got more ' as a link . This continues to satisfy the users want for my facts after they might have been taken a bit aback by what they just read about the country , and how it could n't possibly be true . <p> It 's a problem that we often run into with people who may want to try to link back more to their website rather than just collecting emails through the quiz themselves . Another option would be to embed the quiz into an article on your site , instead of just having the quiz stand-alone . This makes sense in most circumstances , as in order to take the quiz the users have to go to where it is in your site . Therefore the quiz is surrounded by your content , your ads , and branded to look as if it 's just another thing in your site . This is most attractive to many of the people that use our software , because it gives it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third party iframe that is set inside of the site . <p> This speaks to continuity , which creates a smooth reading and user experience from the moment a consumer comes to your site . That way the traffic comes in and stays in , and is n't immediately directed somewhere else once they 're finished with the quiz or when they start it . Having them surrounded by your content gives you the most control , and that is what we should all be aiming for in marketing platforms such as this . <p> So in wrapping up , what we 've created here is a fun , interactive , and actually interesting quiz . You have a great subject matter that is being talked about widely these days , fun results when you finish , and a few methods to have users link back to your website when they 're done , or try to keep them around for even longer . Combining all of these things is sure to create a successful quiz campaign . 
@@22713786 @2713786/ <p> The life of a non-profit marketer is a hard one . Its not like you can just have a great cause and people will automatically buy what you have or opt-in to receive your newsletter , you still have to do really excellent marketing , and there 's usually not a great budget to work with ! Its not easy . <p> Weve been fortunate to work together with some of the worlds premiere non-profit organizations and been able to put together some truly impressive campaigns for lead generation and actual product sales . ( interact offers a 25% discount to all non-profits ) . <p> Today I want to highlight three campaigns that really stood out as stellar because of the strategy and execution ( not to mention cold-hard results ) . Let 's follow the journey of these non-profits from ideation to delivery of excellent quizzes . <h> 1 . The American Red Cross : Use a quiz to boost donations <p> Sometimes it just takes some personalization to get people to pony up and donate to truly good causes like The Red Cross . Recently The Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing relief for victims of fires . <p> Short aside here , just after The Red Cross released their fire safety quiz we are about to look at there was an explosion and fire at an apartment right next to mine and I realized just how awesome this organization is ! <p> Back to our marketing lesson , lol . <p> The problem The American Red Cross had to solve is how they would drive traffic , specifically from social media , to a campaign about fire safety . In our society where we do n't  worry about bad things until after they happen , fire safety is just not that popular . <p> However , when you turn the campaign into a quiz format where it says " Find out how you would handle a home fire ! " that becomes a whole different issue . Now its personal , now Im involved , now it is urgent . <p> At the end of the quiz , there is an assessment of how you scored ( of course ) , along with a link out to donate and educate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already . <p> This link points to a donation page where there is a powerful picture of a pair of shoes . This is an excellent landing page that was designed specifically for the fire campaign . <p> How do you use this strategy ? <p> What The Red Cross did was make an important but not very share-able topic into one that excelled on social media by formatting the content into a quiz which is a very personal medium . The same thing can work in a lot of scenarios . Weve seen " How much do you know about Iran ? " for an Iranian social entrepreneurship organization , " Could you survive on a dollar a day ? " by Oxfam International , and " Could you make it as a farmer ? " by Oxfam as well . <p> All these quizzes follow the Red Cross format of taking an issue and turning it into a challenge that personally applies to every person who sees it on social media . <h> 2 . The World Wildlife Fund : Grow your email list <p> Everyone says an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on growing your email list . I did n't  really " get " why that was until a few months ago when The World Wildlife Fund put together one of the best quizzes I 've ever seen and used it to capture leads that were put on an autoresponder that I still look forward to being on today . <p> It was a couple of weeks before Valentines day , and we had several companies setting up campaigns for the holiday . One of the organizations that reached out to formulate a quiz was WWF , and they absolutely nailed it . <p> The quiz tells you Which animal would be your valentines day soulmate , but only after you put in your name and email address ( okay , you do n't  have to put in your info , its optional ) . This form achieved a 46% conversion rate , and brought in 1,043 new email subscribers . However , that part is not what I find impressive about this quiz . <p> What I think is amazing is the way in which WWF builds a relationship with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first thing they do is send a welcome email that references the quiz itself , and has pictures of animals , and includes a big link to check out more content like the quiz I took . <p> Then after they send me some more awesome pictures of animals , and information about the species that were in the quiz I took , they send me an offer to get involved by adopting an animal , an animal like my soulmate ! Genius . When you 're talking about drip campaigns , this is what you want to do . WWF not only referenced how they got my contact info , but they call me by name , send me entertaining content , and tie the eventual call to action into what I originally subscribed to . <p> How to use this method : <p> WWF used an internal email program to set up their drip campaign , but Interact integrates with most autoresponders so you can collect information and set up campaigns with whatever system you are comfortable with . <h> 3 . Girl Scouts of America : Sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people exactly what Interact does . However , when I share this Girl Scouts example , something clicks in peoples minds and they instantly " get " it . There 's something about a Girl Scout Cookie quiz that just makes a ton of sense I guess . <p> At the end of the quiz you are told what kind of cookie you are and get a chance to share your result . Not gon na lie , I 'm a bit mad that I did n't  get thin mints as my result , but that 's okay , I still have a special place in my heart for Girl Scout Cookies . <p> How to replicated the Girl Scout Cookies Method : <p> This kind of personality quiz works for any sort of organization that works with distinct entities . That was an overly fancy way of saying that you need personalities to start with . Amnesty International did " Which Human Rights Activist are You ? " which is another adaptation of the same quiz concept . <p> To wrap things up . <p> Its a hard-knock life for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@22713787 @2713787/ <h> A Rock-Solid Marketing Funnel for Selling Courses Using Quizzes <h> You can request a demo to see exactly how this would work for you at- tryinteract.com <p> Since I 'm a visual learner myself , I 've condensed this method into a visual below . There is a full text description below that . <p> Now for the text explanation of how this works <p> I 'm going to start with an story for why I 'm writing this piece . <p> The story comes from team USA womens gymnastics in the olympics . In 2016 , they won by the highest margin in history , obliterating the competition . As the announcers discussed the team , they mentioned how the team USA coach is a perfectionist , and when you see the routines you can tell the gymnasts have practiced so many times they do n't  even have to think about what 's next , its pure muscle memory . <p> Then you see the other teams who seem to be less confident in their routines and are even improvising at times when they do n't  quite feel comfortable with the script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lower overall score . <p> Being a marketer at heart , of course I immediately began thinking about how this concept of perfecting a method can be applied to the quizzes that I help our customers with every day . Just like a gymnastics routine , a quiz has many parts and they must all work together in order to achieve the end goal . When you do n't  have a rock-solid routine ( or quiz funnel ) , and have to improvise certain parts , it kind of all disintegrates very quickly . <p> That 's why we always look for patterns at Interact industries and use-cases for our quizzes where the results are not only great , but also replicable many times over . <p> One of these patterns is with online programs , the courses that teach us how to get more life skills in specific arenas that can be done fully online . Weve seen very similar quizzes implemented over and over again with strong results every time . So here 's the play-by-play . <h> Step 1 : Set up your traffic flow <p> Before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to get them to take your quiz first . Once your quiz marketing funnel is set up , you 'll want to use it for a long time to maximize your time investment , so deciding on a consistent flow of traffic before you even build a quiz is vital to its success . <p> Facebook Ads : - <p> The most common method for promoting quizzes is through Facebook . You can run consistent Facebook ads driving people through to a quiz embedded on your website and have a funnel that deliver consistent results . I would highly recommend using an audience profile that 's already set up in your Facebook advertising account . The beauty of doing that is you do n't  have to worry about the audience accounting for different results and you can quickly evaluate the effectiveness of your quiz . <p> Linkedin : <p> Link on your website : <p> A quiz as a navigation item on your website will attract people who might not otherwise opt in . Just the word " quiz " or " assessment " draws attention from passive browsers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from simply linking to your quiz from the home page navigation . <p> Google Ads : <p> Targeting your ideal customer profile through Google is still very effective . I would caution you and say that a quiz should really be used as an alternative to existing ads it will be hard going to being Google ads for the first time with a quiz if you have n't already established ROI through the channel . <h> Step 2 : Build your quiz <p> Subject : There is only one quiz title . " Which ( Blank ) are You ? " - Everything else is an adaptation of that concept . Here are some really common ones for online courses : <p> " What 's Your Ideal Career Path ? " <p> " Do You Have What it Takes to Start a Business ? " <p> " What 's Your Business Personality ? " <p> These quiz subjects all allow you to filter people into different categories from which you can follow-up in a personalized way , and they also have a natural appeal that gets people interested in the first place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the questions you can ask . The first reason I like the questions of a quiz is because they let you speak directly to people who take the quiz . There 's no other kind of content that gives you this type of portal to be able to have a scripted conversation with people . The second reason I like questions is because they let you build rapport with quiz takers and create a connection that helps increase the overall conversion rate of the quiz when it does come time to ask for an opt-in . <p> To make the most of these two opportunities , simply follow a couple of best practices rules about how to write quiz questions . <p> -Speak like a human . This might sound obvious , but think about the last few marketing pieces you looked at and you 'll remember that they often fail to actually connect on a personal level . There 's an art to sounding human , and I actually wrote an entire article about it for our friends over at Buffer check it out here . The TL ; DR version is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go of your inhibitions and pre-conceived notions about how marketing should be written and just talk to people . <p> The easiest way to accomplish that is to write the quiz to one person , an actual person you are imagining in your head who would enjoy your quiz . <p> -Have 6-12 questions. - This range will take about 2 minutes for quiz takers to complete , which is the sweet spot for keeping attention but also giving you enough time to connect with the quiz taker through your quiz questions and prep them to opt-in at the end of the quiz . <p> -Show your knowledge. - Your questions should be relevant to the offerings you provide . Ask intelligent questions to build a profile of the quiz taker so you can offer up relevant advice at the end of the quiz , do n't  just ask questions for the sake of asking questions . For example , do n't  ask " What do you enjoy the most ? " instead ask " What 's Your Ideal Working Environment ? " if you are selling time management courses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through your quiz you 'll have an opportunity to get an opt-in . This is the data we can connect to your marketing automation system , and is really the moment of truth for your quiz because the lead information is so valuable . In order to maximize the opt-ins for people who make it to this page , you 'll want to do two things on the lead capture form . <p> 1 . Give a reason for opting-in that is not just seeing the quiz results . Yes , there is a very strong appeal to seeing quiz results that inspires people to opt-in . However , you should n't rely on the results as the entire draw for opting in . An easy way to offer more value is to let people know that you 'll send personalized advice based on their personality from the quiz . You can also incorporate a giveaway for people who do opt-in , but that 's not necessary . <p> 2 . Give clear direction on how you 'll be contacting new leads . Let people know " Youll get free educational advice to improve your unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaffirms that value you 'll be providing while simultaneously letting people know how you 're going to handle their information when they do opt-in . <p> Outcomes : <h> Step 3 : Follow up based on quiz results and close the sale <p> After you collect new email subscribers in your quiz , you 'll be able to follow up in an automated for each quiz personality based on their outcome from your quiz . This is done inside of your marketing automation system so you can employ lead scoring and other great features . <p> Below is an example image of how you 'd follow up with a standard personality quiz . There are 4 follow-up emails . <p> 1 . The " Thanks for taking our quiz ! " welcome email . This is the first email you send out , and should be set up to send out immediately after someone opts-in through your quiz . The email should reference the quiz personality the person got and also introduce your brand . <p> 2 . The " Top 10 for You " email . This second email is the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new subscriber . Lists are an easy entry point for this so I 'd recommend sending a list of the " Top 10 Ways to Use Your Gift as a ( Blank ) " or something along those lines . <p> 3 . The " Story of someone like you " email . This email helps the new subscriber to understand how your offerings might fit into their lifestyle . <p> 4 . The " Let 's talk " email . For most courses , this is a limited-time discount on what you have to offer . For coaches , this might be a call to action for a one-on-one conversation . This should be a hard sell but not so crazy that you ca n't follow-up with regular emails afterwards <p> After the four-email welcome sequence you can have a trigger to merge the leads back into a normal newsletter or update cadence . If they have n't converted by this point but are still subscribed , they are interested at least a little bit and you can use your normal email marketing cadence to be there when they do have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In conclusion . <p> We 've found a really solid use-case with online courses being promoted using quizzes . Just like an olympics team can practice the same routine over and over again until its perfect , you can utilize this same template that 's been proven over and over again to generate leads for your online course or coaching business . <h> You can request a demo to see exactly how this would work for you at tryinteract.com 
@@22713788 @2713788/ <h> How to make a delicious food quiz for your website <p> Food sites are some of my favorite places on the internet , so you can imagine my horror when I searched for " how to make a food quiz " and was returned no actual guides on how to make a food quiz and only some food quizzes that consisted of radio buttons and no pictures ! Something has to be done about this , so I went searching for a great food quiz made on the Interact platform and was not disappointed . I found a quiz created by Dean and Deluca , a site that sells food products and has excellent design skills . <p> Below Ive broken down their quiz into digestible parts for you to follow and make your own amazing food quiz . <h> 1 . Design <p> The biggest thing that set the Dean and Deluca quiz apart from virtually every other food quiz on the Internet is its design . The quiz just looks beautiful , I want to click on it and see what its all about . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that really make this quiz pop . <p> Cover image . This picture is beautiful . It brings the essence of Thanksgiving with it and really makes you feel warm inside . Quizzes are a very entertainment-based type of content , and having an inviting cover image really sets your quiz apart from the crowd . To maximize your success with images , make sure the picture applies directly to the subject of your quiz and be extra careful to follow the image sizing guidelines . <p> Font . Interact offers a variety of fonts , and this quiz chose one that fits perfectly with the Dean and Deluca brand . Font is one of those things you might not think about as much that can really make a difference in the way your quiz looks . A good font is not noticeable until pointed out , but once you realize that the font is there it really makes a quiz stand out . <p> Colors . Each quiz can have its own background color and call to action button color . Customizing these is the easiest but most often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is match your websites color scheme and things will go swimmingly . Dean &amp; Deluca does just this with a white background and green accent button . <p> Logo . I 've seen everything from company taglines to cat pictures placed in the " logo " section of Interact quizzes . The best thing to do here is exactly what Dean &amp; Deluca did , put a plain text logo ( preferably gray scale or one color ) in the logo area , and format the size to the recommended guidelines . This way everyone who takes your quiz will be exposed to your brand , but not in a " in your face " way . <h> 2 . Questions <p> Speak like a human . I should n't have to tell you this , but too many quizzes still sound like they were written by whoever writes grammar school tests ( like a robot would write ) . Remember that a quiz is a one-to-one medium , its just you and the person who is taking the quiz . Everyone will have a different experience with your quiz based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have the same path . That should help alleviate the pressure associated with speaking to a mass audience . In our findings , speaking like yourself , and being a little goofy goes a long way to getting more quiz views . <p> Limit the answer choices . There are a couple of reasons not to have too many choices . First , there 's a time issue , not everyone wants to read through ten different answer choices before picking one . Second , there 's the rule of too many choices , which basically says that if you give too many options people will panic and leave . Also , when your quizzes are viewed through mobile devices , having a bunch of answers will inevitably cause scrolling . <p> Have 3-12 questions . This is just a guideline based on what we 've seen to work . Three is the bare minimum to have a quiz that actually is somewhat accurate , and twelve is the number of questions people can answer in two minutes ( our online attention span ) . <h> 3 . Results <p> Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize everything you ever wanted . one moment Would you capture it or just let it slip ? Eminem <p> I put this very out of place Eminem lyric here because it represents quiz results very well . You have a very small window with your quiz results to get your quiz takers to share their result on Facebook or Twitter . If enough of them do , your quiz goes viral , if no one does , your quiz falls flat you only get one shot . Now that all the pressures gone , here 's how to write great quiz results . <p> Be positive . The thing that sets highly shared quiz results apart from the rest is positivity . We use social networks as our own personal list of accomplishments , and when quiz results convey good things in a genuine way they do extremely well . For example , the quiz result below just says " Your personality is rich and robust , and your Thanksgiving dessert should be too " This is nice but not too nice , it seems logical , and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can create wording that makes sense but also pays compliments you 'll end up with positive quiz results worth sharing . <p> Create an experience for each result . If you notice the quiz result below , there is a beautiful picture of the result title . If you like below down to the social share buttons , you 'll see it says " share what you 'll be serving ! " just above the Facebook and Twitter share buttons . These things , combined with the description of the result , create a full experience for this quiz result that is unique . <p> If you are going to pull off the full potential of quizzes , you must create a unique experience for each person taking your quiz . This will let you cash in on the benefits of personalized content . <p> Keep it simple . Simple language brings out good feelings because you do n't  leave anyone feeling left out because they do n't  know what the heck you are saying . You can use anecdotes and wordplay in your quiz results , but do n't  use complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neuroscience quiz , which has been done , but not on a food blog , that would be weird ) . <p> What 's missing , a personalized link . With each quiz result , you have the opportunity to include a personalized quiz result link that points to other content or products . This is an amazing opportunity to present a personalized call-to-action ( personalized CTAs convert 50% better than non-personalized ) . This is missing from the Dean &amp; Deluca quiz and could easily be added to promote products . <h> 3.5 ( optional ) Lead generation <p> Quizzes can be used to collect email addresses ( and other contact information ) very effectively . However , if you do n't  do it right , it just looks spammy and no one wants that . Here are our top tips for collecting leads using your quiz . <p> Have a double-incentive . The first draw for entering an email is obvious , you " have to " to see your results ( you can skip the step too ) . But its the secondary incentive that pushes people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this case , Dean &amp; Deluca is offering a 10% discount to subscribers , which is convenient , especially if you were already planning on buying something . <p> Be transparent . Make sure your logo is on this page , and speak directly to your quiz takers , nothing is worse than putting in your email address only to find out you will now get daily emails , ugh . <h> 4 . Social share setup <p> Most of what goes into a social share is automatically generated based on how you write your quiz , so its important to keep in mind while you are creating the content . Here is a quick checklist to make sure you 're covered <p> Have an image in each result . As you 'll see below , each social share pulls the image from the quiz result that the sharer received . Make sure to have good quality images in each result . <p> Make sure your quiz results and quiz title mesh . What I mean by mesh is that they work together . When the results get shared they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( title of quiz ) " and that should create a call-to-action for friends of the sharer to take the quiz . <p> Look at the first sentence of your result description . This is what will get shared when someone posts their results on social sites . It should be somewhat comprehensive of what the result is and act as a subheading to the result title .

@@22713791 @2713791/ <p> Its about a quiz that is extremely effective at bringing in new leads . <p> Its about how you can take Facebook ads and turn them into website traffic and then into prospects you can nurture into paying customers . <p> This is the story of a quiz titled " Wannabe Witchy ? " that was promoted with Facebook ads and brought in 475 new leads ( name and email address ) in just about a week . <p> So here 's the cover of the quiz , its well-designed for sure , but nothing too fancy . I think the real draw here is the ambiguity created by the quiz cover , you really want to know more when you see this cover on a Facebook ad . <p> As I mentioned the quiz was promoted with Facebook ads that were replicas of the post you can see below . Simple enough , an image with a link and a catchy caption . <p> So the journey starts with a post like the one above , which probably shows up in your feed as an ad or from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and are taken to the cover image you see above as well . Then you click on the quiz to start taking it and get some fun and game-like questions to answer . <p> I mean , who does n't  want to answer the question " Which animal would be your best totem ? " its a completely enjoyable experience to answer the questions of this quiz . <p> But that 's not the point , and it is all at the same time . What I mean is that the underlying goal for this campaign was to generate leads , but at the same time its completely entertaining and does n't  come across as just another lead generation campaign ( in contrast to a whitepaper download or ebook download ) The entire quiz just feels like fun . <p> But on to the good stuff , how did this quiz manage to generate 475 new leads from just 1000 visits ? here 's the form that did it . <p> So that 's excellent , the lead is in the database ( in this case mailchimp ) , but now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that person , mention your products , but also provide value outside of that to make sure the person stays interested in your company apart from giving you money . In this case ( a quiz ) it starts off with showing a quiz result that satisfies curiosity ( yes , the quiz talks about witches , get over it ) . <p> But it does n't  end there . When I sign up ( which I did ) I get a personalized email with my name and a message dedicated to the type of " witch " I am . <p> The moral of the story is that this website was able to take a simple quiz , promote it on Facebook using ads , drive 1000 visits , and bring in 475 new leads that could be targeted with specific follow-up emails. 
@@22713792 @2713792/ <h> How Travel Sites are Gamifying Lead Generation Using Quizzes <p> At the beginning of 2014 , Buzzfeed , The New York Times , and Zimbio each made a quiz about which country you should live in , and each of them got 4,000,000 or more hits . At the end of 2014 , Afar Magazine created a quiz " Where Should You Go In 2015 ? " that brought in 9,030 new email leads that can be nurtured into long-term readers . <p> I love this transition from pure entertainment into pure value for brands like Afar as quizzes turned from just " like-bait " into a useful tool that brings in email subscribers . Afar is just one of many travel brands using Interact quizzes to grow their email lists , and with our marketing automation integrations , those leads are fed directly into auto-responders , so the path to revenue is clear . <p> All of this is just words , so let 's dive in and look at the actual methods used by Afar so you can replicate them on your site . <h> An example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz " Where Should You Go in 2015 ? " has been taken 21,277 times to date , and has brought in 9,030 new email subscribers that are receiving weekly updates from the brand ( I 'm on the list , they send good stuff ) , but more on that later . Let 's start at the beginning and work through the strategy here . <p> The hook <p> Quizzes get somewhere between 75% and 90% of their traffic from Facebook , so having a strong incentive for people scrolling through feeds to click on a quiz is a must . The way Afar knew their quiz would work was two-fold . First , there was the success that the other publishers had had with similar quizzes , and second was something called " quiz-purposing . " <p> This weird term means that Afar formulated this quiz based on previously successful pages about the various destinations . Some of the most popular content on their site are the guides to places like Bali and Japan , which are the places recommended to go in 2015 . <p> The trust factor <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , that was insinuated by the super smooth transition I just made ( sarcasm ) ) . I have some very specific tips about writing quiz questions for email collecting travel quizzes based on what 's worked for others . <p> Pictures of the places : You have all this amazing graphic material ( pictures of food , sceneries , people , etc. ) from the places that your travel brand creates content about . Utilize those images in the questions of your quiz to get people excited about going . <p> Get personal : At the end of this quiz you are going to ask someone for permission to be inside their inbox ( that sounds weird , I know ) . That 's a lot of permission to give someone you do n't  know , so make your questions " break the ice " in order to create a smoother transition to asking for information . <p> The ask <p> The questions are over , and now its time to ask the person for their email address . Yes , this shows up before the results , but people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up with a 42% conversion rate ? The answer is an honest value proposition . If I decided to click on this quiz when it showed up in my Facebook feed , I have at least some interest in travel , and Afar knows that . So the call to action says " Youll also receive our newsletter stocked with travel tips and inspiration . " I just took a quiz full of pictures of travel destinations , of course I want that ! <p> There are two keys to a solid call to action in quizzes . <p> Relevance : The call to action about travel would n't make any sense if I was on a page about food or technology , but since this quiz is specifically built for people who like traveling its perfect . <p> Honest goodness : Afar is up-front about what they send ( travel tips and inspiration ) . You know what you 'll be getting if you allow them to enter your inbox . And its a good thing . <p> The beginning of a new relationship <p> At this point someone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Either way this is a sensitive time where your new connection to this person could grow stronger or fall apart very easily . That 's why its important to continue the conversation , right after you tell the person that they rock . <p> What I mean is , this is a psychologically stimulating quiz . The person taking it is answering personal questions , and you are giving them an assessment , similar to how a psychologist would . Now let 's be real , your internet travel quiz is no scientific masterpiece , but it does have the same effect in that people will believe what you tell them in their quiz result . Be nice , say kind things , but do n't  lie . The Afar quiz is an excellent example of this , it starts with " You clearly love adventure " this sentence brings up images of Indiana Jones and Mount Everest ( at least it does for me ) . Its flattery . <p> Here are the three keys to quiz results for a lead gen travel quiz . <p> Be nice : Flattery is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the way the person answered the quiz questions to your advantage . Also put a beautiful picture , that will help with making the description believable . <p> Link out : You can set up personalized links for each quiz result . This Afar quiz has links to read more about your destination . <p> Let the people share : This quiz was shared 2,043 times , representing a 17.6% share rate , so nearly one in five quiz takers shared their results . That 's why it was able to go " viral " for a little while . <p> Utilizing your new email permission- <p> You 're in ! The quiz successfully got you a new email subscriber , which can be automatically ported to any of our Interact integrations ( we integrate with most ESPs ) . You can also collect these subscribers in a file and export . Any way you get your new subscribers , its now time to email them . The key is to live up to whatever you promised in your call to action text . Afar told me theyd send me travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached a screenshot of one of their emails below . <p> They send a " weekly wander " email that I actually read , and it drives traffic back to their site , keeps people engaged , and ends up leading to revenue . <p> There 's a couple of tips for travel email follow-ups . <p> Reference the quiz : If you are funneling leads to an autoresponder , had the welcome email reference the quiz itself . Something as simple as " hope you enjoyed the quiz ! " or " which result did you get ? " ( even though you 'll already know ) . <p> Send what you said you 'd send : If you promised to send travel tips and inspiration , send travel tips and inspiration , nothing else . You can eventually include some ads or upsells , but do n't  rush it . <p> Travel quizzes are like crack for the social media world . Its just too much fun to take them , and travel quizzes are some of the most-shared content on the internet over the last ten years . Now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get real value . 
@@22713793 @2713793/ <h> 5 Lessons Learned from Sending 1,000,000 emails <h> Email marketing is on the rise 75% of businesses plan to spend more money on email marketing next year Sending targeted campaigns has an ROI of $43 for every dollar spent . <p> These are all common quotes that are thrown around lauding the greatness of the email campaign for acquiring new customers and keeping existing customers connected . However , there are a lot of things that must go right behind the scenes to achieve the kind of success these tag phrases claim . Weve sent over a million emails in various campaigns and made lots of mistakes , here are five of the biggest takeaways from what we learned . <p> 1 . Never stop learning about your list : The best thing you can do to make sure your emails resonate with readers is to know who your readers are . Use a program like Rapleaf- to get detailed stats on your subscribers . You can even take it a step further and create an imaginary average subscriber who characterizes the most prevalent traits of your list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be enjoyed by that average subscriber . <p> 2 . Remember your subscribers are people : A common mistake is to feel as if your list becomes to big to address personally . Even with thousands of people receiving your campaigns , remember that each and every individual on your list is still a human and should be addressed appropriately . The worry here is to be to friendly and make your emails feel fake , make sure to test your results to find a happy medium . <p> 3 . Segment , Segment , Segment : The single best thing you can ever do for your email marketing is to segment your list into multiple lists based on interests . Set up the various email capture forms on your site to feed into specific lists and send separate campaigns out . There is an investment up front to set this up , but it is much easier to address a specific subset of people than to try and talk to everyone at once . <p> 4 . Do n't  Chase Numbers : While its tempting to use less-than-kosher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will hurt you in the long run . Subscribers who did n't  voluntarily submit to receiving your contacts rarely make purchases and are much more likely to report you as spam or give your products a bad review . Its better to have 1000 very engaged subscribers than 5000 that do n't  care about you . <p> 5 . Do give people a chance to subscribe : Without being pushy , have clearly labeled subscription options on your site . Often , readers may be interested in getting more information by email , but unless you make it easy the transaction does n't  happen .

These companies get more than 50% of their leads from content and are masters of inbound . I 'd like to highlight some of their specific strategies to show how similar these companies are in the way they do content and what we all can learn from it . <h> 1 . SproutSocial <p> Sprout Social was #88 on the Inc. 500 for 2015 , and if you 're in marketing you 've almost definitely heard of them . This company produces a ton of excellent content and is consistently found at the top of sites like Inbound.org . There general strategy revolves around creating long form guides on social media marketing . <p> How it drives leads : - Sprout has a call to action on the sidebar and below each post to start a free trial of the social tools it offers . They also have a static header that follows people reading blog posts . <p> Sprout Social 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets mentioned a lot as a company that grew up on content marketing and guest blogging . Now they have one of the top marketing blogs on the internet and produce some of the most shared articles every single month . They do a lot of list posts , how-tos and in-depth marketing experiments . <p> How it drives leads : - Buffer goes for the " straight to the product " approach , which I think can work well if you have a free trial or a freemium product . I 've seen them play with different calls to action , from blog subscriptions to the direct-to-product approach . <p> Buffer 2014 Revenue : - $5 million <h> 3 . Hubspot <p> Hubspot produces an insane amount of content , and they do n't  let that compromise the quality . This is only possible because they have an entire team of their own writers as well as guest bloggers . This allows them to cover a myriad of topics while still going in-depth on each post . <p> How it drives leads : - Personalized calls to action on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email marketing . Every single Hubspot post has a call to action at the end that is personalized to the content being displayed . On the Interact site , we 've seen 28% click throughs when the call to action is personalized like this , it works incredibly well .

Provide personalized CTAs for your audience. - Quizzes are set up to have different results based on the takers personality type or score . You can provide a link in each individual result that is relevant to the particular persons type or score . <p> This week I was privileged to work on a quiz for Marleys Mutts , a non-profit helping to place older dogs into homes .

In this case its dogs , which is an awesome thing to make a quiz about but its not always that clear . I 've also worked on campaigns for software companies where the main value is reliable storage solutions and for retail brands where the main value is stylish clothes . <p> Distill down what is most important to your brand and base the quiz on that . There 's always something in there to make a quiz about . <h> Part 2 : How the questions are set up <p> After we came up with an idea for the quiz it was time for me to think about the quiz questions . here 's the process . <p> Make them targeted towards your actual audience. - I asked some questions to get an idea about what kind of audience we were targeting with this quiz . This information will be used to determine the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used ( it would be dumb to have a quiz targeted towards older people and only have images of kids as the answer choices ) . <p> Use image answers. - Image answers are the highest performing format for quiz questions that we 've found so far . We did a study on this with all of our top quizzes here at Interact , and its universally true . The hard part with image questions is finding good pictures to use , which is why we compiled this list of stock image sites to pull from . I try to use what I know about the audience were targeting to inform which images are chosen . <p> Have 7 Questions. - Weve found that 7 is the optimal amount to have . This will take an average of two minutes to complete , which is long enough for the quiz to feel accurate but not too long to where you lose people due to distractedness . <h> Part 3 : The lead capture call to action <p> In Interact quizzes , the lead capture comes after the last question but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I always leave it optional ) . This ensures that the quiz takers full attention is on you , but since its not required you do n't  risk pissing anyone off . <p> It should be relevant to the quiz. - Its okay to tell people to enter their email to see their result , that 's intuitive . However , you should customize the text to say " Enter your email to see which Mutt You Are " instead of " Enter your email to see your results " its just more personal that way . <p> Add value beyond just the quiz results. - For Marleys Mutts , I know they send out updates when they rescue dogs and they have amazing stories of hope that people taking this quiz would be interested in . That 's why I added a note that says " Youll also get updates about our Rescue Dogs once a month " because that 's something of value outside of just seeing which dog you are . <p> Important note : I also always add a note about how often the person will be emailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Quiz Results <p> After the chance to opt-in , the user is then taken directly to their quiz results . I 'm always hyper-sensitive to this part because people take it really seriously . Its like a judgement on their life ( even though all you know about them is their answers to 7 questions ) . But you should see some of the angry comments people leave when they disagree with quiz results its not pretty ( see below for example ) <p> Positive , short , uplifting. - The best way I 've found to keep the results accurate but not end up with any of these nasty comments is to be positive . You can do this with all of your quiz results by focusing on the good things about a particular result while avoiding the bad . For example , someone who gets 0 correct on a business knowledge quiz could be told that they do n't  have any bad habits yet , instead of being told they suck . <p> Personalized links. - Since Marleys Mutts lives or dies by donations , I wanted to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takers . The simplest method for this was simply to provide a button for people to donate and help dogs like the one they were paired with . <h> Part 5 : Personalized follow-up through email <p> Immediate Thank-You Email. - I set up through Constant Contact to have " Thank You " emails sent out to quiz takers immediately after they opt-in . This helps re-affirm the notion of Marleys Mutts sending out emails . <p> Important Note : Interact now integrated with 412 other businesses through Zapier and direct integrations . <p> Messages personalized by personality. - Because you have to create multiple messages to personalize based on personality , the work becomes exponentially more every time you send out an email . However , if you reference the persons quiz personality throughout your messages that will really help them feel cared for and not just like another customer . <h> In conclusion : <p> I 'm starting to see really distinct patterns in what 's working for quizzes , this guide goes over my current progress , stay tuned for more updates in the future . If you 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Interact. -

Theyve created a wealth of knowledge and shared it with the world . They run off of a referral business model , meaning that they make money by helping their visitors find the right online and offline education sources to further their education beyond what Skilledup has to offer . For them , email marketing and list growth are both vital to success . <p> The Challenge : One of Skilledups best pieces of content is a guide to Microsoft Excel . If you 've had the unfortunate privilege of dealing with Excel , you know its not the easiest thing in the world to do . That 's why the guide to using Excel on Skilledup gets thousands of organic visits every month from people looking to learn how to use the program . The only problem is that despite all those visits , the Excel guide was generating very few leads and not really returning anything despite the enormous traffic it was generating . <p> The Solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Excel guide , Skilledup used an Interact quiz with lead generation enabled . What that means is that they created a quiz about Excel and connected it to their mailchimp email list and asked for quiz-takers to opt-in before showing them how they did on the quiz . What happened was incredible . In the first three months of running the quiz , it captured 1612 new email subscribers from only 3302 completions . <p> Solution Benefits : Beyond just adding new email subscribers to Skilledups database , the quiz garnered benefits of its own . Here are the top three . <p> It gamified content : Microsoft Excel is not interesting . Its actually the go-to reference people use when describing boring desk jobs . Adding a quiz to the guide turned some static boring content into something much more fun . <p> It helped foster the move to social : We cant ignore social traffic . There will come a day when Facebook and Twitter rival Google search as the top source of new leads . Quizzes are inherently share-able , and adding a quiz to the Excel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social world. - <p> It did n't  change the page : The quiz did change the page , but not in any negative ways . A lot of the traffic to this particular page was coming from Google searches of people trying to find information on using Excel , and adding a quiz did not affect that . The quiz did use the content that was already part of the Excel guide to formulate questions , but it did not erase anything that was already there . <p> Why it worked : - Skilledup turned their static content into a game , using Buzzfeed style methods . Prior to adding the quiz to the Excel manual , the page had over 10,000 words , but not one piece of interaction . All communication was one-way . Adding the quiz created a conversation mid-way through the content that made the page much more personal to every viewer . 
@@22713803 @2713803/ <h> 5-Step Checklist to Ensure Every Blog Post is Engaging <p> Just over 50,000 people have taken Interact quizzes to date , and trends are starting to emerge concerning which ones are truly interactive and which are n't  . While not every blog post is going to be a quiz , and it should n't be , there are certain guiding principles of engagement that apply across all content . <h> 1 . Does the post answer a pressing question ? <p> I like 500 Startups analogy of the vitamin vs. the antidote . A vitamin is nice to have , but an antidote is necessary to stop poison from spreading through your body that will kill you unless it is stopped . The quizzes that have been most successful are antidotes . While no case is as extreme as preventing death ( unless you are writing about that ) , the principle applies still . Here are a few examples of what we would consider to be antidotes . <p> Quizzes that worked : <p> - " Where are the Holes in Your Marketing Plan ? " answers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want ? " <p> - " Why Isnt your Budget Working ? " figures out why the user is n't able to save money like theyd like to . <p> - " What is My Writing Personality ? " helps the writer find their voice and be confident in it . <h> - 2 . Does it feel personal ? <p> Its not so much whether the topic applies directly to every reader as it is that the post must give off the vibe of being written for every reader . This one is more about knowing your audience than anything , the authors who have created the best content on Interact are the ones who have really learned who reads the content on their site . This goes beyond just interests and likes , into the realm of personality . If a site covers movies , the readers might be mostly middle-aged people from rural areas whose other - interests include hunting , fishing , and the outdoors . If you know this as a writer , your examples , stories , and persona will appeal to people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> - " What Kind of Natural Beauty are You ? " connected with the audience of a beauty blog that was also interested in green and toxin-free living . <p> - " Are You A Suitcase Entrepreneur ? " resonated with an audience that was business-savvy but also like traveling. <h> 3 . Is the tone conversational ? <p> Not conversational in the sense that lots of questions are asked , but rather a less formal tone . Its easy to hide behind big words and formal talk when discussing - a subject , but it was Ronald Reagan who said that if you cant explain something in laymans terms , you do n't  know it well enough . The formality must fit the audience , it would n't be appropriate to write in a story-telling style on CNET , but the quizzes we 've seen really draw engagement have been less formal overall . <p> Quizzes questions that worked : <p> - " I am aware of how to keep my personal information safe when surfing the internet " simple fill in the blank question and simple wording . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encryption , but did n't  . <p> - " Do you have a clear plan for how you will generate revenue ( i.e. , what you will sell , who you will sell it to , and how to reach them ) ? " Revenue is not a complicated subject , but the author still explains it , just to be safe . In a real-life conversation , if you werent sure if someone knew what revenue was , youd explain it too . <h> 4 . Is there room for an easy response ? <p> A quiz requires responses by nature , but its surprisingly easy to create them in a way that does n't  illicit a natural interaction . A call to action is important , but if every blog post has a strong call to action it can be off-putting to readers . Rather , make the theme of the post or quiz something that can be debated or answered . <p> Quizzes that worked : <p> - " What Kind of Beer is Right for You ? " Naturally leads the quiz-taker to ask why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Kind of Link Builder are You ? " Piques some curiosity and with well-placed links to read more opens the site up . <h> - 5 . Leave a chance for a sequel <p> Many great movies have sequels , a planned approach by the studio who was anticipating the success of the first movie . Great blog posts are the same way , if the topic really hits home , it leaves room for a follow up . <p> Engagement is a science as much as it is an art . There are principles that emerge over time with lots of testing that seem to guide interaction across the web . This simple checklist is a way to make sure the basics are covered . To sum it up , pick a topic that resonates with your crowd , answer a question , and leave room for further discussion .

@@22713805 @2713805/ <h> Adding custom fonts to your quiz <p> Today we are introducing five new font options for Interact quizzes . These fonts are available on all paid subscription plans , and they look great ! <h> 1 . Helvetica : The classic clean font <p> Helvetica was invented in Switzerland , I know , I 've been to the brown brick building which housed the design studio in which it was born . Being Swiss , its a very classic and proper font that plays nice in a lot of scenarios and does n't  really clash with anything . <p> This is a great font for E-commerce and content sites , especially since many of them use Helvetica in all their content . Using Helvetica will often allow you to nearly perfectly match the rest of your content with your quiz . <h> 2 . Ubuntu : The tech font <p> Ubuntu is that third operating system that is n't windows or apple , and is loved by developers and hipsters . The font named Ubuntu takes on the same characteristics as the operating system and works very well for tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope and uncovering new things . <h> 3 . Monteserrat : The fancy font <p> Monteserrat is an exotic island in the Caribbean , which is fitting for a fancy font . Its not crazy curly or anything , but like a caribbean island , this font is tastefully different . <h> 4 . Oswald : The strong font <p> Oswald sounds strong , and it is strong . This is a great font for entertainment sites , as it matches well with meme fonts and high contrast situations . This font looks great in moderation , but I would n't recommend it if your quiz has a lot of text . <h> 5 . Lora : The news font <p> I have no story for this one , which is ironic because this font is most commonly found in news settings .

@@22713809 @2713809/ <h> Stand out in a sea of content by going interactive <p> Think of interactivity like an extension of yourself . By creating interaction online , you are able to have short , scripted conversations with every prospect way more times than you could possibly talk with all those people in person . To squash a qualm real quick , the word " scripted " makes it sound like you are some sort of bot that spits out information to people without any sort of human element , which could potentially be worse than not saying anything . However , the football coach Bill Walsh used scripting to win five Super Bowls by using smart scripting , meaning that he had responses ready based on the situation his team was in . <p> With interactive content you can do smart scripting by having messages and content ready for your users based on the responses and scenarios they set up for you . <p> This is a lot of words and not a lot of pictures , which is the wrong ratio , so let 's work through an example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospective customers based on how they respond . <p> Our example comes from Afar Magazine , an excellent travel publication that did a big push for where to travel in 2015 using a quiz . <p> Afar built guides for each of 7 recommended places to go in 2015 , but the issue was that seven places all at once is sensory overload for most people , so interactivity was needed . <p> The quiz is aptly titled " Where Should YOU Go In 2015 ? " and is meant to draw in people interested in travel but not sure where to start . All you have to do in the quiz is decide what kind of food you want to eat and answer a few other questions that do n't  really feel like questions . Meanwhile , in the background , the quiz is calculating where you should go in 2015 based on how you answer the questions . <p> Just before the big reveal , Afar takes an opportunity to stay in touch with people who enjoy travel . See , Afar knows that anyone taking this quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips on traveling if people choose to opt-in . This is a targeted call to action , and targeted CTAs perform 43% better than non-targeted on average , and in our own tests , 50% of quiz takers choose to opt-in . <p> Okay , now we got through all that , on to the good stuff . So we were talking about scripting , and this is where that comes into play . My result is " Eat Your Way Across Osaka " and I get a nice description with that result which is based on how I answered the questions in the quiz . I also get a link to check out a guide on Osaka that goes to other content on the Afar site . All of this is based simply on how I corresponded with the quiz , but it feels personal . When there 's enough interaction in the content its completely possible to provide scripting that does n't  feel fake and effectively gets new readers and users in the door , beginning a relationship that can last for years . <p> If travel is n't your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example from Oxfam International , a non-profit that is working to reduce poverty and war around the world . ( P.S. we offer 25% off to non-profits , email sales@tryinteract.com for the deal ) . <p> Oxfam did an end of the year quiz much like a lot of content sites do , but its their strategy for creating the quiz that 's unique and noteworthy . If you 've heard of the skyscraper technique , what Oxfam did is a variation of that with some interactivity added in ( fancy , huh ? ) I 'll summarize here quickly . Basically the skyscraper technique is when you find content from around the web that has performed very well , using a tool like Buzzsumo , and then you make a better version of that content . What Oxfam did was search through their own top stories of the year and create a quiz out of them to see how well people remember the years events . <p> Each question represents one of the years top stories from the Oxfam site . The one below , for example , is derived from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new position . The beauty of using stories that were already popular is that you do n't  have to worry about whether or not people will care about your content , you know they care , you are just putting the content in a new format . <p> An added benefit to this is putting everything in a visual format . Quizzes are a very similar type of content to quizzes , but in a sequential and visual format . Given the continual success of list posts , its no surprise that quizzes have taken off . <p> Immediately after you answer the quiz tells you if you got the right answer or not . This builds in instant gratification , which makes the quiz like a series of trivia questions with a secret prize at the end . <p> The quiz is only 8 questions , which might seem short for an assessment , but it takes about two minutes to complete , which is a sweet spot for retaining peoples attention online . The quiz has done well , ending with 455 total social shares and more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of that is the distinct lack of work needed to create a quiz like this . - Really all that 's needed is to compile a list of the top articles on your site for a period of time and write a quiz question about each one . <p> One added benefit for this quiz is the natural lead-in to collecting information from their visitors . By including a link to sign up for the Oxfam newsletter , people who did n't  score very well ( or who did ) , can stay up to date so the next quiz that rolls around will be an easier challenge . <p> Interactivity simply means building content that anticipates the future and builds for it . The biggest benefit of interactivity is the ability to personalize parts of your website for visitors so they feel at home . Afar did this by using a quiz to lead visitors to a specific travel guide that matches their interests , and the same method can be used for a variety of applications where you have several assets . <h> You can create interactivity like is pictured in this article at tryinteract.com

Although theyve only done one so far ( and will hopefully increase that number this year ) , the quiz has done extremely well on social media . Its a college quiz , which is a somewhat evergreen topic , meaning that this quiz actually gets more views each week now than it did three months ago ( averaging about 3,000 new views each week ) . <p> What 's even better about this quiz is that is uses its interactivity to personalize Forbes content . Each different college match links out to a specific tool on the Forbes site so every person who takes and shares this quiz brings in more people who spend an average of three minutes taking the quiz and even longer checking out the recommended links from the results of the quiz . <h> 2 .

For me it was one of those moments where something you know about and enjoy ( in this case the movie " Jobs " ) , comes up at work and its really cool . I like that Simon &amp; Schuster took an innovative approach to marketing their books . They are n't  a young company and could have easily just stuck to traditional marketing avenues , but they took a step towards the future with these quizzes . <p> What they did has been replicated many times over with success every single time . Its the " Which ( blank ) are you ? " quiz format that realistically accounts for over half of all quiz traffic . For publishers of books , movies , TV shows , and really any content that has characters , this format is a go-to strategy . <h> 3 .

It was quite popular with the social channels and people enjoyed commenting on how they felt about the recommended places . <p> Afar teaches us a good lesson , which is that quizzes and lists go hand in hand , you can use a quiz to turn a list into an interactive piece and increase sharing by personalizing the items on a list . <h> 4 .

The thing about NPR is that they have local branches all over the U.S. so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in L.A. did a " Which burrito should you get ? " that helps you find a local Mexican food spot . <p> Even though quizzes like those ( locally relevant ) , limit the amount of people you can potentially reach , they also ensure that the people you do reach will actually care enough to take the quiz and pass it on . That 's something to definitely keep in mind with your quiz strategy , its not about how many people you could reach , its about how many people you can reach who will care . <h> 8 .

Picking a topic that works. - Quizzes can work for any industry , we 've had everything from Retail Brands to Hospitalsc build quizzes using Interact . The key to finding a topic that resonates is to understand who your audience is . Here are a couple of tips for how to do that . <p> Write the quiz for one person.Think of one person , a specific person who would really get a kick out of the quiz you are building . Are they a potential customer ? Would they share your quiz ? If you ca n't think of anyone who would like your quiz , then you might be doing the wrong thing . On the other hand , if you can think of one person , odds are there 's a lot of others just like that person . <p> Write for a very interested audience . There was a quiz made just for people living in Faequeir County , Virginia , a county with population of just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your overall audience is n't very large , if they are hyper-interested , you can create a quiz that gets healthy traffic . <p> 2 . Writing the quiz title. - Titles make a massive difference . The same piece with two different titles can see hugely different amounts of traffic . Quizzes are a bit different from typical posts because they are a one-to-one medium rather than an article where you are just talking to people . Given this advantage , here are a couple of quiz title templates that work very well . <p> The " Actually " Title : Here are two versions of one title . " How much do you know about Apple ? " or " How Much do You Actually Know About Apple ? " That one word changes everything . Instead of this being a boring knowledge test , it becomes a challenge to see how smart you are . <p> The Celebrity Personality Title : Again , here are two versions of a quiz : " What 's your personality ? " vs . " Which Celebrity is Most Like You ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but add in a celebrity and it becomes so much more intriguing . <p> Do you really ( blank ) ? For example " Do you really know how to fish ? " this one is again a test of knowledge , but it comes off as a personal assessment of how great you are . <p> Which ( blank ) are you ? " Which Cheese are You ? " or " Which Truck Are You ? " these quizzes are another version of the classic Meyers-Briggs personality quiz but with weird or odd objects super-imposed . <p> 3 . Creating your quiz questions. - The questions of a quiz are your opportunity to have a conversation with every single person who takes your quiz and build some chemistry so theyll feel a connection with your brand . Here are a few ways to seem more personable online and create those connections . <p> Speak like yourself ( but like your tipsy self ) . The internet is a place for blowing things a little bit out of proportion . We often turn to it out of boredom or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I 'm getting at with all this is that you should make your quiz questions fun to read and fun to answer . <p> Get very personal . We very much like to talk about ourselves . Make your quiz questions fit into that desire . Ask questions that make your quiz takers think . <p> 4 . Writing the quiz results. - The results of your quiz are where the magic happens ( the magic being when people share your quiz and drive traffic back to it ) . There are a couple of tricks to make this happen more often , here are the things we 've learned . <p> Use psychology to be positive . In a 2008 Harvard Article on positive psychology , they say that positive psychology involves positive emotions and personal strengths . Pick out the positive emotions and strengths of each result , no matter what it is , and focus on those . <p> Be honest . Positive psychology only works when its based in truth . As you can see below , even if you tell someone they are a cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and used . <p> 5 . Generating new leads ( optional ) . - Quizzes boast a 50% conversion rate , meaning that half of all people who finish a quiz will put in their email address to receive updates ( that number is averaged across 1000 quizzes weve run analytics on ) . Once again , there are some best practices to follow when doing lead generation for your quiz . <p> Make the offer relevant . One of our highest-performing quizzes of all time is one about Microsoft Excel . The quiz generates leads for a newsletter about Microsoft Excel , and the lead generation form asks if people would like to opt-in to learn more about Excel not bad . <p> Make a trade . You are asking for people to hand over their information , in return they will be expecting you to give them something . Make that something worth it . <h> - Three examples of quizzes in real life <p> 1 . ZGallerie <p> Zgallerie is a home furnishings brand with a loyal following . They created a quiz to help potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and its been a smash hit . People are in love with the brand , the quiz , and their results . <p> 2 . Forbes <p> Forbes has used Interact to create a college quiz for the last two years . This quiz gets 250,000 visits a year , and fuels a tool they 've created that helps you compare colleges . It has also led them to a #1 ranking for the term " college quiz , " a term that entire companies have been formed around . <p> 3 . Red Lobster <p> The Red Lobster created their most " liked " Facebook of all time using interact . Its the Shrimp Personality quiz you see below , and it racked up nearly 200,000 likes in a few weeks , a testament to the enormous power of quizzes . 
@@22713812 @2713812/ <p> The #1 problem I see with content is that it does n't  have any staying power . What I mean is that you hit " publish , " then do some promotions , list your new piece in forums etc . The first day or two you get some hits , and thencrickets . <p> Thats kind of contradictory to the whole point of content marketing , which is to build up an audience over time . Today were going to like at 47 different content ideas that last , meaning that theyll continue driving traffic long after the initial social spike . <p> TL:DR Evergreen content solves a problem or answers a question for the reader . There are lots of problems that remain consistent over time , and posts that help with those issues are evergreen . <h> #1 : Be a Journalist in Your Industry . <p> How this works : - Actually be an investigative journalist around your specific niche of the world . With brands becoming publishers we have a responsibility to report on things just like traditional publishing houses do . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself as an authority in the minds of prospects , and according to the 22 Immutable Laws of marketing , whichever brand establishes themselves as the thought leader ends up with the business . <p> Example : - A company called Flexport shows us exactly how this is done with their article on why Dole owns their own fleet. - Its a very interesting piece that interests anyone who lives near a port and sees giant " Dole " branded ships and trucks . ( The reason its interesting is because almost no other company has their own ships ) . The piece Flexport wrote is filled with facts and answers an interesting question about why Dole has branded stuff everywhere . <h> #2 : Interview an influencer in your field <p> How this works : - Asking questions of someone who has done well can reveal some very unique insights into specific processes that might not otherwise come to light . <p> Example : Kristi Kellogg did a great- interview with Rand- Fishkin- where she 's able to ask questions and get honest answers in real-time . Lessons learned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same path , and getting the opinion of someone who 's " made it " can make a difference . <h> #3 : History of your business/industry <p> How this works : - There are a lot of good stories wrapped up in the history of something , and you can tell that story to build yourself up in the minds of potential customers . Also , history tends to repeat itself if not learned from , so you can do your audience a favor by making sure they know what others have done in the past . <p> Example : - Build Direct created this awesome , long-form piece on the history of couches something we all use pretty much every day but think nothing about . Its an awesome article for anyone to read , and is great for anyone who is searching for terms around couches because Build Direct can help with all furniture needs . <h> #4 : Tools to Complete a Specific Task <p> How this works : - There are " stacks " of tools for completing many jobs from starting a blog to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list that covers all the bases , you take the difficulty of searching around for all the tools out of the issue . This is especially great if you can get on peoples radar right when they 're getting started . <p> Example : The Daily Positive set up this list of tools for starting a blog . I love this because it provides everything you need to actually get a blog set up and running . Its practical , helps the reader solve a specific task , and establishes you as an authority . <p> Results : 12,520 shares , Search ranking N/A <h> #5 : Best practices on a complicated topic <p> How this works : Just like a list of tools is essential for building something , there is also a best way to get the task done . By providing a list of best practices on how to get a job done , you can provide tremendous value and save your audience a ton of time on trial and error . <p> Example : Jimmy Daly at Vero create the most comprehensive list of email best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its really more like a book than a blog post , and that 's what makes it so useful . <h> #7 : Customer-Written Article : <p> How this works : - Its very powerful to get the perspective of someone who uses your product day-in and day-out , and they most certainly have a different take on it than you do as the company . Partnering up with your customers to create content is an excellent way to produce content that speaks to other potential customers , who are your audience . <p> Example : - This example is from Interact . We worked with one our customers , The Foundation , to produce a great article on how theyd used Interact + Facebook ads to generate leads . The piece gets into strategies behind Facebook advertising in general as well , which is what produced the ongoing results . <p> Results : 112 Social Shares , 50 visits a month <h> #8 : Extended FAQs Turned Into Content <p> How it works : There is something called the 10x rule when it comes to questions your prospects ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question , there are 10 more who have the same question but just havent asked or do n't  actually know theyd like the answer to the question . Extending FAQs into full , in-depth blog posts is a great way to capture the other 9 who do n't  reach out and ask . <p> Example : - Pardot created this great post- that answers some common questions around content marketing , they go beyond just one-sentence answers and actually explain why things work the way they do , it turned out well for them . <h> #9 : " Best Examples Of " List Must be Updated Annually <p> How it works : - When it comes to trying things for the first time , it can be exceptionally valuable to have some guidance on what 's worked in the past . That 's why posts showing the " best in class " for a particular subject are super valuable and long-lasting ( as long as you update them ) <p> Example : Every year Kapost , a content marketing software company , puts together a list of the top 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its an excellent resource for anyone to learn from because it highlights why these particular brands stand out in the world of content marketing . <h> #10 : Personality Quiz ( Socially Evergreen ) <p> How it works : Personality quizzes are what I call " socially evergreen " meaning that people share their results long after the content is published . To make one , just figure out how to categorize people within your product . For retail brands its " Which Product are You ? " for non-profits its " Which Social Justice Hero are You ? " you get the idea . <h> #11 : Knowledge Assessment <p> How it works : - There are important issue related to every business . Whether that subject is content if you 're a marketer or Iran if you 're a non-profit focused on helping entrepreneurs in Iran there are always going to be important issues attached to any company . To take advantage of the quiz format , create an assessment testing people on how much they know about one of your core issues . <p> Example : - A great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping social entrepreneurs in Iran . They created a quiz " How much do you Know about Iran ? " because that 's core to what they do and an on-goingly controversial topic . <h> #12 : Webinar on Your Products Core Value <p> How it works : The best way to describe this one is like a product video combined with a how-to , mixed with a bunch of free advice . Typically these webinars are an hour or longer , and really go in-depth , with more than enough time to provide really valuable tips to your audience . <p> Example : - Curata does a great job with this type of webinar . In this example , they talk through the whole genre of content marketing and give the low-down on what theyve learned . <h> #13 : Checklist for completing a task <p> How it works : Sometimes a task contains a lot of steps that need to be checked off before you can call it done . That 's where checklists come in these are super useful tools to have when working on more complicated projects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this website review template from WpCurve . They focus on wordpress help as a business and a checklist like this one is a perfect fit for people who are thinking about doing some work on their current online image . <h> #14 : Template for a complicated part of your day <p> How it works : We all have the more tedious tasks of the day . Whether its outlining your next blog post , setting up a social media calendar , or setting an employee schedule , these things have to get done and it would be nice if there was a framework for that which is why offering up a template for the more basic tasks in a day is the perfect way to create great content . <p> Example : WheniWork , a company that provides scheduling software ( among other things ) , put together a simple Excel template for scheduling all your employees . The template is almost a stripped-down version of their full product , and an awesome piece of content . <h> #15 : ( Subject ) Stats Must be updated annually <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain " of how popular apps and networks work is really fascinating and also pretty useful in a practical way . By putting together a really great list of stats you can help your target audience stay up to date and be the provider of information in their minds . <p> Example : Zephoria puts together lists of Facebook statistics for the public to view . Given that Zephoria does consulting to help people with Facebook marketing , that makes a ton of sense and is a great way to get in the eyesight of potential customers . <p> Quote from the writer ( added bonus of awesome info ) : <p> " To give you an idea we get close to 20K visitors per month from that one piece of content. - While the article does n't  itself produce a ton of new business it does help our remarketing efforts as well as helping us to more intelligently market our business. - To be candid , that one article has resulted in me hiring three new social media pros to our team . <p> The flip side is we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much traffic you have to adjust everything else so you get a realistic perspective on the value it is producing. - What Ive found to be really helpful is we also use VisualVisitor so we get an idea of the actual companies that are visiting our site and which ones we should be focusing upon . " Dan Noyes , Zephoria <h> #16 : Customer Case Study <p> How it works : - Partner up with one of your most successful customers and create a case study together . Its good for both of you because it acts as co-promotion , and its good for your prospects because they can get an insiders view of how your product works . To ensure that the post lives on , make sure to provide plenty of information around what kinds of tactics actually worked for the customer . <p> Example : - DOMO , an enterprise software company , created a great case study alongsidhe The Cliffs and shared it for the world to see ( not just sales prospects ) . <p> Results : N/A <h> #17 : Review Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often lead to people searching for " ( Tool name ) + review " and that 's an opportunity for your company to do some co-marketing . Write about how you use the popular tool , and potentially how it integrates with your business for an added bonus . <p> Example : - Ambitionally created a guide on how to use social media tool , Edgar- people searching for " Edgar Reviews " end up on the Ambitionally site and the name makes an impression . <h> #18 : Famous Historical Examples <p> How it works : - Any good service has been around for a really long time ( yes , even before the internet ) . Along the way are stories of successes in the industry that provide valuable insight . Compile those stories to built a great piece of content . <p> Example : - Customer service tool HelpScout created a great list of historical customer service stories that are an awesome guide for anyone looking to find customer service inspiration . <h> #19 : Self-Analysis Post <p> How it works : - The most powerful stories come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your business as you claw your way into existence . Writing a post about your successes ( or failures ) , is a great way to create engaging content that 's also very useful to others who might be going down the same path as you . <p> Example : - Appcues wrote a really actionable post about how they reduced subscriber churn by 50% and then shared all the details . <h> #20 : Email Course <p> How it works : - There are certain subjects ( like sales ) that are just way too broad to be covered in one post or video . That 's where the email course comes in usually a series of 7 to 20 emails over a few months that teach how to do something complicated . <p> Example : - Close.io does an excellent job with their email sales course , which is specifically designed for startups. <h> #21 : Best of ( year ) Must be updated annually <p> How it works : - Every year there is something new or crazy that happens in every business . Whether its the best sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockbusters , people love to see what was the best in any field . This is an easy opportunity for you to get involved and compile that list and establish yourself as the authority who understands the market well enough to put together such a list . <p> Example : - Witty Parrot compiled a great list of the top blog posts for 2015- by pulling together pieces on all aspects of marketing into one super long list of 100 posts . They did n't  create anything new , but rather simply compiled all of the best content already created . <h> #22 : Idea Generator <p> How it works : - One of the most frustrating parts of any job is the constant need for a fresh supply of ideas . If you can provide those ideas as a tool , you 're in a good spot . Now this does n't  need to be a full-blown tool that 's programmed to perfection it can simply be a spreadsheet or excel template with some logic built in . <p> Example : - Portent made a tool for finding blog post ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it spit back " Where Evergreen Content is Headed in the Next Five Years " which would actually make a pretty decent follow-up post to this one . <h> #23 : Beginners Guide <p> How it works : Creating a great beginners guide is all about simplifying things . Sure , there 's a ton to learn about every aspect of a business , but a beginners guide should just show what the aspects are , as the graphic above does for the world of marketing . <p> Example : Before Unbounce was Unbounce ( a content marketing powerhouse ) co-founder Oli Gardner created the noob guide to online marketing that is still getting visits and links today ( the first version launched in 2011 ) <h> #24 : Advanced Guide <p> How it works : - An advanced guide is much longer than a beginners guide , contains a lot of data and experiments , and is written to people who already understand an industry pretty well . I love advanced guides because they are typically very practical ( when done right ) , and you can implement what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sujan Patel created The Advanced Guide to SEO , which is broken into chapters its so long . That 's a good thing though , the guide ranks really high in Google and does an excellent job of teaching SEO. <h> #25 : Planner <p> How it works : Lots of things in life are cyclical , and the importance of staying consistent in those things is enormous . Sadly , its very easy to get lost in the noise and lose that consistency that is so key to success . That 's where planners come in , and when you can provide a plan for a specific task that is cyclical you 've got a really useful thing . <p> Example : For example , this blog planner- provides a way to make sure you stay on track with posting content to a blog , and its one of the most useful things you can do in content marketing ( in my experience ) . <h> #26 : Expert Roundup Must be updated annually <p> How it works : Certain questions come up every year " Where is our industry headed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ? " stuff like that . A post that aggregates the opinions of market experts is really valuable and lasting ( for one year at least ) . If you can make one of these curation posts a consistent part of your annual marketing , that 's a good thing . <p> Example : - Bryan Kramer put together a list of 2016 marketing predictions that pretty much covers all the possibilities of what might happen , really great resource . <h> #27 : Glossary <p> How it works : These posts typically target beginners to an industry , so be aware of that . However , by showing people what the jargon of an industry actually means , you can get in early and establish yourself as the authority who likes to help which is never a bad thing . <p> Example : Ignite Social Media put together a list of 32 marketing terms that might be confusing . They took those terms and turned them into plain english , which led to a really great post . <h> #28 : Best Books for ( Industry ) <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this earth , but there are so many that its quite difficult to decipher which ones are truly useful and which are kind of lame . If you put in the work and provide your audience with a list of books that truly provide value , that 's super useful . <p> Example : Linkedin created a great list of marketing books ( I 've read all of them , so I can vouch for it ) . The post ranks really well because it is truly helpful . <h> #29 : Post-Mortem ( for someone else ) <p> How it works : Competitors and partners might fail along your business journey . Any time that happens is a great opportunity to step in and analyze what went wrong while establishing yourself as the authority . Plus , people continue searching for the brand name even after its gone , so your article will show up in those results . <p> Example : Engollan consulting created a post-mortem on the startup Zirtual , which suddenly shut down in 2015 . Since Engollan has no stake in Zirtual , its an unbiased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause a startup to lose its way . <h> #30 : ( Competitor ) Alternative <p> How it works : When a company gets big enough , people will inevitably start searching for " ( Company ) alternatives " because they just want to see what 's out there . This represents an opportunity for you to jump in and be that alternative . Create a well-designed and in-depth comparison of your product against your competitor for a really solid content piece . <p> Example:This article , written by a marketing professional , goes into detail on how a startup was able to capture the attention of potential customers by targeting people searching for " Splunk alternative " ( Splunk is a well-known company , I guess ) . <p> Note : This one does not receive my personal endorsement . It does work , but its almost like you 're trying to pull the rug out from your competitors , which can create unnecessary bad blood . <h> #31 : A Training Plan <p> How it works : We all know the unfortunate reality that is training for success . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true quote . Unfortunately , we do n't  all know HOW to train for something . That 's where you can step in and provide a training plan for your audience free of charge . <p> Example : Hubspot created a training plan for becoming a better writer , its a 30-day plan , and when I think about it the plan is really similar to what my teachers had me to for learning writing . <h> #32 : How to Use ( complimentary tool ) <p> How it works : When car company Tata introduced the Nano ( worlds cheapest car at just $2,500 ) , they could n't just let people order online because they were selling in rural India . Instead they had to educate people on how to get a drivers license , how to sign up for insurance , and how to get a loan . None of those things are technically Tata products , but by adding them to the offering as add-ons , they were able to sell a lot more cars . <p> The same story is true of any product , you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overall scheme of things , and you can do that by providing a simple guide on how to use a complimentary product . <p> Example : Mallory Lee , VP of Marketing at Bluebridge , a company that creates mobile apps , understood the need to educate customers on all things marketing , so she created a great guide to running Pardot campaigns . <p> Results : 168 social shares , search rank N/A ( posted on Linkedin ) <h> #33 : Your Own Success Story <p> How it works : If you 've had any level of success , you know it does n't  happen by accident . Its hard work and lots of mistakes , which lead to a few wins that slowly add up into eventual growth . That tough journey holds all sorts of life lessons that you can share in the form of a post and help others who are on the same journey not to repeat the same mistakes you made . <p> Example : - Alex Turnbull at Groove has built his business by sharing what his company learns along their path to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what it was like to go from $0 to $30k a month in revenue . Its really informative and honest , and has been one of my reference points in growing Interact . <p> Results : 622 social shares , search rank N/A <h> #34 : Complimentary Products Comparison <p> How it works : Being partnered up with other companies gives you a unique view into how those partners operate . You know better than most people how each company is set up , who they are best equipped to serve , and how easy the company is to engage with . Putting that information into a post is a great way to help out your audience while creating awesome content . <p> Example : The Sales Lion helps companies work on their sales strategies , and one big part of modern sales is marketing automation . Thus , The Sales Lion created a comparison- of the top marketing automation companies and went really in-depth on each one to provide value for customers who might be trying to make the decision on which platform to use . <h> #35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works : You use the scientific method you had to begrudgingly learn in 8th grade and you test a hypothesis you have about your world . <p> Example : I set up an experiment to see which kind of image got the most clicks out of a social media feed , and it turned out to be pretty popular over time ( for my standards ) , and its also just an awesome resource in general . <h> #36 : Holiday Strategies Must be Updated Annually <p> How it works : There are opportunities for specialized marketing that makes a long-term impact around the holidays . By creating a guide for your audience to follow and take advantage of holiday marketing , you put yourself in a position to be really helpful , and if your company also sells marketing products or services , that works perfectly . <p> Example : Sugar Spun Marketing created this super awesome guide- for building a holiday marketing strategy , and while its not a smash hit all at once , it will continue to be popular as long as its updated each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - No matter what topic you think of , there are probably already a myriad of content pieces related to that topic online . You can be more useful to your audience by compiling those resources than by creating your own ( sometimes ) . <p> Example : Uberflip did the work for us and compiled this list of B2B Lead Generation Strategies . <h> #38 : List of resources for customers to use for creating their own content <p> How it works : Creating content is hard . You have to be creative and calculated all at once and if you settle for average you 'll just get lost in the noise . That 's where you can come in and make the whole process easier by providing a list of resources for one part of content ( titles , formatting , images , etc . ) <p> Example : - Bootstrapbay created a very comprehensive list of free stock image sites and won a massive chunk of traffic because of it . <h> #39 : How to spend your first $1,000 on ( strategy ) <p> How it works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are spending money on that strategy its especially scary . If you can put together a very detailed guide on how to spend the first $1,000 on a new strategy , then you put yourself in a very consultative position , from which you can recommend tools ( including your own ) in the future . <p> Example : - Ryan Luedecke created this great guide for how to get started with Reddit ads , and it certainly has the detail needed for being super useful . <h> #40 : Before/After Post <p> How it works : The before/after format is extremely popular in any business . Its best known in the world of fitness , but it can be used for a website redesign , a blog format update , or an SEO overhaul . The key is to document your process and the results to show others how they can accomplish the same thing . <p> Example : - Impact Branding and Design company ran a test on their own blog to increase conversions to subscribers , and did an excellent job of showing the before/after. <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> How it works : - You become an expert by going really deep in one area . What you have to share in regards to that area is very useful to anyone who has time to listen . If you go out and recruit those experts , then get them to share their knowledge on their area of deep expertise you 've got a great piece . <p> Example : - Sean from Growth List interviewed Neil Patel on how to build a personal brand ( Neils deep-seated area of knowledge ) , and shared that interview with the world . <p> Results : 68 social shares , search ranking N/A <h> #42 : What the top ( blank ) all have in common <p> How it works : One of the very most useful blog posts I read this year was about what all the top business blogs have in common . The reason it was so helpful was because I could see the trends that are pervasive through each blog and adapt those to my own work . A good post in this category contains some data analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exceptionally useful . <p> Example : Hubspot published this post- that covers all the things successful business blogs have in common , from post length to sharing frequency and all sorts of other stats. <h> #43 : How to do ( task ) for free <p> How it works : - Pretty much every rational person would prefer to do something for free over paying for it to be done . However , there 's almost always a trade-off where figuring out how to do something for free takes time , and time is money . Therefore , if you create an article on how to do something that usually costs money for free you provide value . <h> #44 : Year in review must be updated annually <p> How it works : - Throughout the year , document your big wins and losses , the " oh shit ! " and " aha " moments that stick out as really memorable moments . Then compile those into a list at the end of the year , this will help others who might be having some of the same issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first year in review for 2014 , and its an excellent piece because it dives into which initiatives worked out for them . <p> Results : 539 shares , search ranking N/A <h> #45 : Unbiased review of software in your space <p> How it works : No one lives on an island anymore . What I mean is that your business probably cant survive without partners who compliment what you do . Working with those partners gives you a unique insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each , and a write-up with your insider knowledge is very valuable to anyone evaluating those softwares . <p> Example : Dearblogger works with a lot of hosted blogs , so they compared all of the possible ways you can set up a blog and gave an honest assessment of each . This is very useful if I 'm trying to decide what platform I want to use for my blog. <h> #46 : People to follow in ( industry ) Must be updated annually <p> How it works : - There are people in every vertical who are just a few steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people you want to follow , but its not always the easiest to identify who they are . That 's where your opportunity for evergreen content comes in , compile the top influencers in your industry and offer that as a piece for anyone to reference . <p> Example : - Nectafy curated this great list of 21 marketers to follow on Twitter . The piece is just plain useful to anyone looking to get marketing news from those on the cutting edge . <h> #47 : Top sites to learn ( subject ) <p> How it works : - This one is simply a matter of you doing the work for your customers . Instead of making them dig through the internet to find the best resources for learning something new , you do that and create a simple list to learn from . <p> Example : - Vertical Response but together a list exactly like that with resources to learn about SEO , and it compiles all the best content for learning SEO into one place- simple but useful .

@@22713815 @2713815/ <h> How do quizzes work ? This post explains it all <p> Quizzes can do amazing things . Drive traffic , generate new leads , increase your social presence just to name a few . Here are Interact we get lots of queries from marketers who have heard about these great things but want to know how it all works . Quizzes are not the most simple form of content , they are probably the most complicated to be honest . In this post Il be answering some of the big questions about the basics of quizzes namely how the scoring system works , how you go about embedding quizzes into a website , and how quizzes get shared through social media . <h> Part 1 : How the whole scoring thing works <p> One of the most difficult parts of quizzes is setting up a scoring system that works . Spoiler alert quizzes ( specifically with personality quiz remember when Ellen did n't  get herself on a queen of comedy quiz ? ) Even so , here 's a quick explanation of how the scoring works . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing the different personality types . Once you 've got them created , its time to create the questions . For each question there will be several answers . Each answer will add one point to a different personality type . At the end of the quiz , the personality type that got the most points will get shown . <p> For example . <p> My different results are : <p> -Lion <p> -Tiger <p> -Cheetah <p> Question 1 is : <p> How fast can you run ? <p> A. Basically the same speed as a bullet ( cheetah ) <p> B. Not that fast , but I can still beat you up ( lion ) <p> C. Pretty fast , but I also have the reflexes of a cat ( tiger ) <p> Each question in the rest of the quiz would be set up like question one , and at the end whichever big cat got the most points from answers would get shown as the result . here 's what that will look like when its all said and done . <p> Scored quizzes ( definitive answer ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in school ( but hopefully that are n't  so dang difficult ) . The scoring for these is much simpler . Each question has several answers , and one of those answers is correct . When you are creating the quiz , all you have to do is check the box for whichever answer is right . <p> The results will display a score as well as which answers you got right and wrong ( that parts optional ) Check out an example below . <h> How they get onto your website <p> The next part of quizzes that gets confusing is how you go about embedding them into your site . If you 've worked with wordpress to a large extent or done work with embed codes before , disregard this section if not , welcome . <p> To help paint the picture of what 's happening when you add a quiz to your site , let me explain what 's actually going on . When you embed a quiz on your site , its actually taking a web page that 's hosted on our servers and adding it into the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant take over your site or anything weird like that ) . <p> So what happens is you grab a piece of code that looks like the one below , then copy and paste it into your site as html . In wordpress , you press the " text " button at the top of the post or page builder , and most content management systems will have an option to copy in html . <h> How they get shared on social media <p> Unless you 're not on Facebook ( I applaud your effort if you are n't  ) , you 've seen someone posting quiz results that look like this . <p> These quizzes have officially infested social media , if there existed a task force for social media pandemics , now would be the time to call on them . The " secret " behind why these quiz results get shared so dang much is much simpler than you 'd think . Really there are two reason ; first , each result is specifically about the quiz taker and we like sharing things that are about us , it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets shared , it also encourages other people to go and take the quiz themselves since the quiz title is like a self-contained call to action . <p> Setting this up when you create your quiz is really simple , what ends up getting shared goes like this " I got ( my result ) ( title of the quiz ) " all you have to do is come up with clever ways to name your results . <p> So that 's it , I did my best to answer some questions that I get asked a lot . Hopefully this cleared some things up for you about how quizzes work and you 'll be able to get up and running with your own quizzes soon .

@@22713818 @2713818/ <h> What the top 100 most viewed interact quizzes all have in common <p> The top 100 Interact quizzes have been viewed more than 5 million times . They average over 50,000 views ( compared to the overall Interact average of 600 ) . These are truly the " cream of the crop " and each and every one of these quizzes was meticulously constructed to maximize its impact . <p> Today I 'm going to share a few of the things that all of these quizzes share in common that contribute to their success . <p> Here are seven things all the top quizzes do that you can copy . <h> 1 . Hyper-focused <p> It seems ironic that the quizzes reaching the largest audiences are also the most focused with their topics . Your natural assumption is to think that heavily popular quizzes have mass appeal ( and I do it to ) . The reality , however , is that all of the top 100 have very narrow focus and their potential audiences are not huge . <p> Take for example this truck quiz below , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that services big rig trucks . I love this quiz because it shows that literally any kind of quiz can become popular if it really speaks to a particular audience . Big Rig truck drivers and service people are not a massive audience by any metric , but because this quiz speaks so directly to them it reached high saturation in that market . <h> 2. 70% are personality type <p> Personality quizzes are a distinct departure from traditional academic quizzes , and I think that 's a big part of the reason why they flourish . 70 out of the top 100 are personality type quizzes . What I think is interesting about these personality quizzes is the wide variety of industries they come from . There 's everything from political satire like the quiz pictured below to elephant pants , and each quiz is crafted to be a personality type . <p> One thing to think about with your quiz is seeing if it fits into a personality type template . I talk with customers who are dead-set on doing a traditional ( maybe , sometimes , always ) format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  appear AT ALL in the top 100 quizzes . If you are working with an old quiz that 's being renovated to be put online or you are set on using out dated formats , consider converting it into a personality type quiz , the results will be pleasant . <h> 3. 50% have people on the cover photo <p> This point is actually the subject of an entire scientific study we did here at Interact . Basically what it boils down to is that pictures of people on cover photos of quizzes perform very well ( outperforming the average by 50% ) . Interestingly , only half of the top 100 have people on the cover , but that by far outperforms the next most prevalent type of image ( cars come in second place at 2% ) <p> If you need help finding images that you can actually use without being slapped with fines , check out our list of stock images sites that are completely free and actually have good images . <h> 4. 75% of all traffic is from social <p> This is probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends bragging on Facebook and Twitter about their latest quiz result . Perhaps what is surprising about this point is just how many people get involved in this sharing of quiz results . Weve seen everyone from official Israeli Embassy accounts to State Governors tweeting out quiz results . <p> The thing you can learn from this one is that sharing should be your strategy from the start . I 've got a nice graphic below that shows the ideal way to share and promote a quiz to maximize your ROI , and you can follow it by embedding a quiz into your website and then pointing the links back to the page where the quiz is embedded ( all possible with Interact ) . <h> 5 . The designs are highly customized <p> There are ten editable design elements on Interact quizzes , and the average quiz in the top 100 has 5 of those elements customized . The average for all other quizzes is 3 elements . Based on my experiences with quizzes , I would say this is at quizzes edited to match the rest of your brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styling from us . <p> This points back to your brand continuity , if you can successfully integrate quizzes into your overall marketing strategy rather than having them stick out as somehow different , that builds trust and also allows the quiz to piggyback on the trust people already have with your brand . In other words , custom-designed quizzes are n't  popular because they are custom , but because they have been designed to look like the rest of your content . <h> 6. 90% have image questions <p> I 've got nothing for this one , just look at the question below and I think you 'll understand why image questions perform well . Visual content outperforms non-visual content by a statistically significant 18% on twitter and by an even larger margin on Facebook , images are king . <p> One thing I have to say here is to make your images relevant and the right size . I 've seen too many quizzes sabotage their own success by using stretched or cut off images that also have nothing to do with the original question . Follow the image guidelines on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have images in the results <p> This one has to do with the previous point about social traffic . When someone shares a quiz result on Facebook , the picture that 's in that result comes with it . As we discussed in the last point , this leads to a lot more clicks on those social posts . <p> However , if quiz results do n't  have an image in them , the social share defaults to sharing the cover photo . While this is n't bad , its not nearly as personalized as when you have images in the quiz results themselves . <p> Have an image in each quiz result , make it relevant , and make it quality . 
@@22713820 @2713820/ <h> 10 online quiz examples that won the social sharing game <p> In many ways , getting social shares for your content is like a game . There 's a certain amount of strategy involved , but also some luck because there is n't a way to " guarantee " that your quiz will end up getting shared . At Interact , some of our customers have been fortunate enough to crack the code on the social sharing game , let 's check out what they did . <h> 1 . " Which famous golfer are you ? " By Golfnow . <h> Views : 10k <h> Social Shares : 1.5k <p> This quiz uses simplicity to its advantage . The most common form of quiz is the " Which ( blank ) are you ? " quiz , and that formula can be applied to almost any industry in this case golf . Honestly I think this was just a matter of taking advantage of an opportunity . The GolfNow blog has a strong following , but in my search I did n't  see any quizzes before this one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takeaway here is to give quizzes a try , and I 'm not just saying that because I work at a quiz business . Quizzes have regained some mojo recently and many sites created in the last five years have never run a quiz before . Give it a try and you might just nail it like GolfNow. <h> 2 . " How much do you know about Iran ? " By Berim <h> Views : 15k <h> Social shares : 2k <p> This quiz blew up in a day , and at one more there were more than 2500 people taking it at the same time . A good portion of those quiz takers went on to become sharers , continuing to grow the reach of the piece . I would attribute a lot of those social shares to the controversial nature of the quiz content . The questions highlight the fact that western nations do n't  really know much about the nation of Iran , and yet we are quick to judge . <p> Takeaway . Quizzes have the unique ability to highlight peoples knowledge . An article can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already know . Use this to your advantage and stir up controversy because controversy leads to more social shares . <h> 3 . " Which cake are you ? " By Food 52 <h> 25k views <h> 5k shares <p> I always like highlighting Food52 quizzes because the food website has created a new quiz every week for about six months now and every single one is brilliant . The way they constructed this cake is special because it uses existing content in an effective way . What the editors did was pick five cake recipes that were already up on the site and popular , and the construct a quiz helping people determine which one they are . The result was a massive amount of social sharing , with people really enjoying it my favorite one read something like " Guys , just made a breakthrough discovery , I am Lemon Cake ! " <p> Takeaway . Use existing success to build more success . If you have articles or products on your site that are popular , make a quiz to help people decide which one they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to what you know already works . <h> 4 . " Which studio c character are you ? " By BYUTV <h> Views : 65k <h> Shares 11.2k <p> Studio C is a BYU production with a loyal following . Their character quiz remains one of their top social posts of all time . The quiz itself asks a series of questions before telling people which character they are most like , and quiz takers loved sharing their results . One out of every six people who took the quiz ended up sharing on Facebook or Twitter and the conversations that ensued were hilarious . <p> Takeaway . A lot of businesses revolve around people . Whether its a TV show , a book , a radio show , or the News , there are lots of ways to make quizzes helping people find out which person they are usually with awesome results . <h> 5 . " Which car brand are you ? " By ViewsBank <h> Views : 17k <h> Shares 3.5k <p> As a big car fan I 'm glad this quiz was made and is successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveys , the quiz is exactly what it claims to be , and tells you what brand of car you are . I think it was successful because people have strong feelings about cars and choose to invest a lot of money in buying their favorite brand . Thus , whether or not they get their favorite brand as a result they will have something to say about it . <p> Takeaway . Focus on what people care about . Even if you think your business does n't  directly pull heartstrings or illicit any kind of strong feelings , odds are you at least indirectly deal with something important . <h> 6 . " What kind of operator are you ? " By Warrior Lodge <h> Views : 90k <h> Shares 15k <p> Everyone dreams of being an action hero at some point , so why not make a quiz to decide what kind you 'd be ? That 's what Warrior Lodge did , and it worked out pretty well . The quiz currently has 90k views and gets an additional few hundred social shares every week consistently its what youd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think the " secret sauce " here is using pop culture as a draw . We are familiar with all the results of this quiz through media and movies , which primes us to share our results . <p> Takeaway . Tap into popular culture . When we feel like we can identify with a quiz result it leads to more social shares . <h> 7 . " Are you an android person or an iphone person ? " By Eldeforma <h> Views : 37k <h> Shares 7.5k <p> Spanish site Eldeforma makes a lot of quizzes with Interact , but one in particular that caught my attention is this android vs. iphone quiz . It was released the day after Apples new iphone announcement and got thousands of social shares within a few weeks , continuing to get views today . <p> Takeaway . Use public events to your advantage . I do n't  know exactly how popular this quiz would have been if it werent aligned with the Apple announcement , but I know it would n't have been the hit it was . Keep track of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new opportunities emailed directly to you . <h> 8 . " Find your perfect ( college ) match " By Forbes <h> Views : 78k <h> Shares : 15.5k <p> College is a big deal , and Forbes is here to help , and get more social traffic . This quiz that guides students toward a type of college they should attend gets almost all of its traffic from social shares and continues to grow in popularity even months after launching . I think this quiz did so well because it does n't  try to be overly specific . Instead of telling students one college they should attend ( out of the 100 's that exist ) , it gives a recommendation about the type of school that would be a good match and then includes a link to check out a list of schools that would work . <p> Takeaway . Do n't  try to do too much with your quiz . If you do n't  get overly specific , you can make each result seem to be more accurate and you wont risk losing credibility by giving people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of environmentalist are you ? " By Grist <h> Views : 50k <h> Shares : 13k <p> When this quiz was released it was not without controversy . Staunch environmentalists were off-put by some of the more goofy results when they came up , and they let it fly in their social shares and comments . However , that was n't a bad thing . What happened was a lot of people ended up sharing the quiz and commenting , skyrocketing the views . <p> Takeaway . No need to hold back . Obviously be careful and make sure you are n't  alienating core readers or customers , but sometimes it takes a little prodding to get a quiz going . <h> 10 . " Which ZTA founder are you ? " By ZTA Fraternity <h> Views : 11k <h> Shares : 4k <p> Some organizations have great pride , and I 'd consider fraternities a leader in that category . That 's why this ZTA fraternity quiz became so popular overnight . Current fraternity members were excited to find out which founder they were and post their results to twitter and Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are curious about what 's happened before , so why not work that into a quiz ?

@@22713827 @2713827/ <p> I must preface this article by saying that the quiz being discussed called " What kind of difficult woman are you ? " is completely ironic , and actually launched on International Womens day . I think the following conversation shows pretty decently that it is not meant to be derogatory in any way . <p> It started when I logged into Google Analytics on March 5th , 2015 . There was a particular quiz URL that was getting some strong activity . Nothing too special , I 'd seen it a hundred times before , but nonetheless still interesting . I took note of the URL and moved on with my day . <p> The next morning something amazing happened , traffic to that quiz URL began to slowly rise until it broke through the glass ceiling and exploded , getting thousands of simultaneous hits . I was taken aback , I 'd seen this kind of thing before , but never in such a close manner and never with such voraciousness . By the end of the day on March 7th , two days in , the quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was the definition of virality . Each person who shared the quiz brought their friends back to the quiz and for every person who viewed the quiz , they brought back more than one person with them . <p> Now here are the stats on the quiz . All of this happened in about four days , with the majority of the traffic and shares happening in the first two days. - <p> I then did some digging into the social stats to see what kind of breakdown there was amongst social networks , and I also used Open Site Explorer to check how many backlinks the quiz had brought in . <p> Social share stats : <p> The vast majority of shares ( like 98% ) came from Facebook . This is typical of what wed expect on a quiz that goes viral . <p> Backlink stats : <p> The quiz has 14 brand new links . The page authority has n't  yet risen because its too soon to make that calculation , but this is still remarkable . ( Side note : its nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you want to build a sustainable publishing brand , quizzes need to have a staying power that can be provided by SEO traffic . Some quizzes actually get more traffic AFTER their viral spike than during like this one from Forbes ) . <h> Timeline : <p> March 5th 11:31 pm : Quiz posted on DailyLife <p> The quiz was embedded inside a page on DailyLife.com.au- which is smart for a couple of reasons . First , when people share the quiz , traffic will go back to this page and DailyLife will get some healthy ad revenue . Second , it provides a built-in attribution system instead of taking this quiz and wondering where it came from , you know the source and build familiarity with the brand . <p> March 5th : 11:55 pm : Quiz posted on DailyLife Twitter <p> The quiz was posted with the #IWD2015 ( for international Womens day 2015 ) . Its hard to say what role this # played in the success of the quiz ( I would guess not very much , because Twitter accounted for a small portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 6th 10:00 am : View count = 8,000 <p> This datapoint was extraordinarily interesting to me . The official DailyLife twitter share accounts for a very small percentage of the overall traffic to this quiz . ( note that they did n't  even share it on their business Facebook page ) . <p> March 6th 12:00 pm : Twitter and Facebook start to explode with sharing . <p> This is where things get really interesting . I had read in the past that virality occurs when a lot of normal people share the same thing in a short period of time . This was definitely the case with this quiz . Below is a screenshot of the biggest influencers who shared the quiz , the top sharer only has 17,000 followers , not exactly mind-blowing numbers . <p> March 6th 11:59 pm : View count = 80,000 <p> At the end of the first full day , over 80,000 people had taken the quiz . I noticed an interesting pattern during the day as the quiz swelled with views . The spike started with a lot of people sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first . Then , after a couple of hours the view count would shoot up as people who were reading through newsfeeds and saw others quiz results began to click through and take the quiz . <p> March 7th 7:00 am : A lull <p> Things started to slow down and it looked like the end for this quiz . It looked like the spike had come and gone . Activity slowed down and people went away . <p> March 7th 11:00 am : A resurgence <p> The rise started slowly , with just a few shares , and then it broke open again . The resurgence started much the same way as the initial spike , where at the beginning there were nearly as many people sharing the quiz as there were people taking the quiz until the views began to catch up and speed past the shares . <p> March 7th 11:59 pm : View Count = 122,000 <p> By the end of day two the quiz had reached over 122,000 people . This was extraordinary . In just over two days a quiz had skyrocketed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of Green Bay , Wisconsin ( where the Packers play , I 'm a football fan ) . <h> What we learned about virality <p> When Daily Life posted and shared the quiz , it got what I would imagine is a normal amount of traffic for an article they write ( about 8,000 views its a pretty good website ) . However , what happened after that is what I find fascinating . Droves of normal people started sharing the quiz to their 50 or 100 followers . It did n't  take a famous person or a huge initial audience to get this quiz going , it took the power of the crowd to give it the boost it needed to go viral . <p> Now what does this mean for your brand making quizzes ? I think it means you need to know what your average reader cares about . Even if you do get some famous person or big brand to share your quiz , it will make a short-term and nearly unidentifiable difference in the overall traffic of the quiz . What you really need is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their friend group to get the traction needed to launch a viral quiz . <p> The quiz pictured in this article was made with Interact , the best solution for brands to create quizzes , check it out a tryinteract.com 
@@22713829 @2713829/ <h> Top 10 Quizzes of 2014 <p> 2014 was ridiculous for Interact , from the first quiz being built in April to seeing more than 1 million quiz views in November , it was a wild ride . We are extraordinarily grateful to the great businesses who used our service to build amazing content , and I wish I could list every single one , but I 'm limited to the top ten . <p> I 've chosen the top ten based on overall views , which I think is a vanity metric that 's pretty meaningless . However , I 'm proud to say that each of these quizzes did an excellent job of using well-placed calls to action to create tremendous value . <p> Let 's take a look at how these quizzes combined for more than 1 million total views . <h> 10 . BioLite : 19,000 views <p> There were a lot of quizzes in this range of views , but I chose this one because its both an E-commerce quiz and a lead generation quiz . Also they make an excellent product . Biolite is a camp stove that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can charge devices like flashlights while out in the wilderness . Its pretty darn cool . <p> They made a quiz " What would you do with ten watts ? " that does two things . <p> 1 . Collect email subscribers . Given that Biolite is one of those products where you would pick one up for an outdoorsy friend at the last minute for a birthday or Christmas , its quite useful to have a strong email list you can remind about Biolite at key times . This quiz uses the Interact lead generation feature to collect <p> 2 . Have a good follow-up . Think with me for a second . When someone finishes your quiz they are pretty curious . Youve just given an assessment on their life based on some rather personal questions . This is a tender moment , and as the quiz taker I 'm very curious to know more about this judgment on my life . Okay , back to reality what I 'm really saying is that you should include follow-up links in your quiz results . Biolite does this well by recommending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are shown . <h> 9 . Rachael Ray Show : 27,000 views <p> My coworker Matt never cares about big name customers . Ill be like " hey Matt , The United Nations just signed up " and hell be like cool . However , when I told him that Rachael Ray had made a quiz , it was a different story , there was much yelling and running around the room involved . That 's the power Rachael has , everyone from a tech startup guy to my grandmother loves her and she 's an icon of Food Television . <p> When you 're one of the best , you constantly have to move forward to avoid losing ground to competitors , and quizzes are one of the ways Rachael is accomplishing that forward motion . This quiz in particular was a compliment to her daily show . Its titled " What type of clutterer are you ? " and was published the same day she had an organizing expert on her show . It was extremely popular and had thousands of likes and comments . <p> I 'm gon na go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to her success . I do n't  know about you , but when I 'm watching TV I usually have my phone or tablet in hand . I 'm either answering emails or chatting online or something . However , if I 'm the TV shows producers that sucks because I 'm not getting my audiences full attention . However , if you add a quiz to the mix that can be taken online while watching the show , you re-capture that persons full attention . Part of the reason TV still rules the advertising game is because of how much attention we pay to it , and by adding quizzes to TV shows , you still get the full attention of your audience . <h> 8 . StyleCraze : 50,000 views <p> The only entrant on our list that used the Facebook embed feature , this quiz is simple . I say simple because I usually recommend that customers make their quizzes very specific , but in this case a broad quiz was very successful . <h> 7 . Hostelworld : 52,000 views <p> You know those posts where its titled something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " we all have clicked on one at some point or another , its okay . This quiz from HostelWorld could be the subject of one of those posts . It has one of the most indisputable cases for virality Ive ever seen . here 's the deal , HostelWorld has run two quizzes , the one pictured below , and another one about travelling technology . This quiz has 52,000 views and averages about 1,000 new visits each week ( from search and social ) . The other quiz ( which was posted and promoted in exactly the same way by the same company ) only has about 3,200 views . <p> While 3,200 is no slouch for a blog post , the first quiz still got about 13 times as much traffic . This is the point where I should tell you what made this quiz so special , and there are a few things I can tell you . <p> -Use a lot of pictures : One big difference between the two quizzes is that the more popular one has a lot more pictures ( especially of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of traveler are you ? " is a personal and controversial question for people who use HostelWorld ( I know , I 'm one of them ) . The reason being that the type of people who stay in hostels consider themselves to be more travel-conscious and citizens of the world , challenging with this quiz topic is smart . <p> Check out the actual quiz to see just how much fun it is. <h> 6 . Studio C : 65,000 views <p> Its a surreal moment when a friend posts a quiz on Facebook and you click the link to find its one that was created using your product . The first time this happened , it was due to Studio C and their quiz prowess . They created a personality quiz for their TV Show to tell audience members which character they were , and the results were brilliant . Within minutes there were thousands taking the quiz , and the quiz continues to get views through search engine rankings and social shares . <p> Side note : This quiz was actually created by an agency who works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a few pats on the back . <h> 5 . Red Lobster Endless Shrimp : 86,000 views <p> This quiz is one of The Red Lobsters most " liked " Facebook posts ever , like since Facebook has existed . ( its actually the most liked I could find after spending much too long scrolling through every single post but in consideration of my possibly overlooking a post or two I 'll say one of the most ) . Its got 119,000 likes so far and is n't done living its life . <p> How , you ask , does it only have 86,000 views ? My guess is that our view counter pulled a YouTube- and could n't keep up with the influx of traffic , but that 's okay because the results still rolled in for Red Lobster . <p> This quiz was used as part of the marketing strategy for the annual Red Lobster Endless Shrimp promotion , and was one of three key Facebook posts that really drove the social strategy . If nearly a quarter of a million likes and 25,000 comments are any indication , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lodge : 93,000 views <p> The epitome of the long tail quiz , this one from Warrior Lodge has the most consistent traffic of any quiz Ive seen yet . When someone asked Buzzfeeds editor how she decided to start running a lot of quizzes , she mentioned that she started to notice quizzes getting a lot of trailing traffic ( long after the initial social push ) . This quiz from Warrior Lodge fits that mold . <p> Warrior Lodge is a site funded by advertising revenue , so this continued traffic is a big deal . Also , given that the quiz has an average on-page time of 3:08 , that 's some pretty valuable traffic . <h> 3 . Forbes : 105,000 Views <p> Go to Google and search for " college quiz " Go ahead , I 'll wait here . If you actually did it , the first article that comes up is from Forbes , with a quiz titled " Find your perfect Match " built using Interact . Now " college quiz " and its contemporaries are not easy terms to rank for . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a quiz , and yet they are all being outranked by this quiz that was built in about a week . <p> Because this is a popular term , it gets searched for 2,400 times each month , meaning that the Forbes quiz continues to get thousands of views each month with no further promotion beyond its initial creation . <p> Forbes has an advantage because they run a smart ad system , so each of those visits has a dollar sign attached to it in and of itself . However , if people just came and took the quiz then left , that would only be about 3 minutes of on-site time , which is n't great . That 's why the writers added personalized links to each quiz results that point to other Forbes pages . For example , if someone is recommended <h> 2 . Anonymous Greek Website : 387,000 views <p> I included this one because it exemplifies perfectly the power of quizzes ( and its in the top 10 ) . Built by a viral content site in Greece , this quiz tells you what you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about three months before they were taken down because of legal trouble ( not related to the quiz ) . With zero brand recognition , no website authority , and a brand new site , they still managed to rack up nearly 400k views on their quiz . <p> Quizzes get 75% of their traffic from social ( on average , across all quizzes ) which makes it possible to start from almost nothing and have very successful money-making quizzes with no prior buildup . In fact , there is an entire website , called QuizCrunch , that was built only using Interact quizzes . As marketers , we can learn a lot from these examples and use the same tools to increase our audiences , no matter how small they may be to start . <h> 1 . Skilledup : 650,000 views <p> Skilledup was kind enough to give us a chance when Interact was a skeleton of a site and all quizzes still had to go through me . Luckily for both of us , the risk paid off . Since January 2014 when this quiz was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views . What I like most about the quiz is that its not that interesting to the naked eye . If you were scrolling through news articles and came across one that was titled " Test your excel skills " you probably would n't click on it ( unless you are into Excel , then I 'm totally wrong ) <p> However , when that same quiz is embedded directly into a popular article about how to use Microsoft Excel , you are much more inclined to click on it . <p> You might be saying " so what , how does a quiz help you make more money ? " ah , wise question . See , Skilledup has their quiz connected up to Mailchimp , so a the end of it you are prompted to put in your email address if you want to get updates about Excel ( and since you are on a page about Excel you probably care about Excel ) . To date , more than 50,000 have put in their email address from this quiz , leading to healthy ongoing relationships which boost pageviews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Even with this quiz being for such a specific set of people , they still got over 15,000 views . It asks funny questions about your personality and how you would respond to certain situations within the real estate business , and gives you an answer based on that . It 's fun , engaging , and hard not to finish once you start . <p> What Monster Are You ? <p> I picked this quiz as an example of taking advantage of a time of year or a trending subject . This quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cadbury- took the general trend of monsters and other objects that are associated with Halloween , and tied those items to the quiz. - When users stated what monster they were in the comments section , they had a chance to win a hamper worth of Cadbury chocolate treats ! This is a great example of a quiz that- created engagement through a giveaway . We 've had a few examples like this that use incentives to have users complete a quiz , and they all seem to do very well . <p> What Car Brand Are You ? <p> This quiz was used simply as a sharing device to create more viewership and interest in their brand . It was able to reach almost 25,000 views and it was shared many times across social media outlets as well . This is a simple quiz that just created interaction and engagement within the company and their consumers . Quizzes can be a great avenue to get people talking , sharing , and posting about a certain product that you have put out. - <p> Forbes " Find Your Perfect Match <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university students so they could find out which campuses matched their personality . This was a pretty accurate quiz too ; I got UCLA when I took it myself ! This quiz was meant to be a quick tool for students who might be on the hunt for a school , and it was obviously very successful with over 125,000 views . <p> Food52 " Which Cake Are You ? <p> Sometimes are customers are looking for content for their users to interact with , and this quiz is a great example of that . This creates fun engagement within potential consumers and the product they might want to purchase . It was a 7-question quiz with questions that could be answered quickly , and gave you a fun product that they thought you related to with their answers . This again is another great avenue for creating engagement somewhere that you would n't have it before without a quiz . <p> SkilledUp " Test Your Excel Skills <p> This quiz boasts a tremendous viewership of over 700,000 hits .

Since this quiz is testing the people who are taking it , there tends to be a higher share rate for the quiz . <p> Huffington Post " How Unaware Are You ? <p> This quiz again was about you , which is demonstrated well in the title , so the share rate for this quiz was quite high given it had about 20,000 views . Some companies make quizzes with the purpose of them being shared many times , and quizzes that are testing the consumer are the best to create if you are going for shares . It sparks interest within the user since they can take a challenge to see how good or bad they are , and then potentially be able to post about it to the world via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz . <p> Studio C " Which Studio C Character Are You ? <p> I personally am always very entertained by a lot of the Studio C video bits that they release , and this quiz was very successful for them . Takers of the quiz could be compared to some of their favorite characters from Studio C 's videos . They were able to rack up over 65,000 views and tons of social media shares based on the fact that they were able to match the personality of a lot of their characters with real life qualities that you might match up with . This quiz is very engaging and fun , and by the time the 10th question rolled around I found it impossible that I had even answered that many questions . The reaction comments to this quiz are also great , as the users get excited that they 're matched with characters that might be their favorite and are more apt to share their results because of it . <p> All of these quizzes are unique in their own way " and fit a certain niche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social shares .

That 's powerful . Today I 'm going to share with you exactly how to create a quiz just like the ones that network made . <h> Part 1 : Creating the Quiz Content <h> 1 . Subject/title <p> There is only one subject or title that you really need to know is the " Which ( blank ) are you ? " title . This can be applied to any scenario " Which ( character ) are you ? " " Which ( player on a team ) are you ? " " Which ( character in a major event ) are you ? " <h> 2 . Questions <p> Asking quiz questions is an art form . Here are three tips . <p> 1 . Use lots of images . We did a study and found that all 100 of the top 100 quizzes created with Interact have at least one image , that 's pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This amount of questions will take about two minutes to answer for your quiz takers , which is in line with our online attention spans . <h> 3 . Results <p> In the results of your quiz you get the opportunity to give people their personality description and they can share their results . In order for your quiz to go viral and achieve what you want it to , it has to satisfy three requirements . <p> 1 . Be uplifting but honest . Tell people they are great , but do it in a way that is honest , no blowing smoke . <p> 2 . Have a great picture . When people share your quiz , the result image comes with it , so put in a great picture ( preferably of one person ) <p> 3 . Consider social sharing . the formula for social sharing goes " I got ( my result ) ( title of the quiz ) , " consider that when you write the results of your quiz . <h> Part 2 : Sharing and Embedding the quiz <h> Sharing <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your quiz <p> 2 .

" that saw more than 40 million hits on Buzzfeed can easily be adapted to any sort of travel company . Recently there have been more and more travel brands building quizzes using Interact , and I 've picked five of my favorites that we can all learn from . Let 's dive in. <h> 1 . Hilton Hotels <p> The second largest hotel brand in the world used this quiz to simultaneously entertain and sell more rooms . The quiz is set up just like any other personality quiz , but at the end of it there are links to check out various Hilton Hotels around the world based on what your quiz says about you . <h> 2 . Afar Magazine <p> This quiz brought in 5,826 new email subscribers , using the Interact lead generation feature . This came on just 20,000 views for the quiz ( well I say " just " because the conversion rate was 25% but that 's still a good amount of traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is uses a method I call " quiz-purposing " which means re-purposing your content into quizzes . Afar started by identifying their top performing content ( their travel guides ) then they turned those posts into this quiz . <h> 3 . U.S. News travel <p> Personal anecdote . I know what U.S News is anyone who attended college in the U.S. know what U.S. News is , they produce THE definitive list on what the best colleges are . ( I proudly attended #18 UCLA ) . When they reached out with a few questions about formulating and embedding their quiz , I was stoked . <p> I was even more excited when it turned out they made an excellent quiz . Its called " Which Spring Trip is Right for You ? " and it is what is promised . The quiz asks you a series of personal but lighthearted questions like " Which drink do you prefer ? " and then it tells you where to go in the spring . <h> 4 . Lovin Dublin <p> Specifically targeted at people who are aware of Dublins offerings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes a nerve with people who consider themselves familiar with the capital of Ireland . I think you have to live in or near Dublin to really understand this quiz , but that 's a good thing . You see quizzes that go after a specific subset of people tend to perform far better on average than ones that do n't  have any bearing on who the target audience is. <h> 5 . Visit Britain <p> When you write about the same subject all the time , it can be difficult to spice things up . Such is the case for Visit Britain , the official website of the tourism office of Great Britain , they are tasked with coming up with fun ways to get people interested in coming to the United Kingdom . <p> The quiz they created is interesting in that it could come off as offensive to Chinese people , but is actually targeted at people visiting Britain from China . Its a multiple choice quiz , asking people to see if they can identify what Chinese visitors have renamed famous landmarks in Britain . <p> Travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is so much to learn about different locations around the world , and quizzes are the perfect format for seeing how much people know about locales around the world .

Its not just that they do great work to protect endangered species around the world , but they also created one of the best looking and most efficient quizzes I 've ever seen . Let 's take a look at what The World Wildlife Fund was able to achieve and dive into the strategy behind their success with a lead generating quiz . <h> Results . <p> We are going to have our dessert before our dinner , and look at the outcome of this quiz before we examine it piece by piece . The quiz was called " Whos Your Animal Soulmate ? " and it was taken 2,703 times . At the end of the quiz there is a form asking people if theyd like to get updates from The World Wildlife Fund , and if the quiz taker is interested they can put in their name and email address . That 's a massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that and I 'll send you a box of Girl Scout Cookies . <p> The quiz got most of its traffic from social shares , a screenshot from Buzzsumo shows it was shared over 2,000 times . That is unique to quizzes as a lead generating mechanism . Think about the last time someone shared a white paper or an industry report who would do that ? This quiz however , is collecting the same kinds of information that those other lead generating pages would , but its also highly share-able . <h> Strategy <p> So how did The World Wildlife Fund come up with the idea " Whos Your Animal Soulmate ? " ( other than the fact that this quiz was released around Valentines Day ) . They did it by examining their content to find the best possible quiz idea , doing what I call " quiz-purposing " ( which basically means turning your past popular content into a quiz ) . <p> I 've put a screenshot in here that clarifies this concept a little bit . When you search for Nathab.com ( The World Wildlife Fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the top pages on the site listed out in the results . A few of the results are " Polar Bear Tours " and " Galapagos " and " Our Trips . " Each of these pages revolves around an animal , given that The World Wildlife Fund focuses on animals , and these are places where animals are endangered . <p> From there The World Wildlife Fund created quiz results out of those top pages , such as the one pictured below of the polar bears . Now The World Wildlife Fund can rest easier knowing that their quiz has been built from content that is already popular on the site very nearly guaranteeing success . <h> A walkthrough of the quiz <p> Now let 's look at the quiz itself . I would like to say that every quiz will achieve the same opt-in results that The World Wildlife Fund got , but that 's just not true . They did an excellent job creating their quiz to be engaging , trustworthy , and fun all with the goal of getting more people to subscribe . It worked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 . Grab your prospects attention with the quiz cover <p> The numbers on the left side of the screenshot below are pretty telling as to what kind of traffic quizzes get . The vast majority comes from Facebook , followed closely by other social networks . The World Wildlife Fund Can Share the quiz once , but after that its up to other people seeing the quiz appear on their feeds to keep the traffic going . <p> This is how the quiz was initially shared on the corporate Facebook page . Because of Facebooks settings , you have to take a screenshot of the quiz and upload that along with a link to the quiz page on the World Wildlife Fund page . The nice picture of polar bears seemingly in love makes for an attention-grabbing visual that certainly stands out on social media feeds . <p> 2 . A set of questions that build a connection <p> At this stage a quiz taker has clicked on a quiz link from a social feed and is now on the quiz from The World Wildlife Fund . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust through nine questions of the quiz and get to the point where the quiz taker feels comfortable inputting their name and email address at the end of the quiz . This is a tall order , that 's not a lot of time and this is just a quiz after all . However , they managed to pull it off , and there are a couple of reasons why . <p> The quiz is conversational . The huge advantage quizzes have over virtually every other form of content is the ability to hold a back-and-forth conversation with people over the internet . This can be an advantage , if you word the questions right . The best way to use this unique feature of quizzes is by being yourself , but like a tipsy version of yourself . Remember you do n't  have long to build up trust here , so let your personality shine through and show your humanness . <p> Imagery reinforces the brand . The quiz is full of images . Its not coincidence , we did a study and found that all 100 of the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question like the one pictured below . The World Wildlife Fund quiz uses images of animals and destinations to reinforce the brands integrity . <p> It gets a bit personal . You are going to ask for the quiz takers personal information at the end of the quiz , so you should probably start asking personal questions before that point . Quiz questions are a great way to " break the ice " because they are light and fun , and by asking questions directly about the person taking the quiz , it can feel much more intimate than just some online quiz . <p> 3 . Write a lead capture form that stands up for integrity and has relevance <p> Now its the end of the quiz , you 've built up some rapport through the questions and its time for the big ask ! The way this opt-in form is worded can make or break the conversion percentage there are two things to get right and a third optional bonus round . <p> Be honest . Tell people what you 'll be sending them when they opt-in . There 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who or what will have access to your inbox and how often they will spam you . Its much better to be up front about what you are going to send than to be vague . After all , this is the beginning of a relationship with the customer that you hope will be a long one . <p> Be relevant to the quiz . This quiz is about animals , and the opt-in call to action says " Receive exciting travel and conservation updates . " Since I clicked on the quiz , I 'm interested in animals and where they live , of course might also be interested in updates on travel and conversation . The same goes for any quiz , the call to action on the opt-in should match the topic of the quiz itself . <p> Optional throw in a bonus . In this example , people who opt-in will also be entered to win a Patagonia jacket , which is a cool added bonus . I 've also seen people have really good success with giving away discount codes for people who opt-in or sending a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Craft results to keep the conversation going and entice sharing <p> Quiz results are where you as the quiz creator get a chance to continue the conversation with quiz takers by including personalized links to pages on your site and enticing people to share their results with the world . The World Wildlife Fund did an excellent job in this arena , so let 's go over what they did to maximize success . <p> Be very kind with your results . When people share their result , it will include the result title and description . No one wants to share a result that is in any way negative or derogatory , so make sure to put on your " nice " hat when writing quiz results . That does n't  mean you should lie through your teeth , everything should be honest , but be nice about it . For example , in this description of a Panda as your soulmate it says " This peaceful creature is quite the catch " which is a nice way of saying your soulmate does n't  do much . <p> Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz result I am all kinds of curious . After all I 've just answered a series of personal questions to get this result , and in some ways its like a judgment of my life . Of course I 'm interested in learning more about my result ( in this case , learning more about Pandas ) . <p> Let the people share . At the beginning of this post I showed a screenshot of how much this quiz got shared , and that 's not an accident . There is a very clear call to action to share at the end of this quiz , and it was effective . <p> 5 . Follow up via email and send me cool stuff <p> So Now you have my contact information and have to make the first contact via email . This is a crucial step because this establishes our relationship outside of the quiz itself and is the first step in turning someone who took a quiz on the internet into a long-term customer who could be profitable to your company . Let 's go over the guidelines . <p> Address me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the email from The World Wildlife Fund starts off " Hello Josh " this is important because it indicates you know who I am and want to begin a personal conversation . <p> Acknowledge that you got my email from the quiz . I see this one get messed up all the time . Companies will either add emails collected through a quiz to a general list or just send an email with no indication of how the address was obtained . Being up front about how you got my email and why you are sending me stuff helps build trust and my interest will be piqued . <p> Talk about the quiz . Either have a link to check out even more information to the quiz or just mention my results again . <p> The World Wildlife Fund achieved in just a few days what it takes some people months to achieve , they brought in over 1,000 fresh subscribers to their database . They created an amazing quiz to achieve this , and we broke down step by step what that process looked like .

" By Golfnow . <h> Views : 10k <h> Social Shares : 1.5k <p> Why it worked : GolfNow saw an opportunity and took it . The sport of Golf has been the recipient of a fresh new audience thanks to several new pros who have strong followings even outside the sport . This quiz helps you find out which one of these pros you are most like , and gives an opportunity to share the results . In a partial search , I found very few Golf personality quizzes , GolfNow benefited from very little competition and a well-executed quiz . <h> 2 . " How much do you know about Iran ? " By Berim <h> Views : 15k <h> Social shares : 2k <p> Why it worked : Two words : shock value . Whether you got all the questions right or wrong , there is some level of surprise associated with this quiz . Because Iran is talked about around the world through news segments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , but this quiz proved otherwise for many and they voiced their surprise on social sites . On the flip side , for the people who got the questions correct , there was a level of pride associated with having strong world knowledge , and they also shared their results . <h> 3 . " Which cake are you ? " By Food52 <h> 25k views <h> 5k shares <p> Why it worked : " Serious quiz , what kind of cake are you ? " some version of this tweet was shared a few thousand times for this cake quiz . People loved that something delicious like cake was turned into a quiz that they could share their results on . Food52 is on to something with their unique style of food humor , theyve now done fifteen or so quizzes with similar results . <h> 4 . " Which studio c character are you ? " By Studio C <h> Views : 65k <h> Shares 11.2k <p> Why it worked : A strong knowledge of the audience . Studio C made a quiz to tell people which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was an instant success because of the " insider effect " which means that people who took the quiz felt like they were part of a privileged group because of the language in the quiz . Every question in this quiz and all the results reference inside jokes from the show and really make people who watch the show feel included . When those people got their quiz results , it felt very personal and like it was applicable , which led to a very high percentage of people sharing their results . <h> 5 . " Which car brand are you ? " By Viewsbank <h> Views : 17k <h> Shares 3.5k <p> Why it worked : Competition . Viewsbank uses their quizzes to run contests the right way . In return for commenting or sharing , quiz takers are entered into a drawing for a tasteful prize ( like a basket of cadbury chocolates ) . The result is a very high percentage of people sharing their quiz results from the Viewsbank quizzes . <p> This strategy can be extremely effective for brand amplification , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run off and try it . First , the quiz should stand alone ( if there was no contest it would still be fun ) . Second , have a good prize . People have become a bit jaded to contests and have lost trust in them , make your prize something believable ( like chocolate ) . <h> 6 . " What kind of operator are you ? " By Warrior Lodge <h> Views : 90k <h> Shares 15k <p> Why it worked : Star Power . Most of us have seen the iconic action movies of our time . The heroic people who play the action stars are a part of our lives , and this quiz cashes in on our affinity for the powerful . Basically all that means is if you use celebrity power effectively it can really boost s quiz . Every one of us is exposed to celebrities daily , so having them in your quiz makes it relatable. <h> 7 . " Are you an android person or an iphone person ? " By Eldeforma <h> Views : 37k <h> Shares 7.5k <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released their iphone 6 and 6+ , Eldeforma released this quiz . As a viral news site , Eldeforma thrives off of trends like the Apple event , and this quiz exemplifies how they go about doing that . This quiz is what youd call a " news quiz " and publications have been running this type of quiz for centuries ( literally ) , with continued success . All you have to do is stay in touch with current events and make a quiz about them . ( please do n't  do this unless the quiz has to do with your business or you are a news site ) <h> 8 . " Find your perfect ( college ) match " By Forbes <h> Views : 78k <h> Shares : 15.5k <p> Why it worked : Answering serious questions . Picking a college is a huge deal . Parents obsess over where their kids will go to school while the high school students enjoy not caring and annoying their parents . ( jokes , but really , picking a college is quite a decision ) . Forbes took advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually get shared . I think the reason this quiz did so well is because it does n't  try to do too much . Instead of telling people a specific college they should go to , the quiz recommends a type of college , which allows the quiz to be more applicable to people . I think the lesson here is to know the limits of a quiz , do n't  try to claim that you can predict exactly where someone should go to college if you cant. <h> 9 . " What type of environmentalist are you ? " By Grist <h> Views : 50k <h> Shares : 13k <p> Why it worked : Controversy . This quiz had very mixed reactions . Some people were very happy with their results while others were irate that they would be called " environmentalist yuppies " people were not stoked . However , this controversy led to a massive comments discussion and an ensuing onslaught of traffic to the point where this quiz became one of the most viewed articles ever for Grist . Sometimes controversy is good , but be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article sounds like that 's what you should do . <h> 10 . " Which ZTA founder are you ?

While the average quiz created using Interact gets about 600 views , the top 100 average more than 60,000 views . A majority of the top performing quizzes are of the personality type , probably because they are just more fun . <p> I picked out ten of my personal favorite viral quizzes and attempted to identify what makes them special , check out what I found . <h> 1 . Red Lobster " What Kind of Shrimp are You ? " 180,000 views <p> I love Endless Shrimp , what 's better than an oncoming supply of delicious seafood ? As part of the social strategy for the 2014 Endless Shrimp special at Red Lobster , the eatery created a Shrimp Personality quiz . It was a hit . What I like about this quiz is the originality . Any restaurant can post screenshots of delicious food flying through the air ( looking at you AppleBees ) , but it takes originality to have a fun quiz . <p> The takeaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a plug for Taco Bell ) . Any company can have fun with a personality quiz , but do n't  be afraid to come up with ideas that might seem too goofy . <h> 2 . Warrior Lodge " What Kind of Operator are You ? " 86,000 views <p> Warrior Lodge is a military content site that has made quizzes a regular part of their content strategy . What I like about them is the ability to consistently produce great personality quizzes . They do one just about every week and come up with an original topic each time . The difficulty with quizzes is that many people get started after seeing one quiz idea that will work for them but then stop after that first one . <p> Takeaway . Stick with quizzes . The quiz pictured below was the third quiz created by Warrior Lodge , the first two did okay but nowhere near 86k people . Personality quizzes can catch fire at any time , and practice certainly increases your chances . <h> 3 . StyleCraze " Which Celebrity Are You ? 48,000 views <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us have created one of our own that got over 48,000 views .

News site Eldeforma based out of Mexico created this quiz to help you find out if you are an android or an iphone . It sparked quite the debacle on Facebook , with people piping up with their opinions about which result they got . <p> Takeaway . Take advantage of news . One way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy is to use breaking news as your ally . <h> 5 . Grist.org " What Type of Environmentalist are you ? " 50,000 views . <p> When Grist created the environmentalist personality quiz and told some people they were " Environmentalist Yuppies " rage ensued . People were commenting with irate counter-arguments as to why they werent yuppies . I have n't done this study , but having a lot of comments is a sign of an engaged community . YouTube comments and Yahoo New comments ( back when Yahoo was relevant ) were a big part of the reason why people enjoyed consuming that content . <h> 6 . Rachael Ray " What Type of Clutterer are you ? " 7,000 views <p> First , 7k views might not seem like a ton of views , but keep in mind that this Rachael Ray quiz was used as just one part of the marketing strategy for the daily Rachael Ray show . The quiz was popular with fans of the show , who commented with their personality types and stayed on the page for an average of three minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for content you invest in heavily . If you have a show or a web tool you 've created , use a personality quiz to promote it . <h> 7 . Greek News " What Will You Be in The Afterlife ? " 385,000 views <p> Ill be honest , I do n't  speak Greek , so I cant tell you what this quiz is all about , but I can tell you it was very popular . <p> Takeaway . Take on big issues . Whether you go the direct route and predict exactly what people will be in the afterlife , or go a more indirect route and tell people which type of person they should marry , you 'll always have an audience for the big questions of life . <h> 8 . Goedekers " Which Room in A House Are You ? " 16,000 views <p> Goedekers is an online appliance website , you can buy washers and dryers on the internet and have them shipped directly to your house , which is cool . What 's even more cool is when a necessity goods website can have fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are You ? " quiz as a marketing piece , but it caught on like a viral quiz . <p> Takeaway . Props to Goedekers for doing branded content properly . Sure , they are advertising washers with this quiz , but that 's secondary to the fact that you get to find out which room in a house you are . <p> Anthony Nolan is the UKs bone marrow registry ( interact provides a 50% discount for non-profits ) , not a guy named Anthony Nolan . That makes it even more awesome that they created a fun quiz . <p> Takeaway . Quizzes are an excellent way for non-profits to connect with donaters on a more personal level . Its difficult to switch back and forth between serious issues and normal life , and a quiz can help . <h> 10 . AITA " What Kind of Truck Are You ?

@@22713843 @2713843/ <h> The real definition of social engagement <p> Speaking with a client today , we discussed a quiz that would work primarily for " social engagement " which is a rather vague term . Its tough to really know what 's successful in terms of your content if the goal is social engagement and no one really knows what that means . <p> When I drilled down a bit more , it turns out that in this case " engagement " meant a couple of things . First , it means getting audiences to click on social content , coming back to your site . Second , it means getting them to continue looking around on your site .

@@22713844 @2713844/ <h> 3 Excellent Examples of College Quizzes <p> I love the idea of colleges using quizzes to recruit students because its such a natural fit . Pre-college young people are not super interested in filling out forms ( is anyone , really ? ) , but they are very willing to fill out forms within quizzes . We have two college quiz templates at Interact , and the " Which Major is Right for You ? " has a 46% opt-in rate while the " Which Career is Best for You ? " has a 51% opt-in rate . Those are truly impressive numbers . <p> Below , I 've picked out three of our long-term customers ( all over 1.5 years with quizzes ) . These colleges have done a really good job with their quizzes , and each has a different approach we can learn from . <p> 1 .

Brandeis <p> I love this quiz for its loyalty to the classic image-based quiz format .

This quiz is also built into the navigation of the Brandeis website and embedded on its own page , but its not quite as prominent as the EiCollege representation . This works out great for Brandeis , as they only get really qualified leads through the quiz , but are still able to drive 300+ new leads a year , and are directly integrated with HubSpot for following up on quiz leads . <p> This is the longest quiz example on this list , with 20 questions .
