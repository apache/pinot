In stark contrast , Christendom Colleges core curriculum consists of 86 semester hours of carefully structured courses in Catholic theology and philosophy , the history and literature of Western civilization , classical and modern languages , political science and economics , and mathematics and science . <p> It- is designed to provide an- orderly , sequential presentation of the fundamental principles of mathematics and natural science , philosophy , and theology , in conjunction with the historical and literary knowledge which is foundational for an understanding of Western- civilization . <p> Yes , those are real students . And yes , that is St. Peters in the background . Our classrooms are located right next to St. Peters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a beautiful day ? Find out more about our Junior Semester in Rome by clicking on the image above . <p> Christendom Colleges exploration of truth conjoins natural and revealed truth , so that each can inform and benefit the other . The first year of study includes both a systematic exposition of the fundamentals of Catholic doctrine and philosophic study of the ancient philosophic wisdom of Plato and Aristotle and St. Thomas ' philosophic understanding of the nature of the human person . In the second year this understanding of God , the world , and the world 's and especially man 's relation to God is deepened and enriched by year-long study of Sacred Scripture in Theology and of ethics and metaphysics in Philosophy . <p> An indispensable element in any sound education is learning to distinguish truth from error or distortion , and then to communicate truth accurately , effectively , and convincingly to others . Therefore , Christendom College requires an introduction to the fundamental questions and methods of philosophy , the study of logic , mathematics and scientific thought , and training in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a foreign language . <p> The study of a foreign language , particularly of an inflected language such as Latin or Greek , leads the student to an understanding of the nature and structure of language as such , and hence to a true command of language . Furthermore , foreign language study both enhances linguistic skills and enables the student to gain a fuller appreciation of the European roots of American culture , a purpose which is also served by four courses each in the great heritage of Western literature and the history of Western civilization . For these reasons , Christendom Colleges Core Curriculum includes a foreign language requirement as an essential component of its B.A. educational program . A minimum of two years of college-level work in a single foreign language , classical or modern , is required for graduation from Christendom College . Language competence must be proven by college course work at or above the second-semester Intermediate level . Advanced proficiency in a language achieved through a medium other than college-level courses may exempt a student from lower level courses , although no college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for or exemptions from this requirement for proven competency in a foreign language are allowed for the B.A. degree . The language requirement for the A.A. degree is somewhat different from that of the B.A. degree , however . <p> The transformation of all history by the Incarnation makes a truly Christ-centered study of the past an indispensable hallmark of a Christendom education . Without this focus , it is nearly impossible to truly understand the present and shape the future . <p> You will examine the formation and disintegration of Christian culture from ancient times to the present and investigate the historical consequences of thoughts , teachings , writings , and ideas in the areas of philosophy , political science , theology , and literature . You will be equipped with a well-formed and broad understanding of the past . This focus on history will assist you as you go on to make history yourself .

Greetings from Italia !

" - Living so close to the heart of the Church , I am thrilled- to walk in the footsteps of so many holy men and women ! - By seeing the places where they lived , worked , and died , maybe my classmates and I will discover Gods plan of holiness for us. - <p> With these thoughts in mind , we set off for Mass at St. Peters Basilica , in the footsteps of St. Francis . We approached the Vatican from Monte Mario and took , by train , the same path that holy friar followed when he first came to Rome . <p> St. Francis certainly seems to be our guide for the beginning of the semester , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome behind us for our pilgrimage in the quiet , sloping hills of Assisi . As we entered the city , we were reminded of Pope Franciss visit to Assisi last year on the feast of his patron , so we are beginning the semester in the footsteps of our Holy Father , as well . <p> Assisi is a beautiful , quintessentially medieval city and a treasury of so many graces ! - After our arrival in the city on Sunday , we visited the birthplace of St. Francis , prayed at the tomb of St. Clare , and celebrated Mass at San Damiano. - We also had the chance to see clothing and other relics of St. Francis and St. Clare and pray before the crucifix that spoke to St. Francis at San Damiano . The joy of being so close these saints is written on the faces of everyone in our group . <p> My favorite moments in Assisi so far occurred on Monday . Early in the morning , some of us arose to greet the sun as it dawned over the mountains beyond Assisi. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the beauty of creation and singing hymns as St. Francis would have done. - After breakfast , our entire group walked down to the Basilica di San Francesco , which stands over the burial place of St. Francis . What an incredible grace it was to celebrate Mass at the tomb of this great saint ! As we prayed at his tomb , I 'm sure that he was interceding for us in a special way , and will continue to guide us throughout the rest of our semester . <p> Every day here unfolds with amazing and unimagined graces , I cant wait to see what tomorrow brings ! Ciao , until next week ! <p> Enjoying Italian dining in Assisi <h> Director 's Cut <h> with Sam Philips <p> Director of Admissions <h> Christendom is affordable ! <p> A concern shared by many people in todays still recovery economy is " how will afford a college education ?

Additionally , each year we hold our Padre Pio Full-Tuition Scholarship in which we award Full Tuition scholarships to two deserving students . The dates for this springs Padre Pio Competition are being finalized . Please check back on our website for details on the competition . <p> In our continued effort to keep Christendom affordable , we are very excited now to offer a Scholarship Matching Program . This - Scholarship Matching Program enables qualified students to submit competitive scholarship offers they receive from other institutions . Our scholarship committee will review each offer and each students overall competitiveness . The committee may then award a Christendom scholarship that matches the competing offer as far as percentage to tuition ratio . In other words , if a student received a 30% tuition scholarship at another college that student could qualify to receive a matching 30% tuition scholarship here at Christendom . This will really open the door for many more deserving students to attend Christendom . <p> For many families paying for college is understandably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to keep in mind . Of all those who were accepted to Christendom last year , not one ( that we are aware of ) of the applicants who chose not to pursue Christendom did so due to financial concerns . In short , money did not stand in the way of anyone who wanted to attend Christendom this year . Through academic scholarships and financial aid , we do everything in our power to make the cost manageable for our families . - So , do not allow financial concerns stand in the way of the transformative education and experience that awaits you at Christendom . <p> Rather than stress about affordability , the most important thing you can do is to try to learn as much about Christendom as you can so that you can make an informed decision as to whether Christendom is the right fit for you . That 's why you absolutely need to come on out and visit our campus . Christendom is truly a unique education and it is not easily reduced to a trite pitch or catchy slogan . It needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read a college brochure , hear a presentation from a college rep , or even review a college website , but its quite another thing to see it firsthand for yourself. - There are certain intangible qualities that you simply wo n't appreciate until you visit . With any college you are considering I would strongly urge you to visit its campus so you can make the best decision for your future .. <p> For Christendom , you are invited to visit almost any week of the semester . Come for just a day or come for an overnight , or even two . In addition to enjoying the professors and classes they observe , visitors to Christendom regularly comment on what a friendly and welcoming campus we have . <p> And if you would prefer to visit in a more formal fashion , plan to attend one of our Fall Open Houses .

I 'm interested in Christendom but was disappointed to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into the military following graduation so I guess Christendom is not going to work out for me . <p> A. You are correct in your understanding that Christendom does not have ROTC on campus , but that in no way should deter you from fulfilling your goal of both attending Christendom and pursuing a military career . <p> Here 's why . You do n't need to do ROTC to go into the military directly following graduation . If you come to Christendom , you would just attend Officer Candidate School during the summer months after your junior year ( Some OFC programs allow you to spread your training out over two summers : after your sophomore and junior years ) , and then when you graduate from Christendom you will be sworn in as a 2nd Lt. ( I distinctly remember my classmate , now a captain in the USMC , walking over from the Crusader Gymnasium directly following our graduation ceremony over to the front steps of our St. John the Evangelist Library where he was sworn in as a 2nd Lt in the Marine Corps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you went to the Naval Academy in Annapolis guess what rank you would hold following graduation ? 2nd Lt. Same as at Christendom . <p> So , there may be a dozen reasons why Christendom is not the right fit for you , but an inability to enter a military career can not be one of them . We have many alumni who serve in the various branches of the armed services . If you are interested in being connected with some alumni to ask them about their own experience entering the military directly from Christendom , feel free to contact me , and I can give you their email addresses .

There is an Italian method to eating , where you do not rush through the meal , rather you relax and enjoy one course at a time . Hence , our dinners thus far have taken 2-3 hours to complete . I love this tradition , especially as the best conversations occur during meals . <p> A few days into the semester , I am already overwhelmed by the majesty of the Eternal City and the excitement of being with some incredible people for the next few months ! <p> We are now enjoying a week-long pilgrimage in Assisi and Siena , but more on that next week ! <p> Madeleine : Where did you go to college ? Fr . Fox : I began my college education in 1965-1967 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in formation with the Dominican Friars of the Province of St. Joseph , preparing for entrance into the novitiate . I entered the novitiate in July , 1967 and on completion of the year of novitiate continued my college education finishing with a B.A. in Philosophy at St. Stephen 's College in Dover , Mass. in 1970 . I then went to our Pontifical Faculty of Theology at the Dominican House of Studies in Washington , D.C. I completed the bachelor and licentiate degrees in sacred theology in 1973 and 1975 respectively . Later I studied at the Catholic University of America in Washington , D.C. where I earned a licentiate degree in canon law in 1980 . Finally , I studied at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome , Italy ( aka the Angelicum ) completing my doctorate in canon law in 1985 . <p> M : Where were you stationed before you came to Front Royal ? FF : I was ordained a priest in May , 1974 and continued my advanced studies in theology in Washington DC . My first post after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington DC . In 1977 I started working at the diocesan tribunal of the Diocese of Youngstown , OH and left there when I began my studies in Rome in August , 1981 . I remained in Rome working in a number of positions as a professor at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas for 21 years , as an administrator for the Dominican Priory at the Angelicum for three years , and two years at the seminary residence attached to the Angelicum , called the Convitto San Tommaso . I also worked at the Vatican . For six years I was a staff official of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts and for five years served as the Bureau Chief of the Personnel Office . I also served as the Director of Pastoral Formation at the Pontifical North American College and as one of the associate spiritual directors of the seminarians for three years . You will notice that I was 22 years in Rome and usually had more than one full time job at a time ! I returned to the United States in late June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Archbishop of Detroit at that time , I worked on processing cases of clergy sexual abuse for both the Archdiocese of Detroit and for several other dioceses throughout the USA .

I was then sent in 2007 to Washington DC to work as the first Vice President for Advancement at our Pontifical Faculty of Theology at the Dominican House of Studies and as Professor of Canon Law . While continuing these duties , I was elected superior of our other priory in Washington DC , St. Dominic Priory . My term as Prior finished on May 16 this year . <p> M : How did you come to be at Christendom College ? FF : In a letter to my Provincial of May 17 , 2011 , Dr. ODonnell requested that a Dominican priest be assigned to Christendom College to serve as assistant chaplain with a possibility of teaching a course in theology . I was asked by my Provincial to look into this request in late June . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 28 that he wanted me to come to Christendom Collegehowever , I did not receive his instructions until August 11resolving how to provide for my standing duties as a full professor at our Pontifical Faculty .

Thus began my service here at Christendom ! <p> M : What about Christendom attracts you the most ?

This time the Crusaders would strike first as John Ciskanik scored the first goal of the season within the first 20 minutes of the game . <p> The Crusaders would dominate time of possession for the rest of the first half and barely miss on two other wonderful scoring opportunities before halftime . The second half saw the Lions of Bryn Athyn battle back and tie the game up and then take the lead half-way through the second half . <p> First-time goalie Dan Mitchell had six saves in the game but was unable to stop the two goals which were excellent shots by the Lions forwards .

With just over 5 minutes left in the game , the Crusaders broke through and John Ciskanik would dart through the defense and fire a shot to the back of the net just past the hands of the Lions goalie . With the game knotted at two-a-piece the Crusaders finished the last five minutes of game amassing six shots on goal , but none proving to be the game winner . <p> In the eighth minute of overtime , Colin McKeague found Tommy Salmon at the top of the box and the fancy-footed Irishman placed a shot in the low corner that squeaked by the goalie for the game winner .

Also , on the last play of the game Johnny Foeckler kicked a towering cross toward the goal which fullback Tim Beer headed into the back of the net for the final goal of the game . <p> John Ciskanik and Johnny Foeckler each scored twice for the Crusaders . <p> Johnny Ciskanik takes the ball down field . <p> Sophomore Tim Beer keeps the ball out of Crusader territory . <p> Q.

" What that means , in short , is that , if you want to get ahead in life , do n't  dress like everyone else , or you will not get noticed . If you dress up , even though you may not be required to do so , your boss may notice and you may get a promotion or raise or some other good thing . That 's the theory , anyway . <p> Christendom has always had a professional dress code for its students for classes , morning Mass , and lunch time because all of those activities are considered important and dressing up for them has a tendency to help students keep focused on the important work that they are doing .
