Instead of purchasing a booth at an expo , employers purchase an online presence where they can engage potential talent in a virtual environment . <h> 3 . Include sponsors in the planning process to drive value . <p> Make the planning process more transparent and create a mailing list just for sponsors , which you can use to send updates to . Updates do n't have to be earth shattering as long as they 're regular and informative . <p> As the event nears , send sponsors privileged information that can help them achieve their goals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Venue Mapper by Social Tables , the attendee list , or the run of show .

@@22008211 @2008211/ <h> Event Marketing : 4 Steps to Cross Promotion with Vendors <h> No time ? No problem . Fill out the form and we 'll email you a PDF version of this blog post to read anytime you want . <p> Your event is a revolving ecosystem . In order to get everything to run smoothly and work together you need to have a plan in place . Thinking back to our last post on how to court a sponsor , we learned how to get sponsors to invest by showing them a mutually beneficial relationship . The same can be said for vendors . <p> If your event is to be a success , you need to have the correct vendors in place . Vendors are the people and companies that make your events stand out , so it 's important to have a good rapport with them . Most people never take their relationship with vendors any further than just using their goods for an event . <p> Have you ever considered engaging your vendors to help with the promotion for your event ? After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why would they not want to promote ? <p> Here are a few tips to get the conversation started with vendors about cross promotion . <h> Step One : Find the Perfect Vendor <p> When it comes to finding the correct vendor ( whether it be catering , hotel , AV , rentals , etc. ) for your event , you need to know what their reputation is in the industry . Look to your industry peers for suggestions . Ask around for the best ( and worst ) vendors that they have used . An important question to consider is that of their availability and flexibility : ensure that vendors are willing to go above and beyond to help with last minute changes . <p> Once you have a list of recommended vendors , start doing your own research on companies . Going with a vendor that everyone else uses means you will have a reliable company , but what about being a little bit adventurous ? Reach out to new companies that have good reviews and a great company model . Companies that are new to the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps them gain additional exposure and business . <p> Approach these companies with a list of questions and information that you need to make your decision . Include the following : <p> Do they have a good track record from past clients ? <p> What does their service cost ? <p> Do they have insurance coverage ? <p> Have they promoted events in the past ? <p> What is their social reach ( IE Facebook , Twitter , newsletters , etc . ) <h> Step Two : Discuss Cross Promotion <p> You want your vendors to be on your team , so show them that this is not a one-way street : you are willing to promote them , if they are willing to promote your event . <p> Talk about using social media to get the word out for both parties . If they are hesitant , discuss how these public recommendations can lead to them receiving new business . By promoting one another on your respected social media outlets , you are making a statement to your audience that you are proud to work with them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social as well . Talk about putting cross-promotion on one another 's websites . Consider including the partner 's logo in email blasts . Publish a press release that shows you are now partnersthe sky is the limit . <p> By working together to enhance your mutual exposure , you 'll be showing your commitment to one another , which will establish a trusting working relationship for the future . <h> Step Three : Identify- Creative Opportunities for Cross Promotion <p> So now that you 've talked to them about cross promotion before the event , it 's time to consider what you can be doing during- the event . Consider each vendor 's needs , then find different ways for them to get the word out about what they do . Here are some ideas : <p> If you have an app or registration partner that you are using for check-in , give them the chance to set up a table adjacent to you . This gives attendees a trouble-shooting area , takes the pressure off of your team , and amplifies the vendor 's voice . <p> Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where your caterer can set up information about what they do . This provides a non-invasive opportunity for attendee interaction that wo n't take away from your program . <p> Consider allowing your vendor providers to come with branded clothing . This will allow attendees to identify , for example , who the AV- company is if they have questions , who the people are that provided the great rentals , etc . <p> These little things will go a long way for you because if your vendors are excited about the opportunity for free promotion , they will in turn communicate your event to their followers . <h> Step Four : Confirm with a Contract <p> All this talk is great , but these days your word does n't mean much . Make sure to get your cross promotion plans in writing . When negotiating your contract with vendors , add in a small clause about what both parties plan to do . <p> Confirm how many tweets or posts that you are willing to do in a month . Specify if promotion will go on the website . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something special at your event . A binding contract makes it a little easier to spend the money knowing you are getting promotion as well . <p> Admittedly , creating a trusting vendor relationship through a cross-promotion plan will take some extra work on your part . That said , if you do it correctly , the mutual success for both parties will be worth the time spent . If your vendors are happy with the way your event ran , and the promotion that they received , they will undoubtedly be a great partner for your future events . <p> This blog was written exclusively for Social Tables by Kristen Carvalho , Content and Social Media Manager for- etouches. 
@@22008214 @2008214/ <h> 5 Ways to Master Instagram for Event Promotion <p> Instagram is to photos what YouTube is to videos . Instagram is the place for sharing your latest selfie or whatever random pic you feel like uploading for the world to see . This social network also has enormous potential for event promotion . <p> As of 2016 , Instagram has an estimated 400 million active users around the globe . With such large numbers , it only makes sense to leverage the site for getting the word out about your event . Here 's a few tips to help you get started . <h> 1 . ) Share the Location <p> Show people a sneak peak of the venue . Let them see what the interior and exterior looks like , so they have an inkling of the type of atmosphere to expect . Want to know how to find the perfect venue ? Why not leave it up to an audience vote ? <p> Upload photos of each potential venue on Instagram and let followers decide which one would make the best location . The event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them have a voice over where it should be held ? <p> Finally , remember that you can also upload brief videos . If you get the chance to walk through the facility , then film the place while you 're touring the area . Do n't forget to add a brief description of each venue , making a note of any highlights worth mentioning , such as a comment on the architecture or outdoor area . <h> - 2 . ) Use Luster ( formerly known as Instaprint ) <p> Luster is a wall-mounted photo booth that 's available for rent . When users upload a photo on Instagram using your event hashtag , Luster prints a physical copy of the photo , which the user can keep as a souvenir . <p> The vodka company Grey Goose is one company that used Luster with great success . During a launch party in 2013 , the company used the event hashtag #CherryNoir to promote its latest flavor . By event 's end , a total of 365 photos were taken , and Grey Goose acquired over 131,000 social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , people still appreciate physical photo copies , which means they 'll appreciate having a tangible photo as a keepsake . Guests walkaway with a physical memento while you get a much-valuable social impression to make your hashtag a top trend . <h> 3 . ) Host an Instagram Contest <p> Social media contests are always a great way to drum up hype and create consumer engagement through friendly competition . Instagram contests are fairly simple . <p> Here 's an idea : have participants post selfies while holding up the event ticket , which should have your company 's logo . Be sure they also include the event hashtag . From there , select a winner at random and award that participant a prize , such as a free upgrade to a VIP pass . This is more publicity for you as your event and company will be seen by your participants ' followers . <p> The pic on the right is an excellent example from the beer company Flying Dog Brewery . The contest has contestants posing with the product in a creative way . <p> here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquiring as many participants as possible . By promoting the contest , you are also subsequently promoting your company and event , so try to squeeze in at least one social media contest for every event . <h> 4 . ) Timing is Everything <p> When you post is just as important as what you post . You have to be strategic about the timing . According to the latest algorithms , 5:00 pm Eastern is the best time for posting . This seems to make sense given that most people are getting off work and want to browse for updated photos as they unwind after clocking out . 2:00 am Eastern is also a very good time , though it 's not certain why this is . Perhaps browsing Instagram is what insomniacs do when their circadian rhythm is off . As far as the days go , Wednesday is the best day of the week for posting , but just by a narrow margin . <p> With this in mind , try to have at least two or three event-related photos to post during the listed times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more or less the general average . The optimal time actually fluctuates depending on the day of the week . Refer to the link above for a breakdown of the best times for each day . <h> 5 . ) Post Often During the Event <p> Inevitably , there will be followers that just wo n't be able to attend . Do n't leave these people out . Use Instagram to provide an update of what 's going on . People often do this using Twitter , but images tell so much more than a 140-character tweet . <p> Dan McCarthy is an Event Manager at JD Parties , an event management company based in the UK .

@@22008220 @2008220/ <h> 6 Steps to Perfect Product Launch Event Planning <p> A launch event is an excellent way to showcase your latest product , build hype around it , and even acquire some sales right at the event. - The more you can get people talking about the product , both at the event and via social media , the better it 's going to do . Here are a few tips to better your product launch event planning . <h> 1 . ) Choosing a Venue <p> Obviously , you want the emphasis to be on the product and not the venue . Nevertheless , an awesome venue for your corporate event certainly helps with the marketing . If possible , try to associate the product with the venue . <p> If you 're releasing a new software , for example , then choose a venue that has on multiple occasions been rented out for tech and IT shows . The venue should also be fairly close to your business site if you cater purely to a local demographic . Do n't make your guests commute way out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Theme <p> The theme , of course , should be related to the product , or at least to your industry in general . If you 're releasing some sort of digital marketing software , then online marketing is the theme , and the event can include activities like SEO workshops , social media marketing lectures , and so on . <p> Essentially , those workshops and seminars should contain informative and useful content but also show guests how the new product can benefit them . The activities practically serve as a lead-in for the product . <p> The event swag can also be incorporated into the theme . Promotional products , in this case , can be of items like thumb drives , pens , and other office products that those in the industry may find useful throughout product launch event planning , <h> 3 . ) Entertainment <p> While the event should be informative first and foremost , you should also incorporate an entertainment element to it to make it more fun and memorable . You have multiple choices in the way of entertainment . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there 's a dance floor , for example , then cap off the event with a dance . Likewise , you can hire a standup comedian who hopefully can incorporate the product or the industry in some way or another into his routine . <p> Entertainment can even be an activity that engages attendees directly while also promoting your product and brand . A contest held at the event is one good way . This can be a simple contest where contestants send out tweets using the event hashtag right as the event starts . <p> Before it ends , announce the winner , which is determined by the person whose tweets garnered the most shares or likes . The prize can be the product itself or last year 's product if it 's still useful . <h> 4 . ) Event Timing <p> When should you hold the event ? Product launches can be held on the day the product is released or as a teaser several days before the release . If the latter , do n't hold it too early ; you want the anticipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While there 's no set rule , try to hold the event no more than two weeks before the release date . <p> Product launches as a whole should also be timed according to the time of year . Perhaps the product makes for an excellent Christmas gift . If so , then make the product launch event planning conference a holiday event . You can also explore industry-specific holidays or explore times of the year when the industry sees a peak in activity . These are the optimal times for hosting your event . <h> 5 . ) Social Media Activity Before the Event <p> You are marketing the product at the product launch event . The event itself , though , has to be marketed as well . In the weeks leading up to the big day , put together an online marketing strategy that involves a combination of social media , email newsletters , and perhaps even offline methods . <p> Create blog or vlog posts that provide informative content while mentioning the product in passing .

The day after the event , though , presents a small window of opportunity to keep the hype going just a bit longer . This should help you acquire a few more sales from guests who opted not to purchase the product at the event . Use the same strategies you did for the pre-event marketing . This includes lots of social media activity , continuing use of the event hashtag , and sending out newsletters . <p> If sales of the product did not meet expectation , then offer some sort of incentive , perhaps a trial offer , a rebate incentive , or complimentary add-ons .

From your agenda and breakout sessions , to your event 's location and even its season , below are 5 areas of consideration for planners to energize and excite attendees , sponsors , and all event participants with new spins on common ideas . <h> 1 . ) Speakers <p> Keynote speakers and presenters are a mainstay of successful events , but there are many ways to keep things new and exciting . For instance , consider adding unexpected speakers ( including outside of your industry ) to your program who ignite new ideas , or ultra-high-profile buzzworthy names to drum up lots of pre-event conversation . Alternatively , think about adding a surprise speaker to your program onsite " this is an exciting way to engage and reward attendees with a really exciting and unforgettable experience . <p> Another idea to consider is how you can change your approach to choosing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader speeches , if you have always featured keynotes who are Fortune 500 CEOs , invite the founder &amp; CEO of an early stage startup next year . Or , if your program has always included a sales strategy expert , instead go for an inspirational speaker to stimulate a different kind of passion and excitement among attendees . Introducing different kinds of speakers can invigorate all participants , infuse a different vibe into your event , and spark creativity . - - <p> When considering a new kind of speaker for your next event , an experienced agent at a speaker 's bureau can also help with new ideas to bring new program content and a new twist to your conference , while still delivering on your reputation of delivering an unforgettable live event experience . <h> 2 . ) Theme <p> Whether incorporating a theme for the first time or changing it up from the previous year , new themes can go a long way to deliver a noteworthy experience for attendees , while also supporting your business objectives . A theme helps to brand the conference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event " it can also shape your agenda , focus your content , generate buzz and provide opportunities to bring a visual appeal to your message . Develop an effective conference theme by considering the event 's objectives , business sensibilities , city/location , and your audiences ' needs and interests " themes can add pop culture references ( from movies to gaming ) or highlight a destination ( like Mardi Gras in New Orleans or a Nashville country theme ) ! - <p> One of the keys to effectively incorporating a new theme into any event is integrated messaging " ensure you are consistent in your language , visual images and overall look and feel throughout your materials and communications and also evoke an emotional and/or visual connection to entice , engage and excite potential participants , registered attendees and confirmed sponsors alike . <h> 3 . ) Location/Venue Type <p> Event destinations and venues are among the most prominent features guaranteed to wow attendees and make an event stand out from the competition . To create a different , unique impression for potential visitors , break from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in this case , outside the typical hotel conference room or convention space . <p> Location : <p> A change of location can provide great opportunities to attract attendees to a new city they might not have visited , and take advantage of regional cuisines and activities . If you have always held your event in major markets like New York , San Francisco and Chicago , look into the possibilities that a city in a smaller market could offer . Instill a hip and funky vibe by moving a conference from Washington , DC to Nashville , TN or Austin , TX . Of course , it is important to take affordability , hospitality options and easy travel access into account , while keeping your overall budget in mind . - - - - - - <p> Venue : <p> Memorable meetings in unique spaces often times means venues that were n't designed for events . With that said , before you start to look for outside-the-conference room locations , it is critical to have a solid understanding of the event objective and the audience experience " ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities , etc . <p> Consider the opportunities that a museum could provide " most have large auditoriums and seminar rooms to accommodate different elements of an event , while offering attendees a unique way to see , hear , learn and experience things in an unexpected way . Similarly , think about the world of possibilities that a large theater could deliver , or how you might transform a warehouse or an airplane hangar into a cool and unique event space " participants are sure to remember venues like these ! <h> 4 . ) Seasonality <p> Just because you have always held your annual meeting in February , does n't mean that it has to continue that way . While it might take some additional logistics and planning , changing up the season in which you hold your event can open up lots of different possibilities , from food choices to greater hotel availability to more affordable travel options . Keep in mind , knowing the availability of attendees and what 's going on within your industry , including conflicting conferences , are important considerations to changing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event to a different season could also impact your overall event budget and potentially save and/or open up additional funds . - - <h> 5 . ) Greater Onsite Engagement <p> Everything outlined above can deliver fresh , new experiences , and you can go further by incorporating some experiential elements to keep attendees engaged and entertained . <p> Activities <p> With the high quantity of sessions , meetings , dinners , exhibits and other typical conference activity , leading experts agree that brain breaks ' are crucial to rejuvenating the mind and actually foster elevated levels of creativity " consider offering hands-on workshops , outdoor activities , art exhibits or wellness activities to provide unique opportunities for attendees to take a break , regroup , and connect with one another . <p> Innovation <p> The digital age is upon us , so why not incorporate some innovative tech ideas into your conference ?

There are twice the logistics , twice the details , and is often twice the effort . However , when done right , it can also be twice the reward. - <p> There are hundreds of factors to consider when putting all of the pieces of an event together , ( and I could go on about each one ) , but one of the key components of a successful one is the flow . If an event does n't feel like it makes sense and is n't moving at a good pace , then attendees will notice right away and it can make the whole experience feel off for everyone . Below are some of my tips for keeping your multi-day event flowing in the right direction . <h> 1. - Prepare , Prepare , Prepare <p> Like with most things , your success boils down to how well you prepared . About a million things could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipate every kind of situation , from bad weather to a no-show caterer , and be ready with a backup plan- this will cut down on your risk potential in a big way . <p> From the beginning , be sure you are setting expectations for all vendors that will be working the event . The lines of communication should be worked out from the moment the contract is signed in order to keep everyone on the same page . It is also important to make sure that you are communicating well with your own team to ensure you are able to oversee every aspect of the event. - <h> 2 . Distinct Events <p> When starting to put all of the pieces together , each day and/or night should be distinct and stand on its own , while still remaining a cohesive piece of the overall event theme . For example , if a conference has an overarching phrase or motto they are following , each day could be themed based on one part of the motto . The last thing you want is for it to feel exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bored and you will lose any distinction you may have wanted . One of the best ways to accomplish this is to bring in the creative partners you trust to be adaptable from one day to the next and will meet your expectations . <h> 3 . Avoid an Overload <p> With any event , you do not want to overload guests with so many activities that they feel overwhelmed and exhausted before the next day . Make sure that you are setting a good pace for each day with enough to keep everyone busy with various options , but not so packed that people are running from one place to the next with no time to relax in between . Remember that several of the attendees are likely there to not only be at the event , but to also meet new people , network and see old friends . <h> 4 . Team Effort <p> Most of all , having a great team behind you is paramount when it comes to executing a successful event . As the person who is in charge , it is impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you have to rely on others to get the job done and trust they will meet your standards . From the get-go , bring on people you have confidence in and have showed an ability to be an adaptable team player . <p> Multi-day events can be a big challenge- but are also a great way to flex your creative and logistic muscles .

RFPs . <p> When an RFP is submitted , did you know it takes : <p> 20-30 minutes for a hotel to reply if they do n't have any availability <p> 45 minutes if they do have availability <p> 1.5 -2 hours if they are available and map out your event in their reply <p> RFPs are submitted online into a nameless , faceless centralized database . As the planner , if you do n't have all the info then do n't source out your RFP to 100+ hotels and feel that each one should get back to you . Send in quality RFPs ( you know the old saying , it 's about quality , not quantity ) so that the hotel will WANT to invest their time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your RPF may find itself in the deleted files . <p> 2 . Communication : Budgets <p> Like any relationship , financial discussions are difficult , uncomfortable , and put us on edge . We get a little defensive ; one side wants to save money , the other wants to make money . Be clear about expectations , on both sides . <p> Menus , for example , are a great way to make accommodations on a tight budget . Menus can be adjusted to work with just about any budget . A best bet ? Ask the chef to join you on a precon visit to discuss your options . <p> Be open to alternatives and be realistic . <p> 3 . Communication : Contract <p> Again , communication is key . Be open and willing to talk . Know what 's going on at the hotel and how/if it will affect your meeting or event ! Ask questions ! <p> Is the hotel expected to be under construction or renovations during your program ? <p> What happens if your sales manager leaves for another job , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available ? We all love free WiFi . But what does free mean ? Will the bandwidth cover 2.5 devices per attendee ? Will you need a password ? Will other guests in the hotel be using the WiFi ? Can you get dedicated WiFi ? You may want to request that the venue create a dedicated account under your company or event name . <p> And above all , review your contract before you sign it . <p> 4 . Attrition <p> Okay , we all hate attrition clauses . But if you are a savvy planner with a strong handle on your group , you will know how many room nights you 'll need . If you have a history with a hotel , they will be able to help track your room nights and provide you with an estimated number of nights . You can increase or decrease from there . <p> Do n't leave this all up to the hotel its up to the planner to keep track of their room block and the number of rooms that have yet to sell . Push this information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room block . Or if the contract allows for it , decrease the block as your event approaches and rooms are not selling . <p> 5 . Walkthroughs &amp; Follow Ups <p> The contract has been signed , all the concessions have been agreed to , and people are now signing up for your event . It 's not over ! Planners and suppliers alike are responsible for reaching out to ensure that all is well on either end before the big day arrives . Be proactive and make a phone call and check in on your event , especially if you have n't heard from your sales manager or event coordinator yet ! <p> Share the conference/event agenda ( with program timing ) with your venue , so that catering and event coordinators can make all the necessary arrangements . Let the hotel know if you have VIPs , special guests or high level officials that may need security , green rooms or other special details . <p> Schedule a walk through . Walkthroughs are great , not only in the early stages of planning , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup . Ensuring that everyone is on the same page . <p> Relationships take work ! Communication is so important to planning an event , and strong relationships between planners and hotels will ultimately provide one amazing program for your attendees ! <p> You have to find ways to invest in others or make relationship currency deposits.It is important to point out that I am not talking about only doing for others who are going to do for you , but as we all know , it is a lot easier to ask for a withdrawal after you have made a deposit .

Not only do these sometimes silly activities take the pressure off of the session , they help attendees transition to be both physically and mentally present during the meeting . Here are a few ideas to kick off your next gathering : <p> 3 Commons , 1 Unique : Have attendees get into groups of 5 ( ideally with people they do n't know ) and within 3-5 minutes , generate three things that they all have in common that are not obvious and then 1 unique characteristic of each group member . Once the activity is over , groups can choose to share their findings if they want . <p> Participant Bingo : Create a bingo board ( or download a- free one ) with different characteristics and participants must find someone to fit into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Note : attendees can only be used once . <p> Candy Confessional : Bring a bowl with an assortment of candy to the meeting and have participants pick their favorite . Each candy should represent a different question ( only to be divulged once everyone has picked a candy ) and participants go around and answer the question . Some sample questions are : what is your favorite company memory ? , what do you see as your biggest challenge going forward ? <p> 2 Truths &amp; A Lie : Every person at the meeting says two things that are true about themselves and one lie , then the rest of the attendees ( or if the meeting is too big , you can split the attendees into groups ) guess which statement is the lie . You 'll learn something new about everyone ! <p> Who Am I ? : Make flashcards with the names of famous people or historical figures and tape a card to every participants head without them seeing who they are . Participants then mingle with each other and asking questions to help them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Have every participant bring something to the meeting that represents him or herself in order to help attendees learn more about each other . <p> Trivia : Create a trivia game surrounding the topic of the meeting or session and see what participants already know . Splitting attendees into teams with others that they may not know will help them network and learn from others with some team spirit ! <p> Ice breakers can be used to introduce participants to each other and/or the topic of the session without throwing them right into the meat of the meeting . Make sure to first evaluate whether or not an ice breaker would be helpful for your next meeting . <p> Have a great ice breaker that we did n't include ?

There is no one-size-fits-all project . In a recent webinar , Tammi Runzler , Senior Vice President of Sales and Services at the Visit Orlando , set out to answer that question . She generously shared some secrets to making the best match between her clients and her community . She always asks both the organizer and your local charities the following five questions to find the right fit : <p> What are your organizations values ? You want to find " philosophical fit " between the two organizations . Organizations whose values are mirrored in their CSR project lends greater meaning and tangible benefit to participating attendees . Moreover , project beneficiaries find themselves connected with institutions that also better understand their needs and become part of a like-minded community of supporters . <p> What is your organizations structure ?

Again , not all projects are the same , and you can help your client customize projects if you understand what each organizations strengths and weaknesses are , especially when it comes to what they can and can not feasibly do , given certain constraints . <p> How many participants are expected , and what are their limitations ? - One of the most important factors at play in a successful CSR project is achieving the optimum level of participation for both organizations , and its important to note that some projects require a lot of participants , while others simply can not . Some involve Herculean displays of physical ability , and others need highly social personalities . Finding the right fit on both fronts will be key to drive both participation and satisfaction . <p> What are some additional ways to get involved ? - Think outside of the box . CSR projects do n't  have to be confined to an allotted amount of time , to a fixed amount of people . Help your client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they are not available at the scheduled project time . Can they support those who are in a different way ? Or , is there a way to integrate the beneficiary organization into the event ? <p> Last but not least , for the benefit of your meeting professionals , do n't  forget to : <p> Include a list of , or link to , charitable and community service organizations on your website . <p> Highlight any " voluntourism " partners in your destination . <p> Include the volunteer site in your site inspection process . <p> Ultimately , by thoroughly evaluating the needs and qualities of both your community and your clients , you 'll be ever more successful at creating truly meaningful and memorable CSR projects that better serve your DMO mission to support your destination .

During this conversation , many questions were asked regarding the evaluation process when identifying new software for departments or as a full-campus solution at colleges and universities . <p> As the lead for our Higher Education team , which currently assists over 200 campuses with their event diagramming solutions , I was inspired to write this post as a guideline for you to use when considering purchasing event software for your academic institution . <h> Question 1 : What are the IT and system requirements associated with the event software ? <p> Additional questions to consider : How will the program be installed ? What will be required of your IT team ? If you get new computers or servers , how easy will it be to transfer information ? <h> Question 2 : What is the installation time ? <p> Additional questions to consider : Does someone have to physically come on campus to install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to your computer during the installation time ? <h> Question 3 : What are the details with system updates ? <p> Additional questions to consider : How- often does the company perform updates ? Will your ability to work in the program be down at that time ? Are there costs associated with the updates , or are they included in the price ? <h> Question 4 : What is the customer support experience ? <p> Additional questions to consider : What is the provider 's average response times for support calls and emails ? Will you have a specific account manager to work with who understands your needs as a department and/or campus ? What are the provider 's hours of support , and where are they located ( time zones are important ! ) ? <h> Question 5 : What are the contract terms ? <p> Additional questions to consider : How long is the agreement for ? What will next years cost be* ? <p> Helpful Hint : Many software companies add clauses to contracts that lock you in for years , including incremental increases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more each year . Renewal rates and contract length are very important items to consider when reviewing your contract . <h> Question 6 : Is the event software cloud-based ? <p> If the event software is cloud-based , ask about how the data is stored . Make sure the terms specify that the provider does not own your data . There are many free event software 's on the market that own your data , and will sell it to third parties . Be cautious of hidden terms ! <h> Question 7 : Who else will be using the event software ? <p> The software company should be able to provide you with clients that are either in your school system or similar in size/what your requirements are . Contact info for references is hard to get , but they should be able to tell you 3-5 similar campuses and a success story . <p> Association forums and listservs are a great resource for asking colleagues about their experience if you cant attend regional conferences . <h> Question 8 : - What is the future of the event software company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they been around ? - Are they backed by Venture Capital ? - Do they plan to get acquired or go public anytime ? <p> As with any service , you will want to know if you should expect any changes in service or support. - These questions will determine your working relationship in the future . <h> Question 9 : What is the comprehensive price ? <p> Additional questions to consider : Can you get a better rate if multiple departments are purchasing ? How do they manage user licenses and limit access ? Does the price include all of the modules that you were shown during the sales pitch ? <p> Laura Simmons is the Team Lead- for Higher Education at Social Tables .

By offering speed networking as part of your conference program , you eliminate this barrier . You also allow your attendees to meet more people in a short period of time and with less effort , than they individually could during coffee breaks . <p> If done right , speed networking will provide one more added value : by helping to match the right individuals , which immediately raises the value of attending your conference . <p> There are different formats for speed networking at conferences . To figure out the best format for your event , its best to understand it through the lens of your attendees . Which connections are most relevant to your attendees . Is the thought of interacting with fellow attendees getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert speakers , and panelists attract the crowd ? Here are three ways to set up a speed networking opportunity at your next conference . <h> 1 . Attendees speed network with experts and speakers- in a group , workshop style , with a focus on pre-selected topics . <p> So what 's the benefit for attendees here ? <p> The direct benefit is that attendees get the opportunity to network with experts and interact with fellow attendees at the same time . Sharing experiences in a group setting- provides an excellent opportunity for knowledge exchange on one specific topic . <p> To try this at your next event , have- attendees select 3 topics of interest during the registration process and designate 3 topical experts . Have your event staff members assign time-slots and tables for each attendee . Then , communicate to attendees the speed networking rules. - Seat each of your topical experts on a table , surrounded by up to 10 attendees . After a brief introduction by the expert , each attendee has 1 minute to introduce themselves , and to spell out specifics they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . Follow-up opportunities should be mentioned . Then , the fellow attendees have 1 minute to chip in . Allow a maximum of 3 minutes for each attendee 's introduction and topic . For a total of 10 attendees , a 30-minute round would be the maximum . Then it 's on to the next table ! Interaction with a fairly large number of people is possible in one setting , so I recommend this format for larger conferences . <p> This style of speed networking is best-conducted mid-way through , or towards the end , of the day . This allows attendees to go into depth about issues they have already heard about during the day 's sessions . And it 's a good way to engage attendees through the end . Best of all , discussions can be continued at the evening 's networking reception ! - <h> 2 . Attendees speed network individually , based on the speakers focus . <p> If your attendees want to get one-on-one attention from experts , speed networking on an individual basis might be the best approach . While this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it affords attendees the opportunity to discuss matters in private- and encourages the- formation of individual relationships . It also allows for attendees to meet with a larger number of experts than the group setting would offer . <p> To execute on this form of speed networking , provide your attendees with background information on the expertise of each speaker . Encourage your attendees to pre-select up to 6 experts they would be interested in networking with. - Have a computer assign time-slots , and tables for each attendee , and communicate the details ! Give each expert their own station ' and have the attendees rotate . <p> If you 're deciding on a room set , classroom style with rows of chairs facing each other works great . Allow for enough space to either side of the chairs , so a conversation can be held despite the loud noise level expected . If space is scarce , set up two chairs on each side of a coffee table . Allow for enough space to either side of the chairs , so a conversation can be held despite the loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attendees move swiftly to the next table . This format is ideal for smaller conferences , and those events with little time for the speed networking slot . <p> Attendees feel more comfortable to discuss projects with expert speakers . And it 's an excellent tool for keeping attendees interested in the latter parts of your conference ! <h> 3 . Speed networking among conference attendees . <p> This style of speed networking is the most common . This method gives attendees the chance to initiate one-on-one business relationships , or potential co-operations , with individuals and not to mention , its an excellent way to generate business leads . <p> Planners who opt for this style of networking can publish a registration list with name/organization/field of interest for all attendees for a sneak preview . Individuals can register for one of the time slots offered and wo n't know who they 'll get to interact with during the rotation . Your team , or a computer , can assign the time slots . Remember to communicate time and location of this session to your attendees ! <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have multiple parallel speed networking sessions in separate rooms . Each room can focus on a topic , and networking can be done round robin style : one group of attendees moving clockwise , while the other group of attendees is stagnant . Then switch , so each of the two camps get a chance to interact with each other as well . This setting is ideal for smaller crowds- unless a topic of discussion is introduced . <p> This set-up is ideal for the beginning of your conference . It allows everyone to get to know each other- and leaves enough time to follow-up during breaks . <h> In Summary <p> Speed networking can be a chaotic experience- if not orchestrated well . Communicate the rules to the attendees and table hosts ' ahead of time and remind them again on-site . Have plenty of staff available to support rotations ' " there is always need for support !

From monitors and lighting , to sound boards and microphones , to tents and bouncy houses , equipment will always play a major role in your event. - <p> Since a large percentage of equipment used for events is rented , its important to ask your equipment rental vendor the right questions to ensure your rental goes smoothly and the equipment performs according to expectations . The questions should vary based on a number of variables , including the location and venue , the type of event , and the equipment being rented . Start by asking these 10 questions long before you 've agreed to work with an equipment rental vendors . <p> Can I get some client references ? If you 're trying an equipment rental vendor that youve never worked with before ( which is often unavoidable ) , nothing provides transparency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more of the vendors clients and hearing their opinions . <p> Have you provided equipment for events at this venue before ? While previous experience is n't an absolute necessity , an equipment rental vendor that is familiar with your venue may be able to make suggestions about the right size , amount , and type of equipment you need " and also to anticipate potential issues . <p> Does the rental include an operator ? Obviously , this question only applies to certain types of equipment that require an experienced operator . But , if an operator is required , be sure to find out if the vendor can provide one , and how much it will add to the cost of the rental . <p> Do you offer set-up and tear-down service ? Similar to question 3 , some equipment can be difficult , time-consuming , or require technical expertise , just to set up and take down properly . Make sure your vendor provides the support you need and includes the cost in the rental estimate . <p> Is a lift-gate required to get the equipment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your people is loading and/or unloading the equipment , be sure to ask if a lift gate is necessary . I know this sounds like a basic , no-brainer question , but it gets overlooked often and results in unhappy planners , unhappy customers and sometimes sore backs . <p> Are you familiar with how union contracts work at this venue ? This goes back to question 2 . A vendor that 's familiar with your venue probably knows if union labor is mandated and the rules and exceptions related to equipment set-up , tear-down and operation . <p> What is your early cancellation policy ? Event Planners know that the unexpected should be expected . Equipment rental can be an expensive line item , so having a clear understanding of the cancellation policies is just smart . <p> Does your rental contract require me to add you to my liability insurance ? Some equipment rental contracts require that renters add the rental vendor to their liability policies to protect the vendor in the event of- accidents involving the equipment . Its a good idea to proactively ask so there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Can I get a copy of the replacement costs/equipment value ? For insurance purposes , and to be aware of your potential exposure , its wise to know the total value/replacement costs of the equipment you 're renting . <p> Whos responsible for equipment damages occurring during transit ? The ideal equipment rental contract specifies that you ( the renter ) have no liability until the equipment arrives at the event location . Other contracts hold you ( the renter ) responsible for damages that occur during shipping .

Instagram does n't  have as much built--in sharing capabilities as other social networks . What it does offer is photo mentioning . Instagrammers can mention their friends in a photos comments by typing in their username . The friend will get a notification letting them know of the mention . <p> By re--sharing attendee photos in your feed , you can unlock some brand exposure through mentioning .

@@22008291 @2008291/ <h> Little Known Ways to Keep Your Participants Engaged to the Moon and Back <p> Attendee engagement its a great buzzword , but what does it really mean ? Authentic attendee engagement includes emotional engagement , cognitive engagement , and behavioral engagement . Whew that 's a mouthful ! - <p> The scarier part ? The only way you can ensure all three is through intentional planning , implementation , and execution of specific strategies . <p> So today , let 's take a look at the three factors that can affect attendee engagement , according to education researchers and authors Robert J. Marzano and Debra J. Pickering : emotional connection , perceived interest and importance in the topic . <h> 1 . Attendees level of activity and emotional connection <p> If your guests are sitting passively listening , their energy and engagement decreases . Activities such as Q &amp; A where you throw around a mic box , starting off sessions with a few minutes of stretching , encouraging seatmates to introduce themselves to their neighbors , and having everyone play rock , paper , scissors in pairs until there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get guests thinking and engaged at any point during your conference . <h> 2 . Attendees level of perceived interest in the topic <p> Even if attendees are engaged emotionally and actively , if they do n't perceive the content as interesting , they wo n't engage . There are three types of individual interest the conference programming must capture to engage participants ( Schiefele , U. , 2009 ; Hidi &amp; Baird , 1996 ; and Mitchell , 1993 ) : <p> Triggered situation interest is capturing the attendees attention . Starting with an activity or a controversial statement can be a great way to pique interest right from the start . <p> Maintained situational interest is holding that attendees interest over an extended period of time . This means you 'll want to ensure your speakers keep their energy levels high , are well-spoken , and can read the crowd . <p> Individual interest represents the attendees outlook toward the topic as needed now and in the future . So , you should aim to help attendees understand how this information can help them do their jobs better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Connect the dots for them by providing real life examples , or asking them how they might use what theyve just learned . <h> 3 . Attendees level of perceived importance of the topic <p> When you can challenge your conference attendees to focus on their highest life and professional goals those required to be successful , compete and lead then they will be more engaged . Additionally , conference attendees that feel they can learn the new information , understand it , and perform it successfully are more engaged . <p> So it could be helpful to survey attendees in advance to best understand their interests , whether they care about particular topics , how they best learn information , etc . Then , you can design tracks that best fit their needs , and ensure there 's hands-on learning , or short bursts of information followed by discussion groups , or even provide handouts with recap information . <h> Now that you know the factors of engagement that are important to address , let 's talk about a few ways you can put these learnings to use : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make everything better : they 're what our brains pick up on fastest and what our brains need to improve memory and recall . So , it can be worth investing big time into making a visual impact when kicking off your conference . For example , amazing special effects ( pink everywhere carpet , chairs , wallsam I right ? ! ) , graphics , intro music , and laser lights are all tools in your kit to create a full emersion of the senses . Do n't have a big AV budget ? No problem . Encourage your cameraman to pan his lens on the engaged crowd as people start pouring into the conference room . ( The old baseball stadium trick ! ) <h> 2 . Provide value every minute <p> Nothing is more frustrating than experiencing a great opening only to be followed by fifteen minutes of dry announcements and future talk . Do n't  start with speaker bios ; introduce your leaders and sponsors after attendees have experienced the good stuff and appreciate the knowledge they 've brought to the table . Kick off with one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear about . <h> 3 . Make the end even better than the beginning <p> Finish your session as good ( or better ) than you start it , and you wo n't have an early exodus . Do n't start packing up displays and your registration desk before your closing session . Recognize how important it is to leave a lasting impression that sends everyone home with smiles . Let your audience know , it 's really all about them . Save one of your best sessions for the end , encourage speakers to hang around to answer questions and take photos in a photo booth , encourage networking with a happy hour located on the way out the sky is the limit ! 2450 @qwx202450 
@@22008299 @2008299/ <p> One of the most common questions I 'm frequently asked is how to find the right venue . As with most things , striking a balance between experience , budget and emotion is a tricky business and requires a bit of a professionals touch . ( Ahemcue the pro planners stage right . ) <p> Maybe you 're warming to the role of " event planner " or new to the hospitality industry and are n't  sure where to begin ? Fear not . You can quickly ramp up your venue selection skills by following a blueprint for friends , family , clients and referrals . <p> This three-part guide makes finding the right venue- faster easier , and more rewarding . It also cant hurt to look like the super hero who knew how to pull it off with ease , right ? <h> PART 1 . How do you want your guests to feel ? <p> Whether its warm and fuzzy , inspired and educated , or as if they just got home from their best night ever out on the dance floor crawling into bed at 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your guests to " feel . " How they feel about you , your brand and your event before , during and after the occasion . You have a concept of the words youd like them to use to describe it . <p> Capture that event essence for your planning benefit . <p> A great way to start your venue selection process is to fully imagine the event in your mind . Vision boarding can be a worthwhile exercise to prevent wasting precious dollars and hours to find the right venue , decor , rentals , entertainment or other event aspects that may not be aligned . <p> Have a solid game plan going into your hunt for the right venue . Its perfectly acceptable to draw on inspiration from previous events , other things you 've seen online or international events that were mucho impressive . It is not always necessary to completely reinvent the wheel at this phase . <h> Venue Style . <p> What style of venue are you hoping to secure ? Will it be a traditional hotel conference center or expo hall , or does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsors or VIPs ? These details matter in helping you immediately narrow your search to find the right venue . <p> Have this in mind . Continue to build on your event vision . <p> Now that you have a fantasy space in your mind , think about what you want the guest registration and entry process to be like , what the guests will see and do first , and where youd like to take them along the event timeline . <p> Deciding on what matters most before you 've started searching will help you really hone in on venues that can help you accomplish these goals , and still meet your budget . <h> Capacity and Comfort . <p> Having a general idea about your maximum headcount is a must before you try to source venues . While we all know that you wont have a guaranteed final headcount until a few days leading up to the event , and even that will have some margin of error , you simply must be certain you are picking out spots that will not be too small to accommodate your group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat " even if you have hundreds of people in the space . <p> While the venues maximum headcount matters , so do specific functional spaces and and rooms . If your event requires that guests move from various aspects of the building to attend group , or breakout sessions , you will also have to be certain that a multi-use facility can fully accommodate your needs . <p> Be certain you 've requested both the venues seated and standing room only ( SRO cocktail-style ) capacity . Be very explicit about this because venues will often suggest a larger guest count will fit into a space than is comfortable or reasonable . You can sometimes make this work with a small margin of error , but not with many guests . You want to make sure the space is as promised . <h> Age and Accessibility . <p> When we talk about the way guests will " feel " , we cant forget about the demographics of our guests . Will the crowd be able to navigate a complicated entryway , hundreds of stairs and is limited seating appropriate ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who require accessible entrances ? Thinking about this need in advance and planning for it will help guide your venue site visit process and make sure you find the right venue for your audience . <p> I personally find it very difficult to be put in a position to stand still for several hours at a reception in heels if at least some seating is n't provided . Moving around makes it less arduous , but its lovely to offer your guests that option so everyone has a pleasant experience . <h> Flow and Function . <p> Have you ever been to an event that gave very little thought to guest flow and created huge bottlenecks in certain spots , say around the bar , the buffet line , the bathroom or between meetings because there was only one refreshment area or one good WiFi signal in the building ? <p> Not a great scene . <p> Be cognizant of what your headcount will require to actually move through your event , what flow you want them to take , and at what pace . If your event is large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of grazing or breaking faster and easier , and keep the event feeling as if its moving along as planned . <h> Defined Dates . <p> One of the largest factors that may play into your event vision is the event date . Not only will seasonality matter in most places worldwide , so will holidays , weekdays , weekends , indoor or outdoor activities and multi-day requirements . <p> It will be much easier to find the right venue if you 've answered a few questions in advance : <p> Is the date flexible ? Do you have the ability to pick a non-peak date or time of day to drive down the venue rental cost ? <p> Will weather impact the date or season you ultimately select ? Do you need a backup and what 's required to hold a " rain " or " weather " date ? Does the venue require indoor and outdoor facilities for your event ? Do you need a weather plan in case of a weather emergency ? <p> Is it far enough in advance that you have time to adequately plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for time to adequately plan , has an alternative date been considered ? Remember that rushing often costs money due to extra fees , rush orders and peak pricing timelines . <h> Tactical Time . <p> In addition to the date(s) of the event , there 's the matter of time " both duration and which part of the day the event will occur . Think about your favored venues during the same time you 'd be hosting your function . Are they in places guests can easily get to ? Is traffic or transportation an issue ? <p> If possible , arrange to have your site visits around the same time of day that you 're planning on hosting your event . Youll have a better understanding of how the venue will look for your guests ( without any decor added ) , and if sun will be an issue for receptions , presenters or ambiance . <h> Gathered Guests . <p> Going back to the event vision , think about how you 'd like guests to gather during the function . Will they need to stand , sit or both ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather spread out ? Will they need to carry around plates of food and drinks and also shake hands ? Will they have a gift bag they also need to navigate ? Is networking a key priority ? If so , how will you foster it ? <p> Do your best to walk the event the way a guest would and think about their challenges in advance so you can solve them . As you arrange your site visits , be specific with your needs and vision . If possible , include your event vision for the venue managers upon first contact . <p> If you 're stressed about the enormous time suck that finding and contacting multiple venues may involve , consider using a venue search tool like Snappening to help you make contact with dozens of venues simultaneously that meet your search criteria . <h> Creative Complexity . <p> Is it a single-day event in one place with local attendees , or a multi-day conference with worldwide attendees that require significant housing blocks , accommodation , complex transportation , etc. ? <p> This plays a major role in where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not you are planning locally in your established market , or trying to plan the event from afar . <p> If you 're in your own neck of the woods , you probably have a pretty strong handle on the venue options in your area . However , if you 're planning from afar , I 'd recommend you tap the local CVB and DMC network to produce a better event with a most appropriate space . Youve got the ability to utilize exceptionally qualified event industry experts in a new market , and it would be a shame not to put that expertise to work for your events benefit . <h> PART 2 . What do you want your guests to remember ? <p> The mark of a great of event is one where all the details happen seamlessly in the background , and nothing logistical serves as a distraction from the the intended purpose of the event itself . There 's nothing that stands out more to event industry types than an event that had logistical hiccups . ( After all , we are our own worst critics . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event aspects that matter most and those that you want your guests to really remember . Will it be the food and drink , the entertainment , the unbeatable speaker content for top-notch education ? <p> A quick set of questions to ask yourself at this stage include : <p> Why are we having this event ? <p> What are we trying to accomplish while guests are with us and <p> What do we hope to accomplish by the time the event is over ? What 's next ? <p> Whatever matters most for the guest memory bank is where budget dollars should be invested . <p> But , how does this help you find the right venue ? <p> It comes down to amenities and offerings . If food is the most important aspect of the event , but you need to be able to bring in your own chefs or caterers , then you 'll need to find a venue with a flexible catering policy . That 's a go/no-go issue for you . <p> If you are going to have a technically complex event , you absolutely can not skimp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WiFi coverage plan . Acoustics , and being able to hear speakers , may also play a significant role in venue selection . <p> Document your event priorities for your venue site visits so the venue managers can help make sure you see the things that matter most to you and are most efficient with your time . This will help you find the right venue with the right amenities faster . <h> Build the Budget . <p> There are numerous items that go into building a comprehensive event budget , but I think the aspects that are often the most important when you are trying to find the right venue , outside the expected venue rental fee , are : <p> Food &amp; Beverage : Will you be beholden to an onsite ( embedded ) cater , a preferred catering list , or can you bring you own food ? Are there spending minimums you must hit for your preferred date(s) ? <p> Other Rentals : Its incredibly important to confirm exactly what IS and IS NOT included in the venue rental agreement . Bar service , glassware , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , podium and other tiny details can add up to big supplemental expenses if you do n't  consider these in your venue negotiation process up front and plan to ask about them . <p> Audio-Visual ( A/V ) : How much is already provided at the venue , how much is included in the rental price and how much will you need to supplement the existing setup ? <p> Preferred Vendors and Suppliers : Are you able to bring your own vendor team , or do you need to use an established team ? Are there any other restrictions about vendors and suppliers you need to know about ? <p> Registration &amp; Ticketing : Will this event be free or paid , and will you require additional staff , security and support to host the event and handle your registration and entry process ? Have you accounted for the extra setup and staff you may need ? Will the income from a paid event be part of your budget consideration ? Have you considered your ticket policy in case of an emergency or weather-related cancellation ? <h> Arrange Site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right venue , its time to arrange site visits . If you 're like most busy event professionals , you wont have time to do endless visits , so you need to be certain you 've really selected the best handful of options for your event . <p> Here are a few additional details to consider as your finalizing your venue selection process . <h> Casual Chic or Impressively Intensive ? <p> How much additional decor and ambiance will be necessary at each venue ? Some venues may have incredibly low rental fees and great , flexible catering , but leave you with a blank box that you 'll have to completely overhaul in order to achieve your event vision . And that 's outstanding if that 's what you want and have the decor budget to account for it . Transversely , some venues will set the intended mood without effort or nearly any additional decor or rentals . <p> Think about the impression you want guests to start with ( first look ) and the one you want them to leave with ( last impression ) , and consider this as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a quick peek into the pre-function , lobby and restroom areas too . These parts of the event experience can be overlooked if you 've not remembered to make them part of your site visit checklist , but they are crucial elements that guests will certainly remember if anything is n't up to snuff . <h> Sights and Sounds . <p> I 've mentioned acoustics , and sound a couple of times , but during site visits , also pay attention to ceiling height and how sound carries in each room . Is it muffled or completely absent , or are there marble or hardwood floors that are going to magnify every shoe scuffle and loud bit of laughter ? Ask the venue manager about the most common comments about sound , and being able to hear at events and what they offer to mitigate any risks . <p> Sight lines are also of critical importance " especially for presentations . Will everyone be able to see the speaker ? If you 've got an important presentation or projected image , will the lights be dim enough in the planned area to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about attempting to recreate the event as closely as possible to the intended experience . Rooms with columns can sometimes be challenging for presentations . <h> Serious Staffing . <p> Not all venues are created equal , nor are their teams . You 'll want to know who will be responsible for not only selling , but also attending and servicing your event , and what level of staffing is provided by the venue . <p> Important questions about venue coordination , housekeeping and security should be solidified in advance .

@@22008300 @2008300/ <h> 5 Steps to Perfect International Event Planning <p> International event- planning outside your home country is highly likely to take you outside of your comfort zone . Especially when its your first time . While the challenge can be exciting it can also be daunting if not downright scary . Let 's face it , even the most accomplished and experienced planner can find it difficult to deal with the social , cultural and legal barriers that would simply not occur at home . <p> So , let 's say you are tasked with planning a small conference in a foreign country perhaps on another continent . Where do you start ? Here are a few tips that you might find useful . <h> 1 . Research the Culture <p> If the destination is already chosen , then a good place to start might in the library or online with some cultural research . One of my favorite resource is Kiss , Bow , and Shake Hands , the book and online resource by Terri Morrison on how to do business around the world . This renown publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business destinations and includes tips on how to win people over . <h> 2 . Collect References Overseas <p> While gaining an understanding of a foreign culture can be fascinating and very useful for negotiations , it may not be enough when it comes to more technical aspects of event planning . When it comes to industry terms the Convention Industry Council 's APEX Industry glossary is worth referring to . This resource is currently focused on the north American industry but it is undergoing a full review and will include notes on global usage of the terms included . <p> Disclaimer : the author is Chair Elect of the APEX Standards Committee , the body that oversees the development of maintenance of APEX . <p> APEX may also be a good reference point when it comes to contracts , however , the quality and availability of equivalent resources for other regions is inconsistent . Most regions have associations and professional bodies dedicated to planning it is always worth contacting these bodies to get recommendations on regional best practice and potential partners . <h> 3 . Find a Professional Local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important recommendation , finding a professional local partner. - This may be the most crucial step of all . <p> Local knowledge from a professional organization will easily make or break an event . The best place to start is the destination 's Convention Visitor Bureau ( CVB ) or Destination Marketing Organization ( DMO ) . As non-profit organization , CVBs are normally able to offer a range of complimentary services for planners and showcase a good range of local properties and service providers . They will also be able to aid in the selection of a local Destination Management Company ( DMC ) . A DMC is likely- to offer support beyond what is customary for national events . This may also increase the costs , however , the importance of their local expertise , service level , and resourcefulness should not be underestimated . <h> 4 . Meet Face to Face <p> With many CVBs offering familiarization trips ( Fam trips ) , these can be the ideal opportunity for planners to experience a destination for themselves , visit a selection of venues and meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such trips can differ in different parts of the world , so make sure this is clear before accepting . <p> Industry trade shows such as IMEX or IMEX America are a great opportunity to explore what destinations have to offer or even to explore destination options when not already determined . A wide range of CVBs , DMOs and DMCs from around the globe exhibit giving attendees the opportunity to meet face to face and make important business decisions . A simple search for DMCs in the exhibitor listing of the recent IMEX America 2016 returns - 732 results from all over the world . <h> 5 . Ask for Help <p> A last word of advice . Ask for help , even if you do n't think you need it . Planners are almost always happy to share their experience and make recommendations in destinations they are familiar with . I would strongly advise all planners to use their professional network to get advice . This can be via email or even better using forums and social media to tap into the wisdom of many with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where members can openly ask question and request recommendations .

One main requirement is having a great audio video setup . And if you 're at a loss on the know-hows of getting AV systems , here 's a helpful list of modern audio video trends and the questions you need to ask in order to implement them . <h> Top Audio Visual Trends For Events <p> The audio-visual landscape changes just as often as the tech industry . As an event planner , you need to keep up with everything that 's new and deliver on the latest audio visual trends that will wow your clients and guests . From time to time ask your A/V partners , what they are using and why they have chosen those the top brands they work with .

You should know how and when to make use of video presentations and LED displays/signage , among many other forms of digital setups and systems . <h> Advanced Displays <p> Another important trend to take full advantage of is the rise of 4K displays and VR systems that are on the rise . This would be even more necessary if you have an event that 's heavy on presentation of information and graphics . The good news is since this trend has become increasingly popular , more and more suppliers are offering it for more affordable prices . <h> Video Instead of Text <p> Videos are the new text , when it comes to delivering and conveying information .

Invest in a good videographer and editor and you 'll surely reap the rewards with how your clients . <h> Virtual and Augmented Reality <p> There 's a major difference between virtual reality and augmented reality . Virtual reality is active ( meaning you have to decide to take part of a VR experience ) , augmented reality is passive . It 's can be used throughout the day as part of our everyday lives . Think of it like the difference between playing video games at home on the couch , and playing games on your iPhone while you 're in line at Starbucks . <p> These are both technologies we 've seen in the world of gaming and entertainment in 2016 .

First is figuring out how far you can go with their services given your budget . Simply put , ask what you can get within your budget . This way , you do n't waste each other 's time by going back and forth . <h> 1. - Give Me the Details <p> Go over the details and the specifics of your event right off the bat . Make sure that all your bases are covered " what kind of event is it , estimated number of guests , any special kind of request or feature you need . It 's important to know what is the earliest time they can arrive for setup , what time guest will arrive , what time do all vendors need to be out of the venue by , and how early can they arrive for tear-down . This will help let the AV team know how much staff they will need to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many hours any AV engineers will need to be on site should you need one or a team to run and manage the electronics . <h> 2 . What Services Do They Offer ? <p> Another important question to ask them is the reach of their services and what else they can provide going beyond rentals . Several companies would surely want to seal the deal with you and one basis that you can use as a- point of comparison would be their extra services and assistance that they can provide on the day itself . If its for a wedding , could they provide an MC if you need one . For a corporate event , could they provide an extra microphone or podium free of charge ? These are just example of questions you could throw their way so you can make sure that you 're getting the best deal there is. <h> 3 . Read Between the Lines <p> Lastly , make sure that your contract is foolproof and solid .

Here are five things you need to make crystal clear on your site , and how to communicate them visually . <h> 1 . Capacities <p> There 's nothing worse than entering negotiations only to realize that the event was n't going to fit in the first place . Today , most properties communicate capacity by square footage . <p> The problem is that no two events are alike . Planners want to know if your space works for their specific event . How would capacity change if the event needed a stage ? How many fewer people could the event hold if you added a buffet table or food stations ? Anticipate these questions and answer them visually on your site . <p> Selling It Visually : Provide more than one capacity estimate depending on specific types of events you 've hosted in the past . Share diagrams for real events at your property with a variety of seating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates for each room setup . <h> 2 . Floor Diagrams <p> Floor diagrams are your secret weapon to closing group deals . Unique layouts and furniture can transform every event space , but properties do n't always make that obvious online . <p> Selling it Visually : If you 're going to include at least one floor plan for each venue , then why not include many floor plans with every layout option ? Banquet , boardroom , cabaret , classroom , theater . Instead of forcing planners to imagine what each of these room-sets might look like , show them an example . <h> 3 . Room Measurements <p> For serious planners , accuracy and precision is everything . If your property is lax on fire codes and regulation , not only will you lose their business , but you might lose your own . <p> Room measurements determine where planners and designers have limitations , and where they 're flexible to stretch some creative muscle . <p> Selling it Visually : Without measuring , could you draw a line exactly seven inches long ? It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photography and interactive diagrams to give planners a better sense of your space . Line up a set of common furniture items such as plants , tables , staging , even vehicles ( for outdoor events ) and place them side by side in your floor-plans as comparable reference points . <h> 4 . Photos of Actual Events <p> Is your property still using photography from the day you opened ? It 's not that uncommon , but it 's also not at all enticing . Planners ( like all consumers ) gravitate towards authenticity and transparency . Breathe life into your event photography by showcasing actual events . And do n't forget the small meeting rooms too . They might not be as beautiful or inspiring , but when you lay your cards out , you 're demonstrating trustworthiness . <p> Selling it Visually : One way to be more authentic is to ditch professional photography ( at least in some cases ) . Odds are , events at your venue result in user-generated photos posted to social networks all the time . <p> Your counterparts in guest-room marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dedicate a place on your website showcasing some of the most engaging events hosted at at your venue . <h> 5 . Virtual / Video Tours <p> We 're not far from a world where you can put on a set of virtual reality glasses and step into a virtual site visit . ( Although it 's coming sooner than you think . ) In the meantime , properties can communicate the feel of their event venues with short video clips right on their site . <p> Selling it Visually : Capturing 360 video is easier than ever before , and displaying it on your site can be as simple as uploading to YouTube .

And , as a result , an event planner 's role is more critical than ever as every event provides a conduit for a business connection that is wrapped around a unique live event experience for all attendees . <p> We- asked futurist Sheryl Connelly , an expert on identifying future global and consumer trends , to connect some of the year 's mega cultural trends to the attendee live event experience " ultimately , helping event planners think like a futurist. <h> 1 ) Value Added , Multifunction Versatility <p> From smartphones to tiny homes , people are intent on getting the most purpose and utility out of everything these days " including events ! From rich content to lasting connections to stimulating activities , consider how every aspect of the event , even seemingly insignificant elements , such as cool swag , can be enhanced to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the schedule on the back of name tags , to provide attendees with an easy and convenient way to check what 's coming up next . At a time when business leaders are ultra-conscious of how they spend their time and with who , taking a step back to look at every moment of the entire experience will ensure your event provides takeaways that attendees will appreciate while leaving a lasting impact on personal learning , growth , and inspiration . <h> 2 ) Celebrate Diverse Voices <p> Outside-the-box thinking will always be a hot topic for events , yet it is often keynote speakers outside of one 's industry or organization who can deliver the fresh perspective necessary for sparking truly creative thinking . In many cases , it might even be a speaker who questions popular opinion or common practice " nearly seven out of 10 say contrarian ideas are celebrated as critical to shaping great ideas !

As an event planner , a keen awareness of society 's heightened interest in reusing , repurposing and recycling can help you develop a thoughtful approach that demonstrates your event 's commitment to the environment . With an overwhelming majority of adults globally favoring products made from recyclable content ( versus those that are n't ) , attendees will notice and appreciate that certain items are biodegradable or made from recycled materials " whether it 's the name tags , registration bags , or food cartons .

@@22008332 @2008332/ <h> 3 Reasons to Throw Your Event Tech Out The Window Today <p> There are two types of meeting planners in the world : those who have been using event technology for months ( or years ) , and those who recently started . No matter which camp you claim , chances are you feel pretty good about being a modern meeting planner using tools that are on the cutting edge of technology and efficiency . <p> Until you open the program . <p> Four months later , your eyes are bloodshot from lack of sleep , and you 're using far less shampoo on a daily basis due to all the hair you 've pulled out of your head . <p> This is all because of the three reasons you need to throw your event technology out the window , and you need to do it today . <p> Reason #1 : It 's hard to figure out <p> Yes , the demo videos on the website made it look easy . But when you start trying to customize your meeting , you 're bombarded with a slew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of more than a few fields inviting you to write your own HTML and CSS . ( I need to know HTML ? Where was that disclaimer ? ! ) <p> The truth is that so many of these fancy event technology apps are designed by programmers and developers . If you 're on the market for a new piece of technology to help solve your challenges as a meeting planner , make sure it 's made to be intuitive and efficient for YOU . You should n't need to complete 12 courses of Codecademy just to insert your branded header on every screen . <p> Reason #2 : It 's not self-managed <p> You work 15-hour days meeting with clients and coordinating with caterers . Your days are full of follow-ups , and you ca n't remember the last time your email inbox had fewer than 148 messages . After putting the kids to bed and opening that bottle of Bordeaux you 've been saving , you finally have an hour to dive into your custom meetings app . <p> But wait a second . Something needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveys need modification , or the seating arrangements need to be completely redesigned . Instead of being walked through the changes by the program , your app instructs you to call the support number . What ? ! It 's 11:30 at night , and your phone is dead and charging on the nightstand . Why ca n't you just make the modifications you need on your own ? ! <p> The truth is that your event tech needs to be self-managed . After you make your purchase and complete the onboarding , the tool should be able to handle any changes you decide to throw at it . Simple ( or even complex ) fixes should n't need the attention of developer support . If you find yourself constantly confronted with a need for third-party assistance , you need to start shopping around . <p> Reason #3 : Inter-vendor communication is bad ( or nonexistent ) <p> Your call for papers app is top-notch . But does it flow directly into your official track management program ? <p> You have a GREAT registration platform . But does it trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community environment ca n't be beat . But how well does it allow them to engage around actual session content ? <p> Maybe your event tech provider has two dozen APIs that communicate with every other vendor technology out there , but most of us are n't so lucky . Many elements of meetings correlate with related tasks , and modern meetings tech should account for those similarities and offer intuitive solutions . If you find yourself needing to manage six different vendor apps , you wo n't only confuse and frustrate yourself , but your attendees will also feel slighted by an inferior conference experience . <p> Bonus Reason : It provides analytics , but does n't tell you how to interpret the results <p> Every piece of event tech has some form of analytics function . ( If you use one that does n't , call the provider right now and cancel your contract . ) But many of them do n't tell you what any of that information actually means . <p> It 's the era of Big Data , but what good does that do any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Your attendees rated a particular block of sessions unusually low . What do those sessions have in common ? Your attendees used 113 gigabytes of data from your wireless Internet provider . But how much did they use last year ? And how much are you paying per gig this year compared to last ? <p> Your event technology ca n't stop at just providing performance metrics . It needs to tell you what those metrics actually mean ! If your recent or longstanding meetings app does n't offer any sort of data analysis alongside the actual reporting , you might need to throw it out the window . <p> Meetings technology increases efficiency , and it saves time and energy . At least it 's supposed to . Just because you 've adopted technology to help you be a better planner unfortunately does n't mean you 're realizing any of those - time or energy savings . Take a second to really look at how your tech solutions are impacting your stress level . If you realize that they could perform better , give them a call and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

As you walk through the door , you either feel elated with the endless choices of event seating- or terrified by the vast array of possibilities . Even if you 're using a seating chart generator , its important to understand attendee psychology- before choosing an event seating arrangement . <p> When designing a general session meeting , or the breakout session rooms , there is a definite method to the event seating madness . Let 's break it down : In a general session ; goals , knowledge and teamwork are to be delivered . In a breakout ; goals , knowledge and teamwork are created and built upon .

Gluten-free , low-carb or paleo ? Business formal , business attire , or business casual ? India Pale Ale , American Pale Ale , or Pale Ale ? We are used to it now . Even at work , we expect to choose our destiny and forge an individual path toward the commonly shared destination . <p> This particularly comes into play when the event seating in question is for people from different positions , backgrounds , companies , and so on . - So how do you get a melting pot of attendees to listen to the same message , but hear it in their own way so that the message is received ? Give them the choice of seat . - - <p> Psychiatrist Carl Jung defines an extrovert as someone who is greatly influenced by their environment , who is sociable and confident in unfamiliar situations , and is characterized by an outward flowing of personal energy . - This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near strangers , and does n't necessarily feel they need a desk environment to accomplish tasks .

When absorbing information , they like to take notes , to process the information they receive- and may gravitate toward tables with chairs ( a bit like their office environment , which is familiar ) . Though a table is a shared space , it has clear boundaries , unlike a sofa . <p> By giving people the choice of event seating , you are allowing them to take ownership of their experience . <h> Break Out Meetings <p> On the other side of the coin , break out meetings have a completely different function , and therefore need to be approached differently regarding room design . <p> The break out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even debate . Here , the room should be set to facilitate your goal outcome . - According to Bernardo Tirado , PMP , in his article in Psychology Daily ; where people are placed at a table can greatly effect how they participate . When positioned at the heads of a table , those individuals become the leaders . Also , when people are placed at square tables , they are all in corner positions , isolated , and directly across from someone at all times , which is more combative and powerful . This is ideal event seating for debates , negotiation , and other more aggressive sessions . <p> However , in a round table setting ( or King Arthur Table ) , no one is able to grab a power seat , and therefore , this is better for collaboration , team building and discussion . Though there are multiple people in front of each attendee at a round table , they are neutralized by the shape , and there are people sitting next to them without corners and boundaries . <p> By thinking in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can set them up for success from the moment they sit down . <h> What does it all mean ? - <p> At the end of the day , sometimes people just sit where there is empty space , and selection can be subjective . However , by changing the room to give people choices , we give our attendees a fresh look into meetings , and subtle ways to help them integrate into the content , as opposed to being a passive guest .

@@22008350 @2008350/ <h> Play Ball : 7 Ideas for Sports Event Planning <p> There is nothing like a good sporting event to promote sportsmanship and friendly competition . When it comes to sports event planning , there may be some questions running through your mind over what is required in terms of logistics and venue layout . <p> Here are a few ideas to help you organize an event that is fun and safe for participants and spectators alike . <h> 1 . Do n't Cut the Game Short <p> Regardless of the type of sport , games should be long enough for participants to at least break a sweat . It 's understandable that you want to squeeze in as many matches as possible , but participants should n't feel like they 're getting the short end of the stick just so you can maximize profit . <p> With that in mind , a basketball or soccer match should n't be a mere two three-minute rounds . If it 's a triathlon , it should n't be only two short obstacles that can be completed in five minutes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize matches between teams that did not advance ; this way , they get equal playing time . <p> It 's not unusual for games to be delayed , and it 's very possible that the event as a whole may end later than expected . Even if this is the case , do n't compensate by curtailing the game time if it can be helped . Perhaps you can shorten the intermission time or speed up the venue-cleanup instead . <h> 2 . Waiver of Liability <p> It 's a sporting event we 're talking about here , so there 's the real possibility of someone getting hurt . Injuries can cause serious liability issues . This is why event organizers should require all participants or parents of participants to sign a waiver of liability as part of the registration process . <p> On the subject of injuries , you should also have medical personnel on standby , or at the very least , their number on standby . You should also have a first aid kit available for minor injuries like a cut or scrape . Ideally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some level of medical training , or is at least able to identify common illnesses like dehydration or heat stroke . <h> 3 . Dressing Rooms/Lockers <p> The venue should have a dressing room or locker area where participants can change into their uniforms . The rooms should be divided by gender . If no such rooms exist , then are there rooms , such as a large storage closet , that can be improvised as a dressing area ? This is a pivotal question to ask the venue administrator . <p> Determine ahead of time the location of these rooms . It 's also important to ensure that these rooms are OPEN on event day . It 's not unusual for separate rooms in a venue to be locked if they 're not expected to be in use . The facility 's custodian should have the keys to all the rooms . It will not reflect well on your organization if participants have to get changed out in the open in the back of the facility " all because you did n't bother checking to see if dressing rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockers are available , encourage guests to use them and bring their own lock . Emphasize that you 're not responsible for lost or stolen equipment/gear. <h> 4 . Trophies/Medals <p> Award the winning team or top participant . It does n't matter if you hand out trophies , medals , or ribbons as long as you acknowledge the top-placing competitors . You can also have winners stand up on one of those 1st/2nd/3rd place pedestals . This is a good way of allowing winners to feel like they really accomplished something while friends and families take pictures . <p> It 's also highly recommended that you hand out participation trophies if you 're hosting a youth sporting event . Children need to be incentivized for their efforts . If they walk away without some sort of physical token , it could discourage them from competing in the future or even prompt them to quit the sport altogether . <p> Here 's another helpful tip about trophies if you 're running a for-profit event . You can set aside a trophy customization table . For a small fee , participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , date , and name of event . This can be done using a trophy sticker label printer . <h> 5 . Handling Complaints and Grievances <p> Sporting events should be about fun and not about winning . However , it 's inevitable that you will have a few participants complain or dispute the results . <p> This is common in youth sports where parents will argue a judge 's or referee 's call on their child 's behalf . You should have someone knowledgeable in the sport that can address these grievances in a calm manner while also backing up the official 's decisions . <h> 6 . Market the Event <p> Use a combination of social media and offline marketing to promote the event . You should also reach out to coaches and instructors of the given sport . If it 's a softball tournament , reach out to little league coaches from schools and city recreation programs . <p> If it 's an individual endurance race , reach out to members of a gym or fitness class . With social media , you can look for sports-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The marketing material is also where you ask for volunteers if needed . If it 's a youth sporting event , ask the parents of the participants if they 're willing to become volunteer staff , perhaps in return for allowing their kids to compete free of charge . <h> 7 . Organize Varying Styles of Competition <p> Hold different styles of the sport . Instead of just a basketball match , how about also organizing a three-point shooting contest on the side ? For a tag football game , how about a side activity seeing who can punt the ball the farthest ? <p> This is just a nice way of mixing things up a bit , allowing competitors to test their skills in a different way . You can also hold separate trophies or prizes for these side events . With respects to these side competitions , you can also have spectators compete . <p> A sporting event is a terrific way to bring everyone together in the spirit of competition .

@@22008376 @2008376/ <h> 5 Event Technology Trends Shaping the Future of Events <p> The event planning industry has come a long way from the binder-toting , paper-based system of the near distant memory of the early 2000 's . Today , advances in technology have led to sweeping improvements in the events management field . These improvements have streamlined and consolidated our meeting systems , making it easier for event planners to get their jobs done . This age in which we live is one of innovation through automation in all business fields , but most relevantly to this post , we consider meeting planning automation . <p> In no particular order , here are the 5 most important event technology trends that will have a significant effect on the event planning industry as a result of meeting planning automation . <h> RFID <p> Radio frequency identification is , in my humble opinion , the wave of the future . I recently attended a conference where I watched a presentation given by Will Travis , co-founder of Sid Lee . Travis explained how his company incorporated RFID technology into their C2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away by just how many aspects of an event were improved by implementing an RFID system . In addition to speeding up registration time , incorporating RFID technology into events will help with both qualitative and quantitative data analysis , thereby making it easier for planners to target what worked during their event and what did n't . In this way , it will be easier to foster repeat attendees . RFID also has the potential to allow attendees to become more engaged with the event across various social platforms . Raffles and contests can be entered and the winners determined ; pictures can be sent , social media can be updated , - and check-in can all be done and ( more importantly monitored ) , using RFID technology . <h> Multi-Use Apps <p> Event apps have taken the industry by storm in the last few years . Gone are the days where bulky , paper event guides are thrust at attendees to explain different activities , break down the event schedule , and give speaker information . Instead , event apps have incorporated all these aspects , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can socialize with other participants , and expand their network , before , during and after an event . <p> Though event apps are admittedly helpful , they now have a new hurdle to face . Producing an application to be used for one event is costly , time consuming , and inefficient , as users must learn how to interact with the app for each new event attended . Phone storage space is very important to consumers . Many are hesitant to download an application that they will only use once . Thus , event apps that can continue to deliver value to customers beyond the date of the event itself , are going to become a huge trend . <h> Wearable Technology <p> Google Glass and smart watches from tech giants such as Samsung and Apple are indicative of the future popularity of wearable technology . The possibility for incorporation into event planning are endless . Wearable tech has the potential to revamp everything from the site inspection process , to food and beverage . Menu options , travel directions , appointment updates , facial recognition software and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways that event planners will soon be able to use wearable tech . <h> Virtual Reality ( VR ) <p> Virtual Reality is another relatively new form of technology that can change the future of events . Virtual information booths are a new trend at meetings and conferences . BizBash employed two of these helpful virtual assistants at their Innovation Expo in October to answer frequently asked attendee questions , and to disseminate specific booth information to attendees . VR is a great way to up attendee engagement during events . Combining the uses of VR with the portability of wearable technology is going to be the future of event management . <h> Social Media <p> We all know by now that social media is here to stay . Many of us , ( thankfully ) are also at a place where we understand that a proper social media campaign is the backbone of any event . Social ads have replaced mailing lists . Attendees are making choices about what events to attend based on who else in their social media circles are going . Mobile user engagement is steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blog , professionals trust information that comes from social media just about as much as they trust information received from other sources .

As event profs , we must make sure that our social media strategies keep up with the times , lest our attendees leave us in the proverbial dust . <p> Event technology trends aside , the number one thing for any event professional to remember , is to let your tools work for you , rather than the other way around . The purpose of implementing advanced technology is to make your life , and the life of those whom you plan events for , as easy as possible .

Or was the cancellation due to your actions throughout the planning process ? <p> If the situation was out of your control , then the best thing you can do is send sincere apologies over to your clients and let them know they can reach out if they need to get in touch with you .

Your contract should have a clause that ensures your deposit is non-refundable , regardless of what situation arises . In addition , consider designating percentages for certain periods of time " for example , if the event is canceled within three months , you will receive 75% of the fees , whereas you would receive 100% if canceled within 90 days in advance . You did the work , so you deserve to be paid for it . <p> Of course , there are some exceptions and it 's always best to consider each situation on a case-by-case basis .

Share it to your social media profiles and your website , as well as any industry groups that you are a part of .

Size of Wedding Party : - For larger wedding parties consider where the group will stand . In tight circular or spiral layouts there may not be room for larger wedding parties to stand and you do n't  want bridesmaids hovering over seated guests . <p> 3 .

@@22008393 @2008393/ <h> Building Successful Relationships Between Event Professionals <p> In any professional environment , its the combination of radically different opinions that often lead to the best results . However , in some cases , those differing opinions come with differing personalities which can bring tension to any- situation . In the events industry , this can be especially distressing if it starts to get in the way of progress . With this in mind , it is essential for all event professionals to work with one another to ensure a smooth and seamless planning process for the client . <p> Here are just a few ways to do your part in building relationships with other event professionals , without causing a headache for anyone else . <h> Be Open <p> This is a major one . I probably do n't need to tell you that communication and collaboration is key to a well-planned event . If you have something to say or an idea for a part of the event , it 's important to be open and honest about it . Events involve a lot of missing pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known or else it could get overlooked . For example , if you need a gluten-free vendor meal , be sure the planner and caterer are well aware in advance so they can plan ahead to take care of your needs . <p> At the same time , you will need to return the favor by responding to those who do reach out to you . Whether you get an email to ask for approval on something or a phone call to discuss the next steps , it 's important that you respond promptly and appropriately . For example , we send out timelines early on in the process and , when we do n't hear anything , we go ahead and finalize it . However , we often have other vendors contacting us just days before the event to tell us the timeline does not work for them . Whether its a relationship with you A/V provider , rental company , or speaking partners , there 's no such thing as " over-communicating " Make the effort to be responsive and everybody will be satisfied . <h> Be Patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that does not justify impatience in any capacity . There is no reason for a vendor to be pushing themselves to the front of the buffet line or forcing themselves through a crowd of guests just in the mix . A planner is present to ensure that everyone has the best time possible " both guests and the vendors . There is a schedule for a reason , so do n't try and speed things up on the day of the celebration , it will just make things uncomfortable for everyone . <h> Be Present <p> This is one I have seen more often and it refers to the day of the actual event . You are there for one thing and that is to do your job . Event professionals should be just that " professional . Unless it is an emergency , you should not be texting or making phone calls that distract you from what you are contracted to do . If something comes up , let the coordinator know so they can help to appease the situation . Otherwise , it may just seem like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Be Cooperative <p> Although you may be contracted to handle one part of the event , do n't be afraid to offer a helping hand to others if you find that you have the time . There is never any harm in helping out ! At the same time , be sure to communicate any day-of plans to the rest of the event team so everybody is on the same page . For example , we always appreciate when photographers let us know if they are going to move something around or take a guest of honor with them rather than catching us off-guard when the main speaker is missing . <p> When it comes down to it , all you have to do is play nice and get along with the rest of the event team . That does not mean that you have to agree with them on every point , but it does require a willingness to work together to ensure a perfect event . <p> Join us on Twitter @socialtables or share a comment below to let us know about your experience building relationships in the event industry .

@@22008414 @2008414/ <h> 2 Simple Ways to Change the RFP Process <p> Reality Check : Meetings and events require a soul , and are successful because of a whole series of collaborations . These collaborations require people : from a client or an agency , a hotel or DMC , a producer or AV supplier , content producers , speakers , entertainers , stage builders or scenic designers ; and these collaborations require operations : from marketing to digital ( web , social media , content ) , print , registration and mobile applications . <p> They must all come together to build a roadmap to a successful event . Planners and designers must ensure brand consistency , create wow ! environments , and deliver experiences that engage , captivate , and build loyalty through a complete attendee journey . It is only through inspiring each individual attendee that planners are able to deliver to the highest level of expectation . <p> Where does each journey start ? With an RFP . Yes , I said it , people . The ingredient often neglected in the planning process is a well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In a long ago conversation with David Merrell , THE Design Dawg of AOO Events , we explored the challenges inherent of the current RFP model specifically those of buying the creative services of events . <p> The current model where a planner ( or the planners agency ) sends out an RFP to multiple production houses , or one in which DMCs request fully costed , " creative , **37;59;TOOLONG " ideas with complete imagery , fly-throughs etc. without even committing to either a specific idea or the organization is lunacy . <p> It not only costs thousands of dollars in submission time , it more importantly takes out the most important element of the process a discussion . David Merrell points out , and I wholeheartedly agree , that our model needs to be much more similar to that of an architect or interior designer . This involves examining a portfolio of work , meeting the designer to see if this is someone who " gets " you and your needs that all important and an intangible must-have piece and then you hire them . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative need for your project . <p> This post-hire conversation should take place to ensure clear articulation of the objectives , while exploring the various avenues which may be taken to achieve the goals . This collaboration leads to mutual trust , and an open forum for sharing ideas . This process can not be as successful when creation no matter how fantastic happens in a vacuum . <h> Bring Back the Respect <p> The next change that needs to be made in the RFP process is the consideration of one another 's time . Sending an RFP to 50 properties when a planner is really only interested in 3 makes no sense , and is a waste of time for the 47 people who have seen the RFP and taken the time to respond . <p> Consider the factors that go into a person 's response to an RFP submission : a sense of optimism at locking in a new opportunity , the time and initiative they have to execute to ensure they met at least the majority of the spec by searching the space , perhaps met with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation of a response . That 's a significant time commitment . <p> Additionally , when first responding to an RFP , much of this is done without the true context of knowing the meetings nuances , or the planners specific needs . There is no type of trust building relationship . When considering that 47/50 of these proposals will not even be looked at by the planner , this exercise nears the level of futility . <p> I have been the planner , the agency producer , and the DMC . I now sit on the side of a technology provider , with a product and service specific to the meeting and event industry . This goes to say that I have experienced the RFP process from all sides . <p> Is there one solution for fixing RFP ? No . That would be like saying that my company could offer one commoditized solution that will fit every event .

Some of the money raised may also have to be used to cover the overhead . It makes sense then to set a budget and stick to it .

Follow these tips when choosing a venue- during charity event planning : <p> Choose a venue that fits with your theme . If it 's a moonlight garden theme , for example , then there should be outdoor access . <p> Have enough space to accommodate the expected turnout as well as additional equipment , such as game booths . <p> Consider a venue that is routinely used for high-profile charity events . This way , you can market the venue as such . <p> Some venues are also perfect for certain types of charity events .

It can also include inspirational stories of how peoples ' lives were positively impacted due to charity groups like your own . <p> During charity event planning , you can also link to photos or videos that illustrate why your cause is so important . Social media is also a platform for raising funds before the event . Think along the lines of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge . Perhaps you can do something similar .

@@22008442 @2008442/ <h> 6 Simple Steps for Better Post-Event Engagement <p> Your work is n't over when the last guest exits the venue . In fact , it 's just getting started . When it comes to post-event engagement , you have much more to do to nurture your potential guests to ensure they take desirable action that convert to higher ROI . The key is to stay in touch with the attendees through a variety of social media approaches . <h> 1 . ) Post-Event Survey <p> A post-event engagement survey is perhaps the simplest way to gauge attendee satisfaction , or lack of it . The results provide valuable metrics with data on what went well and what did n't go so well . The survey should be sent within 12 hours after the event and include questions where guests rate various parts of the event . This can be a 1-to-10 scale asking questions , such as : <p> For a low rating , such as a five or below , ask guests what was it in particular that caused them to give a low score . Surveys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount code , to increase participation . <h> - <h> 2 . ) Networking Event <p> Are your followers following each other ? After the event , you can set up a smaller follow-up event where attendees return . This time , though , the goal is just for returning guests to mingle a second time and get to know each other . This can be a live event or a remote one . Either way , there should be a facilitator . If the attendees were from all over the map , then identify locations where attendees within a geographical area can meet up . <p> If you prefer a simpler approach , then consider creating a temporary forum where a moderator can start threads and facilitate discussions regarding anything related to the event . People who attend the same event have a common interest , and a networking event creates a community where discussion of your company or broader industry remains fresh . <h> 4 . ) Give Back <p> Your attendees did you a huge favor by attending the event . By all means , send a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your gratitude to the next level . Show guests that you really appreciate their attendance by giving them something of actual value . This can be a simple discount code . However , something more physically tangible may be more appropriate . How about a mail-in , handwritten thank-you card with a gift card inside ? <p> A thank you gift should be sent within 24 hours after the event . However , you can also send additional gifts afterwards to show that you have n't forgotten . By the time the next event rolls around , for example , you can send them a personal invitation or exclusive early bird special deal . Let them know that this offer is a thank you for attending the previous event all those months ago . <h> 5 . ) Host a Social Media Contest <p> Some of your guests may experience post-event blues . This is why you do n't want the fun to stop after the event . Give guests some small stuff to look forward to . One way is some kind of social media contest with a prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps a funny photo or caption contest using a pic taken during the event using the event hashtag . The winner can be the one that gets the most votes or likes . The entries essentially become user generated content that furthers market your brand through post-event engagement . Send an email announcing the winner as well as those that came in second and third . Also be sure every participant gets a consolation prize , such as a code good for a small discount . <h> 6 . ) Extend Event-Only Offers <p> The day after your event is a golden window of opportunity to push your goals . If a product was launched at the event , then continue to push the product within that 24-hour opportunity . If the product was made available for the first time at the event and was also sold at a discount , then extend that offer for an additional 24 hours and only to the attendees . Likewise , if you hosted a charity event , make it known what your donation goals were and continue to encourage the donations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social media promotions for post-event engagement should continue even once everything has concluded . This not only keeps the discussions going but also helps you maintain a connection with your guests who otherwise may direct their attention to a competing brand . <p> Dan McCarthy is an Event Manager at JD Parties , an event management company based in the UK .

As professionals , we have an obligation to keep up with industry trends so that we can provide the best service for our company , employer , members , and attendees . <p> One industry designation that stands out in the crowd is the Certified Meeting Professional ( CMP ) . <p> If you want the textbook definition , the CMP designation ( from Convention Industry Council or CIC ) is the " foremost certification of the meetings , conventions and exhibitions industry ; and the program recognizes individuals who have achieved the industrys highest standard of professionalism . Established in 1985 , the CMP credential benefits meeting professionals through : " <p> Recognition : As the premier industry certification , the CMP distinguishes holders as career professionals who have demonstrated a high level of experience , skill , and knowledge . <p> Competitive Advantage : The designation conveys credibility to a meeting professionals opinions and ideas , both at work and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peer Acceptance : CMPs are immediately recognized by other CMPs as fellow professionals committed to the advancement of the profession . <p> Salary Enhancement : CMPs can use the certification as a competitive advantage when it comes to negotiating salaries and other business . <p> Personal Achievement : After passing a rigorous application and examination process , CMPs express a profound sense of personal achievement at finally being regarded as the exceptionally skilled professional they are . <p> Commitment : Successful completion of the certification process conveys that the certified meeting professional is committed and goal driven in their career . <p> The reasons behind earning the CMP designation is different for everyone . Your own reasons may not even be listed above . What can it do for you ? Will your employer recognize the significance ? - The downside of our industry is that many available jobs that include meeting or event planning are still listed under Administrative/Clerical which unfortunately means that employers can justify lower starting salaries . - This varies from area to area and state to state . - Thankfully , more and more employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CMP designation ! That 's great news ! <p> Every single one of us can think of someone who as an Administrative Professional is given the duty of planning meetings without any prior experience or training . - It just becomes part of your job . Maybe that person WAS you because it used to be me. 12 years ago , I was hired as the Office Manager/Administrative Assistant for a nonprofit trade association , and found myself , like many of - us do in the nonprofit world , with several responsibilities that just do n't  fit the job description . - Anyway , two years later I was put in charge of handling the events ; a responsibility I eagerly sought out , but what did I know about planning a conference ? Very little , other than being enthusiastic and detail oriented ( two great skills ! ) . - Could I know more ? Absolutely . Would knowing more benefit our members ? Our attendees , speakers , AV company , vendors , suppliers , etc. ? - You bet it would ! <p> In March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined Meeting Professionals International , the Northeastern New York Chapter , because one of the many benefits to joining the local chapter was access to free CMP study groups and a number of experts in the industry . <p> Of course , things never stay the same ! In 2009 , Convention Industry Council ( CIC ) partnered with MPI ( see MPI and CIC to Partner on Enhancement of CMP Credential ) and in January 2010 a new and improved application process was released . - But that 's a good thing , it means we are keeping up with the evolving world of events ! The industry changes continuously , we need to be prepared . <p> I am proud to have earned the designation , although for me it did not equal a monetary reward ; there is still a long way to go to educate employers in my area about the benefits of hiring meeting professionals and especially those who are CMP's. - The reward for me was very personal , I felt that it took my career to the next level and made me stand out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on many- occasions- that when " CMP " follows your name , suppliers and vendors feel more secure doing business with you , because they are doing business with a meeting professional who understands the industry . <p> So should you jump on this bandwagon ? I say go for it . - There 's nothing to lose , only everything to gain . - Those of us with this coveted designation bring a higher level of professionalism , connections and quality to the job which benefits the company in ways they may not have realized yet . Suppliers , especially hotels , take CMPs more seriously , industry options open up , you bring more to the table and you have a better working knowledge of the industry .

@@22008560 @2008560/ <p> It 's time to reexamine how the events industry is explained , understood and approached in conversation . The glamorizing of the event planner in mainstream media has left out the importance of the strategic thinking needed by event professionals to be successful . <p> This is the first of a three part blog series , which will focus on an updated perspective to explaining the complex world of the events industry . The series will combine event and meeting planners , designers and managers into one term : the event professional . <p> The traditional means of categorizing events as social or corporate is antiquated . Social events and meetings can have business components , and business events can have social components . Therefore , the focus should be on how events are positioned either as a tool for revenue generation or as an expense platform where raising awareness , celebration or education is the primary focus with the possibility of revenue generation as a secondary or long-term goal ( see Figure 1 ) . <p> According to a study conducted by IBISWorld US , the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was a 6% increase over the previous year with 2015 trending to generate $4.5 billion . The industry caters to both corporate and individual clients , each of which demands different services and is affected by divergent factors . Therefore , how one describes the very nature of events is determined primarily by how the client wants to use events positioned for fulfilling their needs . Throughout my years working within the events industry , the work performed differed depending on the organization but the tool that was used was the same : events . Working as a promotions manager for an agency , my primary responsibility was to align my Fortune 500 client 's product(s) to the market by identifying activities that could bring the product into the hands of the consumer at events ( e.g. golf tournaments , art shows , charity events , etc . ) . It required many hours of evaluating the impact of that event by examining proposals , speaking with the event organizers and selling the risk/reward to the client . The client needed a solid business case for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on investment ( ROI ) and I better make it at least 3x more in value than what they were paying for , which was much easier said than done because the results may not be revealed for a long time post-event . <p> Tip : Event professionals , if your event requires financial and/or in-kind resources , make sure that your proposal is customized to the needs of your fellow event professional . Help them out by giving them all the information to make a case for them to invest in your event . <p> Figure 1 . Event Profession Approach <p> While the expense side of the events industry proved to be highly influential ( externally ) and highly disappointing at the same time due to all of the rejections you have to give other event pros , transitioning over to the revenue generating side served to be highly influential ( internally ) and highly results-driven which was very rewarding . As a sales manager for a hospitality organization , my responsibility was to generate revenue for the company using events ( e.g. incentive , celebrations , life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face interaction where both individuals and organizations trusted that the event produced would be planned and executed based of their perception of success , which varied according to each guest . The need to meet the organization 's sales goals monthly was explicit from my employer but the satisfaction perception by the guests was only explicit after receiving their post-event surveys which were both revealed relatively quickly i.e. in the short term . The flexibility of serving two stakeholders simultaneously required a more complex set of interpersonal skills . <p> Tip : Event professionals , if you are using events as a tool to generate revenue for your organization , remember your professionalism will be tested by your interaction with your company and with your guests . But the immediate feedback and rewards are motivators to keep you going . <p> By re-examining the events industry using a different approach may help explain the strategic value Eventprofs bring to the entire business community .

A week later the contract was signed. - <p> Now you 've gotten the audio visual proposal from the in-house vendor , and you 've fallen off your chair . It 's high . Really high . You get comparable pricing from another local vendor and it 's 1/3 less money . You call your venue contact to complain , but , alas , there 's nothing she can do . The contract clearly states you must use the in-house vendor . <p> Congratulations . You 've just fallen victim to one of the most common , but avoidable , mistakes made in site selection by novice ( and often experienced ) planners : Not evaluating the FULL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simply comparing the venue quotes is like comparing apples to golf clubs , a totally useless exercise . At the end of the day , when the R.O.I . is evaluated , everyone looks at what you spent on the entire program , not just the venue . <h> Solutions <p> Your venue comparison grid , therefore , needs to show the full cost of hosting the event at each space. - It 's more work , to be sure , and it takes a little longer to put together , but anything else is really flying blind . <p> Here are a handful of venue-related items that can impact total event pricing : <h> Exclusive In-House A/V <p> There 's a big difference between being a recommended vendor , which is optional , and an exclusive one , which is required . When a vendor is exclusive there 's no competitive bidding involved , so there 's no incentive for them to drop their prices. - In addition , exclusive in-house A/V vendors often pay commissions of 30-50% back to the venue . There 's nothing illegal , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But with commission rates that high , it can impact the price you pay . <p> If you 're able to bring in your own vendor , the venue may assess an electrical charge for usage and/or personnel to liaise with your vendor . Be sure to check this in advance , and include in your costs . <p> Negotiate your A/V costs BEFORE booking the venue , and put the in house pricing into your venue comparison grid . Tell your venue contact that the in-house A/V pricing will be part of their pricing , and often you can get them to lean on their vendor to make sure they are priced affordably . <p> Some venues come fully designed to meet your needs , while others are more raw ' . For example , if your event needs a stage , a venue with one already built in can save considerable money on several fronts : the cost of renting the staging , the labor to load it in and set it up , and additional time to rent the space to install the stage . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , furniture or props to give the space a certain look ' ; you 're far better finding a space that already has those things in place . But if not , make sure those costs are factored in as well . <h> Travel Costs <p> If you 're paying for the attendees ' travel , this needs to be accounted for in your venue pricing . Two venues might be priced the same , but if one requires bussing , whereas the other is walkable , that changes the equation . <h> Early Access for Rehearsals &amp; Set Up <p> If your presenters want to rehearse , remember that this usually needs to be done once the all the staging , audio , lighting and projection is finished , so speakers can simulate the conditions of their speeches , and the tech team can adjust accordingly .

And be sure to look at speeds for both downloading and uploading data .

The location sets up several integral parts of an event , such as the date and tone . With that in mind , be sure that you have considered everything from venue rules and catering options to lighting options and logistics when touring a space . <p> Let 's jump in and take a look at what factors you need to be looking for as a planner when selecting a venue . <p> Before setting foot onto a venue property , it 's important to compile a checklist of all the must-haves you 're looking for . The list is different for everyone based on what kind of event you 're planning , but some of the items that I always make sure to include are the choice of suppliers that fit with the level of the event , property rules , logistics access and technical capabilities . It 's also smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure not to miss anything . <h> The Location <p> When you 're beginning the process of location scouting , one of your first decisions is the where . Should it be downtown , uptown , or a little outside of town ? There is no wrong or right answer in this situation , but it should be based on the tone , attendee list , and budget of the event . No matter where the location ends up being , there will be pros and cons to consider . In terms of logistics , a downtown or uptown event tends to be more convenient for things like vendor meetings and site visits . However , if you are based in an expensive area , the convenience of these venues will come up at a premium cost . Going outside of town will certainly be a budget saver , but could make logistics a bit more challenging , and it may limit the number of folks who attend . <h> The First Impression <p> A venue 's first impression is of utmost importance- it sets the stage for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your venue contact say a lot about how your experience is going to be throughout the planning process . Were they prompt to respond to your initial message ? Have they been prompt since then ? Did they send you the information you asked for ? During the tour , be sure to pay attention to how you are interacting with one another . If you 're not getting a good vibe , that could be a red flag and a recipe for a terrible experience . <p> Additionally , pay attention to how well they are able to answer your questions . Do they seem knowledgeable about the property ? You want to make sure that you are dealing with people that can give you the best information to avoid confusion down the road . <h> What 's Included <p> Venues will often include extras like tables , linens , and chairs when you book with them . While this can sometimes work out in your favor both logistically and within the budget , there are also occasions where you should respectfully decline . Never agree to use what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may not be up to the standards of the event you 're putting together . Make sure the linens are clean and both the tables and chairs are in good , working condition . If you 've seen everything and decide you do n't want to use it , be sure to clear it with the venue team before signing anything so everyone is on the same page . <p> Also , remember to consider things like flow of the space . Do you picture guests moving smoothly through the space from one thing to the next ? Are the aesthetics what you 're looking for in terms of the tone ? <p> Fabrice believes that imagination has no limits . If you can imagine it , Fabrice will create it .

Since its inception in 2003 , the event has grown- to more than 170,000 attendees and spans the entire of city of San Francisco . This year , event venues included the historic Moscone Center , the Marriott Marquis , InterContinental Hotel , the Palace Hotel , Hilton Union- Square and The Park Central . And that does n't  even cover attendee housing . The event organizers at Dreamforce actually charted massive cruise liners and docked them in the port of San Francisco- to meet housing demands . <p> Software giant , Salesforce uses the event as a platform to talk about upcoming products , educate customers and prospects , and create an environment where attendees can learn more from each other . In the spirit of education , we flew Rachel Dobroth and Ray Miller from Social Tables out to San Francisco and asked them to report back on exactly how Dreamforce got attendees to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out . <h> How Did Dreamforce- Engage Attendees ? <h> 1 . Campfire Story Theater <p> This years Dreamforce took attendees back to camp . Every venue had a totally different look and feel , but they kept the same overall theme across the entire conference. - One series of education sessions was set around a " campfire " which served as a perfect analogy for costumers sharing stories and insights related to the product . <h> 2 . Event Scavenger Hunt <p> One of the biggest challenges for an event of this scale is getting attendees to see as much - of it as possible . The planners behind Dreamforce- wanted to encourage attendees to check out new installments or experiences that they typically- would n't have in years prior . To do this , Dreamforce staged a massive city-wide scavenger hunt . Once you arrived at a new venue or a new area in the convention hall , you could pick up a piece of flare or trinket to prove your- conquest . By the end of the conference , attends were brandishing their accolades and trading buttons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events are taking cues from the Pokemon Go phenomenon . <h> 4 . Event App #appycamper <p> No modern event of this scale is complete without a custom event app . So what made the event app at Dreamforce stand out ? - For one it made it simple to manage wifi from location to location . Nothing is more annoying to an attendee than having to figure out the wifi password and re-connect as they jump from building to building . The #AppyCmper event app solved all of that and made it possible for attendees to enter on password and stay connected everywhere in the city . <p> Additionally , with an event so big most of the keynotes and education sessions will reach capacity ( and fast ) . That 's why Dreamforce set multiple times for the most popular sessions and used the event app to send timely push notifications before the most popular sessions . Attendees that missed a session the first time could set a quick reminder to catch the re-run . Right in the app. <h> 5 . Cloud Expo Hall <p> The Cloud Expo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show off their latest tools and drive some serious leads . This year the expo hall was as big as ever but there was one common thread that linked the ways each company tried to engage . Social Validation . Companies like Slack , the business chat app , created a " chat wall " where anyone on the show floor could have their message displayed on a big screen . It makes attendees feel more like a part of the brand , as show-goers walk around the show floor , its impossible for them to miss seeing their colleagues names and faces projected across the room . <p> Overall , Dreamforce did a really good job- engaging people at different levels . It 's layered , it has a lot to offer to people that go every year , or even it 's just your first time . How do you engage attendees at your events ? Join us on Facebook and let us know. -

These days , you have an arsenal of devices at your disposal to take notes , view PowerPoints , and Tweet up a virtual storm . <p> After all , people rely on you to tell them about every single minute of the event. - Right ? <p> And you take these responsibilities seriously ! Your laptop is an ultra-portable , Bluetooth-enabled marvel of technology . Your tablet is the latest in lightweight , high-pixel swank . And your mobile phone can call up any app in less than a microsecond . <p> But then it happens . Everyones worst fears are realized . Right in the middle of an Instagram caption , just as you finish typing the official conference hashtag , right before you can tap the SEND button , it happens. - The conference Wi-Fi goes out . <p> They may as well have just shut off the oxygen . <p> Suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cell phones are being violently shaken as people begin asking each other the same questions : - " Is your Wi-Fi working ? " " Did the Wi-Fi go out ? " " What are we supposed to do now ? ! " <p> But you have a plan . You 're no stranger to the fickleness of modern Wireless Fidelity . You know what to do when the Wi-Fi goes out . <p> 1 . Disable your device Wi-Fi <p> If the Wi-Fi is truly out , you 'll know it right away . However , no one is going to tell your phone . <p> Your wireless devices , if left in Wi-Fi mode , will continue to search for a Wi-Fi network . This comes at a cost to your battery . The combination of constant use and vainly searching for a Wi-Fi signal is a recipe for quick battery death . Give your gadgets some extra life and disable the Wi-Fi function until you confirm that the signal is back . <p> 2 . Do n't  enable your wireless hotspot <p> Switching your mobile phone into a Wi-Fi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this situation to enable connectivity for your other devices . After all , if the conference ca n't provide decent Wi-Fi , you 'll just have to provide it , yourself . <p> But there are a couple problems with this philosophy . First , you stand to become the village hotspot if you have n't configured your device to be secure . How would your carrier feel about you accidentally providing Wi-Fi over their 4G connection for a dozen other attendees ? Probably not very well , and it will be reflected on your next bill . <p> Second , too many wireless connections on a 4G tower can bring data transfer rates to a standstill . Instead of using the convenient mobile data connection for your own personal Wi-Fi , you could potentially contribute to the loss of 4G capability for everyone in the building . <p> 3 . Pick your sessions before the conference starts <p> This is one of the most important things you can do to plan for the unexpected . Conferences are making the green move toward paperless show guides , and its now commonplace for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app . <p> Native apps are good , but they tend to exclude attendees with certain types of phones and tablets . Mobile web apps are more inclusive , but they typically rely on a constant Wi-Fi signal to maintain connectivity ( unless they support offline caching ) . <p> When the Wi-Fi goes out , be sure that you know where your session list is hosted . To be absolutely certain , its best to pick your schedule beforehand and then export it to your personal or work calendar ( if your confidence app supports this functionality ) . <p> 4 . Schedule your meetings in advance <p> Arguably the biggest benefit of attending an industry conference is the opportunity to network with other attendees and speakers . Quick meetings over coffee and business card exchanges at happy hour are how new relationships are formed and new clients are landed . <p> An amenity of your event app is likely the ability to sort through the conference community and identify potential attendees with whom youd like to meet . ( Bonus points if the app supports social filtering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be there , too . ) <p> If your app is truly meant for rock stars , then you can also schedule 1-on-1 meetings directly from the app while on your phone or tablet . ( If not , consider throwing it out the window . ) But if the Wi-Fi goes out , you 'll be unable to find new connections and schedule new meetings . <p> Before the conference starts , sort through the attendee and exhibitor list and make those connections in advance . That way , you 'll be one step ahead of a shaky Wi-Fi network . <p> 5 . Tell your conference organizers what you expect <p> Not all conference apps are created equal . Some handle every aspect of content management and the digital experience for attendees , speakers , and exhibitors , alike . Others may only perform a single function . Some will still thrive in an environment void of a dependable Wi-Fi while others will lose all functionality . <p> Your conference organizers strive to provide a good experience for you , but they cant do it alone . Youve got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If session calendaring and 1-on-1 meeting management are important to you , say so ! Send them an email or let them know on Twitter when they announce the conference . <p> It 's up to all of us to keep things moving when the Wi-Fi goes out . Give your organizers good feedback , and do your fellow attendees a favor by being smart in the absence of a strong wireless signal .

Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but those are systems that can be applied or adapted anywhere ; those will never replace the personal touch and local expertise in a broader sense . <p> Finally , I would recommend to rely on the native experts as a team in the destination , where all players in the local terrain play their respective role : the Destination Marketing Organization ( the CVB ) as the first stop to discover the versatility of the host city ; the PCO for purposes of negotiating power &amp; generating efficiencies ; the DMC to connect with the best suppliers of varying natures through program components and CSR alternatives that warrant the best experience ; and of course the hotel and venue executives who will always be there to complement the host committee . <h> About Our Guest : <p> Eduardo Chaillo , CMP , CMM , CASE is the Global General Manager , Latin America and Mexico for Maritz Travel and Experient and the Founder of Global Meetings and Tourism Specialists .

It 's no longer enough to put out the best team , or have the newest stadium . Schools are now fighting for their fan 's attention and resources from a competitor that has been luring away the once devoted stadium devotees : the cozy confines of the individual fan 's living room . <p> To combat this shift , schools are now beginning to employ the exact thing that has lured fans away from their stadiums : technology . <h> WiFi <p> During football games , WiFi is a necessity , not an option for schools across the nation .

During my more than 12 years at the Mexico Tourism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important context and communication is when coordinating a multi-cultured event . In this post , I 'll share my insights with you , and show you the questions every planner should consider when planning cross-cultural events . <p> The meetings and events industry is becoming more and more global due to the need for expanding markets , the exposure we now have of regions ( its economies , political and social status ) , and the evolution of the communication tools-media . For this reason , meeting professionals need to urgently develop skills to navigate through the cultural differences that could affect results , performance , and attendee satisfaction . <p> The dissimilarities between cultures have levels so it is like an iceberg ( 80% is below the surface ) , being the behaviors and artifacts the most visible contrasts ; personal values and attitudes less visible ; and finally , the educational values/assumptions are not visible , rarely questioned and most of the times the essence of potential problems . <p> When doing business in another region of the world , it is important to understand the communication styles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others privilege the delivery over the substance of the conversation . For example , in Anglo-Saxon countries the feedback is very direct ( even the negative ) , and in Latin America or Asia you need to address any negative feedback in a very indirect , diplomatic way in order not to offend the other party . <p> Another important aspect to consider when doing business abroad is the importance of hierarchy in decision-making processes , strategic planning meetings or even the day to day operations . Again , in Asia or Latin America the conversations and processes are not precisely democratic or egalitarian , they are very vertical and you can immediately discover when something has stopped as they need the boss ' approval for even a simple procedure . So , the consensus is very difficult in those hierarchical cultures and they tend to have top-down decisions . <p> Our industry ( the face to face meetings sector ) is based in human relationships and trust , so differences in that important vehicle to enhance communications are very important . Planners have to take this varied trust factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts . In low-trust societies the bureaucracy , paperwork and legal assistance tend to be heavy and that creates a more complex relationship to planning , sourcing , or operating successful events . On the other hand , when a handshake is enough , and the personal relationship supports a long-term trusted alliance , things move easily and is more likely to have a great experience delivered to the attendee . <p> The concept of time is also another relevant cultural difference when doing business especially in Latin America , so flexibility and patience ( again the trust factors come into place ) are very recommendable , knowing that in the end the human interaction of any meeting will be privileged in this region , even with more open concept of strict timing . <p> In summary , stereotyping people from different backgrounds can lead us to erroneous assumptions .

We are continually comparing the current year to the year previous , and with the year before that . We take into consideration various economic factors and plan for the future with stats of the past . <p> As venue managers , we scour blogs , reports , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business models . And although best practices are suggested with high regard , there are additional metrics that are vital to consider when comparing the past to plan for the future . <p> There was a recent discussion hosted by IAVM on benchmarking among five highly successful venues that shed much-needed light onto the process of benchmarking and what makes the process a fundamental requirement for maintaining ( and improving ) a successful venue . If you 're unfamiliar with the concept , a guide to benchmarking , with examples of various metrics that can be compared , can be found here . <p> In joining with the decision-makers of these featured venues , we were given a deeper look into benchmarking and the benefits that come with the continued process of more efficient venue management . <h> 5 Venues with Successful Benchmarking Considerations <p> As highlighted in the image above , the venues that participated in this discussion vary widely in size , location , event type , and space offerings .

Each venue , however , values a different set of metrics. <h> 1 . ) Determine Market Specific Metrics <p> When discussing the value of various benchmarks , each venue had a list of the same considerations : wage comparisons , revenues , pricing strategies , etc . However , differentiating markets can prove value in an entirely different set of metrics . Georgia World Congress Center puts a significant amount of resources into evaluating their current security procedures with NFL standards and gauging their emergency preparedness protocols . Whereas , the Herberger Theatre Center , acting as a nonprofit venue , concentrates their benchmarking metrics around budgeting to secure financing from stakeholders and donors . <h> 2 . ) Operational Factors <p> Survey results may not always expose factors that significantly affect a venue on an executive level . Facilities like the Mayo Civic Center and the Minneapolis Convention Center operate in an event-driven model as opposed to being a full-time operation . It 's important to keep these attributing factors when performing a comparison in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Competitors <p> Benchmarking should be used to establish goals , from a venue management perspective , that are rooted in business processes and performance metrics of other companies . By evaluating facilities that you strive to compete with in the future ( may not currently be the same size ) , you can better determine where priorities should be to achieve that success . <h> Why is Benchmarking Essential ? <p> There is a significant amount of credibility based on the information that is collected from professional sources like IAVM and Pricewaterhouse Coopers . When presenting current performances or proposed renovations to stakeholders , community members , grant writers , or decision-makers having a true source of data that matches the reason to make the decision will resonate better . <p> If you would like to learn more on vital benchmarks to use for your venue , you may find additional information by downloading the full content of the webinar here .

@@22008748 @2008748/ <p> There are two main parts to negotiating hotel contracts . First , event planning teams submit a proposal to the hotel . After this initial proposal is submitted , the team and the hotel go into a series of negotiations until the final contract is drafted and signed . Before you get started , here are the two golden rules event planners should be aware of prior to contacting a hotel as a venue : <h> The Golden Rules <h> 1 . Never , ever , ever , accept your first offer . Hotels will always be able to negotiate down and offer additional benefits . <h> 2 . A hotels main goal is to increase their occupancy rate . The best way to leverage a great offer is to cater toward this goal . <h> The Proposal <p> Remember that hoteliers receive dozens of requests for venue space and room block contracts week after week . This means that when writing a proposal , pricing negotiations rely on the long-term value that you bring to the hotel as a client . Some things to think about when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Does your event or conference occur multiple times a year ? Annually ? Will you want to use the hotel as a venue more than once for several different events ? Offering a multi-year contract with a hotel is a great way to negotiate down the price and get special perks like free conference rooms and suites . <h> 2 . Rooms vs . Meeting Spaces <p> While you may be thinking about the conference rooms you need for your event , the hotel is thinking about the number of nights you can book people to stay . Remember Golden Rule #2 : the larger the sleeping room block , the lower your price will be . Make sure to make conservative estimates for attendance though because you 'll be responsible for the rooms you do n't book ! <h> 3 . Event Dates : Flexibility <p> If you 're planning far in advance and your dates for your event are flexible , make sure to communicate that immediately to the hotel . High traffic times during the year mean the highest prices . The more alternative dates you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . <h> 4 . Share Your Event 's History <p> Make sure that you are ready with statistics about the reputation and brand power of your event planning group . Mention the number of attendees at your events , and any big sponsorships that you have built . These connections will offer hotels unique reasons for giving you a good deal . If they can associate the brand of their hotel with the reputation you offer as a client , it 's more of a reason for them to want your business . <h> The Negotiation Equation <p> When hotels think about how to make the most profit and increase their occupancy rate - in any given year , they try to strike a balance between two things : <p> Group Profit : Profit that is predetermined and guaranteed . This is brought in from contracts with clients such as event planning groups . Pricing is given at a reduced cost . <p> Transient Profit . This refers to profit that is made through walk-ins and reservations for individuals and families . This profit is not guaranteed but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is non-negotiable . <p> The perfect balance between guaranteed group profit and transient profit at a fixed price results in the Maximized Occupancy Rate . This ratio is decided by the Revenue Management Team at every hotel . If the hotel assigns too much of their occupancy to group profit , they miss out on the number of rooms they can sell at market price . If the hotel assigns too much of their occupancy to transient profit , there is a high uncertainty as to whether or not they will be able to fully book their rooms . <p> After the initial offer , your event planning team should strategize a hierarchy of needs for your event . What is most important to you about the venue ? What do you absolutely need ? What could you do without ? This will set a framework of priorities in the negotiation process until you sign the final offer . <h> 1 . Do your research . <p> Pricing . As soon as you get your first offer , go to the hotel 's website and check the prices of sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The price they offer you per a sleeping room should be lower than the price they are advertising on the website because you are a guaranteed portion of their occupancy rate . Take down the exact numbers they are advertising and negotiate down from there . <p> Venue Space . Schedule a walk through with the hotel and read reviews of the venue online . Knowing the details of the meeting spaces and the weaknesses of the venue will give you the trade secrets of negotiating down . For example , if you do a walk through and notice a particularly annoying pillar in the middle of a meeting space , you can use this disadvantage to leverage a lower price . Having event technology that will allow you to see your event layout in the hotel 's floor plan is a must . Cloud-based software like Social Tables will allow you to accurately depict your event layouts for your clients and collaborators . <h> 2 . Counter offers . <p> Put in proposals at hotels in the surrounding area even if you know you would never host your event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to leverage a hotel to sell to you . Leverage offers against each other to gain the best price and highest number of benefits . In other words : let hotels negotiate against themselves . <h> 3 . Rooms vs . Meeting Spaces . <p> As outlined before , sleeping rooms and meeting spaces act as counterweights . You can always offer to occupy more sleeping rooms in exchange for additional benefits . Oftentimes , if your sleeping room block is large enough , hotels will offer complimentary meeting spaces and upgraded suites . <h> 4 . Add-ons . <p> Is this your first event ? Ca n't guarantee a large room block ? A great way to leverage room prices is by contributing to other sources of the hotel 's revenue . One of the main ways to do this is by adding Food &amp; Beverage requests to your proposal . Some great ideas include a coffee break for your early morning meeting times , cocktail hour and snacks for boardroom events . <h> Conclusion <p> Now that you know all the variables the rest is up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes time to get on the phone with the venue . <h> 1 . Local vs . National <p> Are you working with the same hotel franchise in multiple locations ? The process of negotiation is standardized nationally , although the prices offered in the contract will be different by location . <h> 2 . Relationship <p> At the end of the day , remember that you are building a relationship with the venue . Be kind to everyone in the process . Especially if you decide to extend a contract , those relationships will allow you to gain additional benefits because you have established trust as a client . <h> 3 . Intuition <p> While there are some great tips for the process of negotiation , a certain part of it comes down to your instincts . Make sure that your most emotionally intelligent team members are highly involved in the negotiation process . <h> 4 . Transparency . <p> Always be open about what the needs are of your event planning group and how the first offer is n't meeting your needs .

But as time goes on , I find myself caring about the people I decorate with , and the gesture of giving , much more than the actual stuff .
