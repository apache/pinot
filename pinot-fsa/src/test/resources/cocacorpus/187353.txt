That 's a good thing . The guys we picked can contribute in year one but do n't have the pressure of having to be the starter right now . Harris will play every 1st 2nd 3rd and long .. McMillan may earn a starting job and at the very least will give Timmons who is 32 years old some much needed relief on early downs . <p> Tankersly will probably be better than Bobby McCain early so he 'll play a to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have good work ethics , seem to have football smarts , and are teachable .

I think they just go after their guys regardless , that 's their motto . <p> Dude here is blaming the roster moves of the front office on Gase ? Holy f'n ****ty troll batman ! The guy only took a roster that was deficient to start that suffered injuries to arguably 2 of its best players as well as others to the playoffs . Take that ignorant **** to another forum . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> everybody here claims gase is part of the drafting process , got ta get the blame if u get the credit too . <p> I liked our draft much more this year than any of our previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was better than Don Shulas drafts that I followed also . A plus rating from hitting all the need positions in this years draft outside of Safety . Outside of our last pick in this years draft in the 7th round at wide receiver their is a great opportunity for every player to contribute and possibly start this year . I am not absolutely certain we got the best players at their position when we picked but from every publication I have gotten my hands on we were in the ball park in the first 2 rounds then got great value the remainer of the draft . Compared to last year we did n't appear to pick up any injury concerns this year . Tunsil , Drake and Lucas all came with injury history from their careers not so this year . What does concern me a bit is some of the sports writers appeared to know the picks before the draft from leaks inside the phins organization . Not good . Sure you can probably now circle a need area on the team before the draft , review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might draft . That 's okay you just do n't want to become to predictable or have those leaks otherwise you will have teams start leapfroging us for our coveted draft choices moving forward l. 
@@23051349 @3051349/ <h> After a decade of plodding , does the Dolphins offense finally have swagger ? <p> Maybe we have turned the page . Last year 's offense was definitely more exciting to watch than previous years . <p> . The highlight of Dolphins OTAs came during the final voluntary practice of 2017 . <p> During an 11-on-11 drill Thursday , DeVante Parker shook free of tight coverage by Byron Maxwell and reeled in a diving , one-handed touchdown pass from Ryan Tannehill . <p> And then Parker , maybe the quietest player on the team , found his voice . He immediately got in Maxwell 's face and began jawing demonstratively . Spurred by the spontaneous display of emotion , Tannehill and the rest of the Dolphins offense rushed over to join in the trash talking . <p> Last season Miami had 8 different players that recorded a run or reception of 45 yards or more . It was n't long ago that Miami as a team would seem lucky to have 4 or 5 long plays . Also 35 of the 192 receptions recorded by Landry , Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this offense was 31st in total 1st downs 31st in converting 3rd down LAST IN 10 OR MORE PLAY DRIVES 27th in time of possession 28th in 3 and out drives Last in the NFL in 4th down conversions with ZERO 30th in drives that lasted 5 minutes or more Last in the NFL with offensive plays Last in the NFL in plays per drive <p> With that said I believe this offense should be much better than the stats above have shown ... at least I hope so <p> this offense was 31st in total 1st downs 31st in converting 3rd down LAST IN 10 OR MORE PLAY DRIVES 27th in time of possession 28th in 3 and out drives Last in the NFL in 4th down conversions with ZERO 30th in drives that lasted 5 minutes or more Last in the NFL with offensive plays Last in the NFL in plays per drive <p> With that said I believe this offense should be much better than the stats above have shown ... at least I hope so 16988 @qwx216988 <p> And with all this it was still an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those explosive plays would happen . Kept you on your toes and clinch to the Coush ... lol . I loved it . <p> this offense was 31st in total 1st downs 31st in converting 3rd down LAST IN 10 OR MORE PLAY DRIVES 27th in time of possession 28th in 3 and out drives Last in the NFL in 4th down conversions with ZERO 30th in drives that lasted 5 minutes or more Last in the NFL with offensive plays Last in the NFL in plays per drive <p> With that said I believe this offense should be much better than the stats above have shown ... at least I hope so <p> I read an article near the end of last year saying the Dolphins had the highest rate of big plays ( 20+ yds ) in the league . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> I just saw the same thing on twitter . It was for passes over 20 yards and runs over 10 yards . We were #1 . You can also look back over the first 5 or 6 weeks of the season and compare the offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 81 QB rating over the first 5 games and a 103 rating over the last 8 . He had a big stink bomb against the Ravens ( 3 int 's &amp; 63 rating ) but over those 8 games he threw 13 TD 's and 5 int 's . Over the first 5 weeks he threw 6 Td and 7 int 's . The offense was definitely getting better and more efficient . <p> We will start the season in better shape as we do n't have to start out with Thomas &amp; Turner as starters and by all signs , Parker will be better off ( healthy ) to start the season , no discipline issues for Ajayi , J. James has gotten the line technique down and with a small miracle we may have Pouncey back as well as an upgrade at a very important TE spot . Gase said he saw a light come on for Tannehill last year . Unfortunately it was in the same game where he got injured . He had just posted two 130 rated games as well as a 124 over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch . <p> this offense was 31st in total 1st downs 31st in converting 3rd down LAST IN 10 OR MORE PLAY DRIVES 27th in time of possession 28th in 3 and out drives Last in the NFL in 4th down conversions with ZERO 30th in drives that lasted 5 minutes or more Last in the NFL with offensive plays Last in the NFL in plays per drive <p> With that said I believe this offense should be much better than the stats above have shown ... at least I hope so 16988 @qwx216988 <p> Yup we could n't consistently stay on the field . Among the other improvements on the team the TE upgrades should help there . Especially first few games last year how many times did we see Cameron killing drives . Just hope that Thomas can get up to speed fast . <p> this offense was 31st in total 1st downs 31st in converting 3rd down LAST IN 10 OR MORE PLAY DRIVES 27th in time of possession 28th in 3 and out drives Last in the NFL in 4th down conversions with ZERO 30th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NFL with offensive plays Last in the NFL in plays per drive <p> With that said I believe this offense should be much better than the stats above have shown ... at least I hope so <p> this offense was 31st in total 1st downs 31st in converting 3rd down LAST IN 10 OR MORE PLAY DRIVES 27th in time of possession 28th in 3 and out drives Last in the NFL in 4th down conversions with ZERO 30th in drives that lasted 5 minutes or more Last in the NFL with offensive plays Last in the NFL in plays per drive <p> With that said I believe this offense should be much better than the stats above have shown ... at least I hope so 16988 @qwx216988 <p> Well those are horrific stats ... but just how close were we to 25th ? or 20th ? .... point is there is usually a pretty slim margin in stats and rankings comparisons ... I did n't take the time to analyze but if someone wants to cool ... I believe we will improve our points per game closer to29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those rankings ... this offense with Gase as coach should prove to be very hard to defend consistently ... improved line play will make the difference .... after that the second year in this offense for some and the improvement of our running game .... Julius Thomas .... looks good to me .... all of this coming together gives our defense , at the very least , fresher legs ...

Would you have been in favor of him being a Dolphin this year ? <p> While I do n't want to stunt Ryan 's further development any , he is coming off a knee injury . The only way I 'm in favor of Jay coming on board is with Gase getting with Ryan and Matt and explaining why he would like to bring him in - it 's insurance in the event Ryan is n't 100% . Jay would first have to show that he can beat out Matt for the backup role and then would ascend to the starter position ONLY if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe Adam considered it , maybe he did n't but he does have the history with Cutler to at least think about it .

I know he 's not necessarily the best locker room guy either so that figures into this as well . <p> See , here 's the thing : I 'm not sure of the relationship that Gase had with him ? <p> When Jay cried his way out of Denver --- and that 's what he did .... he cried his way out of there for a trade , he landed with the Bears --- and proceeded to get his bell rung game after game with that atrocious offensive line in front of him in the windy city !

@@23051355 @3051355/ <h> The Importance Of T.J. McDonald <p> The last time that the Miami Dolphins secondary created a cause for concern to opposing teams was in 2003 . Patrick Surtain , Sam Madison , Brock Marion and Sammy Knight dawned the aqua and teal and created a sense a fear around the NFL . <p> Since then , the Dolphins have been trying to find players to fill those voids . The closest they came was during the 2009 NFL draft , the Dolphins drafted both Vontae Davis and Sean Smith , but had no legit safety combination that created any ounce of fear . <p> I think that Reshad is actually underrated in coverage and as a rangy center fielder in the deep secondary . Our best bet might be having Reshad in that role as more of a classic FS and TJ as our in the box classic SS in the final 8 games .

He 's a pro bowl talent . <p> When Reshad played FS , he was young and definitely not the player he 's turned out to be . <p> The best thing is that Miami likely has the inside track to signing him long-term in the offseason .

I truly believe this defense is one the verge of building something that will be enjoyable to watch the work in progress . I think this defensive unit is going to have more pep in there step . <p> We 're in a great spot with regards to McDonald . Looking at how injuries devastated us last year , he provides insurance this year at a very inexpensive salary . If he screws up off the field , he is an extremely cheap cut . If he plays , he will be an unbelievable bargain , fresh going into the playoffs , adding hitting , tackling and a veteran presence . Honestly , we 're in a perfect position . He is on an extreme " prove it " contract with virtually zero downside for the Dolphins . There really are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count on the roster until he becomes available in week 9 . This is like getting 100 scratcher lottery tickets for a penny ... if you lose ... so what ? There is so much upside . <p> Best case scenario is Nate Allen returns to 2014 form and then McD comes back and our " big nickel " package ( 3 safeties ) is a strength . TJ as a hybrid safety/LB . ( Keeps McCain and Thomas off the field . ) <p> We play only 2 division games over first 11 weeks so TJ will be here for the remaining 6 . He gets back week 9 vs Oakland and then Carolina in week 10 . <p> Used to be that a safety " hitting " a WR/TE hard enough to make him drop the ball was a valid way to defend a pass . Both TJ and Reshad can play that role . They just have to careful about penalties . Regardless , I take a few of them to get the point across ! IMHO it is the best way to handle those short crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get away with it . <p> Neither of them are the classic deep center field ball-hawking type .

The selection of Asiata was the latest in a series of moves designed to fulfill one objective : creating more competition in the interior of the line . <p> Asiata joins a group of interior offensive linemen that includes four players who started games for the Dolphins last season " three-time Pro Bowl selection Mike Pouncey , former Pro Bowl tackle Jermon Bushrod , Anthony Steen and Kraig Urbik " plus former Ted Larsen , who joined the team as an unrestricted free agent . <p> Provided he 's healthy , Pouncey will start at center , but there should be intense competition for the starting jobs at guard , just the way Offensive Coordinator Clyde Christensen wants it . <p> The interior Oline play , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions we have IMO player wise going into this season .

Then the left side of the o-line will be set for awhile with him and Tunsil . Larsen will be a backup at one of the three interior positions . <p> I like this group better than last year ... but that 's not really saying much . If you consider the " interior " line loss of Tunsil , we 're not really in a different spot . But the parts to like about this one are 1 ) Asiata is a good guard prospect who will remain at guard for his career and can both pass protect and blow open run lanes , which we desperately need . And 2 ) Mike Pouncey ca n't possibly miss 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 playoff appearance ) . Honestly , if Pouncey is injured again this season , we may not be any better off at all . <p> I see Larsen as depth just like I do Urbik and Bushrod . We should n't have any of the 3 starting , IMHO . I hope Larsen pleasantly surprises , but I 'm not betting on it . I hope Bushrod is better in his second year at guard and with this OL coach ... but he 's also a year older , and I 'm not really expecting great things from him despite what Gase tells the media . <p> But if we get a healthy Pouncey and Asiata adjusts like I expect him to , we have the potential for 4 solid OL , and we can probably cover over that 5th spot .

Just some facts to consider along with the positives. 16988 @qwx216988 <p> Unlike other regimes who have passed through Miami , I have faith that the coaching staff will be able to coach up whoever they bring in . Let 's not forget they made the playoffs last year with a LB corps held together by superglue and paper mache . <p> Well I 'd say that I have faith in Gase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff . <p> Burke had only 1 LB with which to work last year , but IMHO , that LB made a major impact on a defense that greatly underperformed . This year , it 's all on Burke , as we 've given the core players a full season in this defense , he knows the people and the division , and we loaded up his shopping cart full of goodies in the draft and free agency ( do n't forget Hayes , McDonald , Timmons and resigning Branch ) . I 'm looking for production this year , because 30th at anything is n't going to cut it with this kind of investment in salary cap , draft picks and time . <p> The offensive line coach seemed to make progress late in the season . Hopefully James ' improved play was n't just a flash in the pan ... as we 've seen with him several times in the past . I found it funny that we picked up James ' 5th year option , yet the Bills did not pick up Sammy Watkins ' 5th year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks of his " potential " ... but IMHO , at this point of his career he needs to figure it out . I 'd say this is his make or break year . For us and for his sake , I hope the OL coach really has gotten through to him . Maybe he can learn to run block this year . <p> RB coach has earned my respect . That group is preforming . <p> WR coach needs to get Parker performing up to his awesome potential before he wins me over . Stills proved it in New Orleans , and Landry is fully self-motivated , so DVP is the measuring stick for me . <p> DL coach ... simply not good enough . Maybe we can pick up Kacy Rogers if/when the Jet 's fire their coaching staff ? When a DL has Suh and Wake , both performing up to their ability , and is horrendous vs. the rush and not special vs. the pass ... clearly the coach is n't doing his job well . <p> LB coach ... well we 've discussed this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiko and Raekwon give us 2 legitimate three-down starter building blocks . Having Timmons and Misi on the roster should give us a 3rd NFL-caliber starting LB for early downs . Now we should see whether we can coach LB 's . <p> DB 's coach gets a bit of a pass . It looked like the 5th of July at the Mayo Clinic last year ... everybody getting injured so fast that they needed a ' Gurney Traffic Controller ' to regulate flow to and from the training room . This year with Reshad healthy , the double addition of Allen to keep the seat warm and McDonald to be the real ' other safety ' for the second half of the season , we should actually have competent safeties rather than pretenders and converts masquerading as safeties . Maxwell should finally be healthy . Xavien Howard should finally be healthy and no longer a rookie . Add in another year of development for Lippett and draftee Tankersley and we have a lot of talent that was n't in games last year . So , we 'll see just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To pull this back to the interior OL , I do think that Asiata was a fantastic pick . He brings a physicality we need and have been missing at guard . Hopefully he works out immediately and fantastically , and this encourages the front office to get someone just like him for the other guard slot during the 2018 draft . After all , the Miami Dolphins have drafted at least 1 OL every draft since their inception . If the game is won in the trenches , and I believe it is , then keeping 5 good hogs owning the trenches on offense is a smart thing to do . As long as we 're going to draft an offensive lineman next year ... why not make it another dominant guard and finally fix this tragically comedic offensive line ? <p> I think it may take Asiata some time to adapt . Not only to the level of play but the system . He is labeled as " scheme-diverse " but it still took Jawuan James half the season to get used to a different technique .

I do not blame the plalers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this team was not that good last year , get real on the 6-0 finish , and it is the same this year---SABAN AND HIS STAFF ARE A MISTAKE . OTHER TEAMS ARE WINNING WITH LESS . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> Why ? Welker will get an even larger contract now because his play has elevated . AND he is a RFA ! Teams typically do n't do contract extensions till year 4 when the player is a vested veteran .... Actually singin a player early is bad in the players eyes because it 's easy to out-perform the contract because its generally a low dead . For example the eagles just extended shawn andrews and mike patterson . While they gained some extra coin now , and a little security they actually kind screwed themselves . both of their contract salaries will be low if they keep up their pace of improvement , and the contracts are so long the dead cap number is minimal .... Basically the team has them by the balls . If they underperform they can cut them at anytime , and if they overperform then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the eagles ) <p> Signing early is only good for the team , of for bubble guys who may not get another deal in the future . <p> good players will always get a better contract in their 4th year barring injury . <p> PLUS- Welker is not considered an elite receiver . he only fits 3-5 teams defintiton of a slot guy . Welker 's returns are good however . Generally the market is not that HOTT for this type of player ... especially when they are undersized . AND Saban loves welker ! 
@@23051368 @3051368/ <p> A lot has happened over the last 2 years . The stadium has undergone a 2 phase renovation which completely transformed it . From new seats and reducing capacity by taking out the upper corners ( Phase I ) to installing a new canopy ( Phase II ) which gives the stadium a new feel . With that came a long term deal for a stadium name you can be proud of and the days of yearly changes from some underwear company to generic names to cheap crappy beer are over . Now comes Phase III , and I believe it is the final phase . <p> I am not sure if we will have webcam access like with the roof construction so we will be relying on fans and employees of the Dolphins to post some pictures . I will stop by there once in a while and see if I can get some pics . <p> Phase III : <p> For those who are sitting in club seats and suites will see a remodeled club/suite area next year . If anybody does a relocation on-site rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the relocation process begins February/March . <p> Besides the suite area the biggest project will be the parking area . A complete redo is in order and as some rumor has it it will include tunnels and/or bridges from the outside lots straight to the stadium . The goal for the Dolphins is for fans to exit the lot in 20 minutes or less . So I would assume that some extra work will be done in the road access department . In the past if you parked in the East lots the exit was pretty swift . Our tailgate spot ( East 22 ) was in a pretty good spot . But if you ever parked in the South or West lots exiting can become adventurous and time consuming . And I heard more than once that if you exited wrong you got stuck on 199 Street/Honey Hill Road and had to drive to SR823 to catch the Turnpike . A detour which took up to 1 hour . It will also be interesting to see how it will affect our Tailgate Spot . I may have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and under the video boards in the 300 level . This year they used that spot for standing room only . How that will affect the standing room only and/or if it still will be available remains to be seen . <p> And then there will be a lot of cosmetic and facial surgery done . Redoing and painting the walkways of the concourses is part of that . <p> I anybody has some additional info please post it here . <p> With all that being said : Hard Rock Stadium will be finished this summer . <p> I exit to the west at Canes games . It 's a disaster . Twenty minutes is a comedy act . For one thing , the traffic cops at some exits force you to turn opposite of the intended route .

It is a mob scene and not everybody is paying close attention to what they are doing , not to mention many are drunk . <p> The upper level and the concourses need tons of cosmetic work . Tons .

I never had a problem entering the stadium . If there are any delays they are minuscule . <p> Of course the stadium looks weathered . It has been a bare concrete structure for almost 30 years . What you basically have is just the concrete basics like every stadium has - even the new once . That 's why it is so easy to modify . If you look back at the initial renovation under Huizengha they took the boxes which was the old club area off and hung a new structure which expanded all three levels . The old ones are still there - on the east and west side . It is a 30-old stadium which is being updated the last two years and this year to bring it to more modern standards . But we all can sit here and ***** and moan but unless you have a billion dollars in your pocket it is what it is . The only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it , do n't go . And I always find it amusing when people ***** about Hard Rock Stadium and then say " I enjoyed the Orange Bowl so much more . " Dude , the Orange Bowl was a dump at the end . Friggin sewage dripping down from the upper level . It was also a bare concrete and steel structure . One should wait until Hard Rock has completed the renovations . <p> The playing surface was put in a couple weeks prior to pre-season . From that moment on it was double duty . The grass never had a chance to grab root . Once again , we all can ***** but how about we wait what it looks like with an entire offseason under the belt . <p> My question would be : come 2019 , will it seem like a decent super bowl stadium for super bowl LIV or not ? Ross bankrolled the upgrades , but is it good enough by league standards ? In the next few years , can Goodell still demand more upgrades before it gets played there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seem like a decent super bowl stadium for super bowl LIV or not ?

Every city with a team has them , but they 're all the same . Even criticism of the stadium is high treason with the mouth-breathers ! **** you , you 're no more a fan than me and I 'll say what I want about everything having to do with the team . <p> Agreed , Nabo .

@@23051370 @3051370/ <p> There was a time , not so long ago , when the general wisdom was that it took skill position players three years of development before a team could really see what it had gotten in a draft pick . This was true of defensive ends , wide receivers , corner backs , tight ends and quarterbacks . The concept was that the talent level coming from the college game to the professionals was both a huge jump in : level of competition and complexity of the playbook . It took young players the time to develop the skills and knowledge required to be playmakers . This brings us to DeVante Parker . There have been big expectations placed on the wide receiver position over the last few seasons with big names making big plays early in their careers . Mike Evans , Odell Beckham Jr. , Kelvin Benjamin , and Ashlon Jeffery , among others , have come in and lit up the league almost immediately . It 's easy to say , it 's a put up or shut up league . It 's easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NFL . It 's easy to say that a highly touted rookie SHOULD make an impact immediately . <p> College , fewer college teams are running systems with true pro concepts married to high quality coaching . The prospects coming out are really drafted and athletic measurable 's and not true knowledge of their position . Look at the top 50 to 100 players each year and you 'll find athletic freaks of nature and lesser athletes who 've gone to the big schools for high quality coaching that make the NFL . <p> Look at Alabama how many guys they send to the NFL both as top 50-100 all the way to udfa . <p> Add-in free agency and its easy to see how bad NFL teams turn into the Montreal Expos . <p> ******* <p> Honestly I look at the above and foresee a day , when the NFL return to a more simplified power I offensive and defense due lack of practice time and player development time . Better to have excellence of execution of offense/defense than misfire with complicated offense/defense . <p> Easier to remain dominate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Maybe but I think the reduction in time the coaches can spend with the players , especially young players , is a bigger reason for the slower development of some players . Two-a-day practices are a thing of the past . Three to four hours on the practice field is also a thing of the past . If a team hires a new head coach , he can not really interact with the players until the new league year . The last CBA really emphasized this and it is affecting a lot of the younger players . <p> It 's tied to practice time/rules , but it varies by position . Despite the spread/up-tempo offenses , QB 's and WR 's are coming in and playing well early . RB 's are sometimes held back by their ability to block , but people need to understand that these players are processing more information than players from past eras . RB 's ready to block typically play well early . <p> Many OT 's play from a 2-point stance . Geoff Schwartz wrote a nice piece on why this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take some time , because they have to process info so quickly . DE's/pass rushers tend to take some time , because many DE 's win in college with pure athleticism , and that wo n't work in the NFL . The DE 's that win with technique find that they 're no longer more skilled . The ones that do well early tend to have both ( Von Miller , Joey Bosa ) . <p> CB 's always take time , because it 's a very demanding position - particularly for teams that play a lot of man . Jalen Ramsey and James Bradberry were the best rookie CB 's last season , and they 're both long and very athletic ( even by CB standards ) . The year prior , Marcus Peters continued what he was in college - someone who gives up some plays but has elite ball skills and instincts . <p> Safeties are in a similar position to LB 's . They 're not as close to the action , but they have to react as quickly , because they have more space to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it does in the NFL , so they 're basically learning a new position . Hunter Henry is a recent exception - with Arkansas running a pro-style offense . <p> Overall , the talent is better than ever , but the college game is as different from the pro game as ever , and practices are shorter and more restricted . Just like always , though , teams excel when they 're efficient with their resources , and teams struggle when they 're not .

@@23051376 @3051376/ <h> Looking for contributions from last years draft <p> Last years draft was underwelming outside of Tunsil IMO . Sure we got 2 talented part time starters in the next 2 picks in Howard and Starks . Time will tell if they will stay healthy and contribute full time for us . Outside of those guys we really got zero from the rest of the draft class including college free agents last year . Considering the dearth of talent and injuries last year there certainly were opportunities . So kicking Tunsil , Howard and Starks aside for this discussion whom if any of the remaining draft picks and college free agents do you see contributing ? <p> Um who the hell is Starks ? And Howard will be more than a part time starter . Hesitant to mention Drake cause of my name , but I still think he can eventually be a starter , or will at least contribute as much as a starter could <p> Besides that I do n't see much , see how Duarte progresses and I 'm sure we 'll find out more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And Howard will be more than a part time starter . Hesitant to mention Drake cause of my name , but I still think he can eventually be a starter , or will at least contribute as much as a starter could <p> Besides that I do n't see much , see how Duarte progresses and I 'm sure we 'll find out more about Caroo this year <p> I think Xavien Howard is going to be an excellent player , and prove to be an extremely good 2nd round pick . Tunsil was a home run . He has #1 overall type talent . True Hall of Fame LT potential and he sure looks to be delivering on it . Then add in a top notch CB , and you have two stars at premium positions ... that 's a good draft right there . <p> Drake looks like a good pick at the moment . While many people suggested we should have chosen a different back ... Drake has outperformed some of those backs already , and looks to have better long term potential . And Personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to be a late round gem . The guy has unparalleled start-stop quickness , coupled with arguably the fastest speed in the NFL . Yes , I know of John Ross ... but I also know the Combine did not invite Jakeem Grant , so at his pro day the hand-timed numbers were crazy , with some personnel people clocking Grant at 4.19 in the forty for instance . It 's at a pro day , and hand timed , lots of room for variance ... but nobody runs that fast , so at the very least I 'd put him into the John Ross category ... with superior quickness . <p> Looking at last year 's draft , as is often said , it is still too early to judge , but it definitely looks like a good draft to me . <p> I think if Fasano and Thomas work out this year , we give Duarte another year on the practice squad . Let him bulk up and get stronger . Only injuries will make this draft average . I my opinion , we hit a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Howard . Caroo is the only player that is a poor choice but this has been discussed in many other threads . We need the previous draft to step up this year : DVP and Phillips . <p> Last years draft was n't underwhelming at all ..... you know how I know this it pissed half the people off and not all the people meaning that we did n't just draft to draft we took shots . <p> I still love Drake even thou half the people think he is made of glass . Howard I feel is going to end up our starting corner long after Maxwell is gone and Tunsil is Tunsil . Add to that Grant who I still think will surprise and make the cut this year even with the *** load of WRs . If I had to pick right now Carroo is the most in danger and that is a disappointment given the amount that Miami gave up to get him . <p> Add to that draft Kiko and Maxwell and bang it 's a huge draft and the furthest from underwhelming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st , 2nd and 3rd round picks from the conversation and focus on the rest ? <p> I really like Grant and Carroo as prospects and if one of them pans out I think 2016 will be one of the best classes we 've had in 15+ years . <p> I think we got exceptional value from Tunsil , Howard and Drake where we took them . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> My judgment call on that draft excluded Tunsil but did included Drake and Howard which I agreed are talented but were did not play full time due to injury etc . What I was shooting for are opinion and news on the remaining players that contributed nothing . <p> Just the fact that in 2016 Tunsil and Howard were important parts of the team makes the early returns impressive . With jury still out Drake , Grant and Carroo , draft could end up being very good - i 'll bet at least 2 out of those 3 end up as solid contributors ( could already make that argument on Drake ) <p> If we get a franchise LT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drake and Carroo were needed back ups , and the rest of the draft was a awful . Grant , Duarte , Doughty were dumb picks . All 3 should have been LBs or safeties , as we had to sign 1 lb and 1 safety that were t on a roster after 3 weeks . Lucas was a disappointment but we needed to take fliers on LBs and secondary in late rounds , so I ca n't get mad at the pick . <p> You ca n't look at the draft with out looking at Kiko and Maxwell . With he 8th pick in the NFL draft we got our best T , LB , and CB . That alone makes the draft a success .

He definitely threw with more velocity in 2015 . <p> I think his accuracy is solid , but I struggled with his mental processing/decision making and overall poise . He seemed to make some poor decisions when extending . <p> I recognize the upside , but I do n't see him anywhere near Darnold/Rosen .

The wind-up is less than ideal , and he 's not perfect at reading D 's , but that 's about where my criticism ends . For his age/experience , he processes information quickly , has a big arm , great frame , high-end instincts , and he plays with an understanding of what the team needs to win . He looks like the total package . <p> I 'm not sold on Allen - not convinced he has it between the ears - but we 'll see what he looks like in 2017 . <p> But his arm strength is elite . Overused word but only way to describe it . Best arm strength in the last 5 years easily . Then you add in his AA and ability to improvise . <p> I have a top 10 grade on Allen but the only things stopping from putting a huge grade are his mental processing and touch .

I came away with the conclusion that Kuechly was more likely to be a great player . My gut was n't sold on Ryan Tannehill being a great quarterback . <p> If I do n't feel good about a kid 's mechanics , mental processing , character , poise , and overall gut feeling at the quarterback position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to believe that a guy has what it takes to be a franchise caliber quarterback , or I ca n't take him in the 1st round .

I 'll instead select a player I feel can be a great player at another position in the 1st round . <p> What other reason could you justify using a 1st round pick on a QB if you 're not sold he 's franchise caliber ? It makes no sense to me otherwise . You can get something other than franchise caliber at the QB position elsewhere . I do n't come away sold on quarterbacks to that extent very often . Because they do n't come around very often . <p> I 'll say this though , where Tannehill has impressed me is with his resiliency . He 's put in the work to become a much better player than he was . <p> What 's interesting is that he began to make most of those improvements after the first quarter of the season last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed to be more prepared to deal with pressure and to just play the game . Let his natural ability do some of the work instead of relying on every play to be executed exactly as it 's drawn up . <p> Adam Gase is trying to get him to take that a step further now . He 'll have to in order to ever have a truly great season . Tannehill 's work ethic , dedication , toughness , and ability to remain so coachable are why he has a chance to be successful as an NFL quarterback . <p> Rosen is easy to like if you 're a little old school like me , and already have an affinity for certain types of QB 's geared more towards prototypical pocket passers . <p> He looks like the kind of quarterback you want to draft .

My gut tells me Darnold and Allen will be top 10 QB 's . My gut also tells me Rosen will not for those reasons mentioned , and while talented I think a bit overrated in that department . I do agree that he has starting potential though . <p> I really like Stidham . Assuming injuries are not a persistent problem , which does n't seem to be the case at this point , he has the combination of arm talent ( strength , release , and accuracy ) and feel for the position that moves the needle . 4/5-star recruit out of high school with a 6/1 TD/INT ratio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Freshman . While those stats are inflated because of the Big 12 competition , he was a Freshman , and he shows outstanding touch and accuracy downfield , can squeeze the ball into tight windows , and he generally moves well within the pocket . Every once in a while , he 'd freeze up , but I 'm not going to knock a Freshman too hard for that . <p> The sample size is very small at the college level , but he was great at Stephenville , and he projects as someone with the poise and maturity to handle the position . Without a huge year , he almost certainly returns for 2018 , but I think a big year is likely .

Pouncey underwent a stem cell procedure earlier this offseason as he rehabs from a season-ending hip injury that sidelined him for much of 2016 . <p> Much ado about nothing . The Herald says the Dolphins might sit Pouncey through preseason and the next thing all hell breaks loose . Gase said the team might not play Pouncey in preseason and sit him in some regular seasons practices to try to get him to play in all 16 games . The starters play 4 or 5 preseason quarters , I 'm not sweaating if Pouncey sits out those quarters to stay healthy . If there 's a story saying he 's expected to be injured through the season openner then I 'll get concerned . They said earlier Poncey with the cane was due more to the treatment and rehap procedure than to any type of set back . We 'll have a better idea of where he 's at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is little chance he makes it through the season .

He 's as durable as a fricken toothpick . Time to move on from these injury prone players and get some players we can count on week in and week out . <p> Pouncey is our best option at center right now ... resting him in the preseason is no big deal to me ..

Remember Pouncey was n't just using a cane because he re-injured the hip , it was because he just had a steem cell proceedure. it 's not like he was walking with a cane prior . It 's like freaking out if we saw a picture of a player using crutches the day after he had debris removed from a knee . That does n't mean he 'll still be on crutches 3 months down the road .

I 'd say one or two of them is jettisoned after this year barring a strong and healthy showing this year . <p> A guy just stepped out of a time machine next to me on the street . He told me to tell you all that Mike Pouncey will miss most of this season . And every other season . He did n't specify whether this was because Pouncey was injured or in prison , but his look said " if you ca n't tell , it does n't matter .

" <p> Right . <p> Enjoy another year of fantastically underwhelming play by a player who ca n't condition or build his base or core , and ca n't practice full out , and will stumble out for game time and magically get pushed around -- even worse than the last time he missed most the offseason . <p> Unicorn Pouncey of five years ago is a myth . <p> The Pouncey taking up a roster spot with a fat salary and big rep -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a liability . The center of Miami 's line is the weakest link . Right where championship teams are strongest . <p> The one thing you 're missing is that Pouncey 's using stem cells .

I 'm guessing even Lemmiwinks would cringe at that proposition . <p> I think you guys are giving this article too much attention . Gase has said in his pressers that he already knows what he is getting with pounce an does n't need him to over work himself with unnecessary practice . I agree he is injury prone and therefore imo overpaid . But this is also a good thing giving our back up ( who will probably end up starting at some point ) more reps .

Did anyone watch him play the year before last when he tip-toed his way through off-season , camps and practices ? Put that on rewind and then put it on steroids . <p> How anyone in their right mind can think that someone in football 's trenches can pussyfoot through off-season and in season training , and step up and play at a high level -- well , it 's beyond me . <p> This is n't news . Gase said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be limited in camp . <p> I 'm a little skeptical if Mike can return to form , but he is 100% worth the shot we are taking on him this season . The fans here are way to gloom and doom . He had hip surgery and was only able to play in 5 games last year , but before that he played in 72 of 80 possible games ( 16,16 , 14,12,14 , games played . ) . Pretty drastic to give up on a guy after one season being injured . Even more drastic when you look at how elite he is when he has played . Imagine if we gave up on Wake after his Achilles ? <p> No problem with this at all . Matter of fact , for the training camp/pre season it gives ample opportunity to someone to grab by the ***** the center position . Crippled Pouncey played and Ajayi runs for 200 yards , damn .

@@23051430 @3051430/ <p> Matthews is a big target b ( 6 ' 6 ) at receiver and has decent hands . If I recall he was a bit old for a 2016 draft class prospect due to his Mormon mission . I believe he 's already Miami 's oldest receiver . He was someone I wanted Miami to consider as a udfa last year . <p> Every team has 10/12 receivers in camp , I do n't see why people think Miami carrying 11 is too much . Miami has fewer than the Patriots or Packers . If you have 4 qb 's throwing , you 're going to need bodies at receiver . <p> I think Matthews has as much talent as any of the 2017 UDFA wr 's we have in camp . I do n't like his age ( 26 ) , but he 's 6 ' 6 , 220 pounds ran a 4.5 , runs decent routes and has solid hands . Yes all of the UDFA 's are long shots , but you never know how things work out . <p> When I say Mathews runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 220 pound receiver . He 's no Jarvis Landry route wise , but his size and reported 4.5 speed might earn him a spot at the back of an NFL roster . Maybe not Miami 's , it would take an incredible camp , but he has some raw skills . My issue with his age ( 26 ) is that by the time he refines his skills he will be 28 . At the college level he seemed to know how to use his height to his advantage . If nothing else it would be fun to see Mathews , Parker and Julius Thomas in the red zone . <p> Bro in today 's NFL you never know . One man may be passive and another may be aggressive and want to succeed . Nothing against you but I hate that saying . It is an opportunity for another person to step it up . Best of luck . <p> Yes it 's funny that some people complain about not keeping players like Chris Hogan , but write of others as just camp fodder . When the 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot as Mathews is now . Today 's camp fodder can become tommorow 's fish that got away in the blink of an eye . I 'm not saying it 's a lock that Mathews will even still be on the roster when training camp starts in July , but you never know what people will do when an opportunity presents itself . <p> He 's a freakish size/speed athlete , with soft hands , good catch radius , and wins contested catches . If he can improve in route running &amp; separation , he could be a good match for Tannehill 's low trajectory laser throws . <p> Strengths : Big receiver who plays to his height . Uses frame to shield defenders from the catch points . Catches the ball away from his frame with soft hands . Good ball tracking skills and extremely competitive when ball is in the air . High points the ball and can pluck it off the helmet of a cornerback . Shows enough body control to adjust for difficult catches along sideline . Impressed scouts with well-rounded measurable at pro day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Weaknesses : Restricted strider . More buildup speed than pure burst into his routes . Shows some struggles in press release . Can do better job of consistently working back to the throw . Upright in his routes and lacks the natural bend to sink hips into breaks forcing prolonged gear down . Dull runner after the catch . <p> Draft Projection : Rounds 6 or 7 <p> Bottom Line : While Mathews is more of a straight-line receiver than fluid route monster , his ability to win the 50/50 with hand strength , high-point timing and a sweet vertical are very impressive . Mathews needs to become more adept at creating separation in his intermediate routes , but his contested catch talent is a plus . Has the tools and potential to go on Day 3.

So far in their history , the Miami Dolphins have retired the numbers 12 ( quarterback Bob Griese ) , 13 ( quarterback Dan Marino ) , and 39 ( running back Larry Csonka ) .

Marino is the only one in the generation I have watched . I was n't around for the 70 's fins . <p> JT and Zach were both excellent players on teams that could have done something with a few more players and a coach . Neither really transcended the position . Zach is the ultimate over achieving LB and JT helped usher in the long/quick DE . They both deserve HOF and a ring of honor enshrinement . Retired number is a step above that . That is the area Marino is in . <p> Who knows , maybe at some point that start doing things like retiring a number for 50 years or something . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jersey retirement has passed , that 's typically over 60 years , or 3 full generations . Not many living people saw them play at that point . Or heck , maybe even 100 years ... you know , just to be safe .

So yeah , numbers will get re-used . <p> But if I 'm honest , I 'd rather not see players wearing 54 or 99 this decade . Maybe call it a soft-retirement or something . Down the road ... who knows , but not yet . <p> The one I came into the thread to post .

That 's because almost as soon as the rookie was introduced to Taylor , he asked if he could work with Taylor . <p> it 's always nice hearing a player is putting in extra time and effort into working . At the very least , those players usually turn out to be solid starters . I know we are all hoping for more , but it 's definitely a nice really early start to his career <p> It 's great that he 's willing to put in the work and JT is the perfect guy to learn from as he dominated his position from a mental standpoint as much as a physical one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CH is that Laremy Tunsil is helping out CH .

It shows that Laremy is both secure in his ability and loves to compete . <p> Those two kids along with Devante Parker have me extremely encouraged by our last 3 first round picks . <p> I always thought Harris was a top 15 talent and I think going 22 has created a bit of a chip on his shoulder .

That was the biggest reason I did n't mind seeing Olivier leave for the huge contract the Giants gave him . <p> I like this , draft talent no doubt , but you have to have guys that will do what they are supposed to do or the whole thing breaks down . And you end up with numerous big plays in a road playoff game to get blown out . 5 yard TFL 's are nice , but we need dlineman that can make stops at the line rather than leave holes . We need linebackers and safeties that can make tackles even giving up a few feet rather than whiff and give up 30 YAC . A pulling guard or center not making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a 6 yard run and a 25 yard run . Pats have preached football IQ for years above all else . Receivers need to catch the ball , or the athletecism means nothing . Brady makes a living off 5 or 7 yard passes that are always caught moving forward by receivers that run good routes and do n't drop the ball . I hate preaching NE football , but when you 've been to the Super Bowl 7 times in 16 years , there is no other standard worth mentioning . <p> Fairly certain this is the main advantage the Patriots have over other teams with similar skills - intelligence . I have sensed an extremely low football IQ on the Dolphins for many years . I like this news . <p> They allow so many drives to continue because of dumb penalties . Even though they won 10 games and that was awesome , there were so many times during the season I thought some of these guys have absolutely 0 football common sense . You do n't need Pro Bowlers at every position . You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons I was fine with losing Olivier because he had so many bonehead penalties here . <p> Just watch the ending of the Buffalo game in Miami last year . So many dumb penalties . <p> A really interesting player we have picked up in the Draft is Raekwon McMillan from Ohio State . Although only 20 , he was a Defensive captain on a top ranked team for the past 2 years . One should not build excessive expectations before we see him on the field . However , he sounds incredibly calm , settled , sensible and really smart . Watch the Congemi interview - Raekwon comes across as a confident natural leader , who 's happy to be a Dolphin . There is a reason why Urban Meyer gave him such big responsibilities in making Defensive calls at such an early age ( i.e. 18 years old ) and he was n't let down . The more I see of McMillan , the more I love this Draft pick . <p> Wow , I wonder if they were referring to Damien Williams ( who does the running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) when they wrote this ? Overall I 'd agree that Asiata , McMillan , Harris and Ford seem to have it . But , I 'll reserve judgement on Tankersley , Taylor and Godchaux . <p> I do like that we intend to move to a smarter team . Shula won a lot of games by coaching smart players to do the right things in the right circumstances . Bill Arnsparger got the most out of his defenses by getting smart people to play within the scheme . Belichick gets a lot of mileage out of getting his guys to learn and execute sound assignment football . Those are some pretty good examples of one way to get a competitive edge in this era of parity . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> OK - Damien Williams made a few silly mistakes last year , but there were a lot fewer than the previous season and he consistently excelled on Special Teams .

Damien is still to re-sign but he should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'd guess that the Patriots have the smartest group of players in the NFL --- at least in terms of football smarts . That does win games . <p> I know a lot of younger media types will look at old-timers like Bob Griese and dismiss his greatness based on stats , but one thing Griese did so well was steal first downs by drawing teams offsides . He was a master at that . The little things do add up , like getting those extra yards instead of going out-of-bounds , knowing how to run out the clock etc . <p> Smart and physical seems to be the mantra of this offseason for the most part . Have to like that . <p> OK - Damien Williams made a few silly mistakes last year , but there were a lot fewer than the previous season and he consistently excelled on Special Teams .

He impressed the hell out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really smart . They did n't bother getting him back down to Miami for any second interview because they were probably blown away by the first . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> Sure ... but I 'm going to take that as you agree the running out of bounds comment was a shot at Williams by the coaching staff through the media . I hope he signs his tender and comes back , and I 'm sure he will ... but I 'm in agreement that situational football is important too . The Patriots , Steelers , Packers , and other top teams tend to not make those kinds of mistakes . I 'm hoping we become one of those teams that avoids those types of mistakes too . Time to learn if they have n't already . <p> On the smart note , I have a lot of faith in Asiata , McMillan , Harris and Ford being smart players . I also think we have some undrafted guys who fit that mold as well . But I 'm not writing off talented players just because the playbook takes them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like drafting smart players but that 's only part of the equation . Another good aspect of this draft is we steered away from players with character red flags as well as injuries that could keep them out of camp . I 've been impressed with all of the interviews I 've seen from a maturity and humility aspect . A few of the guys are still considered " dogs " or hard-nosed " players but yet they still come off very humble and dedicated . I like that . <p> I just wonder who , out of the group ( if anyone ) is going to be that star player that has eluded Miami 's front office for years . Landry may be an exception and Tunsil will likely turn into one of those guys but if Mike T has accomplished anything in his career , it 's finding the elite player on occasion . So far only Landry has come out of the gate on fire . Most of the past guys could still evolve into an elite player but they have needed time for whatever reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely some good candidates this year . <p> Out of previous classes who is likely to turn into a top tier player ? <p> 2013 : Only 1 player and he is currently in NE ( Gillislie ) . 2014 : Landry is pretty much there . 2015 : Ajayi is there . Parker is my candidate . Phillips and Lippett as outside chances . 2016 : Tunsil is most likely and Howard has a shot . 2017 : Harris , McMillan , Asiata , Tankersley , Godchaux are all good candidates . <p> We had the 2nd most penalty yards in the NFL , so it is obvious we need to get smarter . We also had the youngest roster in the NFL , so that had to be expected . I think this is a contagious element of football . If you get a few guys playing smart that are the leaders it rubs off . It could n't help that one of our biggest team leaders , Landry , had to celebrate after every first down , and got a few personal fouls . That stuff trickles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this down this season , with out losing the edge it gave this team . <p> But that was n't my point .

Forcing us to rush out the field-goal unit team to try the 55 yarder . <p> Guys w low football IQ will get you beat - see Bengals ( w Vance Joseph as D-backs coach ) 2 years ago in playoffs vs Pittsburgh ) .

It will be hard enough to get 2 LBs starting next to Alonso that make us happy ( 3 if God answers your prayer for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a Kiko fan , unlike Sons of Shula . But , one thing that seems rarely mentioned is his versatility . He does n't just play MLB , he also plays spy and sometimes WLB . The current NFL trend is to have two interchangeable safeties , and on any given play you do not know which is SS and which is FS . That is one of the offense 's biggest keys . Even bigger than that key is identifying the MLB . If we were to add another LB who has the versatility to play MLB and WLB , we could really confuse offenses with our interchangeable keys at both levels of the defense , and then with stunts up front . That would really give us the ability to mask all 3 levels of the defense . IMHO , that would be an excellent tool to rachet up this defense . <p> Re-sign Kiko ? Absolutely ! He is excellent , inexpensive , team player ( good in the locker room and as a citizen ) , versatile , with tons of speed and good instincts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will he play ? If we 're smart , he will not be locked into being required to be the Mike . But given that we do n't have any other NFL caliber LB 's on our roster , he had no choice this year . He is a pursuit LB , not a thumper . He can cover and spy . His savvy play has earned license to freelance , leading to numerous takeaways--something our LB 's and DB 's really have lacked . I 'm not in favor of a Brandon Spikes type 2-down Thumper and obvious orange traffic cone in coverage . We 've had bad coverage LB 's before in guys like Phillip Wheeler and now with Spencer Paysinger and Nevil Hewitt ... we 're the laughing stock of the NFL if we try to use those guys in coverage . So , I 'm not up for sacrificing coverage ability to stop a LaGaroutte Blount . We need at least 1 more LB who can also play Mike and Will . Then we 'll unlock more of Kiko 's ability . <p> But not taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost to this team to retain said players services for one more year when the cupboard is basically bare with nothing but udfa types in the first place is short sighted 16988 @qwx216988 <p> I stick to what I know and love . The X's&amp;O 's . And more specifically - the philosophy and schemes of defense . <p> You wo n't find me discussing the finer points of contracts and financial numbers ; you wo n't find me frolicking with an abundance of information in the draft forums ; nor do I participate in the silliness and nonsensical broken record arguments concerning useless analytics . <p> I thoroughly enjoy approaching the game from a strategic coaching perspective , not as a GM or draft guru , and I stick to what I know . <p> Just a few years ago Brain Hartline was our best WR making " big plays " w/ back to back 1,000 yard seasons , but that still did n't stop us from overhauling the entire receiving corp . Same situation , different unit . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> It took a couple of drafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen in one off season ? The entire defense needs younger or improved players . DE , LBs , and CB/S . Kiko will be back . He is playing out of position , and he has good awareness and makes big plays . Complain if your must , but that is the reality .

MikeO had some very good posts also . <p> Hall of Fame is ultra elite , and with accolades to back it up . It is n't nice players who stood out during a long dry era for the franchise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater degree than any player in history . He 'd need at least 40 or 50 sacks for the remainder of his career along with multiple first team All Pro nods . <p> And even that might not be enough . None of this is frozen in time . That 's the aspect that is conveniently overlooked . No matter what it looks like now there will be numerous players galloping forward on the recognition list in the subsequent seasons before Wake or anyone else is considered or up for a vote . Not only do you need to reach the historical barriers but you also have to stand out in comparison to players who are your younger peers and then the following generations . Wake right now is only 11th in active career sacks . Ruthless criteria . Nobody is going to care that he peaked later than the norm . <p> O.J. Anderson of the Canes was one of my all time favorite players . Freak talent . Unfortunately he got too heavy after his first couple of years in the NFL , and he also had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the St. Louis Cardinals . His best seasons were not in public view . Paul Zimmerman of Sports Illustrated named Anderson to his first team All NFL squad one season , saying that he sampled many defensive players who faced both and they said Anderson caused more problems than Walter Payton . I was n't surprised . <p> But that was n't the public consensus . Then Anderson got weary of playing behind a weak offensive line so he gained weight to become more of a power back . <p> Anderson was lucky to be sent to the Giants where his public profile surged , Parcells had faith in him , and he played a role in two Super Bowl victories , notably the second one in 1990 when he was Super Bowl MVP . Anderson was something like 8th in league history in rushing yardage at that point . There was quite a bit of Hall of Fame debate in the days following the game . Howie Long was still playing but he was already being used as a prominent network analyst , especially when the Raiders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anderson , Howie Long emphatically stated that " this cinches it " toward Anderson in the Hall of Fame . <p> Sorry . Not going to happen . I emphasized that on Las Vegas radio . The voting is n't today or tomorrow . It 's at least a decade or two down the road , when countless players will have matched or surpassed Anderson in stats and raves . <p> I nearly fell over when I read Mike Pouncey linked to the Hall of Fame . Luckily I have softened quite a bit , and I 've sensed that it is n't proper for me to criticize other posters so much when these days I do n't spend much time on forums and mostly hit and run . In my younger years I would have launched an attack on that Pouncey inclusion from the opening sentence . <p> On edit : maybe Suh . Tough position to be voted in but he is well known and has enough time to post some All Pro years . His playing reputation somewhat exceeds his actual level , which helps . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the correct path right now at least but he s gon na have to step up his finish on the qb numbers very soon ... needs to be more in that 8 sacks per range plus still dominate the opposition <p> I 'm hoping for Zach Thomas , but that one will be close . Definitely Ndamakong Suh , who hopefully goes in as a Dolphin . I 'm rooting for Cam Wake and think he has a pretty good chance , depending upon the classes his first 3 eligibility years . <p> I can not see Mike Pouncey making the Hall of Fame . OL rarely make it , he 's always injured , involved in our internal scandal , plays on a team that did n't win much and does n't have much national sympathy , and is perceived as being the less talented twin . I 'll be very surprised if he makes it . <p> Down the road , I think Reshad Jones , Laremy Tunsil and Jarvis Landry have a chance if they can build on their careers and have long , very successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . Hopefully he 'll still be alive when/if he gets in . I do n't know if any of you younger fans know this but he held Alan Page in check with a broken arm in SB VIII . Even got under his skin and flagged for a personal foul . Great stuff . He played in all of Miami 's SB teams . Next would probably be Ricky followed by Suh . Wake might get in if ( as stated before ) he brings up his sack totals or he has another great season capped off with a SB win ( in which he had game changing plays ) . I do n't really see anyone else who has a chance . I know Zach is a local favorite , but he never really got the attention he deserved . I 'll be honest I did n't think Taylor should have made it , but I am very happy for him . As for Anderson and Scott , nope no chance . The selections are more based on the players popularity with a few stats thrown in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . Miami just does n't get the same coverage other teams do , i.e. the Steelers , Cowboys , Patriots etc . Now if Miami starts winning and gets to a couple of SB ( with a win or two ) , them maybe the selection committee will look favorably on the past Dolphins . <p> 1 . Cam Wake ( think he is 1st ballot , 22nd at worst . 2 . Mile Pouncey . Injuries might keep him out but he Ulf , be a lock if he can make it a few more years . 3 . Zach Thomas .

@@23051470 @3051470/ <h> Bobby McCain <p> i posted this on FB , but I 'm curious as to your opinion on Bobby McCain . I absolutely trust Gase and this front office ( way more than years past ) . Last year I was worried about our linebackers , but this year I 'm nervous about our Slot CB . Really wish that we would 've picked somebody up who could challenge McCain . I think you 're fooling yourself if you think Maxwell , Lippett , or Tankersley can effectively play the slot . Howard could possibly , but he was drafted to play the boundary . I understand that Bobby improved down the stretch ; however , at times he was lost and a huge liability . In Gase I Trust though . <p> I am worried about our short passing defense the most regarding our linebackers and slot cb . Safety has me both curious and concerned from a health standpoint . On offense its still the offensive line that 's the worry and then followed by the tight end area which just like the safties I am curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensive coordinator should a area of concern too . <p> I pretty much totally agree with you , dolfanattic5 , we need to upgrade from him , but he could be good depth . I like him more in the slot that Michael Thomas ... I wonder about lafeyette pitts ? ? Maybe a competition for playing time .. But I also think that even though the team views Howard , Lippett , and Tankersly all as boundary , top 3 guys , I think Howard ( of top 3 this year ) is the best option to move inside . Lippett should n't , Maxwell should n't , but Howard might be versatile enough to make it work <p> I like McCain , but he 's not awesome or anything . To be honest one of the kids I really wanted to snag in round 7 or as an UDFA is a tiny Nickel CB named William Likely . He 's about 5 ' 7 .... maybe 5 ' 6 , but he 's insanely quick and can cover the Edelman types . But we did n't go that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think Tankersley will get some snaps there too , but primarily he is going to be groomed as a boundary CB , like Howard , with Lippett being the 3rd guy in that rotation .

McCain is our best lateral-quickness guy , but he can not cover those little quick guys really ... so we will just have to accept that guys like Edelman will always be open against us . But Bobby McCain does a decent job against most slot guys , so he 's not a bad option to have . <p> He got picked on in the red zone pretty bad last year .

Isaiah Ford might be flawed value logic in the seventh . I , as well , was secretly hoping for some scatty CB 's . <p> I watched the Voch Lombardi YouTube of Tankersly and he looks way better in press coverage . I 'm glad we got him , like you said , you ca n't have enough of them . However , combining his lack of tackling prowess , with his propensity to hold , he might just be the last guy on the roster I 'd consider for the slot . <p> But yeah , really would have liked to see a Corn Elder or Teez Tabor drafted this year . <p> Maybe if our linebacker would lay out one or two of the Edleman types , our slot corner would have a better shot of covering the slot . You get slot receivers looking over his shoulder for a LB , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a division with the Patriots , who seem to hoard slot type WR , it would have been smart to get a slot type CB . We drafted plenty of defense but we ignored our own weaknesses in the process IMO . By that I mean we were horrible against the run but we draft a pass rusher in Harris who does n't play the run well , a CB that does n't tackle , and two late round DTs that are more known for getting upfield and after the QB than they are for their run stuffing ability . <p> The Dolphins say they self evaluate at the end of the season and make an assessment of needs and where they are but then the draft comes and it 's like they ignore the majority of it . <p> Interesting point about you 're guy in the seventh .

When Tankersley is able to get in the receiver 's face and get physical he can be a great CB . But if asked to play off and read , that 's not his strong suit . He needs to get into camp and buckle down so he can learn those situations better and move instinctively rather than panicking from lack of knowing what to do or falling behind the play and then grabbing . He also needs to take a more committed approach to tackling . Both of those things can be taught if Tankersley is willing to learn . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this league yes , but let 's see how an upgraded front 7 helps his play improve ... FWIW our LB play was a borderline disaster last year and our lack of 2 starters at Safety most of the season did n't  help anyone either ... I like the kid and am rooting for him but am not sold at this point Plus there 's this : <p> McCain is my major question mark for this season too . I 'm still hopeful he will become that slot CB our coaches believe he can be . In most cases , it takes 2-3 years before a DB settles in and plays to potential . Let 's hope that proves to be right for McCain in his third year . <p> When my friend played against him in pre season during Mccain 's rookie year he said Mccain had laughably stiff hips and let him do whatever he wanted against him .

Hayes will be the No. 3 end with the Rams . Coach Jeff Fisher likes to kick him inside on passing downs . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> He is n't going to surprise his opponents with elite speed , but he has a solid all-around skill set that allows him to get to the quarterback in a multitude of ways .

Hopefully those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft article I could find and for the most part those last 4 draft picks fell to us in this years draft . The DT from Oklahoma was maybe the worst of the lot and Forde the 7th rounder was ranked pretty high even the 1st round in one publication . Both rookie DT strength was pass rush etc .

Not great , but he could have easily started over Paysinger and Hewitt , except that Kiko was n't really cross-trained enough to play Will at that time . One of the advantages of everyone knowing the system already is that they can spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to play someone like Hull , they can shift Kiko around and make that happen . <p> But , Hull is n't the real impetus . We now have 4 competent LB 's : Kiko , Raekwon McMillan , Lawrence Timmons and former starter Koa Misi if he ever gets healthy ( hopefully he can still play without further neck injury ) . Guys like Hull and Hewitt are going to be strictly bench players this year unless we lose 2 LB 's to injuries . <p> Last year we had 3 LB spots and only 1 NFL caliber LB , this year we 'll have 4 so we can field an NFL caliber LB corps even if we have 1 injury . <p> Last year we spent most of the year with a secondary in shambles . Reshad Jones played only a handful of games , and we had no SS replacement really . IAQ , who played admirably , was not a great player and could n't hold it all together by himself , then he got injured too . Michael Thomas is a poor safety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a lot more cold as the year progressed . So , going into the season we thought we had a good safety pair ... but both went down and for the playoffs we fielded a joke safety pair of scrubs . Similarly , our cornerbacks were devastated . We started the year with an injured and clueless Byron Maxwell , then eventually he healed up and figured things out , giving us mostly very good games . Then he got injured and disappeared again . All in all , he started and finished invisible and in the middle showed he could be a good CB . Xavien Howard had an impressive rookie season repeatedly marred by injuries . Tony Lippett was thrown into the deep end before he was ready , but really progressed because of it . This year all 3 look healthier and improved compared to last year . Then we added another quality prospect at boundary CB . This should make us a lot deeper with more quality and less learning the defense on the fly . And adding TJ McDonald and Nate Allen in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CB , which I think is where he is much more effective . <p> So , Burke will have more faith in his secondary , and rightfully so . He will not need to use his LB corps to protect his DB 's as much as Vance Joseph did . And , Burke should have actual NFL caliber LB 's . This cross-training allows him to shuffle them around should we have injuries . Our second year in the scheme allows guys like Kiko , Misi , Hull and Hewitt to figure out multiple positions , just in case . I do think they 're limiting what McMillan sees , because he 's 20 years old and it 's a big jump , but I think he can make the jump and learn on the field in games , because he 's naturally talented , smart and hard working . <p> Lb 's will surely make us better but it wo n't make a huge difference unless we get more quality snaps from whatever DT lines up next to Suh . That means the #2 and #3 DT . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump because right now it 's the weak link on the defense . <p> sounds like harris is positioning himself very well for the plan a sub gig which for my money would be meeting expectations provided it carries through camp <p> I do n't see hayes as much of a dt rotation option ... not enough lead in the pants 16988 @qwx216988 <p> I think Hayes is pretty stout and also a great tackler . Like Suh , once he get 's his mits on you it 's over . He has some power . Jason Jones played that role for years ( kicking inside ) . He was 6 ' 5 276 lbs . He was pretty good at it a few years back but obviously declined . Hayes is 6 ' 3 272 . Only 4 lbs lighter but beefier on a shorter frame . He wins one on one match-ups and sheds tackle effectively . <p> Harris is getting rave reviews from non-padded practices . Omar said yesterday he 's never seen a guy this disruptive who is constantly in the backfield . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little early but you want to hear these kind of reports and all the beat guys are noticing as well as other players and coaches .

Not much but he did it . <p> i was referring to not much of an option as a dt outside of the sub ... I could see hayes kicked inside in the sub ... here to give us Jason jones role <p> I 'm sure what harris is showing will translate to pads ... not sure why edge rush skills that he possesses would disappear in a pad setting ... although omar of everyone out there short of Beasley is probably the worst eye for talent of the bunch ... that first step should translate in any setting <p> also if he s wrecking camp fodder that does n't really mean much . if he 's wrecking guys that play on sundays then we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub <p> you put him out there in base your just asking for soft fronts in year one . it 's like cam wake you need to save that for the sub ... get me off the field ... he would n't be my plan a starter in base ... but I guess there 's also the point that if he 's just THAT DOMINANT an edge rusher you want to get him as many snaps as possible <p> they keep saying wakes a starter too I would be snap counting both these guys out the gate and only giving them more extended run if the game situation called for it , attrition , or just plain old poor play from hayes and branch cropped up ... those guys make too much coin to get barely any run <p> miamis gon na play a ton of nickel anyways ... easiest way for the opposition to exploit the lb level in space/coverage and get after the nickel corner and lack of range at the safety level <p> If I had to rank the DEs by snaps they will receive I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wake and Branch being basically interchangeable as far as snap count goes .

This defense is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matchup with quick receivers . It takes away from the pass rushing strength of Suh and Wake . Still a lot of work to do , but on the right track . <p> I voted fully . The only thing I did n't like was him defering to the other team and here 's my reason . First , our offense was pretty bad so why put it out there first ? Second , our offense always seemed to start slow so why not put it out there first and see if they can get something going sooner . But really the main reason is this , the defense was built to " play with a lead " but they always started playing catch up . Put the offense out there first and if we can score then your defense is " playing with a lead " . But really , I 'm very happy with what he did in his first year and looking forward to next season already <p> Ca n't be fully satisfied until after a super bowl victory , but am confident they finally found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure how much personnel input he has , but fixing the LB core and offensive line are absolute musts before they can take the next step . <p> We finished 4-2 in the AFC East ...

Check We rebounded from a catastrophic start of 1-4 ... Check Our locker room is harmonious and serious ... Check We finished games ...

Because after the season they just had , I would imagine Gase gained alot of leverage in the organisation a far as draft decisions go . <p> Fully satisfied . The fact that Don Shula got to see this genesis before his demise is even more satisfying . Now go and win a Super Bowl so we can have the best story the NFL has ever seen . Don Shula on the Super Bowl floor hoisting the trophy one more time with Adam Gase . <p> We hired a coaching prodigy . Certainly things could derail us , but we certainly do n't  neeed to worry about this for many years . Short Term-Gase got us playoffs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established the winning culture and sense of inclusiveness that is rare . <p> Given that the overarching goal of this first season was to try and salvage Tannehill and later decide his future . Heavy investment in the offense was reasonable in my opinion . The defense was bolstered with rentals that primarily did n't  work out . All will be ok if we tach hard towards D this offseason <p> The Miami Dolphins concluded the season with a 30-12 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the wild-card round at Heinz Field . Now that the Miami Dolphins season is over , what 's next ? The Dolphins surpassed everyone 's expectations this season by winning 10 games and advancing to the playoffs for the first time since 2008 . <p> Most savants predicted Miami to win six to eight games this season , which was a reasonable evaluation of the roster , particularly after big injuries to key players such as center Mike Pouncey , safety Reshad Jones and quarterback Ryan Tannehill . Although coaching matters in the NFL , rookie head Coach Adam Gase and first-year defensive coordinator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and getting the most out of what they had . <p> Adam Gase 's offensive scheme did oddities for Miami and helped fifth-year quarterback Ryan Tannehill take positive steps forward before his knee injury . Second-year running back Jay Ajayi also had a breakout year and confirmed he is the long-term solution at the position . <p> I am sold on Gase . He had a winning season in his first year . He did it with a group of men he had very little input on hiring . He did it without needing a gimmick play to win . Is there room for improvement ? Absolutely . But he will have a full offseason to get more of his type of players on the team and that has me very hopeful for the future . This is the first season in a LONG time I am really looking forward to the next season . <p> I put " mostly " simply because I want to know he 's more involved in fixing the D. But at the same time I give him an A+ . Does that make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's going to have success for a long time in this league . <p> He proved that he was indeed a QB whisperer . He made damn sure he did n't  collapse down the final stretch of games .

Then the left side of the o-line will be set for awhile with him and Tunsil . Larsen will be a backup at one of the three interior positions . <p> I like this group better than last year ... but that 's not really saying much . If you consider the " interior " line loss of Tunsil , we 're not really in a different spot . But the parts to like about this one are 1 ) Asiata is a good guard prospect who will remain at guard for his career and can both pass protect and blow open run lanes , which we desperately need . And 2 ) Mike Pouncey ca n't possibly miss 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 playoff appearance ) . Honestly , if Pouncey is injured again this season , we may not be any better off at all . <p> I see Larsen as depth just like I do Urbik and Bushrod .

Let 's not forget they made the playoffs last year with a LB corps held together by superglue and paper mache . <p> Well I 'd say that I have faith in Gase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff . <p> Burke had only 1 LB with which to work last year , but IMHO , that LB made a major impact on a defense that greatly underperformed . This year , it 's all on Burke , as we 've given the core players a full season in this defense , he knows the people and the division , and we loaded up his shopping cart full of goodies in the draft and free agency ( do n't forget Hayes , McDonald , Timmons and resigning Branch ) . I 'm looking for production this year , because 30th at anything is n't going to cut it with this kind of investment in salary cap , draft picks and time . <p> The offensive line coach seemed to make progress late in the season . Hopefully James ' improved play was n't just a flash in the pan ... as we 've seen with him several times in the past . I found it funny that we picked up James ' 5th year option , yet the Bills did not pick up Sammy Watkins ' 5th year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks of his " potential " ... but IMHO , at this point of his career he needs to figure it out . I 'd say this is his make or break year . For us and for his sake , I hope the OL coach really has gotten through to him . Maybe he can learn to run block this year . <p> RB coach has earned my respect . That group is preforming . <p> WR coach needs to get Parker performing up to his awesome potential before he wins me over . Stills proved it in New Orleans , and Landry is fully self-motivated , so DVP is the measuring stick for me . <p> DL coach ... simply not good enough . Maybe we can pick up Kacy Rogers if/when the Jet 's fire their coaching staff ? When a DL has Suh and Wake , both performing up to their ability , and is horrendous vs. the rush and not special vs. the pass ... clearly the coach is n't doing his job well . <p> LB coach ... well we 've discussed this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiko and Raekwon give us 2 legitimate three-down starter building blocks . Having Timmons and Misi on the roster should give us a 3rd NFL-caliber starting LB for early downs . Now we should see whether we can coach LB 's . <p> DB 's coach gets a bit of a pass . It looked like the 5th of July at the Mayo Clinic last year ... everybody getting injured so fast that they needed a ' Gurney Traffic Controller ' to regulate flow to and from the training room . This year with Reshad healthy , the double addition of Allen to keep the seat warm and McDonald to be the real ' other safety ' for the second half of the season , we should actually have competent safeties rather than pretenders and converts masquerading as safeties . Maxwell should finally be healthy . Xavien Howard should finally be healthy and no longer a rookie . Add in another year of development for Lippett and draftee Tankersley and we have a lot of talent that was n't in games last year . So , we 'll see just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To pull this back to the interior OL , I do think that Asiata was a fantastic pick . He brings a physicality we need and have been missing at guard . Hopefully he works out immediately and fantastically , and this encourages the front office to get someone just like him for the other guard slot during the 2018 draft . After all , the Miami Dolphins have drafted at least 1 OL every draft since their inception . If the game is won in the trenches , and I believe it is , then keeping 5 good hogs owning the trenches on offense is a smart thing to do . As long as we 're going to draft an offensive lineman next year ... why not make it another dominant guard and finally fix this tragically comedic offensive line ? <p> I think it may take Asiata some time to adapt . Not only to the level of play but the system . He is labeled as " scheme-diverse " but it still took Jawuan James half the season to get used to a different technique . Larsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a head start and is more experienced . The issue with him could end up being penalties . <p> Did you all notice this ? How do you feel about it ?

@@23051498 @3051498/ <p> Tearing an Achilles tendon is one of the most severe injuries an NFL player can suffer . It 's an injury that affects the very core athleticism that players rely upon , and to come back from such a setback and be successful is an achievement . Cameron Wake did n't just come back and perform well , but went straight back to being one of the league 's most devastating pass-rushers , winning back the starting job that had been handed to Mario Williams at the beginning of the season . Wake was eased back into playing time , but proved too dominant to keep off the field , ending the year with the fifth-highest PFF pass-rushing grade ( 87.2 ) among all edge defenders .

The Bolt fans were cool , not a single bad thing said before or after the game by their fans . Kind of sad that this may be the last Chargers game in San Diego , with that being said .... that stadium is a dump ! I swear the tv in my livingroom is bigger than the big screens they use . It was built in 1967 , great year for the Mustang .... not so much for the stadium . <p> For the game , the only word I can come up with is pathetic . We came out flat and NEVER had intensity .

I think if Jones does n't fumble his int back to the Chargers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we went even deeper in to a funk . <p> I had amazing seats , 50 yardline , Field level , on the 13th row . I was able to see a lot ! The first thing is the O-Line is even worse than I thought , it was embarrassing . The other thing is the receivers get no separation 90% of the time . This is critical with the type of O we run and the weakness of the O-line . Tannehill got hit early and often . On one particular hit , it was ugly . He got blasted in the chest right when he was throwing and stayed down for several seconds . The one thing I did like seeing was one of the guys on defense who came out for special teams helped him up , gave him a bro hug and grabbed the back of his helmet to hold his head and told him something ..... and then patted him on the shoulder . Whatever it was Tanne slapped him back and shook his head like as to say thanks . <p> On to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big supporter as I think most of the issues are tied to the O-line . The O-line played like crap once again , but Tanne missed several open receivers and I do not know WTF that Hail Mary pass was at the end of the first half that went sailing 15 yards out of bounds . He looked shell shocked . When they all out blitzed , on a few plays he was basically back pedaling in the fetal position never attempting to do anything but not get hurt . I have said it before and saw it posted on here earlier about the comparisons to David Carr . I am seeing that and it is sad . I see a QB who has been beaten down for going on 4 years and it may not be recoverable , like Carr never was . It is sad to see . Tannehill played like crap , but that is one tough SOB ! I hope he can turn it around , but I myself am starting to wonder if it is too late . <p> The D is what I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beast but is getting doubled and chipped by a back consistently . Rivers is a hard dude to bring down , he strong like bull ! Jones is a Pro Bowl caliber safety but you ca n't carry the ball like that after an INT . There is no passion on the D. They did come out in the 2nd half and play better , but I think got frustrated with the O and reverted back to crap . <p> Bottom line is this team has a couple of good players and ALOT of average to below average . SOme of our best players like Grimes and Wake are quickly being degraded by time . I hate to say this but we are NO WHERE close . We need to blow this thing up , bring in a LEGIT head coach and rebuild .

Someone else who was at the game mentioned that as well . <p> Tannehill was set up to fail the day the Dolphins drafted him and the damage is done . I do n't think it 's recoverable . <p> Regardless of that however , drafting another QB at this point would be stupid . The new QB would just be set up to fail as well . We need to put some pieces in place , fix the O-line , get a TE and establish an identity on offense , then maybe you can replace the QB .

@@23051541 @3051541/ <h> Keep the push for Vets on the O-line <p> We may draft a few O-Linemen but i think we need to go after at least 2 more vets for the Line . with about 30 million in cap space left we should be in good position to sink about 12 million more into some vets on the line . take 3-4 million to a corner and save 8 million for the draft . then use the rest , say 6-7 million to extend some vets so the cap looks better next year and we can keep moving in the upward direction . if we make that happen we can draft the best available rather than need . <p> I think the smart move/necessary move is not so much to get two new guards but to get a new tackle . Whether or not that 's a RT or a potential/future LT is up for debate . <p> Albert will get hurt again . Look at his track record .

That serves more purpose . He can play RT right away while James goes inside . He can also play LT when Albert gets hurt and when he eventually leaves . If Albert gets hurt again this year he will be cut next off-season . No one wants to see us draft an o-lineman but it would certainly be smart .

I 'm going with Edelman over Michael Thomas tentatively , but the Arizona/New Orleans game looks like a potential shoot out . Michael Thomas is a boom or bust play , but Edelman is a guaranteed 7-10 targets per game against a stout Denver defense , so I 'm still mulling that over . Lastly , I 'm going McKinnon over anyone else due to the matchup against the Indianapolis defense . Biggest weak spot has been TE since Gronk went on IR .

OK fine , any Gadsden is better than no Gadsden , but how much will the wrist and brace affect his hands at catching the ball . Let 's face it , his strengths are n't blazing speed , or exceptional route running . It 's his leaping and catching abilities , and a wrist injury will really hurt his strengths . <p> But what happens if he hurts the wrist even more ? Career ending ?

That is probably exagerated , but still , an injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new contract . The guy gets job security so that 's incentive for him to play . From OG standpoint that would be great .

They would be rolling the dice and taking a chance . Not really a good administration option . <p> Option C ) Have surgery now . By far the best option for OG . He gets the surgery and then is good enough to stay with the team or move onto another next year .

The team is better with him on the field and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute and keep it from getting worse , great , that 's the best option . If he injures it further , than miami has no liabilities with him if its career ending . It sounds cold , but remember as much as we the fans want it to be about winning and a passion for the game , its just as much if not more , just business . <p> One thing that was n't mentioned was BLOCKING . Gadsden is a pretty good blocker . Better than every other WR on the roster except Chris Chambers . And this injury severely limits his ability to put his hands on and abate a DB . <p> I think Gadsen will play out the year . This team has a very good chance of going to the the Super Bowl this year . Can you imagine being on the sidelines when your team is playing in the biggest game of their lives ?

It appears that was the correct read . <p> This feels the same , to me . If Gadsden wants to play with one of his greatest assets missing , and taking the chance that he might destroy that asset for football forever , I do n't think he believes he 's ever going to get another NFL contract and wants to ride this train as far as it will go . <p> Health is extremely important , and this guy should not do such a big risk to his health by playing this weekend . It is n't even that big a game anyway . Also , Ward starting will make Lucas more comfortable , so I really think Gadsden should sit . <p> It 's defintely a big decision , even if he plays as Muck points out , one of the thing s the WR 's do in this O is block down field , even OG pointed out that could be a problem ..

Gray showed me more in a few minutes than Thomas ever has . 2 ) The Interception was CLEARLY on Moore ! 16988 @qwx216988 <p> no it was n't . If you look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ten times ) , you would notice that Bumphis hesitates and starts to slow down just as the ball is released . Matt was throwing it to the spot he thought he would be . That 's just a trust thing . <p> On Phinsiders OJ Mcduffie mentioned the name Orande Gadsden when talking about Kennan Davis . I kinda see what he is saying . I would say he was not Orande in the sense he dropped a 2nd TD pass in his gut . Orande did n't  do that which is why he stuck . Big hands . <p> I have to agree on most of the points by the OP. *Im not sold on Gray like everyone else is . He had one 20= yard run that made it look like he had a good game but his vision is so-so and had one play for me at the goal line where he hesitated instead of just lowering his head and running hard that would have gained him 2-3 yards and instead got tackled at the 5 trying to dance . It was on the first down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all said and done . *Jordan played well and Shelby played great . Too bad he will be buried in the Depth chart cuz he s not bad at all . *Special teams was good outside of Presley as the returner. *Turnovers were annoying . especially since we forced one and could n't jump on it . And the tackling sucked . * Martine seemed to hold his own out there . Hopefully we can work on these thing and come week one we will see a different product on the field <p> I was at the game , and what I saw was similar . Shelby and Jordan looked great . The interior OL blew worse than Dallas Thomas from my view . There was a huge push from the Dallas interior ( backup ) DL that collapsed the pocket darn near every pass play . Egnew looked much better than Miller at TE , bigger , faster and more of a threat . Shocked to see that . #10 and #8 looked good at wideout , as did Bumpus . The others looked lost for the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D was pathetic . Our backup QB situation looks great . Moore and Devlin both look good . <p> I 'm not a guy who breaks down technique and claims to know how the plays are supposed to be diagrammed with a flow chart , but he was my opinion . <p> Keenan Davis belongs . He 's a man making the most of an opportunity and deserves to be on this team . Bumphis reminds me of someone , I just ca n't peg it . It 's not his size or build , it 's his enthusiasm and desire to make every play amazing . Not every play can be a home run . The INT probably does n't happen if he does n't try to make an impossible catch and keep the ball live in the field of play . But I like his effort . It 's just misplaced right now . <p> Jonas Gray belongs . He realizes every play is an audition and he 's giving a lot of great effort . For a power runner , boy 's got some wheels on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open field . Lamar Miller looks like a race horse being held back around the back stretch . He needs to learn more control in the first part of the play . Think Barry Sanders . Learn how to harness that explosion and execute in the initial phases of the play . He 's close to something special , it wo n't be long . Daniel Thomas does n't belong . Two yards and a cloud of dust has got to go . <p> Matt Moore makes very few mistakes and has command of the huddle . Taking the sack in the red zone was a complete rookie mistake . He atoned for it later with his leadership and urgency , if you do n't see a leader of men when he 's on the field , you 're not looking . <p> Jonathan Martin is a turnstile . His obvious weakness is a pure speed rusher . Maybe it 's the off season and my eyes need practice , but it appeared to me the pocket collapsed immediately on every pass play . He was beat before he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaches and I hope in 4 weeks we are remarking how he is the most improved player during camp . Dallas Thomas looked more serviceable at LT than Martin tonight . Honestly , I think he looked exactly the way he should tonight . A solid prospect who needs to learn the speed of the NFL . His footwork was clean and on most pass plays I noticed he made it to his spot before the DE . I ca n't say that for Martin . To me , Thomas was the better pass protecting LT tonight . I was happy with his effort . <p> Overall , I got the feeling Dallas ' cohesion is better than ours and it led to them looking more polished . And because of this I STRONGLY caution the fans . Dallas held starters out intentionally and you could tell the 2nd string " starters " were more prepared . It looked as though they have been getting more snaps . And they 've probably played together in practice more than our guys . <p> Philbin and crew have been shaking things up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . And the benefits of this style of practicing shows up later in the year when you need 2nd stringers to step in on short notice and perform . <p> I CAUTION our fans to not be overly impressed with Dallas . They have a history of being a very HOT and COLD team . They look great when winning and pathetic when losing . They do not have an even keel presence as a team . If we learned anything from last year , a Philbin prepared team plays consistently from day one . We will get better each week . I have a feeling Dallas will get exposed by a savvy Tom Coughlin or Mike Shannahan and all of the smiles and gloated expressions on Jerry Jones ' face will turn to frowns and sideline visits during the season when they have their typical blow up moment . Dallas always peaks too soon . <p> I know we could n't sign everyone . But of the opportunities we had in Free Agency , I believe not signing Jake and Leach were the two moves we could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philbin and staff did n't make those moves because they wanted opportunities for younger guys to step up . For me , that means J. Martin , Dallas Thomas , Jonas Gray and a few other guys now have a chance to step up and become something more . We have to be patient while they become the players this staff envisioned . <p> Do not panic . Our passing game looked just like last year 's . It should . Mike Wallace was n't on the field . When he starts playing with Hartline and Keller , you 'll see just how different we are going to be . Our genie is n't out of the bottle yet . Right now , our weaknesses are being exposed and that 's EXACTLY what we want to happen right now . 0-5 in the preseason means nothing . <p> Derrick Shelby was busy chasing RBs that got past him because he could n't get off the OT 's blocks . I do n't see what anyone saw from him that was impressive . It was n't just Shelby either . Dallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamar Miller needs to learn to take care of the football . There is no excuse for fumbling a ball that the QB put right in the breadbasket . <p> Houston , the Dolphins have a serious issue at LT . Martin again allowing pressure and having trouble with speed but Dallas Thomas was pathetic . Not sure what they were thinking about putting him out there . That lack of trading for Albert just may come back to bite them in the *** . <p> Tannehill was unimpressive in the little bit of action he got . Missing two quick throws as badly as he did is inexcusable . I am going to watch it again tonight but I have to think he is having issues with his footwork . <p> Thanks again to Hayden for a great post as well as the rest of you for your input . A great read . I hope the tackling improves .. This game reminded me of the preseason game against Tampa last year where they ran through us , over us , and around us , looking all world in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a measure of caution before we get too panicky.Still , ( sigh ) , your dead grandmother could have run on our defense last night.Our offensive line ? Looks like we need to make that Leach deal and use the tight ends to the max . <p> I was disappointed with how easily Dallas was able to collapse the edge of the defense early in the 1st quarter of the game . It looked like the OLB 's were caught inside and Dallas was able to make plays . I saw Will Davis and his knack for coverage , he seemed to be glued to his receiver , although he did have that 1 penalty . The tackling was very bad making Dallas ' RB 's appear like Pro bowl type players with all the 2nd and 3rd efforts they got after not being brought down . The team looked " OFF " as a whole . Jonas Gray may be a step slow , but , boy does he run with power . The O-line is going to make or break this season . Unless something miraculously happens I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much push up the middle on Miami 's O'Linman , although it 's pre-season game 1 , I saw enough to be concerned moving forward . LT is going to be a serious problem . While Jonathan Martin had his moments , there is always that 1 or 2 plays every game that gets you sick to your stomach . I ca n't say enough good things about Dion Jordan . The guy is a freak of nature , he is the type of player ( Like JT ) that has you sitting on the edge of your seat in anticipation of a big play . It took him a few plays before his 1st impact was made . His speed off the edge is going to help all the other players along the line and make them better . He showed stoutness against the run too , which shocked the hell out of me , being how he was getting bashed , by some in the media , after Miami drafted him . He 's so good , yet so raw . It 's scary how good he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DE position . He stood up on 1 play and back tracked into the MLB position and like a BLURR came up to make a tackle on the RB . That was all instincts ! ! ! He 's going to be a STAR someday . " The Praying Mantis " now resides in Miami ! ! ! BABY ! ! ! Chad Bumpis looks like he 's got what it takes to make the team . He has a knack for finding the opening in the defense . He 's one feisty SOB ! ! ! Looking forward to him come the regular season . He sure seemed like Devon Bess out there and that 's exactly what this team needed to find IMO , a slot WR . He 's shifty and crafty . Good Job by the F/O signing Bumpis . <p> I have to agree on most of the points by the OP. *Im not sold on Gray like everyone else is . He had one 20= yard run that made it look like he had a good game but his vision is so-so and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hesitated instead of just lowering his head and running hard that would have gained him 2-3 yards and instead got tackled at the 5 trying to dance . It was on the first down draw play . I think Gillislee will be the #2 when all said and done . <p> Borscht ! <p> GILLISLEE showed NOTHING worth mentioning . GRAY is a power HB , who I have maintained has enough speed to run O/s of Tackle . We just have n't seen it at ND , because ND 's " game " when GRAY was there was Tackle-to-Tackle power running . We got a little hint of it last night . GRAY 's power is legit , and YES HE CAN catch a pass and motor , and his blocking in pass-protection may be the best of the team 's HBs , and he 's " hungry " and plays smart . Looks like he 's over the knee injury ... I hope so , because we could use him : THOMAS is the pits ! <p> Poor tackling I expect ... especially when they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things that ticked me off was the punt return teams ... how many freakin times are we going to watch a ball bounce on punt returns before we find someone that will catch it . The first punt by Dallas that pinned us down and ended up being a fumble by Miller bounced outside of the 20 and rolled all the way down to the 11 ... catch the freakin ball ! ! ! ! <p> This is a PRESEASON game and not only that but an extra one .... of course the team will look like **** . They are used to having these games televised locally ... not all over america for the very first live action . The pressure on them was HUGE ! ! ! ! New uniforms , logo , team , just look at the fumble on the first play . Miller was crazy nervous , YET came back and run like a ****ing beast . Also the 1st string defense started out sloppy but quickly recovered their composure and stopped the Cowboys offense . That was enough good things from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its PRE presason . Relax guys . I wanted to stay on the forums but the negativity on here was seeping through my desktop and attaching to me . I was forced to leave the site XD . Just relax and we will have fun when our team actually has a gameplan and Wallace and Hartline are on the field . But ..... I am worried about that line ... <p> I do n't read much into preseason , but the Cowboys were in the same boat as the Dolphins and actually looked like they belonged on a football field -- with basically all of their starters sitting out completely . <p> The only thing I do n't agree with is that the coaching was good . I must have seen guys rushing onto the field on defense right before the ball was snapped 2 or 3 times . And we also had to call a timeout right after a 2 minute warning . <p> NEGATIVES " 1 ) Our LT Position is bad . Really bad . Martin got worked at least once in a short stint and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3rd teamers . BRUTAL . From what I saw , our OL had a less than stellar night all the way around . 2 ) Receivers " No one flashed ANY speed or quickness tonight . The best receiver we had was a guy we signed 5 days ago ( Keenan Davis ) 3 ) Tackling " BRUTAL tonight . Hopefully we get this corrected SOON . 4 ) QB 's " In general they did n't look very sure of themselves tonight . Devlin was the best of the 3. 5 ) Coaching " I know it 's only the first preseason game.But game management and clock management need some fine tuning . This is just the first preseason game .. We were horrible in the preseason last year and we had a decent year . What I 'll be looking for Friday against Jacksonville will be progress in the bad areas listed above <p> Besides the one pressure early , I thought Jon Martin did ok . Nothing spectacular and nothing overly bad . Also , on the first carry that Lamar fumbled , he pushed the OLB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big gain to the left . He 's not a bad run blocker at all . <p> Is he the real deal ? can he deliver accurate throws on a consistent basis , Is he getting a better feeling in the pocket ... Sadly IMO it 's still unanswered ........... <p> Last nights lack of performance especially the 2 throws behind his WR 's still leaves me with major concern ...... the OL did n't make anything easier and would like to put the blame on them but the throws speak for themselves , you got to make those ........ Will need to start to see some " consistency " with him as the pre-season continues ...... forget the talk let 's see it on Sundays ........... <p> Is he the real deal ? can he deliver accurate throws on a consistent basis , Is he getting a better feeling in the pocket ...

@@23051568 @3051568/ <h> Anyone else excited about the potential of a 4-3 ? <p> I think a 4-3 would be better for us now that we have both Traylor and Wilkinson . No one would be able to run up the middle on us just like when Chester and Bowens were in their prime . We could then put Taylor and Carter on the ends with Thomas and Crowder tearing it up at LB . We could also sub in Newman and Roth on long third downs to get pressure/sacks on the QB and we would be freaking amazing . <p> If we did that then the only question mark on defense would be our newly aquired secondary . <p> yeah i sought of have always thought that our defensive line stocks were much better than our linebacking corps and has clearly much more depth . to be honest i was a little puzzled when we changed to the 3-4 with really 2 of the linebacking positions undecided with i suppose zach and channing the only two penciled in starters depending on wether JT changes his position to linebacker and david @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got traylor and big daddy we also have zgonina , holliday , roth , carter and then evans and vickerson. but also depending on where bowens and taylor are playing we have them to , man we have a damn fine defensive line depth wise . <p> Well Newman is a pass rush master it seems looking at his stats and some film . I very much like our team so far especially with all of the good offseason moves . Now if we land TJ Duckett or Stephen Davis to secure our running game then we are golden for the playoffs because I will not pretend for a minute that Ronnie Brown will make it the whole season without an injury . This kind of stuff happens unforunately and it will happen to Ronnie for 1 to 2 games most likely and without a significant backup we are up sh*ts creek without a paddle so to speak . <p> Zgonina and Holliday are the definition of aging and mediocre at this point in their careers though in my eyes . I mean they are good for backups but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rams and Chiefs let them go . <p> I think that Traylor and Wilkinson still can get the job at their ages which is impressive . I remember the first tackle I saw Traylor had last year and he pretty much engulfed Mike Anderson lol . <p> He is a big boy and I hope he makes it especially since a decent back do n't get paid 35 mill . He needs to carry our load for years and protect himself . Newman was one of my favs up here in Tarheel country along with Hodge but I do n't know if they are going to use them much down there . <p> Personally I think our line is stronger then our Lb unit , but I do think Taylor does a good job as an OLB . I like the 4-3 , when you have the kind of talent that we do up front you want utilize them as much as possible . IMO . <p> Zgonina and Holliday are the definition of aging and mediocre at this point in their careers though in my eyes .

One of the reasons why the Pats are so successful on defense even with all their injuries and free agent losses , is Belichick customizes his defense to counter your offense . We need both the 3-4 and 4-3 to be able to do that . I feel we have the personnel to do it well . <p> I personally like Holliday and Carter at DE , while Traylor and Wilkinson plug at DT . Then move Taylor to LB with Thomas and Crowder . Looks like a deadly run stopping team , not to mention the ability to send rush from the second level with Taylor at LB . I also think Taylor would be better in coverage than Spragan , etc . <p> I 'll take the flexibility and distinct advantage of switching back &amp; forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect Saban and Capers are planning .

The move in the NFL is toward flexibility , and we 'll neither be a strict 4-3 team or a strict 3-4 team . We 'll adjust to the opponent and the situation . <p> The Panthers D rates just as high if not higher than the Pats so the flexibility is out the window IMO because Carolina has a great D-line which even as old as ours is I think may be able to get close to the same results . <p> Big Daddy was not brought in to be an every down DT , he was brought in to spell Traylor and eventually replace him next year , and also provide a security blanket in case Traylor goes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of them in there at the same time on some packages , but it will be rare . Holiday is more than capable of playing the other DT spot . <p> I personally love the idea of having the 3-4 , with now 2 huge NT 's to get us thru the game ( Just think about it , Traylor gets a breather and Big Daddy comes in to replace him , just sick ) , and both ends being great ( Carter and Holiday ) to go along with Zack , Channing , JT and Spragan/David Bowens .

Makes me think .... how good it was when we had a Qb that was able to throw a pigskin more than 20 yds ..... and complete it to our team ..... I was thinking we had color-blind Qbs for the past 7 yrs .... Just do n't beat up on the team if the Pitt game gets rough .... They have a tough Def. but we do too ... After that first game ... its gravy for like 6 weeks .... <p> The reason i think we use the 3-4 more than the 4-3 is two reasons . ( a ) It keeps the offense guessing what type of alignment we are going to be in and gives us flexibility . ( b ) Since we use so many D-linemen we can keep them all fresh and able to take on double teams as well .

The problem is that the coaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broadcast but not enough to show exactly when the ball came out . <p> From what I could tell , though , if they had chosen to review that , it would have been a fumble ( b.c. they had a reviewable camera on the other side of the field ) . Ben 's knee looks clearly off the ground when the ball is knocked loose . Sad that it was n't reviewed . <p> I agree . The NFL announcing it was legal is horrifying . Glad to get the win Let 's move on now . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> They did n't say it was legal did they ? They just said there was n't enough to overturn it . It was one of those plays that would have stood no matter what they called but I think most would say it was a forward pass if you put it to a poll .

As for the comparison in Quinn and Ginn , your points are well taken but I think you are comparing the wrong people . The true comparison would be Quinn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wanted at #40 instead of Quinn at #9 . Then if you want to compare Ginn you could compare him to whatever reciever would have been available in the 2nd had we taken Quinn in the 1st , possibly Dwayne Jerret . I realize that we chose Ginn over Quinn at #9 but you have to realize that that decission was not made in a vacume , the teams comparison of Beck and Quinn played a very large roll in it . As for Ginns foot and it effecting his speed the guy ran in the 4.3s a few weeks ago with the foot injury . While it does seem like it has taken a long time to heal , do n't forget it is just a sprain . It did n't require any surgery and should not have any long term effects . I imagine the length of the recovery has a lot to do with where it is located ( in the mid foot area ) and the severity of it . But the good news is it will heal and he should be just fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news that he could miss quite some time because of his foot is making this pick sour . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> instead of worring he may miss some training camp , just remember we could have taken a flop wr from USC who would be there for all of training camp but still stink ! ! ! we got the player we wanted , period . Now we deal with the injury ( thanks OSU players who can not celebrate like men ) and move on ! I love this draft more and more every day <p> You make absolutely zero sense .. Because Cameron thinks we got a better Qb in Beck .. So what difference does it make whether we selected Ginn or anyone else at # 9 ? ? Miami was going to pick Beck instead of Quinn no matter what .. Because he is the better QB . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> My post had nothing to do with Beck or why we did n't take Quinn ... It was merely an observation about VALUE . When you pick in the top 10 of the draft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must consider whether a player 's skillset and position mandate his selection with such a pick . <p> IOW , Ginn will be making HUGE money ... but his current evaluation is that he is a great punt returner and a sloppy receiver who is currently injured . Is #9 money a value for a punt returner and a potentially decent receiver ? That is the question surrounding the pick . Quinn enters the equation because he was available and plays the most critical position on the field , a much easier justification for a 9th pick sized contract . <p> Remember , Welker may not have been as fast a Ginn , but he was a reliable receiver and a decent return man ... how much was his contract again ? Ginn may be a great pick , but only if he quickly blossoms as an awesome receiver . Punt returns and reverses are nice , but at how much money ? I 'm honestly not saying Ginn was so much a bad pick , just that I question his overall value at that pick . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently we did ) , we had to take him at 9 , otherwise Houston would have taken him at 10. 16988 @qwx216988 <p> I guess this is a question of drafting philosophy . In the top 10 picks , do you draft need , value , or BPA ? My problem with the Ginn pick is that I 'm having a hard time assessing where he falls under those three areas . I 'm not sure he was the BPA , and I certainly do n't feel he represents the best value being primarily a return specialist . I understand the need for greater speed and a WR on the team , but the need just does n't seem to rise above the value or BPA question , especially since we have need at QB , which was also available at that selection . <p> Again , I 'm not trying to rain on anyone 's parade or anything , just trying to be a little more objective about the pick . I hope Ginn becomes an awesome receiver ... his contract size will mandate it . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could miss quite some time because of his foot is making this pick sour . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> I would be surprised if Ginn was n't 100% by the end of July . I 'm sure the Dolphins medical staff has given him some MRIs and have a good idea of how the injury will heal . I 'm sure they 'll do everything possible to get that foot back in top condition . It 's a very expensive foot , so I 'm sure Cam and Randy will be thinking about Ted 's foot a lot over the next several weeks . <p> Ted better not do something dumb like slip getting out of the hot tub or at the pool this summer . I read that Joe Toledo actually DID re-injure his knee when he was in the sauna last fall . I say keep that protective boot on Ted 's foot as often as possible ... especially anywhere where he could re-injure it . <p> My post had nothing to do with Beck or why we did n't take Quinn ... It was merely an observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the draft , you are making a huge payout .

Beck plays a huge roll in the decission . Even if you are talking about money , what is the difference in overpaying for a QB and getting a WR really cheap or overpaying for a wr and getting the QB really cheap . The money still comes out the same in the end . Except that we would probably had to pay Quinn more than Ginn just because of his position . And as far as Quinn being more worth the money than Ginn , that is n't the case if he is n't the guy the dolphins wanted . I would rather over pay for the guy Mueller wanted than for a guy they did n't . <p> Not only that , but Linehan of St Louis was on the radio yesterday saying St Louis was going to take Ginn at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next 4 picks after us .. Meanwhile Quinn lasted to #22 , to a team that already passed on him before with the #3 pick .. When you consider this was a deep Wide receiver class and a small QB class , one would think Quinn should have had more suiters than Ginn .. But that was NOT the case .. Many GM 's apparently saw what I saw in Quinn .. A QB who gets rattled easily , has average acuracy at best , and does not throw off his back foot well at all - which is something very important in the NFL when you have blitzers coming at you like wild animals in 3 seconds or less .. <p> I guess this is a question of drafting philosophy .

It 's just that if you accept that Cam/Randy believed he was worth the #9 pick , then you have to take him there . <p> You ca n't judge the weekend based only on the #9 pick in the draft .

It is the weakest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like reaching a bit for a QB or even some secondary/line help is more palatable than reaching for a punt returner . <p> Not only that , but Linehan of St Louis was on the radio yesterday saying St Louis was going to take Ginn at #13 .. So Ginn would have went twice in the next 4 picks after us .. Meanwhile Quinn lasted to #22 , to a team that already passed on him before with the #3 pick ..

A QB who gets rattled easily , has average acuracy at best , and does not throw off his back foot well at all - which is something very important in the NFL when you have blitzers coming at you like wild animals in 3 seconds or less .. <p> But wait , according to many experts on this site ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love Mueller . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> Actually most of the people on ESPN ( Except Meshawn and Berman ) thought Ginn was a top 15-20 pick , but were unsure if he belonged at #9 . They did say though he is a weapon , and very talented player , and if not for Brady still being there , this would not be called much of a reach . <p> Not to mention that there 's another aspect ... special teams . IIRC , there 's offense , defense , and special teams . How many kickoff or punt returns does Booker have ? <p> It 's killing me that so many people have discounted the importance of special teams . How many times in the last 15-years have we had a kickoff return for a touchdown ? Punt return for touchdown ? So , how many times have we forced our ( pathetic ) offense to go a long way to score ? Ginn was IMO as much of a special teams pick as an offensive weapon pick . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> You hit it on the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a great defense , one way to score points is through special teams ... One more piece of food for thought , imagine how scarey the fullback from Hawii will look running down field on special teams <p> Also if Ginn can open up the field for Chambers , and he has a chance to catch some passes again , we are getting another all-pro receiver back.Having the weapons Brown , chambers , ginn , rickey , and brooker starts to give an oc some weapons to work with <p> God there are a lot of crybabies in this thread . There are some definate facts out there : <p> -Quinn was overrated . Seriously the guy was already deep plunging before he even reached Miami . If Cleveland could n't have made the trade there is a chance he falls all the way to 29 . Just because Miami needed a QB did n't mean they had to pick one right there . For all we know he 's Rick Mirer #2. -2 teams have openly stated they would have taken him in Houston/St Louis . -Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped past 20 under any reason . -No offensive player went higher then 22 after Ginn . So offensively beyond Quinn who would you have taken cause this team did n't need a #1 invested into defense . -Russ Lande ( very respected ) said not a single team took him off their boards over his injury . <p> When you look it , things like that have happened in the past around the league with guys coming out and there are a lot of similarities . It just makes sense that it probably is a small break and probably a month or two from now he should be close to 100% . The fact that he ran on it and ran a 4.4 with it in his position tells you that he should be fine when it 's all healed up . It just needs another two months to get through but I do n't think it 's going to be a big issue . <p> Brady was still the better pick , the safer pick , and the smarter pick . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> So what makes Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talk about delusions of grandeur . <p> How exactly can a one dimensional player be the " safer " pick ? If Quinn does n't succeed at QB , he really ca n't contribute to the team at all . If Ginn does n't succeed as a starting WR , he can still contribute on special teams and as a #3 or #4 receiver . And there would still be the possibility that he could be converted to a DB , his natural position . There are several possibilities for a guy like Ginn to contribute and succeed . The same ca n't be said for the QB position . See Joey Harrington , who was a complete waste of a #3 overall draft pick .

@@23051598 @3051598/ <h> 5 things to know for Sunday : Jay Ajayi <p> You would n't have to talk about Miami RB Jay Ajayi 's fantasy stock long before someone brings up the notion that the vast majority of his 2016 production was tied up in his three huge games . Ajayi ran for 200-plus yards three times in 2016 , but only topped 100 yards one other time all season . PFF Senior Fantasy Analyst Scott Barrett investigated that idea , looking at Ajayi 's advanced metrics in and out of those huge games to see whether he 's a smart season-long investment in 2017 . <p> Ajayi also led the league in yards after contact per attempt last season . If we remove his three 200-yard games , he still ranks a very respectable ninth . Ajayi also led in missed tackles forced per attempt with 22.3 percent . If we strip away those three games , he actually improves , jumping to 23.4 percent . If we took away any player 's three best games we should expect their numbers to fall , but it 's surprising how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment among the fantasy community . According to the data , he was n't just good in three games , he was great all season " and unlike other running backs , he was n't just getting what was blocked for him , he was creating plays on his own . <p> The analysis of our run game is simple : when we create running lanes Ajayi is do.inant , and when we do not create running lanes , no running back is going to be very successful . <p> The analysis of What I is similarly straight forward . He breaks tackles at an elite level . He led the league in yardage after contact both of his seasons , one with a few carries and the other as a workhorse back . He is a power back who gets better in the 4th quarter when we are running the ball a lot . <p> His style is similar to that of Marshawn Lynch , in that both are power backs with good jump-cut ability in the hole to make tackles miss . Both run through arm tackles without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correct angle to tease defenders into trying to arm tackle them then running through the arm tackle . Both are nifty enough to avoid many big hits and easy tackles . Both drive and fall forward to get the extra yard . <p> While Beastmode was underappreciated in Buffalo , he became a do.inant league star when he went to Seattle because they built an offense around him and consistently opened running lanes . <p> Similarly , if the Dolphins can start consistently opening run lanes , then the J-Train can become a do.inant runner and our offense truly blossoms . This will require new and better players at the 3 interior positions . <p> Isaac Asiata has that kind of potential , and if he delivers on that potential then Ajayi flourishes . Mike Pouncey is our other key . We can make do with one weak run blocking guard . While not ideal , it is manageable . But that just means the other guard and the center need to do the heavy lifting ... literally . <p> If you discount his top 3 statistical games , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned those 200+ yd games because he broke tackles to make those big runs . They were n't a fluke 16988 @qwx216988 <p> I agree completely . I think what they are trying to say is some people like to say well those were his only good games , but if you remove them his numbers are right up there so not a very valid argument . <p> PFF did a good job explaining that after they removed those three 200+ yard games that Ajayi actually improved in two of the three categories they broke down and that he was great all season despite a terrible run blocking game .

@@23051603 @3051603/ <p> I know I said that these players are not big names but there is no question that Tannehill is the key to this years success . He has had a very solid pre-season thus far and the Dolphins need that success to continue all four quarters of each game . Tannehill must develop a killer instinct and not simply settle for field goals . He is but one part of this entire offense and team but he is a vital and critical part of it. ? <p> BILLY TURNER ? <p> The Miami Dolphins offensive line is a mess right now but one player has played pretty good through the pre-season and that is Billy Turner . Turner spent all of the 2014 season watching from the sidelines , injured . He has been taking first team snaps since the beginning of camp and the Dolphins believe that he is the answer to one of their guard problems. ? <p> Turner does n't have the experience at this level but he has a lot of upside and potential and working between Ja'Wuan James and Mike Pouncey will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolphins success . Turner needs to protect his quarterback but that is not the only job he has in front of him . In order for the Dolphins to succeed , Turner has to be able to punch holes in the defense to give the Miami running game room. ? <p> JAMAR TAYLOR ? <p> If you watched either of the first two pre-season games you will have noticed a significant drop in play by the secondary when the starters are not in the game . That is easily said when it comes to the position of cornerback opposite Brent Grimes . On Saturday the Dolphins Jamar Taylor looked very good before hurting his knee , an injury not serious . Taylor has welcomed the challenge to become better and has shown that he can back that up. ? <p> JARVIS LANDRY ? <p> We all expect to see Jarvis Landry improve over last years rookie season but just how much is Landry needed to the success of the offense ? A lot as it turns out . Landry is the one player that Ryan Tannehill can rely on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennings , Kenny Stills , and Jordan Cameron but it 's Landry who has the watchful eye of Tannehill. ? <p> EARL MITCHELL ? <p> ? <p> The questions are not difficult to answer . Last year Mitchell teamed with Jared O'drick and Randy Starks to form a line that faltered against the run as the season wore on . Mitchell is returning and needs to improve his run defense . With Suh next to him Mitchell will face far more one on one 's this season and in addition will not be a focal point of opposing offenses. ? <p> How will Mitchell elevates his game up front will help the Dolphins stop the gashing rushing attack we witnessed last year late in the season . Mitchell has the ability to play well and carry the line but he wo n't have to this season , he only needs to play well enough to keep offenses from making big gains . <p> ? <p> KOA MISI ? <p> Koa Misi will start at middle linebacker for only his 2nd season .

There are no excuses given the formidable defensive line that Miami has in front of him. ? <p> Misi 's biggest issue to me is his indecisiveness and frankly he needs to make better reads and decisions . He has been far too inconsistent with pursuit angles and needs to work better on wrapping his tackles . We have n't seen a whole lot from him the past two pre-season games as he has been nursing a small injury but when he is in he needs to get better and given the depth behind him , he is likely the best option for the Dolphins . <p> ? <p> DION SIMS ? <p> Forget about Jordan Cameron for a minute .

His biggest obstacle right now is experience because he lacks it . Last year he too was injured as was Delmas and Thomas but this season both safeties need to not only stay healthy but impact the secondary unit. ? <p> ? <p> CALEB STURGIS ? <p> There is no guarantee that Sturgis will win the job from rookie Andrew Franks but last weekend for the 2nd weekend in a row , it was Sturgis getting the field goal practice in pre-season .

I 'm thinking it 's not that high , but I am one of the few who really liked Andre Branch . I probably would of let stills walk , but honestly if it is 8mil it is n't that big of an overpay . I would of went to 6.5mil for him . <p> Some of us think that it 's great that we are successfully re-signing good players rather than seeing them walk out the door . Make no mistake , Coach Gase is probably delighted that we have retained Stills and Branch . BTW - some of us thought that Kenny was eager to stay in Miami all along . His agent did his job to extract a lucrative offer . <p> I 'm willing to bet anything when all is said and done and we see how the deals are structured that Branch 's deal is not nearly as good as Stills , so I would pump the breaks on the Branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It does n't matter how much per year only guaranteed money matters and branch will only get around 10-12 guaranteed . Now go get Hyde Williams Timmons tretter fluker . With higher revenues contracts are going to be higher . We could have kept vernon . But we have to keep guys who thrive in our system and still and branch both thrived . 20 million guaranteed for stills was a very good deal . Low cap number . Very happy so far . <p> I appreciate the frustration for Branch . I 'm mixed on the Stills signing . He 's a good player at a saturated position . Continuity in the passing game vs dispersing resources to more crucial , scarce positions . It 's not my favorite , but I get it . Branch is just silly , but I hope they 're not done with DE in FA , and I 'd love to see Willis at 22 . <p> I appreciate the frustration for Branch . I 'm mixed on the Stills signing .

Branch gives them some continuity and him and Wake being inserted into the starting lineups were catalysts for that 2016 season . <p> But no question , even with this move , DE still ranks as the top need for me and I certainly think there is plenty of talent at DE available at 22 to add to this **30;319;TOOLONG Dion Jordan ) group . I also imagine we 'll see a cheaper veteran added . <p> Stills I 've always been unsure about , but at that number I can live with it . It 's Adam Gase 's show , I got ta trust that he felt Kenny was essential for his offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something ? What 's bad about signing Kenny Stills to 8mil per ? He was projected to get 12 per . I think this is pretty good news . As for the Andre Branch contract . A bit steep but we 're thin at DE as it is .. ca n't afford to lose more at that position . My only issue is we could 've paid OV the same last year to keep him , but time to move on . <p> Getting stills back and hopefully sims is huge it means we will have the core of our offense back in one piece . Cohesion going into year two on that side is awesome . Now if we can just find two decent guards and some depth we can rock all defense in the draft

His rookie year was marred with struggles , as he caught just 26-of-44 targets for 494 yards and three touchdowns while dropping four passes . His overall grade of 73.7 ranked 50th among receivers with more than 300 snaps played . It was n't quite the year people expected , but his 19.0 yards per reception screamed big time potential . <p> Going into last season , there was even more hype ( and pressure ) on Parker to take that next step to becoming the elite receiver he was drafted to be . He improved for sure , catching 60 passes ( on 88 targets ) for 799 yards and four touchdowns . He also dropped just one pass . He finished with the 26th best wide receiver grade in the league at 79.6 . Again not quite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in the right direction . <p> While at times last season he showed that he could be a number one receiver , consistency was an issue for him . He had five games in which he caught two or fewer passes . That simply is n't good enough for an expected go-to receiver . ' Parker will need to use 2017 to prove to the Dolphins that he can be the player they drafted him to be , otherwise he could see his fifth-year option declined .

This is a refreshing change from the ego battles and turf wars of our recent past . A Football team ca n't prosper when all the factions are at odds with each other . We dumped insecure losers like Ireland and Philbin and replaced them with a top notch group , including Tannenbaum . Grier has an excellent pedigree and he seems to bring a great deal to the table . Tannenbaum is a deal maker and Gase spearheads the group . This is great for the future of the Dolphins and I truly like where we 're headed . <p> Regarding the draft , all we 'll hear between now and the draft are smoke screens . I still see us taking a Guard on day 1 or 2 . We NEED at least one more quality Guard fighting for a starting role . Pocic , Johnson , Feeney or Elflien will be our man .

Jarvis Landry ran a 4.51 a month later at the LSU pro day .... Pro football is not track &amp; field . <p> Just curious , what 's your approach when the Combine does not confirm what you see on tape ? 16988 @qwx216988 <p> I watch the tape 2-3 more times . What we ca n't do , which is huge in evaluations , is talk to the kid and his former coaches/teammates . Sometimes you can get a feel from that conversations why someone may have underachieved . <p> Eh ..... it can sometimes , when a guy is asked to play in a scheme that does n't fit his skillset , or he 's asked to play out of position , he may not pop on tape and really show what he can do . Now that 's not to say he should n't still show good technique , instincts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of him when you see him in a different setting . <p> You also have to factor in the school/staff . Some kids just are n't coached well and need more seasoning . For instance , a kid like Ragland coming into Bama as a top recruit , coached by an incredible staff and playing behind a STUD dline with multiple 1st round picks should look good on tape . A kid at Vandy playing behind 2-3 star Dline recruits against Bama might look like crap at times . You have to sort through the tape , watch technique , instincts , see if he does make plays in spite of his teammates and make a judgement . He might not pop all the time , but you have to look for the little things . Then if he shows out at the Combine or Pro Day , you have to project what he could look like with better players . <p> This is something that I do n't quite understand . Should n't being faster allow you to be able to separate easier ? Of-course , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional level . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> Technique plays a huge role in separation . If you plant off the wrong foot or have to slow down to cut , your straight speed means nothing . If you do n't use your hands well against bump coverage , you wo n't have enough time to get separation before your QB eats it . If you ca n't gear down in zones , you may overrun a passing lane . If you do n't understand route concepts and know when/how to break them off , all your speed could run you into a LB or S. There 's so much that goes into being a good WR at the pro level that many college WRs never have to deal with b/c 10 out of 12 games a year they can usually win on speed/talent alone . <p> Landry is still slow even with football pads on , but that does n't  mean he not a good wideout . I never watched film and thought Landry was fast . The film and the clock agree . He has other parts of his game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out run any cornerback . He will out maneuver or out position a cornerback . Landry is this generation version of O.J. McDuffie . Its the scout job to evaluate a players complete game . <p> The 40 has a lot to do with the start and straight line acceleration . That 's why some teams look more closely at the various splits . <p> For receivers , it is about 2 things , 1 ) separation , and 2 ) top gear . <p> 1 ) Separation is a short burst acceleration and generally comes out of a cut , so straight line acceleration is n't even the best indicator . Some guys that are not fast or even very quick can create separation with great route running . Things like the broad jump often show the explosion to get that burst for example . <p> The throwing window depends a great deal on the receiver 's ability to create that separation . Some systems/routes allow the QB to see the separation and then pull the trigger , and require the receiver to maintain that separation . Other systems/routes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at exactly the right time and location . The first is often safest but requires sustained separation from the receiver either by foot speed or body/length shielding . The second type requires precise route running . This is why different receivers can be good or poor fits for certain systems and QB 's . <p> The top gear is the Mike Wallace trait . Sure , people may keep up with Mike Wallace at the top of the rpute , but when he unleashes his burst to separate , only a cushion will allow them to stay near him because his top gear will pull away from just about every DB . <p> Jarvis Landry will never have that Mike Wallace top gear , and may not be a good fit outside . But , he has the quickness and explosion to separate and the route running to maximize his burst . So , he gets good separation . Then his change of direction ability makes him great in the open field after the catch and as a returner . <p> Landry is still slow even with football pads on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wideout .

Its the scout job to evaluate a players complete game . <p> In my experience , tests almost always match the tape .

If someone calls for a new LG because Colledge is n't that good that 's not a surprising thread . It 's not like replacing the QB . <p> I would be shocked if Hartline is back next year . Suggesting we start his replacement in the lineup sooner rather than later is n't like starting a new era . <p> The same Tom Brady I read on here was washed up , stunk and needs to retire ? Even if he does Hartline is not Welker , Embleman , Amendela , or LaFelle . Hartline is the definition of overrated trash that reached legend status on here . He is the next Camarillo ! Where is he ? What happened to him when we cut him ?

@@23051654 @3051654/ <p> If NFL Films ever produces The NFL 's Greatest Medical Exams , Drew Brees 's visit to New Orleans in March 2006 will get top billing . The QB was 27 and coming off shoulder surgery . The Dolphins brought him in and wavered . The Saints signed him instead.Life has been hell for Miamians ever since , except for the fact they live in Miami , so never mind . But still : The Dolphins chose Daunte Culpepper over Brees . That kind of decision can set a franchise back a decade " and it has.It 's easy to question Miami brass now , knowing what we know about Brees and his career . But at the time , the Dolphins had legitimate reasons to be wary . The QB had a torn right labrum . He 'd made one Pro Bowl . He had n't won a playoff game . Everybody knew he was a viable starter when healthy , but he did n't appear headed to the Hall of Fame . The Chargers , skeptical , traded for Philip Rivers and wanted to give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Culpepper . We should have drafted him ! ! ! ! ! ! I still remember yelling at my tv when we drafted Jamar Fletcher ( do n't worry just got really drunk . no animals were kicked in the process ) <p> I have moved on from this . I was so pissed when we traded for Culpepper and did n't sign Drew Brees . I remember many Dolphins fans were excited about Culpepper and many did n't care for Brees . It is what it is , hopefully we will have SI cover with Tannehill and the Lombardi in the future . <p> There is no guarantee that Brees would have played as well here as he has with the Saints either . He found the perfect coach in Sean Payton to get the most out of him . It 's not like he set the world on fire when he was with the Chargers . He just found the perfect situation with the Saints and being able to play in a dome with a pass happy offense . <p> I do n't waste anytime thinking about these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the concerns with his injury and we did n't draft him because he was 6 ' tall . San Diego was in a better position to draft him with their second pick than we were with our first , especially after they traded out of the No.1 spot with Atlanta so they could take Vick . SD ends up adding LT and was more apt to take a chance on Brees after having added extra picks . <p> Then 5 years later we did n't sign him because I believe he had a torn labrum in his throwing shoulder . <p> It makes perfect sense , even after his success . <p> What 's the point of looking back ? <p> Why stop with Brees ? <p> People made bad decisions . <p> Get over it . <p> If the Dolphins win the Super bowl with Ryan Tannehill are Redskins fans going to have posts like this about RG3 ? <p> 5 QB 's went ahead of Dan Marino , 3 of which who sucked , do Chiefs , Jets and Patriots fans still kick themselves for that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember Wanny saying " What can Brees do that Jay ( Fiedler ) ca n't ?

I 'm by no means defending the move .

We were n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening night game vs the Steelers . The hope I had for that team quickly diminished after culpepper looked like he had one leg . Brees had a damn good team in NO at the time too . Who knows what would 've happened . <p> My anger towards missing on that move is about 5 years removed from me . I like where we 're at as a football team and organization at the moment . <p> I still do n't get why people think he 's a horrible QB . A 93.5 QB rating last year . An argument can be made that he 's a top 15 QB . That rating is better than Wilson , Stafford , Dalton , Winston , Tyrod , Alex Smith , Eli , Flacco , Rivers to name a few good to really good QBs . Super winning QBs . <p> I also wonder if Nick Saban would have won multiple championships had the Dolphins drafted Aaron Rodgers . <p> It 's hard to believe that 23 teams passed on Rodgers , especially when you see what kind of talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early on with Miami as the talent there was n't what he has in Green Bay . But , at some point you 'd have to think he would have put it all together . <p> Saban was building a nice defense in Miami and have to think with Rodgers the offense would have turned as well . We could have seen Rodgers versus Brady twice a year to determine the division title and possibly AFC Championship as well . <p> Could argue that Jimmy Johnson wins a title if he had drafted Randy Moss and Ray Lewis . Johnson had some great picks with Miami ( Taylor , Thomas , Madison , Surtain ) , but those were huge misses . Can you imagine what a talent like Moss would have meant to Dan Marino late in his career ? Certainly more than the team got out of John Avery . Lewis was the tone setter for Baltimore and a huge piece to their super bowl teams .

@@23051673 @3051673/ <p> PHOENIX -- Time has a way of uncovering facts and this morning has been a good one for that.I take you back to January of 2012 when the Dolphins were conducting a head coaching search . One candidate name that flew under the radar then but surfaced in an ESPN article today is Bret Bielema , who was the Wisconsin coach at the time.I 'm told owner Stephen Ross was really high on Bielema at a time he was leading the Badgers to multiple Rose Bowl appearances . Carl Peterson liked him a lot as well . But the pursuit suddenly ... just ... stopped . A day and a half into the meetings the sides , I 'm told , had " personnel issues . " And now I understand the " personnel issues . " Bielema told ESPN that during his meetings with the Dolphins he promised them a Super Bowl in five years if they drafted quarterback Russell Wilson in the second round . Wilson was Bielema 's QB at the time . And when the coach told the Dolphins he wanted his college QB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They all looked at me like , ' You ca n't say that. , " Bielema said . " That 's the difference between college and pro . He 's undersized . He ca n't throw . ' I was like , ' OK , all right , ' and I honestly , that day , kind of pulled myself out of it . " Bielema told ESPN he could n't work with people he could agree with on what players Miami should pick.The Dolphins picked Ryan Tannehill in the first round with the No. 8 overall pick . Wilson was picked by the Seahawks in the third round with pick No. 75 . The fact is Wilson was passed by the Dolphins three times because Miami used its second round pick for Jonathan Martin and its third round pick ( No. 72 overall ) for Olivier Vernon.But , again , Wilson was not a secret to the Dolphins . I am told that Bob Griese , a Hall of Fame quarterback and part of the Dolphins broadcast team , told everyone within the organization that would listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolphins Wilson was , as one source put it , " far and away the second best quarterback prospect in the draft behind Andrew Luck . " <p> Obviously , no one listened . <p> I will say then-general manager Jeff Ireland told me in a 2013 conversation that he " liked " Wilson . But he had decided Tannehill would be his guy and he was n't about to double down at quarterback by picking Wilson as well.And , obviously , we do not know whether Wilson would have had the same kind of success in Miami that he has had in Seattle . He is surrounded in Seattle by an outstanding defense and a great running game . The Dolphins no longer have an outstanding defense.But none of that changes these facts : The Dolphins were told at the highest levels -- ownership -- Russell Wilson should be their man . They dismissed the notion out of hand . Then a person of high reputation within the organization tried to convince people Wilson was a find . And he was ignored . What might have been . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to pick stars , but another to get them to fit into a specific system . Tannehill ran a lot with the Aggies . He came here and was told to stay in the pocket at all costs . Last year he started running more . Made first downs and kept drives going . So if Wilson did come here , there 's a possibility he 'd be misused . <p> While I do believe Russell Wilson is a special player and would love to have him as our QB , I do n't fault the Dolphins for their skepticism toward Bielema 's promises . <p> It 's so easy to look back and say " We should 've drafted Kuechly in rd. 1 and Wilson in rd. 2 and we 'd be set right now " , but the truth is no one could 've predicted Wilson going to 2 super bowls in his first 3 years in the league . And also , no one can guarantee that having Bielema as our HC and Wilson as our QB would = instant success . <p> So yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front office ( and we 've had plenty ) , but like I said , that 's easy to say 3 years later . <p> Anyone who watched Wilson in college could tell you he was special . He was a difference maker for a crappy NC State team . I watched him for 4 years and it was clear his intelligence was far superior than any defense he faced . He had the " it " factor . I did n't care if he fit in a size box or not , I wanted him in Miami big time . He might not have been as successful in Miami as he has been in Seattle but I do know he 's better than Tannehill . This is n't a knock on our QB because I like him and feel he will be our guy long term . However Wilson is far better of a QB . <p> What I do n't understand with this team is they know what it takes to win but they will never put it together . Once you get your QB , then protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself a RB . Easier said than done , ha ? SMH ! <p> Anyone who watched Wilson in college could tell you he was special .

But , can you imagine if the Dolphins did n't draft a Qb at # 8 ( like Tannehill but instead decided to draft a prospect like Wilson ( Which nobody else was kicking the for down for ) ? <p> There is freaking absolutely NOBODY on this website , NFL Media etc that would have been like ... GREAT MOVE MIAMI . <p> Wilson would be a twitching mass of humanity if he had to suffer behind this o-line with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him , but I 'll fully buy his hype when I see him without that supporting cast . <p> If anyone thinks that Wilson would have been as successful in the Dolphins organization as in Seattle , they are grossly mistaken . The majority of Wilson 's success has been a product of having great complimentary crew around him . He also benefits from Beast Mode ( who had 17 total TD 's this season to Russell 's 20 passing TD 's ) and a defense that can shut an opposing team down at will . Not a knock on Wilson , I 'm a huge fan of watching him play and seeing how he responds in tough situations . But again , that mentality is a team mentality where no one will quit on him and the team around him refuses to lose . <p> The Dolphins organization would have found a reason to throw him under the bus for being too short and for running too much . Seattle/Carroll has that dog mentality where they will claw their way with who they have . Wilson fits Seattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport ... you need the o-line , you need a running game , u need a defense ... Russell Wilson gets the job done when needed , he does n't  lose games for the team . He does what is needed and what is called upon him . If we had Beast Mode in our back field would we use him ... ummm YEAH ! ! ! <p> This story is probably true , but Ireland prided himself on selecting players that met his criteria for height , speed , weight , etc . He was taught by Parcells and the one occasion that they ignored the size parameters for QB , was when they drafted Pat White . Bielema effectively eliminated himself from consideration by expressing his desire for Russell Wilson . Ireland would have walked out of that meeting thinking that he can not be dictated by a college coach who does n't understand that a QB has to be over 6 ' 2 " . I bet Ireland privately called him an idiot . <p> You guys thought it was a joke when I had this scoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you should n't start threads talking about hiring some loser ground and pound coach .

Max Unger should have been a Dolphin ( that 's who we should have taken instead of Pat White ... stupid Ireland ) forget Wilson . <p> People forget that Wilson was almost benched his rookie season cause he had a stretch of games where he was really bad .

Whatever defense we run will likely be built around Ndamukong Suh . He had great success in Detroit but 90% of the time he played left/strong side DT . He lined up mostly in the B gap between the right guard and right tackle or in the A gap between the center and right guard as a 1 technique depending on the call . <p> We have the same coaches here from Detroit that ran the wide 9 in Detroit . Typically Suh was lined up as a 1 or 2i tech and not always in the 3 technique role . He also would occasionally line up as a 6 tech and stunt back into the opposite b-gap . This surprised me as I always thought of him as the prototype 3-technique . <p> He was still pretty good in the same ( strong/left side ) role in Miami but deficiencies in coaching as well as players next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . Every time I noticed him last year he was on the left side of the defense next to Wake or Shelby . <p> Now if we run the 4-3 under , where does he go ?

In OTA 's he was reported to be on the left side once again . It would seems to me that if we run a true " under " defense , the 3 tech is the most logical spot for him but then we do n't have a guy to play 5 tech unless Jordan Phillips plays that role . Then we have ? at the 1 tech ?

We see with Tannehill what can happen to a QB when he 's blitzed all-game , he starts making errant throws and bad ball placement trying to get the play off fast . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> The current scheme does n't  work .

I brought this up a year ago with many having interest but , nothing ever came of it . <p> You need to understand NFL licensing issues . A site , like FH , can put out a T but , not with the team 's logo or name . It can be brought in to a degree but , not named . <p> The site I am thinking about using , especially since there seems to be little interest , is teepublic.com . You upload your design and within the first 72 the shirt is only $14 . After that it goes up to $20 . The plus side of this site is I can set which color shirts it goes on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white shirts with the design on it . They also offer other styles of clothing like tank tops and hoodies , they just cost different prices .

@@23051755 @3051755/ <h> DeVante Parker continues to show flashes GIF <p> Parker playing at this level ( granted the second play is in garbage time ) makes me feel more comfortable if Matthews is n't retained this offseason . Put that money towards Miller and find a coach that can use him ! Anyway , enjoy the gifs . <p> I agree . After witnessing this FO and coaching staff at work for 3 1/2 years vs. other teams who get the most out of their rookies , I 'm not sure how people can still come to the conclusion that it 's on Parker not knowing the playbook . It could very well have been his foot but I 'm guessing it was n't about the lack of knowledge of the playbook . <p> What I 've seen over the last few weeks is that he 's playing faster - you play faster when you are comfortable in knowing what you 're doing . This is where the challenge for the coaches comes into play - do you keep a player on the boil and not put him out there until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing across the board ? or do you throw him to the wolves and see what that gets in return . <p> In relation to those players who flash in practice/preseason , but perhaps show concern in other areas - I 'm always a fan of throwing them in at the deep end because it can help steer discussions with , you have to work on this , that and the other . And sometimes , players are a better game player than practice player . <p> But it seems to be a trend with this team - even the likes of Cam Wake who sat for a while , when a of folks thought he should have been out there earlier . <p> Sometimes you just have to let Talent go and do it 's thing - or try and let it go do it 's thing . <p> He definitely has flashed these past 3 weeks and hopefully we will see more in the final two . I 'm still not fully there though ..... as I have also seen plays where there is not separation or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . <p> I 'm an optimist with Parker and hope with a full active off season and a new coaching staff , he will be the star we all know he is capable of being . <p> One of the lone bright spots on this team . I 'd hate to lose Matthews ; would rather lost Stills and Cameron . Not sure what their contracts looked like , so maybe that is completely unrealistic . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> Losing Stills would be a terrible decision and Cameron is one of the most misused players on the team . He 's only on a two year contract , though , so if they want to let a legitimate seam threat and redzone target walk , they can . It would be a very Dolphins thing to do . <p> He definitely has flashed these past 3 weeks and hopefully we will see more in the final two .

I get he was injured but you ca n't tell me runNing some packages for him in the red zone while he eased back would n't have helped . <p> I think the biggest thing now is getting his confidence up . There have been several plays where I think he just was n't used to the dbs being physical . I think that 's something with him that will improve with reps but it 's something he was n't getting . <p> The kid is special , no doubt . His routes still need to be cleaned up , but that 's coachable and will come with time . His intangibles outweigh his shortcomings , and I 'm excited about what this kid can do in the future . <p> He had foot issues all year . That 's why he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You saw it in the Giants game - not coming back to the ball etc . He 's going to be good next year . He and Landry are going to be fun along w Stills . <p> Nice Gif thanks , but I 'm not getting excited about a guy who only shows up after the game has been decided . Its time for him to make a few of these plays in the first half , to be honest he looked a little slow on the 2nd one , but trying to take the corner on that bad foot maybe the reason .... hopefully he stays healthy the rest of the season so he can work out instead of rehab this summer , we need him to be great ....... <p> What I 've seen over the last few weeks is that he 's playing faster - you play faster when you are comfortable in knowing what you 're doing .

He definitely has the tools . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> I 'm as big of a Davante Parker fan as anybody and I thought he has all the makings as a number 1 WR , but Cooper was just in another league in terms of being a WR prospect . Parker was much closer to Kevin White ( the 2nd WR taken ) than White was to Cooper IMO . <p> Also not everybody is going to develop at the some rate . Some peak too early , some are late bloomers . Remember there was a time when the Cowboys were made fun of for taking DaMarcus Ware over Shawn Merriman.

@@23051760 @3051760/ <p> Good morning everyone . Drafts are made years from now with these picks and the UDFA 's that will be signed immediately after today 's selections . Also , " real " fans stay with draft through 7/8pm tonightor maybe we do not have lives . Whatever it is nonetheless , let 's keep the discussion going . The last few days have been awesome . <p> Here are some players I like as we head into todaysome will go early and others will be undrafted . I made some notes where I see fit . <p> QB * Mettenberger * Murray * Shaw <p> RB * Seastrunk * Tallaferro <p> WR * Bryant * Herron * Hoffman <p> OT * Lucas- Foot issue , but looks the part . * Wesley Johnson- Jack of all trades on the line . <p> C * Paradis <p> DT * Jones- very productive , but had some injuries . I think he makes it . * Quarles- excellent player , but got in some trouble recently . * Carrethers- huge body , could develop into a space eater. * Barnett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flags here , but high character , high energy LBer . He will get exposed in the passing game , but he could help the Fins run defense . <p> OLB * Bradford- not sure where his position is , but plays so hard . * Telvin Smith- so slight of build , but he can run and could help in a nickel package and special teams . * Christian Jones * Reilly <p> Debate as we may about over-reaching with our first round , our offensive line seems poised to be a solid group . Looking ahead to today 's draft , I 'm not sure if there is a day one LB starter left in this draft . I also do n't think we can draft a corner who will be overtake our picks from last year , much less Finegan . We can certainly draft for depth at these positions , but it would be hard to expect them to start this year . I think we look for impact guys that will be absolute gunners on special teams . I also would like to draft another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trading Moore after pre-season injuries may occur . <p> DaQuan Jones of Penn State is someone I hope Miami gets . I think he goes early 4th , but we 'll see . Also , this could be the round that the Dolphins get a linebacker or that big receiver ( Brandon Coleman ) . <p> I would be looking for guys who were team captains and who were produtive with good character . That is the MO here . forget rankings . throw them out . teams know what other teams want . that 's why all the trading . <p> Agreed .. Plus his game is similar to Odrick and Starks - disruptive , pass rushing DT . We may need someone who can plug effectively .. I liked Khyri Thornton for that , but he got taken earlier than I anticipated . <p> Debate as we may about over-reaching with our first round , our offensive line seems poised to be a solid group .

I also would like to draft another QB in the 5th round for competition and the possibility of trading Moore after pre-season injuries may occur . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> You could be right with the LB 's . Skov 's knee is questionable . I said before the draft that Jelani Jenkins must be counted on to take the next step . I think he has a lot of potential to help . <p> I most def. think that the team can do the following today : 1 ) find a CB to compete with Will Davis at the very least 2 ) Find a FS that could back up the Delmas/Jones combo 3 ) Find athletes to help Darren Rizzi. 4 ) Find a QB to push out Pat Devlin . <p> I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset by having one of the top 5 receivers , described as Boldin-like as the consolation prize . We really do need a dependable pounder who can catch out of the backfield when not blocking . Fortunately , more so than any other skilled offensive position , panning for late round and UFA gold seems to work pretty well , conjuring up names like Turner , Bradshaw , Holmes and Foster off the top of my head . Since RBs are undervalued with the top tier going later nowadays , a case can be made that yesterday 's first and second rounders are today 's 3-5th rounders so from a quality assessment standpoint , there 's that too . <p> Hopefully we can draft the next Alfred Morris , cuz we need someone like him . <p> Good move , ESPN starts to focus on back stories ( ala Bob Costas in the Olympics ) on Saturday . You wo n't see many picks . <p> I do ESPN on Thursday because I actually find the combo of Kiper/Berman/Gruden entertaining . The switch to NFLN started yesterday . 16988 @qwx216988 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories . Plus , they will pimp the NBA today . Who do they think is watching this part of the draft . Show and analyze the picks . They will be all over Michael Sam too . <p> I see some decent CB 's that could push Will Davis available and they have potential to help down the road . However , I think the team thinks that are okay at corner . Grimes is locked in . They rave about Taylor . They believe in Finnegan . Jimmy Wilson played well in the nickel last year . Will Davis ? Not surebut they might say these corners are not that much of an upgrade over him ( I vehemently disagree with that ) but I could see them saying that . 
@@23051761 @3051761/ <p> Very impressive feat considering that the jump took place after he had already gone through a full workout . Just sick athletic ability ! <p> As for John Wendling the safety , I saw some of his Combine workout coverage , and I 'm not sure he would be a fit on our team . I think the guy has the intelligence and the football instincts to play in the NFL , but he seems a little stiff in the hips , and he has more long speed than quickness . I think he would do well playing near the line of scrimmage , but he would struggle if asked to cover over the top . I think this guy is either going to be like John Lynch or take a more unfortunate turn and become like Adam Archuleta . Lynch was never fast , but his football IQ made up for physical speed , and he learned to play effectively in the box and out in space . Archuleta on the other hand is completely lost when you move him more than 5 yards from the line of scrimmage.

I have to agree though , the aqua pants with the white jersey on the road are pitiful . They look like we slapped them together at the last second . In baseball , basketball , and hockey , a lot of teams have third jerseys that have completely different designs . They 're usually pretty cool and sell well . For instance , the Edmonton Oilers have the one with the big drop of oil and the Dallas Mavericks go with a different color scheme . Maybe we should try that for the road .

Stopping the Bills running game on 3rd down and short will be critical . The inside out of Jackson / Spiller will test our LB 's . They will get their yardage , but hopefully we make a few plays too . IMHO , the game shapes up as a defensive battle , and a battle of field position . It will be a field goal duel .

Maybe he 's doing a lot of that now ! I 've been into running since college but I get the feeling Zach would beat me pretty good in a 5 or 10K <p> Maybe all the football injuries , probably a ton of little things we never heard of , prevent him from lifting heavy anymore .

You 're all over the map with your posts ..... and then you start this thread ? I can understand someone being a homer for their team , but even as a true fan you have to see the train-wreck that your team is right now . <p> Most NFL games are not decided until the final six minutes and up to that time it 's anybody 's game . I 'm not ready to claim any game a victory yet . The team has to prove it can impose it 's will in the fourth quarter . When teams like the Patriots and Broncos reach the fourth quarter in a close game everybody fears they will find a way to win the game . That 's what I want to see with Miami this season .

@@23051820 @3051820/ <p> Nothing against Bortles , but our QB is Ryan Tannehill , and I think he will do just fine and be our franchise QB . I also think he will do better than the other recent Texas A&amp;M QB ( Johnny Manziel ) , who I think is going to be a major bust . But we shall see what happens . <p> i 'm waiting for bortles to show that not willing to stand in against delayed pressure up the middle he showed in college ... and i tell ya another thing while he throws the ball down the field he throws the ball in some tight windows ... that may get better as he learns to see things faster or it may lead to picks ... <p> anyways tannehills one of the best young qbs in football ... bortles could be down the road ... i 'll take my bird in hand ... especially when i add in that after all this on the move stuff wears off with tannehills legs i have zero doubts he can play a high end traditional pocket qb ... like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and not flashed in the pan <p> I prefer Tannehill as well . He definitely has better arm talent , and is more athletic . Neither are outstanding deep ball throwers . I feel that Bortles has better pocket presence , improvisational skills , and instincts . I think both are franchise QBs . I do n't think Tannehill will ever be elite , but could be around the top 12 QBs . I think Bortles is a franchise QB as well , but has a lower ceiling . <p> Bortles looked very impressive in his preseason games , and I 'm about as critical as they get when talking about rookie QBs . His stats were ok but he made some great throws . He looked like a 5 year vet . Forget what you saw at UCF , he has decent players and coaches around him now . <p> I 'd take Bortles without hesitation . No adjusting required .

He also thrashed Baylor in the bowl game as two touchdown underdog when it was obvious that a huge number of points would be required . Tannehill has invariably flattened out in similar situations , including college with big first halves and next to nothing in the second half . <p> Bortles has superior instincts and can throw on the run either left or right .

But Carr has really bad pocket presence . He showed that in college and confirmed it so far in the 2 preseason games . He has A+ arm talent , and incredible athleticism . Believe it or not he ran the same exact 40 times as Johnny ( 8ball , Middle Finger , Clipboard , Football ) . I just think the pocket presence thing will be what holds him back from being a franchise guy .. but what a great combo of arm strength/ accuracy/ quick release/ athleticism .. <p> Of course any personal preference nets out as more subjective than objective and is influenced by one 's own perspective and biases , despite what we 'd all like to think . <p> Some posters are firm believers in " pedigree , " going back to high school as a precursor of things to come . In that regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school recruits , Rivals ranked Tannehill the 23rd best at his position and Bortles at 44 , almost twice as low . <p> And certainly some prognosticators consider the collective wisdom of the drafting experts to extrapolate out future success . Of course there exist anomalies like Brady as a 6th rounder and Wilson as a 3rd rounder that refute that wisdom , but even more indicative are the early swings and misses like Russell , buttfumble , Leinart , Freeman , David Carr , Harrington , Gabbert , Boller and Losman ( some of those first rounders being the equivalent of NBA " lottery picks ) who argue that the success of an early draft pick is only as good as the individual team and decision-makers picking them . <p> That being said , and acknowledging that it was the iconic Jeff Ireland who selected Tannehill at 8 , my own opinion is that if this version of Blake Bortles was available in the ' 12 draft , he 'd have gone 4th or maybe even after Weeden . A case can be made for both possibilities . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success and more a reflection of relativity vs other available QBs in that draft coupled with the skill of the major draft decision-maker . David Caldwell in his first GM job and draft in ' 13 picked Luke Joeckel which was almost a no brainer and looked good until being season injured in the 5th game and Cyprian in the second who had 86 tackles . But IMO the verdict 's still out on him also . <p> So obviously I 'd take Tannehill over Bortles as I would over RG3 and Weeden .. but not over Luck coming out or Wilson from what we know now . I was disappointed in him blowing the jest game ( Peyton Manning himself would have been eviscerated behind our line in the Buffalo game , but by the same token , given the off the field disruptions , terrible offensive schemes and coaching , the loss of his most trusted receiver in Gibson and Keller in TC ( net effect with Fasano gone , no one not only to block but also for red zone receptions ) , the offensive OL , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a rookie kicker getting the yips , etc and ad nauseum , my impression is that considering with what he had to work , it 's a wonder Tannehill even kept us in contention through 14 games , especially that NE masterpiece . <p> Bortles , based on what I saw from him over the last couple of college season , the guy 's a leader and a born winner , those are things Tanny just does n't seem to posses for me . Hoping to be proved wrong though this year , which is make or break for Tanny I feel . <p> I Bottom line , with Bortles you get the first quarterback picked in that draft , while we settled for third with Tannehill .

The guy is a monster-- there 's no reason he ca n't be great as long as he gets the reps and is able to acclimate . <p> Margus Hunt is a free agent this year as well . If we ca n't play real defense maybe we can just collect athletic freaks . 16988 @qwx216988 <p> True , lol . We would have the all-discus defense . : lol : <p> Margus never really reached his potential because Zimmer left . He also had a back injury since the moron strength coaches at Cinci make their players lift their maxes right after the offseason . You ca n't just show up after vacation and squat 700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost all linebackers and a lot of d-linemen he played against back then . He 'd be a sitting duck these days for any defender wanting to lay the wood . Just too slow and stiff to play in today 's league . But he was an animal when the average linebacker was 225 pounds , or bigger , but slow and unathletic . <p> Yeah . To say he was slow and athletic could n't be farther from the truth . Qualified for the olympics , did n't start playing football until he was 23 , 4.4 for a 260 lb guy , 35 in vertical , he could bench over 400 and squat over 700 lb and long jump over 23 ' . Guy was a freak who was done in by injuries 
@@23051841 @3051841/ <p> On the topic of McNutt and the Panthers , wow , what a mess in Carolina right now at the WR position . They are losing all their receivers from last season . The scary thing is that right now McNutt might be the #1 receiver and he has never caught a pass in the NFL . In fact only one receiver on the Panthers has ever caught a NFL pass and that is Kealoha Pilares and he only has 2 career receptions . <p> So while McNutt is probably the current #1 WR in Carolina he was probably the 5th best in Miami at the start of the season . 6th best if you include Binns before his injury . Poor Cam Newton , he needs help at WR big time .

@@23051853 @3051853/ <h> Ryan Tannehill : not a guy you pay money to see <p> According to Armando Salguero of the Miami Herald , the Miami Dolphins have seen " no appreciable surge " in ticket sales since announcing on Monday that first-round draft pick and cheese-faced happy boy Ryan Tannehill will be the team 's starting QB . Salguero notes that Fins fans have endured 16 mostly terrible quarterbacks since Dan Marino departed to the Big Isotoner in the Sky ( read : CBS studios ) , so the collective hesitation about a thrower who many felt the team reached for at no. 8 in this year 's draft is hardly surprising . But thus far , on Hard Knocks and in the preseason , Tannehill 's looked capable and occasionally frisky at QB . Bonus : He 's got a big smile , a cheery presence , and seems to have that " It 's cool , guys , I know I 'm a rook " thing going during the light hazing this season . He 's also got the tools " if not the weapons " to succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That settles it .

@@23051855 @3051855/ <p> This is exactly the kinda reason I hire a discrete and skilled professional to harass my ex-girlfriends . The average guy just does n't have the psy-ops and secrecy training to handle this important task well . <p> Well , I imagine that the Linebacker corps just got one body lighter here pretty soon . If for no other reason than for him not reporting it to the team , which is his responsiblity . With him being a longshot to make the team as it is , they may very well cut him soon . Although , If I knew a player was going to be cut and I am Dave Wannstadt , perhaps I keep him as an extra body to run the offense on ? ?
