If you do n't have the time or the desire to take your catfish reels apart , your local reel repair shop will clean reels for around 20 " 30 bucks each . If you like to tinker , taking apart an Abu reel is relatively easy , if you keep some key points in mind . <p> Here 's a guide to cleaning your fishing reels . As always , one may find some easier methods , but here 's my method . <p> These basic steps for cleaning and lubricating a fishing reel will work for all baitcast fishing reels . Some of the parts may have slight variations but the overall process will be the same . <p> here 's how to clean and lubricate an Abu Garcia Ambassadeur fishing reel . <p> You can use any reel lube and oil that you prefer . I use a variety of lubricants but the Abu Garcia brand products work well because they do their job well and can be found at most stores . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat tip and the #1 Phillips screwdrivers . The extra flat tip screwdriver is available in the event that the 3 thumbscrews are too tight on the Abu faceplate , but most importantly , for the pawl cover . <p> To clean the parts you can use Simple Green or Oxy Clean . Be careful not to get any over spray on to your line , unless your cleaning agent is biodegradable . This reduces the chances of affecting the properties of your line . <p> If you 're really going to be cleaning a lot of reels you can use an ultrasonic- cleaner to clean the parts . We 've gone to this system because of the volume of fishing reels to clean it really helps expedite the process and the investment is minimal if you buy one like this . We use a mixture of water and a small amount of Simple Green and it makes the cleaning process a breeze . <p> Before you begin , you do n't have remove your fishing line , just put a piece of electrical tape on the line . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it keeps your loose line from getting caught between the spool and the frame . If its time to change out your fishing line then go ahead and remove it . here 's an awesome DIY fishing line stripper you can build for pennies . <p> Do n't forget to work in a well-controlled area . There are a few tiny parts , and they can easily be flung off.never to be seen again . <p> PRO TIP : If you 're not experienced cleaning fishing reels use an empty egg carton to put the parts in when you 're tearing the reel apart . Put the parts in order in seperate slots of the egg carton and in the order removed . It wil help with finding parts and keeping up with the order they go in when putting the reel back together . <p> We 'll break the reel down into 4 major parts : <p> Left faceplate Frame Spool Right faceplate <p> All parts are referenced as if you are holding the reel in the casting position , with the level wind pointed away from you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although well begin by removing the right faceplate first , we 'll go over this part of the reel last . This section has the most moving parts and consumes the majority of the percentage of your time when cleaning the reel . <p> Start by removing the 3 thumb screws on the right faceplate . Use a flat tip screwdriver , if the screws are too tight . The right faceplate assembly will come off the frame and the spool will come off the spool axle . <p> Next , remove the 3 screws on the left faceplate with a #1 Philips screwdriver . <p> Clean out the faceplate of any dirt and debris . Check the teeth on the cog wheel to ensure that the gear is n't stripped . Apply the grease/lube along both sets of teeth on the cog wheel . I put one drop of oil in the axle seat ( hole in the faceplate ) and one on the cog wheel spindle . You can set this faceplate aside , because that 's all there is to that piece . <p> Now , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear , so that line guide moves all the way over to one side . You 'll need to do this in order to clear the reel foot with a screwdriver . Remove the pawl cover with the screwdriver . Pull the pawl out from the line guide assembly , taking care not to lose it ( small part ) . <p> Slide the worm gear clip off of the worm gear and set this piece aside . Pull out the worm gear and the entire assembly will come apart . <p> Again , take care , here . The worm gear sleeve at the other end of the worm gear cover could come loose ( small part ) . If you have a C4 reel , you will have a bearing in place of the sleeve . <p> Clean off any dirt or old grease . Run a cotton swab through the worm gear cover and line guide to get out any dirt or debris . Clean the pawl tip as well , since this is what runs through the grooves on the worm gear . <p> As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cosmetic purposes , but you really do n't want any dirt in and around the ingress points like where the spool makes contact and where the worm gear cover sits . The thumb guard snaps on , and you can remove it to give it a more thorough cleaning . <p> Let 's put this assembly back together : <p> On the worm gear itself , put one drop of oil on the tip and one drop on the white collar just below the gear . Slide the worm gear into the worm gear cover . When sliding the assembly back into the frame , remember that the worm gear is tabbed , so it will flush into the frame when seated correctly . If the plastic sleeve fell out of the worm gear cover , make sure it 's oriented correctly . If you have problems seating the assembly , usually , it 's because the sleeve is backwards . <p> Here 's where having a third hand comes in handy . Slide the complete worm gear assembly back into the frame . While it may take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember 3 key points : <p> Ensure the top tip of the line guide seats inside the slot of the top frame post . <p> Ensure the bearing does n't fall out and onto the floor .. never to be seen again ( yuplearned that one the hard way ) . <p> Make sure the tabs of the worm gear cover fit snugly into the reel frame on the sleeve/bearing side . <p> When you reinstall the worm gear clip , make sure it seats between the white collar and the gear . Flip the frame over and move your line guide back over to one side . Pop in the pawl and move your line guide slightly , until your pawl is almost flush and is inside the grooves on the worm gear . Screw your pawl cover back on and turn the worm gear to verify function . <p> Move the line guide to the center and place a drop of oil on either side of the line guide onto the grooves of the worm gear ( here is one place that you can use two drops ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread the oil around . I also place a drop of oil in the groove on the thumb guard post , where the top potion of the line guide slides across . <p> Now , you are done with this section . Place this aside , and grab your spool . <p> Pull off the plastic spool pinion gear . Place a drop of oil on the spool bearing and pop the spool pinion gear back on . <p> Note : Older Abu 's may have a brass bushing instead of the bearing . I recommend replacing the bushing with a spool bearing for a much smoother reel . If you wish to do this : <p> Spool bearing " part number 13472 <p> The part number is the same for the 4000 " 6000 series . <p> Now , flip the spool over and place a drop of oil on this bearing as well . There is no need to remove the spool brake . That 's it for the spool . Now for the good stuff .. <p> The spool axle is held in by a little black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension knob and pull the axle out . <p> Using a #1 Philips screwdrivers , remove the handle cap . <p> Here , you will see a small C-clip . Be VERY careful with this clip . I 've lost way too many , so I keep spares handy . This C-clip not only keeps your handle nut from getting loose , but it keeps your handle gear shaft tight and down to align your gears inside the faceplate ( just some FYI ) . If you lose this , it is n't the end of the world , but you could notice some skipping issues with your reel . Not a fun time . <p> With your 1.4mm flat tip screwdriver , carefully wedge the tip in between the C-clip and the handle post . Once again , be careful not to fling this clip off into the infinite reaches of space . <p> Remove the handle nut with the 10mm open ended wrench and remove the handle . There will be a handle spacer plate right underneath the handle , so take care when removing the handle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and two metal tension plates will come out off of the shaft . <p> Turn your assembly right side up again and remove the two inner faceplate screws . Lift the faceplate off of your brake plate assembly . <p> Grab the handle shaft gear and remove that entire assembly off of the brake plate post . <p> Remove the excess grease from the brake plate assembly . There is a little copper washer that sits on the brake plate post . <p> Remove any excess grease and wipe it clean . Place a small drop of oil at the base of the post and place the washer back on top of the oil . <p> Next , remove the drive gear from the handle drive shaft , including all the metal and felt drag washers , plus the anti-reverse bearing sleeve . <p> Clean off all the grease from the handle drive shaft . <p> Turn the drive gear upside down and you should see a black felt washer . Carefully , clean any and all excess grease and oil . Grease and oil will seep into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag . Place that black felt washer back onto your handle drive shaft . <p> Wipe off any and all oil and grease from the remaining felt and metal washers . <p> Place your drive gear back onto the handle drive shaft . <p> Now , place all the washers back onto the drive gear in the order that you see in this picture from left to right . <p> A felt washer goes on the drive gear first , then the round washer . <p> Next , add another felt washer , then the round tabbed metal washer . <p> Finally , add the last felt washer , then the round washer with the raised collar . <p> On the brake plate assembly , add one more drop of oil on top of the copper washer that sits on the post , and slide the drive gear assembly back onto the post . <p> Apply a light amount of grease between the brake plate pinion gear and the drive gear . <p> Clean the anti-reverse bearing sleeve and place it back on the drive gear assembly . <p> Clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the axle seat and two drops inside the anti-reverse bearing . <p> Go back and second check the washers on your drive gear . Make sure the washer with the tabbed ends is sitting correctly in its grooves . <p> Slide your faceplate back onto the brake plate assembly , minding the alignment of the push button release , so that you get a proper seat . Screw down the faceplate with the two inner screws . <p> Now you will be reinstalling the two metal tension plates . Orientation is important . The easiest way to remember , is that the tension plates should mimic the open and closed parenthesis shapes as they fit onto the handle drive shaft like so : ( ) The plate curving upwards should go on first , then the plate curving down . <p> At this point , I tighten my spool tension knob almost all the way down , because it 's easier to get to . <p> Screw your star drag back on . <p> Turn your assembly over and place a drop of oil in the hole of your metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar side in ) back into the spool pinion gear until you hear it click . It should do a slight lock into the black clip inside the spool tension knob . Once it 's in , you can back off on the spool tension knob . On the inside of the metal collar that surrounds the gear/axle , place two drops oil . You can put the drops anywhere , but I usually put them at opposite ends of each other for even distribution . This will help to lube the brake blocks on the spool for smoother casting . <p> Set the assembly aside for now . Grab the frame and screw on the left faceplate . <p> Back to the right faceplate assembly , slide your spool onto the spool axle , ensuring that the brake blocks are not protruding out of the collar and that the brake block assembly is aligned with the gear for a perfect seat . <p> With both assemblies oriented this way , I like to pop the frame assembly on from the top . This way , I know my spool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force the pieces together . Ensure your alignment is correct . Once the assemblies have snapped into place , tighten down the 3 thumbscrews . <p> Reinstall the handle spacer plate , with the two outer ends flat against the star drag . <p> Apply a drop of oil at the base of each paddle on the handle and turn the paddle a few times to spread it out . <p> Place the handle back on the shaft and tighten the nut with the wrench . Before re-attaching the C-clip , check the alignment of the handle nut cap . <h> Comments <p> Nice and very informative instructions how to clean an Ambassaseur reel . Just one minor point you wrote : " Loosen the spool tension knob and pull the axle out . " I would like to add this " , turn the axle half a turn to release the axle and pull the axle out .

Ive been watching Barry since we both were very young on The Outdoor Trails Show . I have a question . I live near Navarro Mills Lake . This lake is basically a shallow lake no more that 20 ft deep except in front of the flood gates which you can not get to . I do not own a boat : I fish off of the fishing pier . Water is about 19 ft deep there . This lake is full of blue , channel and flathead cats , but for some reason I have yet to catch any catfish other than a few small channels . I 've used every bait you can think of . Any suggestions would be much appreciated . Thanks for all you do to help the novice fisherman . <p> Hi gene . I live near a very similar lake that only goes to 14 feet . It only has channels in it but i have caught them up to 16 pounds . How i find them is to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 8 pounder from floatin a shrimp around a swamp cooler someone did n't  want anymore . So i would try and find structure in that lake like a transitsion from pepples to sand or a feeder creek or even a submerged creek channel . I understand your shore bound so i doubt you have a sonar , but that is just a minor setback . You can usually find these type of spots by just paying attetion to the ground your standing on , i have found that the features you find above the waterline extend below it as well . So with a bit if leg work i am sure you will find some good spots that hold better cats .

We went for at least two long years with almost no rain at all . The lake levels on many of the Texas lakes had reached critical points with the low water . <p> The drought was so bad we 'd started working on alternate plans to be able to launch our guide boats . The main lake I guide on during much of the year was down to one boat ramp and the loss of another few inches of water in the lake would have shut it down . Many of the boats already could n't launch because of the low water levels .

My home lake came all the way back up to it 's pull level rising fifteen feet over the period of about ten days . Not only did it fill back up but it flooded and most of the North Texas lakes were shut down due to the dangerous flood conditions . <p> During the winter of 2015 " 2016 the rain slowed down but it came right back in March of this year and it came back with a vengeance .
