I tend to post them on GoodReads . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience might not , an Audible price of " $25 " is n't real dollars . Some of the audio books have even more outrageous price tags $66 for Truman . It is like how Safeway and other stores have perpetual sales and membership pricing .

Another category of extreme Audible is " Romans : The Greatest Letter Ever Written : Complete Set " at 153 hrs and 59 mins for $14.95 . <p> Big fan of the Great Courses myselfback when it was its own company . If you get a chance ( and you are interested in classics ) , then check out any of the courses offered by Elizabeth Vandiver . Theyre excellent ! <p> I like it , reviewing books is a fab idea . Inspiring people to read books is helping world peace by exposing minds to new ideas and ways to look at life . Of course this is only true for good literature , the junk that 's passed for literature is astonishing .

Beyond the anonymity , would you continue the Tryout approach or revert to a more traditional conversationally styled interview but in a textual format ? 
@@98355967 @2555967/ <p> The Tungsten T2 is out . I 'm not terribly impressed with the specs , but its a step in the right direction . The Tungsten T is still a great product and you can probably get them for quite a bargain now . <p> As of last night I have been happily in Austin , a much needed vacation and also a wonderful oppurtunity to visit my sister Charleen whose birthday is the driving reason for this visit . Its interesting because we did n't  get along terribly well when we were both younger ( and there were ten years between us ) but now we seem to grow closer every year . The goal for this weekend , when not partaking in festivities , are to finish all of my email , including the ones from January and December that I still have n't taken care of .

I 've decided for the forseeable future every weekend all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be composed and responded to in some sort of poetic form . Sure it will probably increase the amount of time each email will take , but whistle while you work , spoonful of sugar and all that . <p> I 'm dead tired , but before I go to sleep I wanted to inform you of a neat tool you might dig . Month before last at the Houston Palm Users Group ( which I lead ) we did a bit on creating ebooks . I covered the Palm Markup Language which is a sorry excuse for a markup language . To balance out how bad PML was , I wrote a little tool that would convert Project Gutenberg texts to a format more sutable for ebook reading . See the problem with the Gutenberg texts is that they are plain ASCII files which wrap every 76 characters or so . What this means on a PalmOS device is that you get a line and a half of text , and then a break , and it makes reading anything a major pain . <p> So what HPUG DocIt ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  get funny line breaks everywhere , except where you want them between paragraphs . Its pretty basic , but I 've found it incredibly useful and a number of members of the group have as well . Even though the only other time its been mentioned was at the meeting and on the HPUG website , it converts about a dozen documents every day . Anyway I 'd just like to put this out there as a service . The interface should look pretty familar to Texturize users , with the additional option of being able to upload text files . If there is interest there is definitely a lot of room for improvement in this tool , for example it could convert the ASCII faux text styling ( stars for bold , underscores for underlined , etc. ) to HTML equivilents , and it could also determine when the nend of a line is a hyphenated word and deal with the break accordingly . But for now , it does one thing and it does it well . Enjoy .

The average brain is 56 cubic inches and weighs 3.3 pounds . " <p> Well , who would have thought that installing a keyboard and mouse could be so difficult . After my first few words , and using the mouse just long enough to start to really like it , everything has crashed and burned . One of the questions burning in my mind was if I could use the keyboard a , nd mouse with my existing Bluetooth dongle , partly because I do n't  want to have to carry anything extra around and mostly because the " laptop adapter " for the Microsoft Bluetooth receiver sticks out from the laptop at least 4 inches . I plugged my old dongle in , and nothing special happened . Not surprisingly , the Bluetooth keyboard and mouse stopped working . I went into the Bluetooth software that came with the dongle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair them somehow so they would work . The good news is that it was able to detect both the keyboard and the mouse . The bad news is it had no idea what to do with them . Any attempt to discover their services turned up blank . <p> I should have known that the operative word when dealing with Microsoft is " proprietary . " I was n't entirely dismayed though , I was ready to stomach carrying around the ridiculously long MS Bluetooth dongle just to be able to use the very cool Explorer Mouse ; I like buttons and this mouse had them in buckets . But being able to dial up to the internet through my cell phone ( T68 ) using Bluetooth is even more of a must , so I decided to try that with the ugly Microsoft Bluetooth adapter . It worked , beautifully . Many times when dealing with the current Bluetooth software implementations Ive felt like it was back to the old Windows 3 days , when the interfaces were clunky , buggy , unresponsive , and ugly . The wizard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real part of the operating system . In fact it was apparently , but well get to that in a minute . <p> Anyway the phone works just fine with the MS adapter , however I could n't get it to talk to either the mouse or keyboard now . I thought maybe this is just a software glitch , so I went through all the regular motions . Reboot , retry , un-install , reboot , reinstall , reboot , try again , uninstall other Bluetooth software , reboot , try again , reinstall , smash mouse to smithereens against head . Okay , I made that last one up , but I did all of the others , perhaps more than listed . At this point I was thinking it must be a simple hardware issue , so I changed the batteries in both devices to fresh ones that I was sure worked , and tried again . Still no go , it simply would n't detect either of the devices . <p> Having isolated nearly every variable I could think of , I decided to try it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first step of installing the software , and it tells me that for it to work it has to have Windows XP Service Pack 1 installed . Life is too short . <p> As a last ditch attempt , I decided to try and pair either of the devices with my phone . I think the keyboard might have paired , even though it probably would n't have worked anyway , but I 'll never know because of the proprietary and non-standard way which the keyboard and mouse pair works only with the Microsoft software . Which only works on Windows . The latest version . With the latest Service Pack . ( Did I mention it un-installed the special software for my touchpad on the laptop ? ) <p> What I suspect happened is something about the way the old non-Microsoft Bluetooth adapter tried to interface with the devices messed something up , and that is what 's causing them to not work . But at this point I really do n't  care . <p> Maybe Logitech will come out with something nice to counter this , and maybe then I 'll try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disadvantages to using Bluetooth HIDs , such as no current BIOS supports it , it tricky , it takes up two of your seven possible Bluetooth devices , does n't  offer anything extra , the range is n't worth it .

Still , how far do you need to go ? <p> So I have packed everything up from the batteries to the cruddy documentation , and tomorrow I will attempt to get store credit and buy something that actually works .

@@98355988 @2555988/ <h> Starting a Bank <p> I often get asked something along the line of , " If you werent leading Automattic , what would you work on ? " There 's not a single answer to this question ; the answer changes day to day . But I think if you asked me today , I 'd say I would like to start a bank . <p> There are very few people who really love their bank . We 've all dealt with overage fees that stack up , brain-dead fine print , and a general malaise . There 's also a unique opportunity in that mainstream contempt for financial institutions has never been higher , while at the same time there is an incredible amount of government backing that essentially makes it a no-risk environment . People are hungry just for anything different , something contrarian . A David to the Goliath banking industry . <p> The name of my bank would be something supremely boring , like SafeBank . The idea behind it is that bad behaviour in the banking world has been largely inevitable because their compensation structures incented people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve level 2-3x higher than Fed requirements and any other bank . SafeBank would have no bonuses . Critics would say this would make it impossible to attract top-shelf talent . Every time the bank gets attacked we 'd turn it into an advertising opportunity to emphasize why were different . " We cant attract top-shelf talent ? We take your money and put it in a vault . We do n't  need the million-dollar bonus geniuses on Wall Street to do that . SafeBank . Bank , safe . " <p> In fact , the first few years of SafeBank would be largely focused on acquisition through every trick in the book . At the very beginning pull a Gmail/WordPress.com and make it invite-only , which will create a buzz and also allow you to give amazing white-glove service to the initial customers , who will in turn tell their friends and make a ton more buzz . ( You can also target certain profitable segments and ultra-safe depositors at first , like Gmail users in San Francisco ( using Firefox with an ad-blocker ) who make six figures a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks and debit cards and theyd need a distinctive design so if you saw one you 'd say , " What 's that ? " which would then start the whole conversation again about how SafeBank is different . <p> For the first two years you could also do things like not allow accounts larger than the FDIC-insured limit . No one has ever heard of a bank turning away money ! But youd say that although everything SafeBank does is risk-free , its still a startup and if people have more than the insured limit ( 250k for single , 500k for couples ) in an account , they should put the extra somewhere else . Again , this will impact a very low percentage of customers , but everyone will think its remarkable . This can be phased out after a few years ; in fact , it would be a PR opportunity . " Weve been in business now long enough that we feel comfortable with larger accounts . " Boom , free coverage . <p> I 'm a tech guy so of course a lot of focus would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with a Google-like simplicity and attention to speed . All logins would be two-factor , with the default being itd SMS you a one-time code to log in when you gave your email address . A big part of the website would be the blog , of course . It would have a strong Ben Franklin-like common sense voice , and in addition to giving a few cool saving or home tips each week , it would cover at least one financial industry story a day . <p> " Bank of America spent $40,000,000 dollars on airplanes last year . We spent $40,000 to develop an iPhone application so you can check your balance from anywhere . " - ( Hmm , the iPhone app should cost like $2.99 . ) <p> " Heres how to block advertising when you browse the web with Firefox ; it makes the web faster and less annoying .

If we had an extra 16 billion dollars lying around , we 'd put it in the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid out bonuses they never would have needed government intervention . ) " <p> " So-and-so Banks website requires you to use Internet Explorer . We beg that you do n't  , because there are way cooler and faster browsers . Here are 3 open source browsers you can switch to today . " <p> ( Thats all made up . ) The headlines would almost write themselves , and every time a financial institution is in the news itd be an opportunity to contrast why SafeBank is different and what the underlying philosophy is behind why its different . <p> All of the marketing would be on the web and viral , because itd be an online-only bank like ING Direct . No storefronts where people have to wait in line or risk a bad interaction with a teller , or that get robbed and need insurance ; basically a lot of the historical risk of running a bank could be eliminated . When you sign up it would have a " tell your friends about SafeBank " address book feature that would connect you to them if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Bank of America has something like this ) , and also make it easy to send them money , PayPal-style , if they have an account . <p> How would the bank make money ? I think it would n't touch anything risky on the financial side it would be a data company . The first 3 years the focus would be entirely on customer acquisition , marketing , PR , and building a world-class tech team building a rock solid infrastructure . SafeBank would make way , way less money than banks currently do , but it would be more than enough to build an amazing product in a sustainable way , like Craigslist did with newspaper classifieds . After a certain milestone , say 100 billion in deposits , I would buy or clone Mint . SafeBank would have more ( and more accurate ) data about its customers than almost any other company in the world other than credit card companies , so the online interface would have Mint-like lead generation offers based on that information . For example , you spend $140 a month on electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd save $200 a year . Think of it like Gmail contextual advertising but based on where you spend your money rather than the words in an email . There also might be aggregate data opportunities for economic research or targeting , but I 'm not sure if I like the privacy implications there . <p> SafeBank couldnt raise VC or anything like that because having any sort of exit expectations would completely kill the safety story , but I think it could be bootstrapped and after a few years would be hugely profitable . Its existence would also put huge pressure on existing banks because depositors would be leaving in droves , putting pressure on their reserve requirements . Existing banks could n't compete in a traditional way because they have such a sordid history of customer apathy and bad PR . SafeBank would n't be trying to capture their profits , it would largely be destroying them and making much smaller amounts of money in non-traditional bank ways . It would be somewhat like a credit union , but for the masses . <p> Anyway , this is just how my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll think the last industry I 'd every want to be in is banking . = <h> Related 14594 @qwx874594 <h> 242 thoughts on " Starting a Bank " <p> When I was living in the USA it seemed like every state had its own banking laws , but I imagine a lot of the challenges is just how complex these banks systems are .

In your post you mentioned several things that are currently a regulatory problem even having a company blog is a problem for investment firms all material that communicates with the public has to be approved by a compliance team- banks are similar . You cant deny deposits and have all kinds of regulations about how many loans you must give , money you must take , etc etc . You cant even buy ( let alone start ) a bank without having all kinds of approvals which they will not give you because you do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sadly we have very little competition because of this . But it will take a visionary to break through the internet will certainly help but the only thing that will really help new competition is to have less regulation . Most people think deregulation is an ugly word and the cause of the current mess , the opposite is true- get rid of the current regulations so a Matt or Marc could enter the space . <p> Then people would have to choose again between very safe but extremely low return , and very unsafe , but high return . <p> The whole cause of the banking crisis was the safe investments not being used at all , all money going to the very unsafe , which caused a cascade failure . One unsafe investment fell through , causing another to fall through ( because the first firm went bankrupt ) . <p> In other words , Matts bank would have made 0 difference . <p> The problem was not safe investments being unavailable , the FED offers investments that are as safe as America itself . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen over low risk investments for two reasons : <p> 1 ) US monetary policy and various regulations provided excess capital . The FED may offer safe investments but they incentivize mal-investment and help to create bubbles . <p> 2 ) There was an ( obviously correct ) expectation that the " too big to fail " institutions would get bailed out in a crisis , creating a moral hazard . <p> I do n't  know any average people that chose to invest in high risk areas . I know many that took out mortgages they could n't afford because the banks offered it to them . The banks offered it to them because of easy credit from the FED and the implicit guarantee of institutions like Freddie and Fannie . <p> In truly free market , one with much less regulation and no distortion by a central bank , there would be more interest in lower risk investments . When the high risk investments failed , nobody would be there to bail them out . <p> Not wanting to rain on your long teeth brushing brain storming here are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly reading you idea while eating my toast <p> You say that there is currently a no risk environment in banking . Not only is this a paradoxical statement in terms of banking but unfortunately your bank would not qualify for the TARP scheme , as indeed the 89 other small banks that have gone bankrupt in the US have found out . <p> We ca n't attract top-shelf talent ? We take your money and put it in a vault. Although you later go on to contradict this false advertising claim by discussing how you 'd make money , its not really much of a bank , or indeed a business at all , if you just take the money you 're given and stick it in a vault . Remember you have to pay each of your customers interest and the fractional banking system only really works if you take their money and make more interest with it than you are paying out . Which means you are taking on the risk of holding their money ( see that risk word again ) . <p> As another poster has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to is a pretty terrifying one . But , but , i hear you cry , look how the banks created the current crisis . If so , i suggest you read up on the Greenspan Put , Fed Policy to not prick bubbles , The model portfolio theory , the efficient market theory , Chapter 11 bankruptcy law , the yen carry trade , the mark to model/market accountancy changes amongst other things before blaming banks for the crisis . The banks did ignore and ultimately underestimate the risk too long , but they had little choice given the lax regulatory and governmental economic environment that developed through the late 1980s onwards through the policies of the BoJ and the Federal Reserve . <p> " How would the bank make money ? " Youd lend it to other people at a higher rate than you 're paying out . That 's what banks do and this creates risk . <p> " I think it would n't touch anything risky on the financial side " it would be a data company . " If that 's the case , its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to register as a bank and enojy any of the protection schemes and/or FDIC guarantees . <p> " The first 3 years the focus would be entirely on customer acquisition , marketing , PR , and building a world-class tech team building a rock solid infrastructure . " <p> Ok let 's assume you take in one million pounds from investors and give them interest of 3% a year . In three years you 'd have paid out approximately -100k in interest and also i assume you 'd be paying your great PR and advertising teams some nice salaries . But you wont have actually made any revenue . Now this might sound fine in the insular world of web 2.0 as many companies build up a user base before making any money ( and in most cases never making any money ) . However , banks do n't  work like that . In late 2008 , when a few money market funds lost money on the lehman brothers bankruptcy and announced that they would n't be able to pay back all of their investors money ( and i 'm talking about saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which might not sound like much ) , panic ensued and the industry lost 7% of its assets in 48 hours and these investors redemptions caused various funds to go under . So saying you want three years of losing money and eating into your deposits as you build up a user base might not go down too well with your depositors . <p> " after a few years would be hugely profitable " How exactly would it be profitable ? Yet again , youd need to be making more money than your paying back and this would require you to invest the money and financial expertise . <p> Ok nitpicking over . Having said all that , i do applaud some of your ideas to make banks and their bonus structures more transparant . The problem is , the banking world is painfully complex and by definition the idea of a bank is the assumption of risk . And as we 've found out in the last few years , this is something that anybody can get horribly wrong . <p> The point about interest rates is misleading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for overdrafts etc , not from lending money from current accounts . Personally , I would be very happy to use a bank ( or whatever you might call it ) which charged a modest fee for managing my money rather than using it to finance bets , which is what investment banks do . If Safebank used my financial data like Google , they would be able to predict cashflow , make bill payments on time and generally do what a good business manager would do , only for a few dollars/euros/pounds per month . Let 's do it ! <p> Try a Frost Momentum account , its free and the Flash interface is good . You can tag your purchases like Mint , you create the categories . Also its a paperless account and you do n't  need to visit a branch if you do n't  want tothe idea is to save money , like you 're saying . Also Frost has a long historynot that you do n't  Matt = <p> They are about to announce some SMS services . I hope Frost continues to innovate , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on technology . <p> I do n't  believe that you can have an invitation only bank and still receive the Federal Insurance ; I think that you have to be an equal opportunity bank to have FDIC backing . That being said , I *really* like these ideas , so sign me up ! I think that I would want an opt out option on the advertising . I would also like a BlackBerry app developed as quickly as the iPhone app = You would also have to address the time that it would take to generate and send the SMS passwords . Oh ! Do n't  forget to have banners available for people to place on their websites ! <p> It would be open to everybody , just in the beginning it would be limited to something like 1,000 new accounts a day , so youd sign up on a list to get notified when there was a space available and reserved for you . <p> I think this thread is starting to hit on possibly the biggest downside about this business : dealing with government ! Something most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun out of it . <p> But seriously , brilliant idea Matt ! ING Direct is trying to do some of this but not all . Very innovative . <p> Paradigm changing ideas always sound crazy at first , something you certainly know better than I. Why not ? Look at what WordPress did to the way we all experience and think about the web and communication in general . Why not banking . I 'd move my money from ING to SafeBank ! If Arrington can build the CrunchPad , why cant you start a bank ? Yeah ok , that 's stretching it a little <p> LOL ! I just had to comment on your comment . I was really laughing out loud . I also think about how clean I am getting my teeth while I brush . I get most of my ideas instead when I shower . And even while I shower and think at the same time , I sometimes forget to add conditioner to my hair ! <p> The missing story of the past year was all the small local banks that performed just fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were conservative with their money and consequently had very few problems while still making money . <p> I use USAA ( . com ) and I really love it Theyre not far from your invitation system , in that they only offer membership to military personnel and their families ( then certain family members of existing members , this is how I got it , I married a member ) . <p> Their service is the most excellent service Ive ever gotten anywhere . For real , nothing compares . Their website is pretty darn good . I do everything online , even deposit checks with my scanner . I can use my ATM card at any ATM and theyll refund any fees from the other bank ( they do n't  have many of their own ATMs ) . <p> USAA has a really nice iPhone application too . You can check balances , they have an accident collection form ( if you use their Auto Insurance ) , and with the latest version you can deposit checks by taking photos of them with your phone . <p> I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I agree with these sentiments . I had no idea about the check depositing , and I 'll have to look into those services , because I definitely love and trust the company . <p> Your ideas sound great , Matt . I hope we see more innovation in banking . <p> Agree with the rest on USAA . No ATM fees . Deposit a check with a free application on my iPhone from anywhere and have the funds available instantly . Customer service that wows every chance it gets . They just ca n't be beat <p> No .. this fee is NOT dishonest or unethical , but its all so easy to make a mistake <p> Banks have even rigged the system against you sometimes . If you go into many banks and deposit $500 ( you 've got an existing balance of $10 ) and then write a $200 check that check could overdraft , simply because the bank has n't  made it " available " yet . <p> Seriously .. you just deposited your money , but the bank wont let you spend it ! ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance ) and will let you make a deposit one minute before the end of the day to bring your account positive . As long as your account is positive at the end of the day , they will waive the fees . <p> Other banks will run checks and stuff going out of your account first , and THEN do the deposits going in That means you could have deposited the money to cover the checks , but since they took the money OUT before putting your deposit IN , you got overdrafts . <p> Another way they screw you is by charging that fee instantaneously . I 've had cases where an ( incorrect ) overdraft charge caused other checks to bounce . When you finally convince the bank that that charge was invalid , and they finally credit you back the overdraft fee try cleaning up THAT mess . <p> Delaying that overdraft charge from coming out of your account , even by a week , would save consumers billions of dollars . What other business in the world gets away with charging a fee first , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for a haircut until after you 've received the product even your credit card company sends you a bill before charging you fees for not paying it why shouldnt it be the same with banks ? <p> Overdraft penalties are not unethical its the way they are handled which is not . <p> While definitely not your idea of SafeBank , there is a fairly remarkable bank that I became aware of as part of participating in the LaunchBox accellerator program . <p> Square 1 Bank https : **27;0;TOOLONG is very much a " startup " bank . All of my interactions there were with actual people that could get things done . They were actually able to offer good advice on things , they " turn away money " from anyone who is n't a VC backed concern , etc . <p> Yeah but their web stuff is horrendous we 've used them as well as Silicon Valley Bank which is the other go-to for startups . They 're " valley " in name only , it does n't  feel like there 's any real innovation especially on the technology side coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of other offerings . I had a local Virginia Bank all but accuse me of fraudulent activities for wanting to open a business account for an online business : " What do you mean you do n't  have an office ? " <p> Square 1 covered the costs to FedEx all the documents to us and was overall just about as cool as a bank could be . <p> On the technology side they also offered us a scanner for opening an account ( no toasters ) so that we could scan checks for deposit electronically , which I thought was pretty cool . <p> I think you are completely wrong about safety in credit cards . Frauding a credit card is much easier than a debit card . To fraud a credit card all you need is the credit card . A signature is not enough to validate/invalidate a purchase in my mind . <p> With a debit card you have to have a password ( PIN ) , which in most cases is a number that is random ( or should be ) . <p> I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases where with debit card you know instantly if you have the money for a purchase . <p> I think banks like SafeBank would discourage the use of credit cards as spending money you do n't  own is not a safe practice . <p> There are others that do it as well . Schwabs Investor checking account offers a rebate on any ATM fees you pay . I believe USAA reimburses up to a certain number per month ( though its generous I never came anywhere close to it ) . <p> Matt the bank you want ( or a lot of it ) already exists . It is called a Credit Union and you have one of the very best very near you on Second Street patelco . <p> Theyve had online banking since 1996 . They do things like cover all transactions against a stolen debit card even though they do n't  have to by law . And you may not realise it but credit unions are in fact now open to everyone . <p> I second the person who suggested that you work on a teleporting device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only thing I do n't  like about your plan is the SMS part . I only had my cell phone for two months but I received about 20 fake banking-related SMSs trying to get me to call fake numbers or use fake sites . I think there are too many SMS scams for you to use that for the PINS ( unless I have misunderstood SMS and it stands for something else now ) . <p> I would be so upset if SB functioned only in US . I am Aussie and we want to be initially included . payPal took years to make us equal . Please send me your invite , for the start I will invite only proper people , after proper consideration to whom I send it . Good on you Matt . <p> Just wanted to throw my vote in for UTAHCONs suggestion of a Credit Union rather than a bank , the differences are subtle but in general creating a Credit Union is probably easier and offers more benefits . <p> also , open a branch in Japan at the same time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy . and the geeks and regular people here are probably even more apathetic about the possibility of good banking than North Americans easy to surprise and delight them with the story you 're telling . <p> I love my credit union , NFCU is really good . I would like to see a more technologically advanced credit union , using the Verisign little 6 digit number system that works with the iPhone VIP app would be awesome . <p> ING Direct has actually based quite a bit of publicity around the fact that they do this . They say do n't  want the large accounts , do n't  want customers who expect to be treated better than most other customers , etc . <p> While your hubris is attractive , I think you need a little deeper understanding of banking . <p> Banks no more make money off taking deposits than Google does by conducting my searches . Just as Googles business model is to put eyes in front of ads , a bank makes money by aggregating savers and matching them with borrowers . <p> While retail banking is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more so from the perspective of the bank , because retail depositors are an expensive ( though stable ) source of loanable funds . Many banks would just as soon not have to deal with them and stick solely with commercial clients and the interbank market for funds . <p> The other problem with your model is the idea that keeping a capitalization 2-3 times higher than your competition would somehow put you at a competitive advantage . While your bond holders and depositors might appreciate that , any equity investor will be signing up for returns of 1/2 or 1/3 what she might get investing in your competition , though we expect that to be mitigated by cost savings through efficiencies and marketing . <p> I think there is tremendous room for improving the current situation for retail depositors , but I 'm not sure that yours would work . You cant lose sight of the big picture the borrowers are the banks customers , and we depositors are suppliers . <p> I do n't  think SafeBank would be attractive at all to equity investors , for exactly the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it could be bootstrapped cheaply enough to avoid having to raise money in public markets . <p> Excellent points Jim . I do think there are other banking models that will work . I seriously wonder if this " do no evil " approach to banking can make money . If Google charged even a penny for a search , their share of the market would be no where near what it is . <p> You see a bank like Wamu . They played nice and they were swallowed whole . <p> Hi Matt , I really like how you want to grow the bank as in get the clients , but , maybe I 'm wrong , I think I see a flaw in your argument at the end of the article . Why do you need a bank if you just want to make money the way Mint does today ? Looking at it only from a business perspective it seems to me its way to complicated and it takes a lot of time until you 'll be able to make money . The only way it makes sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of social corporate responsability kind of thing which makes you a incurable dreamer = And I say this as a genuine compliment . Sorry for my possible english mistakes . Its not my native tongue . <p> You rock , Matt you can do anything because you appeal to the intelligence of people first and you call to action afterwards , when people are listening . <p> I personally have an idea for co-operative micro-credit banks to be established in every single family or small group in Canada ( which could be done in any country , actually ) where anybody could borrow at the prime rate and then , loan the money at any interest rate " the co-op members " wish because , whatever money is made , its REDISTRIBUTED back to everyone ! <p> Isnt that cool ? <p> Paying interest on loans which will be PAID BACK TO YOU ; ) <p> There needs to be public pressure for this idea to become a reality . <p> People absolutely need to take back control in their own hands big banks have ruined us and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money flows . <p> Being involved in Diku-Dilenga , org ( an NGO offering microfinance in DRCongo ) , I thought that Matts wonderful proposition could leverage many microfinance organization methods : reward people giving you money ; lent only money people can reimburse in short terms ( 6 months ) ; target just sustainable entrepreneurs with loans ; go after each cent not reimburse . Then this bank will be able to reach the 99%+ of returned loans ! <p> One that offers simple banking solutions . Instead of offering many many different credit and deposit products , my dream bank offers three solutions , investing ( deposits ) , spending and borrowing accounts . And all these accounts are connected . <p> The primary banking channel would be the website , making then ATMs and over-the-counter services secondary channel . <p> Automattic is a risk-taking , profit-making venture with high growth . SafeBank would only be 1 of those 3 , so not a great fit for the venture capital model . ( Some forms of private equity might be interesting . ) <p> A fantastic article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would get cash out thoughwhose ATMs would you use ? Who would pay the interchange fees ( http : **34;29;TOOLONG ) ? Or better yet would it be a cashless bank and everything needing cash would be paid via NFC mobile payments ? <p> Great post ! Very insightful and you hit the subject right on the nail . There 's actually some banks in Denmark , at least , that have tried this aproach more-or-less . http : //www.basisbank.dk for instance . I remember I read about them as an innovator within the bank sector a couple of years ago . They are doing ok , but strugling with the trust issues of its customer base . Just like any company that deals with large transactions but which is only based online with no brick-and-mortar stores . <p> When you start to think about webbyfying a bank then think of all the sectors one could invigorate by restructuring the bussiness around a web startup bussiness model . Produce ( " you order , we deliver " ) , the car industry ( already happening with the Tesla and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontend companies which cater specific needs ) , publishing and media distribution ( amazon , iTunes , netflix ) , electricity ( buy you power local with niche offerings ) etc . <p> Its already happening and will continue to expand to other indutries . I think there 's a lot of benefits in the long run both business wise and for the consumers with this approach . My guess is that whoever commands how these old industries transition to this new model will command the 21. century just like Ford , Sulzberger , Rockefeller did a 100 years ago . <p> A bank that just holds money ? That there is the reason this will never work . <p> When I leave money in the bank they pay me interest . Why ? Well because inflation depreciates the value of my money while its lying in their account . So interest is the banks way of offsetting that cost . To make money to pay that interest they have to invest their depositors funds . Keep in mind that a good savings account will give you an interest rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in a way that gives that return plus the rate of inflation ( since the money they invest is worth more than the money they get back after their investment returns an income ) . <p> Now given that you started with the intention of setting up a bank that does n't  damage its customers interests , how can you justify a cost for leaving your money in an account there ? That 's not very sensible . <p> Most checking accounts holders earn pretty minimal interest ING Direct Electric Orange currently has %0.25 APY for accounts under $50,000 . ( I wonder what percent of their accounts are under 50k ? ) I think if your goal is protecting your capital against inflation you should probably allocate your money in bonds and money market accounts . The " working capital " in your checking should probably not be the bulk of your assets and move the needle much when earning 25-100 points . <p> So ? Checking accounts are not meant for holding funds for a long period of time . They 're for quick access to funds . Savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of interest as a result . <p> As you say the working capital in your checking account is not the bulk of your assets . So what are you proposing ? A bank that solely does checking accounts ? In that case by your own admission most of peoples funds would be in the " unsafe " banks . <p> Of course it depends on the rate of inflation , but in a solid economy that should not be too high . <p> You have a very interesting concept Matt we need more innovation in our financial markets . <p> I have experience in opening a new financial institution a few years ago I was the principal organizer of a new bank that my company opened . As I 'm sure you would guess , there is a staggering array of regulatory hoops to jump through in the approval process . <p> The 100% capital reserve concept is interesting , but would create challenges for the startup process . If you truly wanted to hew to this tenet throughout the life of the bank , you would be required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Year 3 of the life of the bank . Currently , federal regulations require new banks to maintain what they call a Tier I capital ratio equal to the expected asset size at Year 3 . This of course is well below 100% ( typically 5-10% ) , but still a challenge in fund-raising . <p> I know there is no shortage of " bastard banker " stories , but I can say that the vast majority of new bank founders do n't  go into business to take advantage of customers . Certainly it seems like the mega-banks are n't  in the customer service business , but you might check out any one of the 8,000 community banks that operate in the US today . Many of them are small business people too , and share your values in customer service . You can find one via the Independent Community Bankers of America web site at http : //www.icba.org <p> I do n't  know if 100% reserve would work , but you could make a very good story with 20-30% . Thanks for pointing out that there are lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds like they might offer a fantastic alternative today to the merge-banks . <p> I think iPhone app would be an overkill stick with developing websites that are adapted to iPhone browser . The only benefit of having an app is the marketing via app store , which does not seem to useful in this case . At the same time , there are multiples benefits of a website : -you can update it anytime you want ( I am sick of app approval process ) ; -it costs way less ; -its way more streamlined from a user standpoint . <p> Paul Graham wrote a good article outlining all this in more detail recently <p> Funny how nerds always feel they know better than everybody else , about everything , in industries they know nothing about , have no qualifications in or have any experience in on the business side . Yet when someone who does n't  have a CS degree writes some code or html , they complain about how much of an art computing is , how hard it is , and that it requires decades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fearless naivete , while 99% of the time wrong , and mixing of ideas from different industries is at the heart of many innovations we enjoy . <p> I spent more time writing down my thoughts here than I actually did thinking about them obviously anyone embarking on this endeavor would need to dig much deeper on every aspect , but I think its interesting that there 's obviously *some* market demand and people with experience in the industry ( and starting banks ) have dropped in on this comment thread . Thats what 's fun about brainstorms , anything is possible . = <p> Is selling the sort of data you 're talking about possible under banking privacy laws ? I thought the way that banks got around those restrictions was reporting everything to central ( bank-owned ) credit bureaus that , in turn , sold the data . <p> Setting that aside , it sounds like you think banks today take too much risk with our money . But then you 're passing up relatively safe sources of income ( let 's call those honest , old-fashioned loans ) and instead betting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your customers risk across a wide range of investments , you 're essentially making them bondholders in a single startup venture that 's betting on selling data about them to the highest bidder . <p> With that in mind , I do n't  think an **27;65;TOOLONG model is where I want to bet my own life savings . Do you think you can make 5%+ selling data about depositors today , to provide even a nominal , positive rate of interest for them ? If market interest rates go up to 5% , do you think you can make 10%+ selling data about customers ? <p> Let 's say you have a customer with $100,000 on file . Youd need a few thousand dollars in data revenue for that one customer to support paying them any interest at all . If inflation hits 5% again , or higher , how do you create enough revenue to keep their savings " safe " from inflation ? <p> You 're 100% right that we need new kinds of banks that are focused on depositors . But I do n't  think data-mining is the way to design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank could still lend some out , traditional bank stuff , though a much lower percentage of assets than most banks . The other ideas are just complementary ways a bank could make money in non-customer-hostile ways . <p> Where is the bank making its money ? I get your plan to take in depositors , but traditional banks make money on the spread between the interest given to its customers and the interest charged on loans ( amongst fees , and other stuff ) . <p> Where is the First National Bank of Ma.TT going to make its money ? Are you going to loan ? What kind of loans ? <p> As I said , the bank would make loans , and also explore opportunities with the vast amount of data it has not necessarily selling it to outsiders but using the insight into your life to recommend ways you could save money , Mint-style . <p> Wow , for just a toothbrushing thought this is really amazingly detailed and with a lot of great service and marketing details . <p> I was stunned , however , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would not like my bank to tinker with my transaction records ( just as little as I want Google to analyse and tinker with my personal communication ) . <p> Wouldnt that result in me giving money AND data to the bank in return for hm . A fast webinterface and a beautiful credit card ? This appears to be imbalanced . While most banks do n't  offer the latter , I hope they at least are not making additional money with my data . <p> ( Of course , the idea of doing the recommending yourself and making money by some sort of clickthrough to new services makes me feel more comfortable . But it still requires a considerable amount of trust in your privacy fineprint ) <p> I hope your bank has plenty of ATMs but no branches ; You can spend the money you save on branches to pay for my external ATM fees ( see http : //www.53.com ) . Also , skip expensive types of marketing and use that money to bribe other banks to cooperate in speeding up your transactions- they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions . Finally , you should have 24/7 telephone/chat support- splurge here for the best ; People are starving for good customer service ( see http : //www.zappos.com ) . <p> Matt : The essay is fantastic , as everybody before me praised already . One really basic concept threw in the middle of it bugs me though : " A big part of the website would be the blog , of course . " It seems that every website of every field could be adapted to a blog somehow ( even a bank ! ) . I thought it amazing , but I did n't  get there really . You meant with that phrase that your bank website would have sequential posts with pieces of information and a community commenting it or a bank blog would go further than that ? <p> I would love to think that this model would work . And maybe it would Its just that I 've worked in the financial sector long enough to have formed a very jaded view of what is possible under our current oligarchical banking system . My first ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too popular , SafeBank would be swallowed up by one of the decreasing number of banking behemoths . <p> On the other hand , given what youve already accomplished at such a tender age I 'm disinclined to declare that you could n't pull it off . <p> I too would be interested in helping to make this a reality if that option is ever available . My primary background is IT Security and Compliance . Currently for healthcare but I have done a bit of banking work in the past . <p> How do you deal with competitors that show up and run on the same platform and model you do ? This plan works great if you 're the only one , or one of very few doing it , but competition in your space could throw you heavily off of your game . <p> Hi Matt , I 'm a first time reader . I 've read a bunch of crazy comments from people here and on HackerNews . <p> I think your post is great . It is not the idea , or your brainstorming here that is awesome . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and said , let 's start again . What is the main goal , and how can I serve the needs . You were brave enough to question something that we take for granted . <p> Your ideas are just loud thinking of things that need to be solved . I cant see why anyone would read it as a business plan . <p> I will read this as , hey here is a guy that says that banks suck and he is thinking of what could be done . Any banks listening ? <p> I wrote in my notepad to reimagine the banking system from the clients perspective , and I hope I will write my take on this soon at aleveo.com <p> From what you describe of SafeBank , you should look into modern Islamic Banking as a model . <p> It is not about bonuses but about the profit making model . Conventional banking practices are concerned with " elimination of risk " where as Islamic banks " bear the risk " when involved in any transaction . That is the only way to make banks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a money-making blog to run . brush your teeth again to be sure . <p> Most excellent idea . I will head up the Safebank Mortgage department . We will only lend to people with 780 credit , 50% down payment and five years of income verification . And well do it at 3.25% And still make money <p> Thanks for the inspiration . Harvard Business Review ran an article last year profiling industries that only make a killing when the customer is having it stuck to them . Biggies were cell phone companies ( think overage fees ) , video rentals ( think late fees ) , airlines ( same seat cost more as flights fill ) and banks ( think fees , fees , fees ) . I loved banking at WaMu because they seemed less predatory than any other bank I had experienced .. right up until they went out of business . Thanks again ! <p> Where do I sign ? I 'm ready . A couple of years ago I accidentally transposed a number in my check book ( wrote 2 instead of a 5 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the result . ( amounts for illustration only ) Balance $100 Check #1 $105 car payment Check #2 $5 Blockbuster Debit $15 Gas Debit $5 lunch Debit $3 Morning Coffee <p> This resulted in a $150s in overdraft fees . While I can actually understand why I would have received one overdraft fee . I think receiving 5 $30 OD fee is stupid considering 4 of the transactions didn ; t even ad up to $30 . <p> So Matt sign me up . Ill be the first in line for a customer application . <p> It would be the last thing I 'd do with my money = I 've seen pretty similar business plans and we decided to help one of them happen . It just did n't  work . the customer segment willing to buy in was one that just couldnt let the bank survive , despite of a professional banking team and a very , very good IT . <p> You 're dreaming the way adolescents do when letting their imagination fly with Superman = <p> But its refreshing and very nice to see such naivity exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big religious divisions in the world and their issues , stereotypes and traditions around lending money think Christians , Jews , Muslims and that 's just the well known ones <p> Always near the bottom line is the issue of trust and design . It is obvious that Banks are all about trust . All banks in try for prime locations and building with completely over-the-top architectural styles often routed in some mythical past . They cry out for the public to trust them and if not trust , to be just overwhelmed by the gravitas and unquestionable authority of the great financial institutions that they would like to be seen as . <p> They often seem completely enmeshed in the world of secret societies and shady morality and legality ( lately we see that they actually are ) . <p> Like insurance schemes , if you pare back to the basic functions , they are all trading on peoples fear of being robbed and of just not having enough ( health/food/stuff ) . <p> While it is naive to think that we can do away with banks and/or money overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the workable systems and ethos from recently emerged new media like transparency , crowd sourced building/debugging , micro-publishing , near zero cost replication and distributed , fault tolerant processing . <p> Whos to say that we could not set up a system of micro-trading that did without centralised , top heavy hierarchies . Instead it might rely on self policing and regulation . <p> In Africa people have set up micro credit transfer systems based just on ad-hoc mobile phone owner network that enables people to send credit , that can be turned into real currency , simply . <p> Maybe the emerging nations are teaching us a thing or two about our technology and about our greed once again ! <p> Matt , I think someone has a similar idea . Or , at least , according to their advertising , they seem to think in a similar way to what you 've described in the way of service , though , perhaps not the " membership " model . Its Ally Bank at , er , allybank.com <p> Incidentally , if anyone has checked them out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know more about it ! <p> The marketing &amp; technology aspects of this idea are great ; too bad you do n't  have time to help more banks adopt them . <p> Unfortunately , as mentioned in other comments , the economics of this banking model do n't  add up . It is possible , that by adopting strict loan underwriting standards and offering low/no interest accounts , you might make this an attractive option to college students and young adults with few assetsnot much profit there though . <p> The course I took last semester ( http : **32;94;TOOLONG ) covered the various factors which incentivize banks to undertake risky lending practices . These are very complex problems ; dealing with regulatory , competitive and economic forecasting issues . There are no easy answers . <p> Interesting post . I was thinking about this same concept today . What about also giving the money made on loans back to the depositors of the bank . So a user can sign up , deposit x amount of money and choose to get returns from a loan portfolio that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits , the profits from loans goes straight back to the depositors . Of course , they may not make money , but they also can get a decent return if the loans the bank makes perform well . Can this work or I 'm I being a idiot ? Thoughts ? <p> those of you working on the iphone app , I 'm tired of putting money in separate envelops under the mattress . How about portfolio-style earmarked savings , where each deposit is diverted into multiple folders per user-defined percentages ; savings for dog emergencies , savings for triathlon supplies , etc. , all within one account . And the ability to drag and drop funds from one folder to the next . Easily keep track of multiple lines of project-specific savings . The total money in the account matches the total money displayed in the app , but the graphical representation of how that money is divided up and sorted and earmarked makes all the difference in the world . <p> Great Idea I-m in and will handle the german PR &amp; marketing based on succes of course = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ads you-ll show in their banking statements I think it-s one of the most obvious things any bank could do , but of course they never come up with ideas like that by themselves I ha the idea of a " best price " reverse calculator , where you type in what you pay , eg. for your phone , insurance , electricity , and the site would suggest , where you can pay less . That thing in your bankingstatement would be just so much more convenient go , please ! <p> As an ex-banker and now financial start up , and loyal WP blogger , this is an inspriatonal post for me . <p> I am gong to do some math on the concept of extra capital . As someone earlier suggested this reduces relative profits to other banks , but there are other aspects here like no branches or trad marketing that compensate . <p> I just tweeted about this ! I HATE my bank . I was there 20 years . Finally moved . To USAA which alot of people have been talking about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . You have seen them actually doing a bit of advertising about their " safeness " in this downturn and are picking up gobs of customers ! <p> If you take all the money and put it in a vault , the rate it earns the bank is 0% , and it costs you tens of dollars in admin , because you have an infrastructure to run . <p> You want 6-figure salary earners , who will deposit 6 or 7-figure amounts , but youre not going to offer them any return on that . <p> You restrict accounts to the FDIC limit a scheme you will have to pay to take part in , incidentally but then fail to make use of its safeguard . Put everything *over* the FDIC limit in a vault , and offer no return on that excess , while risking the first $125k on low-risk investments . <p> Your alternative method of obtaining a return is the traditional mortgage route , which I 'm guessing you 'll baulk at because of the sub-prime mess , but can earn you money . However , then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial lender . <p> I do n't  see how you get out of the current mess except by having been lower risk , or less naughty . And there are already many banks and credit unions who take that line . You just do n't  know about them because they are beneath your radar . <p> To finish , you have also aggregated everyone into the same use case . Grandma wants her pension payouts , her savings for the kids and safety safety safety . She does n't  care about your iPhone app ; she wants a building to go to , with a nice person to talk to . Mr Fresh Startup , however , wants to bank his $2m trust fund , get a credit card that he can impress the ladies with and borrow $40m from you for his startup . He does want the iPhone app , but he wants to get a real rate of return on that trust fund , and to borrow at a reasonable rate . You run significant risk of being master of none here , because the thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what you do n't  want to do . <p> Sorry Matt . I 'm a dreamer too . I suggest you find a nice credit union with an iPhone app . <p> Matt , most of the people they just want an extra top up on their interest rate or have a face to face relationship . You should not mess investment banking with retail banking . The second is the old boring stuff that Safebank will do . Having funds over 2-3x the Fed reserve does not mean the bank is a lot more safer , it makes liquidity management easier . A safer bank would be the one that does not need to go to other banks to ask for money ( it relies on depositors ) . Any retail bank that did not get excitated by the WallStreet CDOs and subprime would have not experience any problems . You idea of replicating Mint is the same I heard in 2001 , the main problem is do you want your bank to monitor your expenses , what happens when the credit card is from another bank you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a premium to people that share this info Alex <p> @Alex it is essential that Matt mess investment banking with retail banking because that is precisely what the large banks have done . I aagree with someone that there are some conservative smaller below the radar banks " who have not , but darned few . <p> Think derivatives and off balance sheet financing and investments that places banks squarely in the investment banking space . <p> There remain 3/4 of a quadrillion dollars outstanding in derivatives , and the associated liabilities form a large part of the concern over too large to fail that perpetuates bad banks . <p> A new bank that scorns the investment banking approach , maintains a defined level of risk , and offers a value proposition along the lines mentioned by Matt has merit and could charge for that offer . <p> The challenge would be in offerring suitable interest rates on deposits . SafeBank could experimnet with achieving those returns using P2P Lenders as a low cost origination channel , offerring decent rates at reasonable risk levels . <p> I loved reading your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simpleness you strive to achieve is excellent . <p> It would be a hard switch though for me , from USAA . I love USAA . We use them for our banking as well as insurance needs . The customer service is wonderful and the refunded ATM fees is definitely a bonus . <p> What I like most about your idea is the attention to the web , and how you would like to incorporate something like MINT in to the site . I think that would give you a REALLY long leg up on the competition . <p> Scratch the FDIC , they 're pretty much bankrupt anyways . Its also a way to socialize losses . Every bank pays in but the poorly managed ones get the money , so there is a transfer of liability . <p> This type system punishes the banks that have good management and follow sounds practices forcing them to absorb the losses of their competitors . Also creates moral hazard when gov. socializes business losses . Hmmmm all this sounds like it has happened before = <p> Put your reserves in gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant devalue hard assets through inflation . <p> I 'd sign up to a bank like SafeBank in a heartbeat , ive lost count of the amount of times various banks have let me down or annoyed me to the point where i decided to close my account and go elsewhere with my business ( only to be annoyed again at a later stage ) . <p> To be honest , I like your ambition , but I think its all a bit , well , naive . There is a lot more behind the scenes that actually do need the " top shelf " bankers with the knowledge and intuition of the market to actually earn more money with money so that loans / mortgages and all the other things people are holding onto for dear life are readily available . However , a more cautious bank would n't go a miss . <p> Matt , found your site a little while ago , interesting stuff . I am not in the Web 2.0 scene much so did n't  even know you were the guy behind WordPress . Must be getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing for years now . I hate banks ! As a entrepreneur and small business person they just suck . <p> There 's an old saying , " Banks are not in the business of taking risk . " I would add , " unless its with your money . " <p> I have strong opinions against the Fed system and fiat money . Might not change that , but I have decided I will do a bank someday . I loved the micro lenders and you can find out what happened to them , I am not sure if Prosper ever came back online when the SEC or whoever went after them . <p> I would start up a bank or a lending company in a heartbeat and I got the drive to make it work too . Ive been researching it now for almost two years . Regulations stink ! <p> Everyone is talking about why something can not be done , what happened to entrepreneurship ? I hear people mentioning regulations , compliance , other barriers to entry . So what ! <p> We only do things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it that much more enjoyable in my opinion . <p> Did someone mentioned USAA ? I bank with them , only for military or dependents , but a pretty good bank . They do n't  fee you to death and are very helpful . I can scan my checks anywhere I have Internet . <p> I agree with Bruce , we need less regulation not more , but the minute something bad happens you got the certain groups who scream for more government oversight . The regulators really helped this last decade , eh ? <p> I have suspected that small business and microfinance areas are underserved , and low risk . Some combination of Kiva with Zopa in a form that has the transparency to allow depositors choose the loans seems very interesting . <p> Matt , I desperately tried to start a bank to finance entrepreneurs last year in Arizona with a dozen friends . My vision was n't that far from yours ( go figure ) and it would have been great to have you on the web site : - ) The OCC would n't give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona ; they wanted us to buy a bad bank instead/ We refused and blew over a million dollars in investment . But I would still like to do it . <p> 1 ) Matt , I 'm with you . Yours is better than a great idea : it is a great way to execute an old idea . <p> 2 ) When you 'll execute your idea , you 'll realize that zero risk is short term treasury bonds . This fact will allow you to pay some interests and still be profitable . Money in a safe can be wiped out in a few years of 14% Inflation . Some economist do forecast two digits inflation due to huge liquidity pumped lately into the economy . <p> 3 ) Why not ask us the money for such venture ? Why not a " Google Style " community fund raising ? You can raise the risk capital from us and keep risk free Bank deposits . Ill be happy to send you two checks : first one for shares of the start up , second one for my first deposit = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long timemortgages , equity loans , car loans , investments , etc. etc. etc. , and find banks right up there with insurance companies and credit card companies . I even get the once over when I do business at a different branch of my own bank . Recently , I was in Ireland and had trouble with all of my credit and debit cards . I went to a Bank of Ireland branch and a young man took the time to try my credit card in in the ATM and when it did n't  work took it to his teller window , asked for identification and handed me five hundred pounds , no fuss/no muss . If I tried that at a bank in the states they would have had me tailed my the dept of homeland security . Our banking system makes it too hard ! I 'm with you . <p> In fact , they 're a really neat trickery , invented to keep overhead ( base salaries ) as low as possible and extra costs and incentives backed by turnover : we give you $1 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1 ( we keep the $9 , pay you the other one and made $8 ) . <p> Thing is , you 're facing a perverted industry , with people motivated by their extra $1s . Its a matter of character when you can reel in the very best of blokes without giving in to perverted bonus-demands ( stocks , options , backoff-fees ) . And you do need boring dudes in a bank ; really . <p> Genius . When all this craziness started at the end of 2007 and early 2008 , I worked on database and website development for a client who had the same vision . Eventually the project couldnt get funded because he could n't get traditional investors behind the idea . I figured it must have just been a crazy idea . But reading this makes me realize he was just asking the wrong kinds of people . <p> I would like to start a worldwide credit union that also has a lower-fee ( for both merchants and customers ) brand credit card and does local stuff like microloans in various communities . Large depositors know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who receive microloans are then customers with increasing equity in a community-oriented financial institution . Both win . <p> There are many local banks that can be had for a comparative song right now . Why not buy an undervalued one out and alter it to fit your goals ? Berkshire Hathaway used to make shirts <p> You say if Goldam Sachs never paid out any bonuses , they would never need government intervention . That 's such a ridiculous statement . If Goldman Sachs never paid a bonus , they would n't have ANY of the employees they have today . Goldman also did not need a bailout . The treasury department forced them to take the money . They were also one of the firsts if not first to pay it back in full . They are also more profitable today than ever ! <p> I 'm just a bit tired of all the Goldman bashing . Someone needs to defend them on the interwebz . <p> Great idea Matt ! I think itd get a lot of people very fast . You should see the revolution going on down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M-PESA mobile money service about 2 years ago and now they have about 12 MILLION subscribers most of them UNBANKABLE by snobby banks . I can go to thousands of M-PESA agents throughout Kenya and upload money via my mobile phone . I can send money to peeps , pay bills , and buy credit of course . Boy , the banks are PISSED off . But Equity Bank ( an award winning bank serving low income markets ) added an M-PESA button to its 400 ATMs so now lots of peeps can WITHDRAW cash WITHOUT a bank ATM card . They just have to press the button , enter the transaction I 'd from the M-PESA system , and choose how much of their balance they want to withdraw . Then you get an sms telling u that your balance is now reduced . All that for a few shillingswaaaaay cheaper than postal wire transfer or Western Union . Now they 're taking it to other parts of East Africa and The West . Kenya is now #1 in the world for mobile money thanks to Safaricoms innovative idea . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big brothers . Regulation is extensive . Jumping borders you run into currency and capital controls . My partner and I are thinking of applying for a license so we will see which of your ideas will work . <p> Simple , useful and very realistic . The world needs more start up entrepreneurs like you . The world needs more minds like you . Sometimes we get so caught up fantasizing about such a huge success only to be carried by these dreams and accomplish unfinished projects whereas you were not afraid to think small , act big . <p> And here would LONG ... apply as well ( you linked to it ) . <p> Here in South Africa we now bank with http : //www.capitec.co.za mostly relying on technology , low key branches ( ATM indoors ) and a web interface that got me wondering where the buttons went as they only use links sometimes only 2 or 3 on a page . No massive sponsoring ( like the 4 other abysmal dinosaurs that monopolise the country . They are actually so David , that the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get away with it ! ) But yes , often dreamt about the same : how to run my own honest bank but that might be a contradictio in terminis <p> Negative balances could almost disappear overnight if banks would find a way to send the current balance to not only ATM withdrawals , but everytime someone uses their Debit card for a purchase . <p> Banks do n't  want to do this for two reasons ( and besides these two reasons they say it is technically not feasible mostly because they do n't  WANT to ) : <p> ( 1 ) They claim people will take the balance literally and not realize that checks or VISA/MC charges may still be pending . This of course is just dumb . Not only do their own user agreements defend against such witless thinking by some dumb user , but they could also ( shocking ! ) print a disclaimer below every balance that says just that : " Balance does not reflect pending checks and Visa/MC charges yet to have cleared " , or better , " Balance may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And of course , this is really reason #1 , the banks do n't  want to give any kind of warning to users that they may be perilously close to overdrawing their account . <p> I , like most people , am responsible and check , but we all have that one moment in our year where all heckaroo breaks loose ( death in the family , etc ) and we do n't  really check because we think we know . But we do n't  know that our wife took something out . Or we guess wrong . Or , well , life ! Life is for living not checking balances ( iPhones or otherwise ) . <p> First bank that does this across all vendors and ATMs wins by loyalty and future business . Hint : It ai n't  much in $$ , but I 'll throw in as much free P.R . to my friends and family as I can . At the least , it shows they care about making OUR lives easier not theirs . <p> Found this post when doing some research on disruption in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of BankSimple ( http : //banksimple.net ) , a startup bank that 's been getting some press as of late . <p> Sounds like they 're taking a different approach though , and avoiding starting a bank entirely , just partnering with several existing banks for a variety of services and hiding the messy details behind one slick web UI . Interesting idea , though I do n't  have the expertise to know whether its really feasible or not Seems to me that the partner banks would want to maintain their current profit margins and then were back to square one . <p> I really enjoyed reading this whole comments list . UNFORTUNATELY as a retired " good servant " of the Owners Of The World , all of the lovely ideas presented lack one thing : Money chases money . EVERY time . The only hope of altering matters is by making the theft of money/lives INDIVIDUALLY too expensive to risk . Minimum 50 years hard labour , no parole and seizure of all assets all assets including family . OR a simple alternative , do not let Banks risk funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow a Bank to invest in markets of any kind directly . Easy ? No more recessions/depressions Except THAT is where the the big killings are made ! THAT is what they are for , culling the flock <p> Forget the money , Matt , the big future is in Bitcoins ! , , See , you could convert all your assets to Bitcoins and start a Bitcoin exchange ! Seriously , though , if you did start a banking enterprise of some sort , I 'd feel safe starting an account with you ! I think you have enough " business savy " to pull it off ! You know , at the current rate it takes about 300 USD to buy 25 Bitcoins ! And absolutely NO backing ! <p> Glad you put that last sentence in , I was thinking why on earth would you want to be a banker ? . Shows that really you were just enjoying the marketing exercise , and it is one I have envisioned ( fairly similarly ) in the past too . <p> One point tho banks make money by lending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone wont want their money back at once . If you werent money lending ( and earning x% interest ) , you would n't have anything to pay your depositors any interest with ( at x-2% etc ) . If you paid interest out of new deposits , that would be a ponzi/pyramid scheme . Just taking peoples money would n't actually earn you anything unfortunately .

@@98355992 @2555992/ <h> Category Archives : WordPress <p> Today is 14 years from the very first release of WordPress . The interface I 'm using to write- this ( Calypso ) is completely unrecognizable- from what WordPress looked and worked like even a few years ago . Fourteen years in , I 'm waking up every day excited about what 's coming next for us . The progress of the editor and CLI so far this year is awesome , and I 'm looking forward to that flowing into improvements for customization and the REST API . Thanks as always to Mike for kicking off this crazy journey , all the people chipping in to make WordPress better , and Konstantin and Erick for surprising me with the cool cake above . <p> In the WordPress world , when we look back an 2016 I think well remember it as the year that we awoke to the importance of marketing . WordPress has always grown organically through word of mouth and its passionate community , but the hundreds of millions being spent advertising against WP has started to have an impact , especially for folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear about a number of folks across many WordPress companies and industries working on this from different angles , some approaching it from an enterprise point of view and some from a consumer point of view. - Theres an opportunity for learning from each other , almost like a mastermind group . As the survey says : <p> Never have there been more threats to the open web and WordPress . Over three hundred million dollars has been spent in 2016 advertising proprietary systems , and even more is happening in investment . No one company in the WP world is large enough to fight this , nor should anyone need to do it on their own . We 'd like to bring together organizations that would like to contribute to growing WordPress . It will be a small group , and if you or your organization are interested in being a part please fill out the survey below . <p> By working together we can amplify our efforts to bring open source to a wider audience , and fulfill WordPress mission to truly democratize publishing . <p> But were trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . When I took on the responsibility of CEO of Automattic January of last year , we faced two huge problems : our growth was constrained by lack of capital , and the technological foundations of the past decade were n't strong enough for the demands of next one . <p> The first has a relatively straightforward answer . We found some fantastic partners , agreed on a fair price , issued new equity in the company to raise $160M , and started investing in areas we felt were high potential , like this year 's WooCommerce acquisition . This " war chest " gives us a huge array of options , especially given our fairly flat burn rate we do n't  need to raise money again to keep the company going , and any capital we raise in the future will be purely discretionary . ( Since last May when the round happened we 've only spent $3M of the investment on opex . ) <p> The second is much harder to address . The WordPress codebase is actually incredible in many ways the result of many thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest strengths were also holding it back . <p> The WordPress codebase contains a sea of institutional knowledge and countless bug fixes . It handles hundreds of edge cases . Integrates constant security improvements . Is coded to scale . Development moves at a fast clip , with six major releases over the past two years and more around the corner . Its power and flexibility is undeniable : WordPress just passed a huge milestone , and now powers 25% of the web . You can run it on a $5-a-month web host , or scale it up to serve billions of pageviews on one of the largest sites on the web , WordPress.com . <p> The interface , however , has been a struggle . Many of us attempted to give it a reboot with the MP6 project and the version 3.8 release , but what that release made clear to me is that an incremental approach would n't give us the improvements we needed , and that two of the things that helped make WordPress the strong , stable , powerful tool it is backward compatibility and working without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradigms of wp-admin are largely the same as they were five years ago . Working within them had become limiting . The time seemed ripe for something new , something big but if you 're going to break back compat , it needs to be for a really good reason . A 20x improvement , not a 2x . Most open source projects fade away rather than make evolutionary jumps . <p> So we asked ourselves a big question . What would we build if we were starting from scratch today , knowing all we 've learned over the past 13 years of building WordPress ? At the beginning of last year , we decided to start experimenting and see . <p> Today were announcing something brand new , a new approach to WordPress , and open sourcing the code behind it . The project , codenamed Calypso , is the culmination of more than 20 months of work by dozens of the most talented engineers and designers I 've had the pleasure of working with ( 127 contributors with over 26,000 commits ! ) . <p> Calypso is <p> Incredibly fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leveraging libraries like Node and React . <p> 100% API-powered . Those APIs are open , and now available to every developer in the world . <p> A great place to read , allowing you to follow sites across the web ( even if they 're not using WordPress ) . <p> Social , with stats , likes , and notifications baked in . <p> Fully responsive . Make it small and put it in your sidebar , or go full-screen . <p> Really fun to write in , especially the drag-and-drop image uploads . <p> Fully multi-site for advanced users , so you can manage hundreds of WordPresses from one place . <p> Able to manage plugins and themes on Jetpack sites , including auto-upgrading them ! <p> 100% open source , with all future development happening in the open . <p> Available for anyone to adapt to make their own , including building custom interfaces , distributions , or working with web services besides WordPress.com . <p> A lot of people thought we should keep this proprietary , but throughout my life I 've learned that the more you give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a ton to figure out around plugins , extensibility , contributions , Windows and Linux releases , API speed , localization , and harmonizing the WordPress.com API and WP-API so it can work with core WordPress . Thousands more PHP developers will need to become fluent with JavaScript to recreate their admin interfaces in this fashion . I 'm also really excited to revisit and redesign many more screens now that we have this first version out the door . <p> This is a beginning , not an ending . ( 1.0 is the loneliest . ) Better things are yet to come , as all of you dig in . Check out these links to read- more about Calypso from different perpsectives : <p> This was a huge bet , incredibly risky , and difficult to execute , but it paid off . Like any disruption it is uncomfortable , and I 'm sure will be controversial in some circles . What the team has accomplished in such a short time is amazing , and I 'm incredibly proud of everyone who has contributed and will contribute in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with in my career . <p> With core WordPress on the server and Calypso as a client I think we have a good chance to bring another 25% of the web onto open source , making the web a more open place , and peoples lives more free . <p> If you 're curious more about the before and after , what 's changed , here 's a chart : <p> There 's a thread on Quora asking " I am powering a banks website using WordPress . What security measures should I take ? " The answers have mostly been ignorant junk along the lines of " Oh NOES WP is INSECURE ! let me take my money out of that bank " , so I wrote one myself , which Ive copied below . <p> I agree there 's probably not a ton of benefit to having the online banking / billpay / etc portion of a banks website on WordPress , however there is no reason you could n't run the front-end and marketing side of the site on WordPress , and in fact you 'd be leveraging WordPress strength as a content management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update and maintain . <p> In terms of security , there are a two simple points : <p> Make sure you 're on the latest version of core and all the plugins you run , and update as soon as new version become available . <p> Use strong passwords for all user accounts . For extra credit you could enable a 2-factor plugin , use Jetpacks WordPress.com- login system , or restrict logged-in users to a certain IP range ( like behind a VPN ) . <p> If your host does n't  handle it , make sure you stay up-to-date for everything in your stack as well from the OS on up . Most modern WP hosts handle this ( and updates ) for you , and of course you could always run your site on WordPress.com VIP- alongside some of the top sites in the world . If you use any non-core third party code , no harm in having a security firm audit the source as well ( an advantage of using open source ) . <p> For an example of a beautiful , responsive banking website built on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WordPress is also trusted to run sites for some of the largest and most security-conscious organizations in the world , including Facebook , SAP , Glenn Greenwalds The Intercept , eBay , McAfee , Sophos , GNOME , Mozilla , MIT , Reuters , CNN , Google Ventures , NASA , and literally hundreds more . <p> As the most widely used CMS in the world , many people use and deploy the open source version of WordPress in a sub-optimal and insecure way , but the same could be said of Linux , Apache , MySQL , Node , Rails , Java , or any widely-used software . It is possible and actually not that hard to run WordPress in a way that is secure enough for a bank , government site , media site , or anything . <p> If you wanted any help on this feel free to reach out to Automattic as well , we have a decade of experience now dealing with high-risk , high-scale deployments , and also addressing the sort of uninformed FUD you see in this thread . <p> If you 've developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comments . <p> Internationalization will be a big focus of the coming year , including fully-localized plugin and theme directories on language sites and embedded on dashboard in version 4.1 , which is coming out December 10th . <p> Better stats coming for plugin and theme authors . <p> Version fragmentation is a big challenge for WordPress , only a quarter of users are currently on the latest release . <p> - This is also a problem for PHP well be working with hosts to help with- version fragmentation , as well as to- get as many WordPress sites as possible running PHP 5.5 or better . <p> For the first time in 11 years were switching away from IRC as our primary communication method .

To do that we need our community to be inclusive and welcoming. - There is a sublime beauty in our differences , and they 're as important as the principles that bring us together , like the GPL . <p> On Sunday at WordCamp Europe I got a question about how companies contribute back to WordPress , how they 're doing , and what companies should do more of . <p> First on the state of things : there are more companies genuinely and altruistically contributing to growing WordPress than ever before . In our ecosystem web hosts definitely make the most revenue and profits , and its been great to see them stepping up their game , but also the consultancies and agencies around WordPress have been pretty amazing about their people contributions , as demonstrated most recently by the fact the 4.0 and 4.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Code for the People , respectively ) . <p> I think a good rule of thumb that will scale with the community as it continues to grow is that organizations that want to grow the WordPress pie ( and not just their piece of it ) should dedicate 5% of their people to working on something to do with core be it development , documentation , security , support forums , theme reviews , training , testing , translation or whatever it might be that helps move WordPress mission forward . <p> Five percent does n't  sound like much , but it adds up quickly . As of today Automattic is 277 people , which means we should have about 14 people contributing full-time . That 's a lot of people to not have on things that are more direct or obvious drivers of the business , and were not quite there today , but I 'm working on it and hope Automattic can set a good example for this in the community . I think its just as hard for a 20-person organization to peel 1 person off . <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better long-term investment in the health of WordPress overall . I think it will look incredibly modest in hindsight . This ratio is probably the bare minimum for a sustainable ecosystem , avoiding the tragedy of the commons . I think the 5% rule is one that all open source projects and companies should follow , at least if they want to be vibrant a decade from now . <p> Whenever I visit a site I can usually tell whether its WordPress or not within an instant there 's just something about a WordPress site that is distinctive . Super-clean permalinks are usually a dead giveaway . One thing Ive been noticing a lot lately is on my guilty pleasure for- tech news , Techmeme , it seems like almost every link I click is to a WordPress-powered site . Fortunately Techmeme provides a leaderboard showing both rank and % of space a- site has taken up in headlines in the past thirty days . <p> The list changes almost every day but went ahead and took a snapshot of the top 100 as of January 16th and ran down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> WordPress comes in at 43% , custom or bespoke systems at 42% , and then the others . When you take into effect Techmemes " presence " factor WP jumps to 48.8% of presence in the top 100 and all Blogsmith , Drupal , Blogspot , Tumblr , and Typepad combined are 8.4% . If you curious of the raw data , here 's the spreadsheet with the platforms . <p> This is just a snapshot , itd be interesting to see how this evolves over time . Its a small slice of the world of websites , but a very influential one . I 've actually reached out to Gabe Rivera a few times to sponsor the leaderboard page , putting a W logo next to the ones that run WordPress in the table , but nothing has come of it yet .

@@98355997 @2555997/ <p> Would it be good to add one more ? One hobby that you love doing but also helps others ? I thought about this book called Drive that I 've been meaning to read because of the little blurb it has on Amazon ( " the secret to high performance and satisfaction in todays world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives , to learn and create new things , and to do better by ourselves and our world " ) , which I think is a great addition to anyones guiding principle . <p> I 'm struggling for number 1 . For me , when a hobby become something that make money , then it stops being fun . The reason is , when people pay you to deliver something , then it is usually come with deadline . <p> Sunsetmood have you heard of Cognitive dissonance ? What it means , in essence is that when something happens to us or we put a lot of effort into something , our brain tells us that the reason we are doing this is because we enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us/finding a higher purpose etc if something bad/good happened to you . But what also happens when we start making money of our hobby , is that your brain starts telling us that the reason we do this is not because we enjoy it , its because it makes us money . So our level of enjoyment dissipates . You also see this when you start rewarding someone for a behavior that they did without reward earlier . So the issue is probably not the deadline , but the money . What might help is doing some work for free , not a lot , maybe a couple of hours a week if that is possible . That way you are not doing it just for the money/reward . You should read Stumbling on happiness ( i think ) by Daniel Gilbert . <p> And this is great quote .

@@98356002 @2556002/ <p> The first sentence from the preface of the book : " EVERY MOMENT IN BUSINESS happens only once . " reminded me of that saying about the river , which I thought is a buddhistic piece of wisdom , but just found out its from the greek philosopher Heraclitus : <p> " No man ever steps in the same river twice . " or " You can not step into the same river twice . " <p> The fragment " It is not possible to step twice into the same river " is often taken to be a statement of the first principle of Heraclitus physical theory of the universe . He disagreed with the Melisians and held that an answer to the question of a first principle was impossible as long as the one is taken to be a material thing . He has been represented as building his philosophy around the notion of change , but the extant fragments do not support this . <p> He sought to find the one behind the many and so to explain the multiplicity of the world . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you deny change . " Is this logically possible ? Heraclitus sought to unit these two by answering the question of " what is change ? " His theory at first seems contradictory . <p> 1 . There is a first principle of all things . This is unity . <p> 2 . The senses tell us that everything is in constant flux or change . This is variety . <p> 3 . This problem is solved by understanding the unity of opposites , the interdependence of contraries , the harmony of strife . <p> For Heraclitus the answer was Eternal Fire . This is the synthesis that solves the whole problem . The many are the One . The One is the many . There is no dividing point . 
@@98356005 @2556005/ <h> Getting a Job After Coding Bootcamp <p> The past 6-8- months I 've been seeing a new type of person applying for Automattics engineering positions that I had n't  seen before , and I think its very interesting and promising but missing one key component . <p> These applications usually have great cover letters and well-put-together resumes , which is a good sign that people put some thought into it and had someone spot-check it before sending it in . But where most people list prior jobs , these applications ( and LinkedIn profiles ) list projects . When you dig into prior jobs listed , if there are any , they 're typically in a completely unrelated field like medicine or finance , and under education they list one of these new bootcamps , like Hack Reactor or App Acedemy . <p> Here I 'm going to offer a key = " piece of advice to these folks to help their applications stand out , and can 100% compensate for their lack of professional experience : contribute to open source . " Projects " done in a coding bootcamp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't  really tell me anything about your engineering ability . Open source contributions show me a passion for a given area , ability to work with others to- have a contribution reviewed and accepted , and most importantly show actual code . Even better than one-off contributions , if you can grow into a recognized position in an open source project , that puts you ten steps ahead of applications even from folks with 20 years experience in the field , at least to an Open Source-biased company like Automattic . <p> Though I do n't  know any of these boot camps well enough to suggest them , I love the idea in general . Even before the more formal bootcamps Ive seen hundreds of examples of people who used free information and technology to rise to a very high level of technical contribution . In fact that 's very much my own story from the early days of WordPress . So in summary : its okay to learn to code through class projects , but show your value by getting involved in something bigger . <p> Matt this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those applicants = I think you are 100% correct when it comes to showing off your real-world experience instead of education or knowledge , especially anything that is open source . I hope you find the right people for the company and I also hope I can be one of them = <p> This is great advice . We had an intern in the office recently who was going to school to become a developer and I recommended to her http : **33;128;TOOLONG It matches up developers with non profits that need a bit of code help . Might not be OSS , but any experience can help grow you as a person and help you land a job . <p> ( This is highly generalized but ) From what Ive seen , attendees of bootcamps leave with two things : intense passion to go out and build things using their newfound skills ( awesome ! ) but also an overestimation of what their current skills are actually capable of ( not-so-awesome ! ) . <p> Working on open source projects gives you a good reality check but also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ( and hope ! ) that article and the data it cites is very out of date and behind the current state . You would hope since most open source is done exclusively through online identities ( which can be whatever you like ) that it would have evolved to be more welcoming . In WP its something we think about and work on a lot , and of course in the context of Automattic experience with WP be it a plugin , theme , core , accessibility , support , or any side of the project is a bonus . <p> I do agree with you on this Matt , but as someone who wants to get into Open Source projects , its darn hard to do so . Especially if you 've not done it before . I can build great websites ( I think ) but have little knowledge of Git or Mercurial to be able to get started on contributing , then I think its also difficult to build a name for yourself in an Open Source Project to be able to have submitted code used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do agree with you but I just would n't be surprised at the lack of contributors applying as this may ( or very well may not ) be the case in this scenario . If you want to see someone in action contribute , the " good to start off with bugs " in the WordPress Trac system might be a good test to put the budding Engineers through . <p> Expertise in version control systems like Git are absolutely crucial as soon as you 're working on something with more than one developer . ( And many would argue before then . : ) ) So I 'd strongly encourage you to dig in there . Its also something these boot camps already teach I do n't  see a huge skills gap in these applicants , just they could stand out more with participation . <p> I applied for a job at Automattic a few months ago . The experience was good ( it was for a Happiness Engineer role , Jeremy interviewed me ) , however the feedback afterwards was a little short . I think there 's definitely points on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot but I would n't want to apply again and not improve on the things I needed to , which I 'm not sure of . <p> As for the Git thing ; I 've not done a bootcamp , I 'm not lucky enough to have one close by so I 'm having to struggle through trial and error on GitHub . It seems to be one of those things you know very well , or do n't  know at all . <p> Unfortunately its difficult to be very specific in feedback when we do n't  move forward with someone . Also sometimes people come back with very pointed or detailed questions that would honestly take a very long time to answer . The best I can say is that we publish a lot about what we look for in the positive sense , including the Creed , so the more you can embody that the better . <p> Great post Matt . You touched on this briefly , but I think beyond being able to see actual code contribution , viewing peoples open source contributions provides insight ( but not complete ) into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical chops , but be a poor fit for a company because their communication and/or personality sucks . <p> Its a lovely idea , but given that the reason you 're receiving the CVs is that these candidates are looking for work , the suggestion that they contribute at a professional level to a substantial extent is tantamount to asking them to work ( not for you , but it is still valuable -work- ) for free for six months . You can see why they would not pursue that line of thought . <p> Contributing to open source is n't required , but its definitely a way for candidates without as much relevant industry experience to stand out from other applications . Everyone can spend their time however they choose . Folks going through coding bootcamps have already made a very significant time commitment , this is just a slight tweak to how that time is spent that will assist them specifically with Automattic . ( Other companies may not care . ) <p> I have a question as someone who just finished one of these bootcamps . <p> Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicants have projects and githubs in their applications or resumes . If you want to look at their code , its right there . Assuming the projects are deployed you can also look at what the final product looks like . <p> Our teachers at the bootcamp I just finished with definitely pushed us to go out and find open source projects to contribute to , so I 'm not dismissing that advice . I just feel like there is code available for you , as a prospective employer , to look at it . <p> Contributing to open source is very hard especially in a well established projects . For example WordPress for Android has over 150 MBs of code . There 's no guide to how to begin reading and make sense of the codebase . Majority of developers in a project fail to understand that newcomer has no idea where to begin . The threshold of entry to contribution to open source projects is very high .

Its March already so I 'm a bit behind and the next few will be out of order , but this seems like as good a place to start as any . <p> I really enjoyed this series . Some of the early lectures covering Aristotle , Longinus , and Sidneys " Apology for Poetry " were quite brilliant . Later ones from Foucault- and Derrida on were weaker and harder to follow , which I think is a function of both the material , which can be dense when it starts getting into Modernism , the length , fixed at 30 minutes , and the lecturer , Louis Markos. - Markos teaches at Houston Baptist University and his asides can sometimes be a little traditional , - but in an adorable grandpa way . He has an infectious enthusiasm that makes even the slower chapters on Kant and- Schiller bearable , but his love of and fluency in the earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious to look into more online lectures and sometime this year I 'm going to check out this one on Value Theory at Khan academy . I also picked up a used copy of Critical Theory Since Plato which had the original text for many things discussed in the lecture , so was a great reference point when I was at home in Houston , where I end up listening to most audio content since its a driving town . <p> Ill start by saying Im writing this on a 12 ? Macbook in space grey . The screen , weight , size , and weird keyboard have captured my heart and I 'm enjoying using the machine . It has replaced a 15 ? Retina Pro as my primary laptop- for about 2 weeks now , with most of that being on the road . <p> For better and worse , its a lot like an iPad the size and weight feel very natural in your life , and the screen is really gorgeous . Its also not worth plugging anything into it besides its charging cable . It feels great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The speed feels more than adequate for everything Ive thrown at it so far , though I have n't tried video editing or photo management outside of the new Apple Photos app . If there was a perfect iPad and keybard combo , it would feel and look like the new Retina Macbook . <p> The second thing I 'll say is I would n't recommend this laptop for everybody- yet . There are some trade-offs , for example I can get 5-6 hours from the battery but its a little shorter than I expected . Its refreshing to have a computer that 's totally silent with no fan , and I 've only had a heat warning once when it was sitting in hot direct sunlight for about 20 minutes . I moved into the shade because I was also wilting a bit from the direct LA sun . <p> The main reason I 'm not sure if I 'd recommend this Macbook right is hopefully ephemeral : USB-C . One of the very coolest things about the new Macbook is it charges ( quickly ) with a new standard called USB 3.1 with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is reversible , and I think is going to be the future as I 've written about on this blog before . <p> Today , however , USB-C is bleeding edge . I actually have one other device that uses it , Googles new Chrome Pixel laptop , but when you search on Amazon for " USB-C " there are almost no results except sketchy or not-in-stock generic things , and Apple does n't  have any USB-C stuff in stock , even in their stores . ( Perhaps related to the general stock issues I ended up writing about last time I tried to pen this Macbook review . ) I was able to get a cable that had male old USB and male USB-C on Amazon , that was pretty much it . The promise of USB-C is incredible : standard cables for charging everything super-quickly , a battery pack that could charge your phone or laptop , smaller power bricks , a next-gen Thunderbolt display with one cable for all data , display , and charging . You can see and imagine a really perfect ecosystem around USB-C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff has been announced but is n't coming until the summer , even thumb drives . <p> The problem in- one sentence : it is impossible to buy a cable , from Apple or otherwise , that let 's you plug an iPhone 6+ into the Macbook . Theyve announced but not shipped ( to me at least ) an adapter for old USB stuff ( Type-A ) , but the last thing I need in my life is another dongle . <p> I think the most perfect tech combo in the world right now might be a 5k iMac at home , an iPhone 6+ as your phone , and the Macbook as an on-the-go device . ( The iPad is n't in my must-have list anymore . ) The strengths of each of these products complement each other , and as Apple gets better about the cloud with things like photos , tethering , keychain sync , and continuity its really becoming a pleasure to use these products together . I also have an Apple Watch in the mix , but still forming my thoughts on that one . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new tech in the retina Macbook around the keyboard , screen , trackpad , and battery is applied to their " Pro " series , which will probably be a bit more in my wheelhouse . <p> Along with about a million other people I bought and read the authorized biography , and did n't  think it portrayed Jobs in a way that made me think any less of him , but there must have been some things in there that someone who knew him closely felt were so off that as a group they decided to coordinate and speak with a new author to set the record straight , as Eddy Cue said of the new Becoming book , " Well done and first to get it right . " I will never know who Steve Jobs really was , but it is interesting to triangulate and learn from different takes , especially Isaacsons biography that Jobs himself endorsed but might not have read and this new one promoted by his closest friends , colleagues , and family . <p> As an independent third party who does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must say that I felt like I got a much- worse impression of Steve Jobs from Becoming than from the authorized biography . It was great to hear the direct voices and anecdotes of so many people close to him that havent spoken much publicly like his wife Laurene he was a very private man and his friends respect that . But the parts where Schlender/Tetzeli try to balance things out by acknowledging some of the rougher parts of Steves public life , especially the recent ones around options backdating , anti-poaching agreements , book pricing , ( all overblown in my opinion ) or even when trying to show his negotiating acumen with suppliers , Disney , or music labels , they make Jobs look like an insensitive jerk , which seems to be the opposite of what everyone involved was intending . <p> The direct quotes in the book could not be kinder , and its clear from both books that Jobs was incredibly warm , caring , and thoughtful to those closest to him , but Becoming tries so hard to emphasize that it makes the contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ callous . The personal anecdotes from the author are the best part : one of the most interesting parts of the book is actually when Jobs calls Schlender to invite him for a walk , as one of the people he reached out to and wanted to speak to before he passed , and Schlender not knowing the context actually chastises him for cutting off his journalistic access and other trivia , and then blows off the meeting , to his lifelong regret . <p> Its tragic , and its very human , and that 's what makes for great stories . No one suggests that Steve Jobs was a saint , nor did he need to be . His legacy is already well-protected both in the incredible results while he was alive , and even more so in what the team he built has accomplished since his passing , both periods which actually amaze and inspire me . Becoming Steve Jobs- tries harder and accomplishes less to honor the man . It is worth reading if , like me , you gobble up every book around the technology leaders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a familiar tune , but if you were only to read one book about Jobs , and get the most positive impression of the man and his genius , I 'd recommend Isaacsons Steve Jobs . <p> Ill talk about the Beats first because its easy : before I used a Plantronics set for exercise , but the battery life was n't great and they would often fall out when running . The Powerbeats 2 are light , have great battery life ( they claim 6 hours , that feels about right ) , stay in place even when running in the Houston heat , charge fast , and as a bonus they look cool . ( Beats has always been great about that . ) The sound ? Theyre bad , but good at it . There 's basically no isolation so you can hear traffic and things around you at lower volumes , which is actually a bonus , and if you turn up the volume they get loud enough to drown other stuff out . Buy these for the function , not the sound quality , and you can pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Apple Store if you lose or forget them , so they 're pretty ubiquitous . <p> The sound is the best I 've heard from wireless headphones so far . Just the right balance . The noise canceling apparently uses 4 different mics and I 've found it more than sufficient on dozens of plane rides , including passing the noisy baby test . My only complaint is they do n't  " grip " my ears as much , so some sound leaks in that way . They fold up to be pretty small , and I just toss them in my backpack . The battery goes forever , or as they claim 22 hours . You really forget to charge these things for a while and they still have plenty of juice . The volume and other controls actually work with the iPhone , and bluetooth calls have sounded great and people can actually hear me . Only downside is they have basically a proprietary connection for their 1/8th inch cable , so you have ta carry that around , but they charge with standard micro-USB . The only possible challenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I have n't tried yet . <p> I think its interesting that both of these recommendations are version 2.0 of a product , its good to see companies iterating and improving on products even if theyve already been successful in the marketplace . <p> I listen to music pretty much constantly , and its not unusual to see me on the road with just a carry-on and still have 3 or 4 headphones on me that I 'm testing . <p> First off , Bluetooth changes everything . Its so nice to not ever worry about cables , or even proximity for the most part , like having your phone charging by the laptop and still able to walk around the room . Audio quality is great now , only downside is having to charge something , but they 're all pretty good about battery now . <p> Ive been enjoying a category I 'll call : Bluetooth , over ear headphones that let people know not to bother you , that you feel kind of cool wearing , that are great for planes , and cost around $300-400 . The pioneer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their Studio Wireless ( in matte titanium , natch ) after Apple bought them- because I wanted to see what the fuss is about . More recently I got some horribly named but well-reviewed Samsung Level Overs , so this is a comparison of those two . ( Another contender in this category would be- the Parrot Zik ones , but just skip those . Great idea , annoying in practice . ) <p> Let me start with how the Beats are better : they fold up , look cool , sound pretty decent on calls , and everything works nicely with the iPhone . For me they have two fatal flaws : comfort and noise . The earcups are kind of small , or my ears are kind of huge ; whichever it is , sometimes after wearing them for a few hours my left ear starts to become quite sore . Second is they have active noise cancellation ( ANC ) that causes what can only be described as a constant hiss you can hear both while music is playing and while its off , its like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finish of the Beats are nice , as well as the accessories like cables , how it indicates how much power is left , et cetera . <p> The LEVEL overs ( wow that 's awkward to write ) are big , and they do n't  fold , but they float around in my backpack pretty much the same as the Beats , especially if you do n't  use- the included case . The battery seems to go forever . The ANC can be turned on and off ( battery goes longer with it off ) , and when its on its good , like **37;163;TOOLONG good . For me this is the deal-maker I did n't  realize what I was missing with mediocre ANC before on the Beats , Im now able to concentrate and relax much better on planes . I 've flown every third day in the past month , so this is a big deal to me . They also feel like they 're better made less plastic feeling than the Beats . The have a touch gesture control on the right cup like on the- Zik , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my ears and in general it feels more comfortable on my head , I can wear it for hours at a time and its totally comfortable . I do n't  think they look as cool , but that 's probably because I have n't been conditioned with pictures of my favorite musicians and athletes wearing them . ( Though not in football anymore . ) <p> Main downsides : the cable it comes with does n't  " work " with an iPhone or Mac as a mic or control device , and is also clunky . ( Bluetooth control works fine . ) This is apparently because the remote control resistor on Apple-targeted cables work differently from everyone elses , which I think we can all agree in 2014 is ridiculous for both sides . My fix for this was to use the cable from the Beats , which you can also buy online , which looks cooler , is smaller , and works great with my Mac for G+ Hangouts and Skype calls . Perhaps related to this is when the Beats or many other Bluetooth headsets Ive used are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samsung does n't  support this , but since the battery life is so good I do n't  worry about this too much . <p> Too long ; skipped to the end : The Samsung sounds better , is- more comfortable , and is- better made . Try it- out if you 're considering buying headphones in this category . I do n't  expect this to be a long-term advantage because I 'm fairly certain Apple will do amazing things with Beats in the future , even if that just means a lightning connector , but I 'm guessing that 's a 2015 thing . <p> I 've always been into personal analytics . From Wakemate to the Nike Fuelband I 've tried pretty much every device that 's come on the market to help you become more self-aware of your activities , and hopefully improve them as well . <p> Lately Ive settled on two that I think are really high quality : the Jawbone UP- and the Basis watch . I would recommend either above the Nike Fuelband or Fitbit , but let me share some brief thoughts about my experiences with each : <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any outfit , even with formal wear I find I can move it up my arm a little bit inside my sleeve above my shirt cuff thanks to the flexible nature of the band . The social app they have for it is cool , though it can be a little weird to see your teammates minute-by-minute sleeping habits ( " Hey ! I noticed you were up between 3:32 and 3:50 AM last night . How bout them Giants ? " ) . <p> I 'm very proud of my sleep . <p> The battery life is over a week so you never have to think about it , but you do have to carry around a proprietary connector for it which I keep losing leaving me ( like right now ) with an uncharged and useless device . To sync you plug the band into your phones headphone port and the sync takes a few seconds , its a fun process I do usually first thing in the morning to see how I slept the night before and its also fun to demo to friends . The first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I ended up wearing it out it started to look dirty and I broke it where the headphone jack comes out making it difficult to charge and sync . That said , I was pretty rough on it . My new one is blue and I like it much better . My only big complaint about how the whole thing works is it does n't  detect when you go to sleep , you have to press and hold the button on the end to put it from wake to sleep mode , which I would frequently forget to do . I really like the idea of the smart alarm and power nap features even though I never used them . <p> The Basis is a bit clunky and retro looking , but functionality-wise it provides some really cool data : it tracks your heart rate , skin temperature , perspiration level , steps , and sleep . It detects automatically when you 're asleep , no buttons to push . The data is presented in a really cool web app that let 's you compare some of the data points and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate jumps about 20 beats per minute when I wake up , and I 'm most warm about two thirds into my sleep cycle . There do n't  appear any social features that Ive seen in the software , though its habit formation tracking seems pretty slick . The way the " buttons " work on the device is pretty cool , the silver dots in the corners are touch-sensitive . There 's a button on the side that I have n't figured out what it does yet . Syncing and charging is much worse than the UP its got an even clunkier proprietary USB thing that both syncs to your computer and charges , but because the display can show you how you 're doing as you go throughout the day I do n't  feel the need to- synchronize- it as often . The heart rate tracking is by far my favorite feature . Its comfortable to wear , but does n't  disappear like the UP . Finally , as an added bonus , it tells the time . ( Surprising useful . ) If it somehow merged with the Pebble I 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two I 'd just use the Basis . The awkwardness of the device is outweighed by the richness of the data it provides . For right now I 'm not choosing : I wear one on each wrist and compare the data . ( Its always within a few % of each other for things they both do . ) If I were hiking in the woods for a week I 'd probably just take the UP as its battery would last the entire time . Its really illustrated for me what a silo each of these systems are , they do n't  talk to each other at all and it appears unlikely they ever will . <p> Long-term I think we really need an open source package you can run on your own servers that can ingest the data from all of these services , say from back when I used to use a Wakemate- sleep tracking to todays Fitbit Aria scale , the meals I track in the UP app with my Basis heart rate data and Runkeeper- and Hundred Pushup- logs , and provide you with a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various services . I think there 's going to be a lot of competition in this space in the next few years . <p> Nathan Myhrvold , an interesting character Ive following for a few years now , has been in the news lately for his co-authorship with Maxime Bilet and Chris Young of the new food bible Modernist Cuisine : The Art and Science of Cooking ( Amazon link ) . ( Peep that beautiful , 100% WordPress-powered site . ) I pre-ordered it forever ago , a fact that may surprise friends who know how little I cook , but I do love food and I was as interested in the pictures and the result of a detail-oriented and science-driven obsession with quality that goes all the way down- to the stochastic printing process as the articles/recipes . <p> The books are , in a word , stunning . I 'm probably a lifetime away from attempting a 30-hour burger , but last night I did try a sous-vide approach to a New York sirloin and it turned out amazing . ( Though that photo probably wont be in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can barely scramble eggs but made a super-good steak might portend the- apocalypse .

@@98356016 @2556016/ <h> A Bank Website on WordPress <p> There 's a thread on Quora asking " I am powering a banks website using WordPress . What security measures should I take ? " The answers have mostly been ignorant junk along the lines of " Oh NOES WP is INSECURE ! let me take my money out of that bank " , so I wrote one myself , which Ive copied below . <p> I agree there 's probably not a ton of benefit to having the online banking / billpay / etc portion of a banks website on WordPress , however there is no reason you could n't run the front-end and marketing side of the site on WordPress , and in fact you 'd be leveraging WordPress strength as a content management platform that is flexible , customizable , and easy to update and maintain . <p> In terms of security , there are a two simple points : <p> Make sure you 're on the latest version of core and all the plugins you run , and update as soon as new version become available . <p> Use strong passwords for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-factor plugin , use Jetpacks WordPress.com- login system , or restrict logged-in users to a certain IP range ( like behind a VPN ) . <p> If your host does n't  handle it , make sure you stay up-to-date for everything in your stack as well from the OS on up . Most modern WP hosts handle this ( and updates ) for you , and of course you could always run your site on WordPress.com VIP- alongside some of the top sites in the world . If you use any non-core third party code , no harm in having a security firm audit the source as well ( an advantage of using open source ) . <p> For an example of a beautiful , responsive banking website built on WordPress , check out Gateway Bank of Mesa AZ . WordPress is also trusted to run sites for some of the largest and most security-conscious organizations in the world , including Facebook , SAP , Glenn Greenwalds The Intercept , eBay , McAfee , Sophos , GNOME , Mozilla , MIT , Reuters , CNN , Google Ventures , NASA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely used CMS in the world , many people use and deploy the open source version of WordPress in a sub-optimal and insecure way , but the same could be said of Linux , Apache , MySQL , Node , Rails , Java , or any widely-used software . It is possible and actually not that hard to run WordPress in a way that is secure enough for a bank , government site , media site , or anything . <p> If you wanted any help on this feel free to reach out to Automattic as well , we have a decade of experience now dealing with high-risk , high-scale deployments , and also addressing the sort of uninformed FUD you see in this thread . <p> If you 've developed a major bank site in WordPress leave a link in the comments . <h> 32 thoughts on " A Bank Website on WordPress " <p> Here , in Spain , it seems large companies are starting to use and trust WordPress to build small sites for marketing campaigns or corporate blogs . The main problem that agencies are facing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a website using a custom and complex CMS . Is like they 're scared about this free thing called WordPress . <p> In my company , we have developed WordPress sites for a national bank , a very important clothing brand and also a big Business School . Sometimes is hard to convince each IT team from these big companies that WordPress is secure . Normally they run infinite security stress tests and always the problems come from plugins or from the theme where code does n't  escape things = <p> Any platform is vulnerable if not properly secured and up to date . I guess the problem with WordPress is that so many people are using it and SO MANY are not securing it properly . Its a very accessible system ( easy to install , huge number of plugins ) so obviously you 've got more people playing around with , without having the slightest clue of what they are doing . <p> And should I add one more point to the security tips . Always have a solid developer support in place . There are tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restful sleep for you and your customers . <p> " I am a WP evangelist and 99% of the time and I think it is doable with WP . However , I second Leonid S. Knyshov . Not because WP is bad inherently , but because if you 're asking how to do that here , in Quora , you probably do n't  have the resources to do it right no matter what answer we give you . " <p> The issue is n't whether WordPress is a appropriate platform for building a banking site it is but whether or not the person asking the question can muster the expertise and resources to do it successfully . <p> When I worked with the digital channels on the Resurs Bank in Sweden we chosed WordPress in 2011-2012 . <p> The security issue we had up early , but it 's worse with systems that are sold where we as buyers do not have a clue about the security flaws that exist . WordPress openness makes that we can analyze and when it shows up deficiencies corrected promptly . It does not happen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet bank , when the customer is logged in , so it is safer with a system that been fixed as often as wordpress . It 's more an API session with underlying systems . So again , it 's not WordPress that will be a problem here . <p> Banks has proven track record of safety on the Web server side . Especially for those services where customers log in . Here in Sweden we have several good security solutions for the customer 's part . <p> So no , WordPress works great for banks . Too bad no more hanging on , but it 's only a matter of time . <p> I would build a new web solution for a bank today , well then I choose WordPress without blinking . It is hugely affordable solution . Customers ' money should not be wasted on CMS solutions that cost huge sums . If I can build a more modern and better future proof solution for a tenth of the total for other CMS systems , it is the way to go . <p> There are many corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in place for years and are full of security bugs . <p> An obvious advantage that WordPress has over the custom cms is that it is probed , proded and tested by thousands of developers and security professionals . There are bugs in core and plugins but they are found and fixed . <p> WordPress like any system requires good management to ensure it is secure and kept secure . This is where updates , strong passwords , SSL etc come in . <p> Weve developed everything from a high-end secure and auto-scaling hosting environment to a multi-lingual WordPress installation that can work with content deployment as part of a content release system . Certain laws here in Europe require that you must always be able to go back to the state of the site " as a whole " at any given moment if a financial authority requires this . Weve built a history and preview mechanism for this . We 've basically enabled time-travel in WordPress . <p> The UX of WordPress , is only a small part of the equation . You mention two points with regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the largest concern . It seeps through in every single aspect of how WordPress is used and implemented , forcing secure passwords is a very small part of this . You basically need to run a locked down installation on the production server to meet the security and compliancy requirements dictated by central banks and other authorities . <p> That 's why I said " make sure you stay up-to-date for everything in your stack as well from the OS on up . " Its true that WordPress is only a small part of it , but that was what the question was about . = <p> We also had to build something to solve the " we need to see what the site looked like at any point in time in the past 7 years " problem , was fun . Basically runs a flat html mirror of the whole site everytime anything changes , those are then browsable through the wp-admin , works pretty well ; well be open sourcing it at some point hopefully . <p> Just like with any other part of the stack , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to miss security related things . But if you know what you 're doing then WordPress is hardly the weakest point . <p> We recently helped Newton ( part of Bank of New York ) move to WordPress . There were some specific considerations related to FCC regulations around data retention but nothing that couldnt be solved . Overall it was a huge success , WordPress has been transformative for them compared to their previous systems . <p> In addition to strong passwords and keeping the software up to date , I suggest that high quality hosting is an important security factor . We worked with WP Engine to set up the hosting for Lake City Bank . <p> I 've had great success using WordPress for a local credit unions website https : //www.bankcfcu.org that we run on a dedicated server to also provide ancillary enterprise applications . Credit unions are perfect candidates for using WordPress as their base brochure site , as most utilize hosted applications built for the credit union industry that are more affordable for these smaller banking institutions . <p> Well . I also have developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we cant just say that its insecure . I think in WordPress its more easy to secure your site as Matt mentioned that we can use 2 factor authentication . Keep up the good work Matt <p> I personally built number of sites on WP . Now , this time I am working on a serious level eCommerce site on WordPress . I do n't  see any reason why I should n't ! Our new site would be up by next week though = <p> Its not WordPress that I do n't  trust , its the plugins . If a bank could run their system solely off of WordPress , incorporating their own secure plugins developed from the same team , then I do n't  see the problem with a WordPress bank . 
@@98356017 @2556017/ <h> Tag Archives : Birthday <p> My thirty-second birthday has arrived after a whirlwind year , probably my most challenging and rewarding . It went faster than any year I can remember , absolutely flew by . Luckily it was capped at the holidays with a precious few weeks of downtime in Houston . Now I 'm back to work- in Cape Town and just finished a lovely day of great food , wine , and conversation with colleagues who are here for a meetup- starting tomorrow . <p> Since I started tracking , 2015 was the first year that I traveled fewer miles than the year before , clocking in at 398k , down 27k. ( 398,553 miles , 111 cities , 20 countries . ) In 2016 I 'm going to try and get that even lower . It was also one of my best years for blogging on this site , with the most posts ( 252 ) Ive made since 2008 , and the most words ( 24,605 ) since 2005 . ( If anyone is curious , I wrote about 60k words over the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omission , though , its the first year since this site started in 2002 that I did n't  post a single gallery of photos . I 've developed a mental block around processing and posting the fancier pictures , even as I carry hundreds of gigabytes of them around the planet several times over . Hopefully this is something I can get past in 2016 . <p> I ran 163 miles in- 2015 , more than I did the year before , and I think- that trend will- continue . Last year I talked about habits and small actions , and a daily todo list with some small items to nourish the mind , soul , and body has become central to my routine . I dyed my hair ( grey ) just for fun and also to show the rest of Automattic they could too , how you look does n't  matter one iota . My restaurant quest- has continued , and Ive now been to 38% of the current top 50 list . <p> More so than before , I really do n't  know what 's around the corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more still being defined and started . Theres freedom in the groove , to reference Joshua Redmans great album , and I 'm getting a lot more comfortable with ambiguity and the faster pace of life in general . More than ever , I consider myself incredibly lucky , so its exciting to make the most of the opportunity that the volatility , love , loss , glory , failure , inspirations , and setbacks that 2016 will bring . <p> As in WordPress , the X.0 release is just the one that came after ( X-1 ) .9 before it , so while it seems more significant , it 's just another iteration in the steady march of progress , a job never done . I 've now managed to stay alive for three decades , thirty rotations around the sun , and I woke up this morning a little hungover ( there 's a lot of tequila in Mexico ) but with a huge grin on my face . <p> In many ways life accumulates complexity as you get older , but the things that are most important are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and working on something you enjoy and has an impact . I 'm happier and finding balance more often than at any period I can remember since I was a young child . <p> This was another year in motion , traveling 345,211 miles to 78 cities in 13 countries . I 'm still really enjoying being on the road , and it 's very intrinsic to how Automattic works , so I expect that to continue or even pick up pace . <p> Every generation feels this way , but it also genuinely seems like we 're at shift in how society works , with technology accelerating change , and navigating and more importantly creating that change is one of the most interesting challenges I can imagine working on . <p> Tomorrow I 'll wake up a little sunburnt , but hopefully with that same grin and ready to take on the years of my life that start with 3 and hopefully end with a bigger impact than my 20s had . It was a decade when I failed a lot , tried even more , and most importantly learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that gets easier as you learn about yourself . <p> Today is a fun day 2011-1-11 ( not 1:11 PM anymore , I 'm a slow writer ) and I 'm turning 27 . This is the time of the year I always look back , and from last years resolutions I actually did pretty well . I was able to simplify a number of areas of my life , including reducing the number of computers running in my place . I bought my first apartment and remodeled it . I slowed down my eating by chewing more , a vignette that made Tims new Four Hour Body book . Redesigned this site . I did n't  bike at all , but walked a ton . I started exercising with a kettlebell over the summer and was pretty consistent about it until last month , with some- noticeable- improvements in strength and energy .

( With an interesting traffic pattern too lots of Twitter and Facebook like you would expect , but 92% of the traffic from the long tail or blogs like Daring Fireball . ) <p> According to TripIt , which I love and use constantly , I was on the road 227 days out of the year , traveling 122,066 miles across 59 cities and 17 countries . <p> 27 is a really awkward age I 'm not young anymore but still before the looming 30 .

Itll take a long time though , as it follows all the nooks and crannies of the the coast . But the scenery is spectacular , especially the Big Sur area ( a bit south of SF ) . <p> Well its a little late now but you could have cut north to avoid Los Angeles .

@@98356023 @2556023/ <h> Divine Command Theory and the Euthyphro Argument <p> The divine command theory is the view of morality in which what is right is what God commands , and what is wrong is what God forbids . This view is one that ties together morality in and religion in a way that is very comfortable for most people , because it provides a solution to pesky arguments like moral relativism and the objectivity of ethics . <p> The Euthyphro Argument comes from Platos dialogue in which Sokrates asks : Is something is right because God commands it , or does God command it because it is right ? The ethical implications of this argument suggest that the relationship between morality and religion might not be as clear-cut as previously thought . What makes this question so effective is that if the interlocutor accepts either part of it he is often logically forced into conclusions that may conflict with other beliefs he has , therefore creating a logical dilemma for him . Let us look at these two cases : <p> If something is right because God commands it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if God commanded otherwise . God " says " it is right to honor your father and mother , and so that is the morally right thing to do because He says it . However if on the mount God had commanded Moses to say it is not right to honor your father and mother , then it would be just as right today to do that because it is what God commanded . This , in effect , completely trivializes all the commands of God as completely arbitrary , and furthermore it eliminates the logical validity of God being Good , because if something is Good because God commands it , then God is Good because God commands it , a tautological statement with no real force behind it . The rebuttal that God would chose something to be right because of His infinite wisdom fits in line more with the next argument . <p> The second option , that God commands something because it is right and that is obvious to Him in His infinite wisdom , avoids the arbitrariness of the previous option , but introduces a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if God commands something because it is right , then in accepting that argument you have abandoned a theological concept of right and wrong , insofar that it would be right whether or not God commands it . Each of these cases will lead the believer in the divine command theory into morally uncomfortable territory . In my personal experience , I have found that when presented with these two options , most people who previously believed in the divine command theory outright will go with the second option , as it is more pious to acknowledge Gods infinite wisdom and an independent concept of right and wrong than to characterize God as arbitrary . <p> Another problem with the divine command theory that is n't as logically addressable , but is still a sticking point , is that what God " says " is mired in issues of accuracy and human error . What if a person claims God has said something to them , and another person claims God has said something different ? Whom should you believe ? The answer is , of course , the right one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of this in larger terms of the chief document of Judeo-Christian faith , the Bible , and millennia of time and generations of translations multiply the problems . Within the Christian faith , different denominations accept different parts of the Bible , and exclude others from the very inclusion in printing ; a Catholic bible will be textually different from a Baptist bible . Furthermore , in teaching their particular texts , different parts are emphasized and deemphasized , lending an entirely different interpretation of what is thought by each to be Gods word . <p> All of these arguments lead us to the fact that the divine command theory is not as universal and robust as many might believe it is . This should not be viewed as an anti-religious argument , rather simply as an invitation for deeper thought into the issues . Some of the greatest religious thinkers of all time such as St. Thomas Aquinas rejected the divine command theory because of the very logical dilemmas presented here . Therefore , in this sense , elements of religion certainly do and should borrow from moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I am writing a paper on the same arguement for my college philosophy class , and i found that your views very much concerted with mine . I found your paper helpful in picking what may be the stronger of my claims to focus on , thanks ! ! <p> You do a good job of laying out the Euthyphro dilemma . One point you may consider : The mere fact that God could have made a different decision does not make His decision " arbitrary " . This is one of the biggest problems with the so-called " dilemma " . Ask yourself this . Suppose you want to walk from point A to point B , and there is a straight sidewalk leading directly from one to another . Now along the way you come across another sidewalk to your right that leads to point C. You have a decision to make . You can continue to go straight or turn right . You , of course , decide to continue straight because you want to reach point B , and the sidewalk to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free to choose to turn right . You could have chosen to turn right . Does the mere fact that you could have come to a different decision somehow make your decision to go straight arbitrary ? Of course not . You weighed the consequences of going straight with the consequences of turning right and made an informed decision . The mere ability to make a different decision does not render the decision you made arbitrary . <p> Now you may object that what I have said leads into the second problem ; i.e. , I am basically saying that God knew the moral truth and simply stated a pre-existing truth . But notice that in the example I gave the consequences you weighed were completely devoid of moral consequence . It would be neither morally right nor wrong for you to choose one path over the other . The same could be true of the decision-making process for the origin of morality . Bear in mind that we are talking about how morality came into existence . Therefore , prior to that point there was no morality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not exist yet . All decisions were in essence of the same nature as our diverging sidewalks example . Using these non-moral considerations , God could have made a decision about morality and defined morality in accordance with potential consequences . So He is not simply restating a pre-existing moral truth . He is defining morality itself , but based upon non-moral considerations . I could go on a lot further explaining this , but that at least provides you with a brief introduction to the problem with the Euthyphro dilemma . <p> Also , you may consider modifying your paragraph dealing with the differences in Bibles , because it does show that you do not fully understand Christianitys view of the Bible . First of all , there is no such thing as a " Baptist " Bible . All genuine Christian religions believe that the only true authority is the original . Errors have crept in over time due to copyists mistakes , translational differences , etc . But no denomination bases its theology upon one particular English translation . The authority for making theological decisions always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the Catholics include a few more books in their Bible than protestants ( the vast majority , including the entire New Testament , are the same ) , there are no textual differences between the common books because the " Bible " for both is the original text in the original languages , NOT the English translations . While there may be differences in translations ( the Catholics do have their own English translation , although they do not go so far as to say other translations are incorrect ) , the translations are simply tools for us to use since most of us do not speak ancient Greek or Hebrew . The " Bible " is the same for all . <p> In regard to your comment about a " Baptist " Bible , you should know that among all protestant denominations , there is not even one authoritative translation . A protestant is free to use whatever translation they believe speaks best to them . Your statement that " different denominations accept different parts of the Bible " is incorrect . " Denomination " refers to protestants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use any translation . Finally , in answer to your question about " Whom should you believe ? " , the answer is neither . You should believe the Bible ( i.e. , the original text ) . Of course humans are going to disagree as to what this all means , after all we are fallible creatures . But that can be said of any moral discussion , whether religious in nature or otherwise . <p> Ultimately , the conclusion may be that an infinite number of factors go into determining morality , and because humankind only has a finite mind , we will never be able to fully understand it . That certainly would explain why every moral theory attempted to date has failed to adequately explain all aspects of morality . <p> First off , excellent post . You lay out some good points that are well worth considering . That said , there is Kens post . LOL <p> Question : <p> What exactly is " All genuine Christian religions believe that the only true authority is the original ? " Who decided this ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not translations ) of the Bible . <p> " At the time the Christian Bible was being formed , a Greek translation of Jewish Scripture , the Septuagint , was in common use and Christians adopted it as the Old Testament of the Christian Bible . However , around 100 A.D. , Jewish rabbis revised their Scripture and established an official canon of Judaism which excluded some portions of the Greek Septuagint . The material excluded was a group of 15 late Jewish books , written during the period 170 B.C. to 70 A.D. , that were not found in Hebrew versions of the Jewish Scripture . Christians did not follow the revisions of Judaism and continued to use the text of the Septuagint . <p> Protestant reformers in the 1500s decided to follow the official canon of Judaism for the Old Testament rather than the Septuagint , and the excluded material was placed in a separate section of the Bible called the Apocrypha . Protestant Bibles included the Apocrypha until the mid 1800s , but it was eventually dropped from most Protestant editions . <p> The Roman Catholic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Septuagint . The result is that these versions of the the Bible have more Old Testament books than Protestant versions . Catholic Old Testaments include 1st and 2nd Maccabees , Baruch , Tobit , Judith , The Wisdom of Solomon , Sirach ( Ecclesiasticus ) , additions to Esther , and Susanna and Bel and the Dragon which are included in Daniel . Orthodox Old Testaments include these plus 1st and 2nd Esdras , Prayer of Manasseh , Psalm 151 and 3rd Maccabees . <p> " Council of Trent : on April 8 , 1546 , by vote ( 24 yea , 15 nay , 16 abstain ) approved the present Roman Catholic Bible Canon including the Deuterocanonical Books . This is said to be the same list as produced at the Council of Florence in 1451 , this list was defined as canonical in the profession of faith proposed for the Jacobite Orthodox Church . Because of its placement , the list was not considered binding for the Catholic church , and in light of Martin Luthers demands , the Catholic Church examined the question of the Canon again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Council of Florence . The Old Testament books that had been in doubt were termed deuterocanonical , not indicating a lesser degree of inspiration , but a later time of final approval . Beyond these books , some editions of the latin Vulgate include Psalm 151 , the Prayer of Manasseh , 1 Esdras ( called 3 Esdras ) , 2 Esdras ( called 4 Esdras ) , and the Epistle to the Laodiceans in an appendix , styled " Apogryphi " . <p> Thirty-Nine Articles : in 1563 , of the Church of England , article 6 , recognized the Roman Catholic Canon including the Deuterocanonicals with the caveat " for example of life and instruction in manners but not to establish any doctrine . " <p> King James Bible : of 1611 , included deuterocanon and apocrypha from the Vulgate and Septuagint . " <p> Vatican I : on April 24 , 1870 , approved the additions to Mark ( v.16:9-20 ) , Luke , ( 22:19b-20,43-44 ) and John , ( 7:53-8:11 ) which are not present in early manuscripts . <p> Oh yes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a translation by definition . Further while canons are considerd important they are not part of the Bible and no real authority believes that . <p> The only problem with the argument is how it assumes god is defined . What it means depends on how god is defined in the case . Otherwise , its sound reasoning ; most definitions of a god are disproven in this argument . <p> KEN really ? I want to adress your first 2 paragraphs . to say that God defines morality for us , is the same as saying its good b/c God said its good . Where it really does become an arbitrary command BECAUSE he could have commanded anything , since there is no pre-existing standard for goodness . Also there is a massive flaw in your sidewalk analogy , because if you are going from A to B , your decision not to go to C is not arbitrary as you said , and that is because A does in fact exist , and you want to get there ; even though you were free to go to C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good , he knows the good and command it , or he can diverge and command evil . <p> by saying that he defined morality based on the different consequences of different actions , for him to make the decision on which consequences are good , once again there must have to have been a pre-existing standard for which consequences are good , for God to pose his definition . Your trying to pose a circular argument by disguising it in different terms . <p> there is no problem with the Euthyphro dilemma . therefore your argument is invalid

But as you can see from the mess of cables and how many other legacy USB things I 'm carrying around , were ( still ! ) in this really awkward in-between phase for computing . First , there are no good retractable cables , especially ones that have USB-C on one end and Lightning or Micro-USB on the other . I wish my headset , headphones , sunglasses , and Kindle did n't  need Micro-USB , and I wish the Airpods , iPhone , iPad Pro , Magic Mouse would just give up on Lightning and support USB-C instead . But were in this liminal space , and the number one thing I hope is better by next years post is that the USB-C accessory world has flourished and I just have a couple of neat retractable USB-C cables and things like the battery , wall charger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 37 just have all USB-C ports . A boy can dream , right ? <h> In Closing <p> Partly because the backpack is a little smaller , I 've really tried to streamline and a lot of things from last year , like a small digital camera , the Chromecasts , travel router , etc I do n't  bother carrying around in my backpack anymore . I hope these can get simpler and shorter every year . I tagged these with an affiliate I 'd for Amazon this year but mostly just to see if anyone actually buys stuff from these posts . I walk millions of steps a year with my backpack and would n't carry something around unless I really believed in it , which is also why I 'm always testing and trying new things . As you can tell a lot of this kit has evolved from recommendations , so if you have any please leave a note in the comments .

There 's basically no isolation so you can hear traffic and things around you at lower volumes , which is actually a bonus , and if you turn up the volume they get loud enough to drown other stuff out .

The pioneer in this category is Beats , and I bought a pair of their Studio Wireless ( in matte titanium , natch ) after Apple bought them- because I wanted to see what the fuss is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-reviewed Samsung Level Overs , so this is a comparison of those two . ( Another contender in this category would be- the Parrot Zik ones , but just skip those . Great idea , annoying in practice . ) <p> Let me start with how the Beats are better : they fold up , look cool , sound pretty decent on calls , and everything works nicely with the iPhone . For me they have two fatal flaws : comfort and noise . The earcups are kind of small , or my ears are kind of huge ; whichever it is , sometimes after wearing them for a few hours my left ear starts to become quite sore . Second is they have active noise cancellation ( ANC ) that causes what can only be described as a constant hiss you can hear both while music is playing and while its off , its like like noise addition rather than noise cancellation . The fit and finish of the Beats are nice , as well as the accessories like cables , how it indicates how much power is left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's awkward to write ) are big , and they do n't  fold , but they float around in my backpack pretty much the same as the Beats , especially if you do n't  use- the included case . The battery seems to go forever . The ANC can be turned on and off ( battery goes longer with it off ) , and when its on its good , like **37;202;TOOLONG good . For me this is the deal-maker I did n't  realize what I was missing with mediocre ANC before on the Beats , Im now able to concentrate and relax much better on planes . I 've flown every third day in the past month , so this is a big deal to me . They also feel like they 're better made less plastic feeling than the Beats . The have a touch gesture control on the right cup like on the- Zik , but it actually works well . The cups fit completely over my ears and in general it feels more comfortable on my head , I can wear it for hours at a time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cool , but that 's probably because I have n't been conditioned with pictures of my favorite musicians and athletes wearing them . ( Though not in football anymore . ) <p> Main downsides : the cable it comes with does n't  " work " with an iPhone or Mac as a mic or control device , and is also clunky . ( Bluetooth control works fine . ) This is apparently because the remote control resistor on Apple-targeted cables work differently from everyone elses , which I think we can all agree in 2014 is ridiculous for both sides . My fix for this was to use the cable from the Beats , which you can also buy online , which looks cooler , is smaller , and works great with my Mac for G+ Hangouts and Skype calls . Perhaps related to this is when the Beats or many other Bluetooth headsets Ive used are connected to the iPhone there 's a battery indicator and the Samsung does n't  support this , but since the battery life is so good I do n't  worry about this too much . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds better , is- more comfortable , and is- better made . Try it- out if you 're considering buying headphones in this category . I do n't  expect this to be a long-term advantage because I 'm fairly certain Apple will do amazing things with Beats in the future , even if that just means a lightning connector , but I 'm guessing that 's a 2015 thing .

People got excited , and assumed I was buying a house , fancy car , plane , company , jewelry it was really amusing to see where peoples imagination went . I 'm afraid the truth is much less exciting , at least to other people . I was wiring money for the domain I 'm on now , ma.tt . How did this come to be ? <p> Around the beginning of the year I was going through a spreadsheet for international domains , listing all the different countries , and I spotted . tt . I noticed they did the top-level thing , not . co.tt or something lame like that , and I wandered over to the 90s-era NIC site for Trinidad and Tobago . I did a search for " ma.tt " and was utterly shocked that it was unregistered ! <p> Now Ive been at photomatt.net for 6+ years now , but quite honestly the . net threw people off . I cant tell you how many times media coverage has misspelled my domain name , usually with . org or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wacky , but eventually he let the domain expire and I picked it up . But the . com guy was a little more damaging he had a somewhat active and well-designed site , it just focused mostly on pictures of harajaku ( sp ? ) girls . People assumed this was me and I had a weird Asian fetish . No matter how many times I contacted him , he never got back to me about a price for the domain , or a mutual link , anything . I had also thought about something like matt.com , but I think thatd be way too expensive . It became more obvious that photomatt.net probably was n't going to be a domain name for the ages . <p> Back to ma.tt , it was unregistered but to register a domain in Trinidad/Tobago you have to do an international wire to their bank , they do n't  accept credit cards , and the cost is 500/yr for the first 2 years . ( Which is probably why you do n't  see too many . ) The cost is much higher than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a good . com and this was way cooler , so the price seemed reasonable . Its a 5-character domain , the same length as a single-letter . com . So about two weeks ago I went to the bank , wired the money to their foreign account and then did n't  hear anything for a week .

@@98356041 @2556041/ <h> A Better Image Rotator <p> The Hiveware Image Rotator , shared by Mr Zeldman , does one thing and does it fairly well : it shows a random image on each reload . However , the approach the script takes is slightly flawed , and could be improved as detailed below . <p> My first issue with the script is that it is really only set up to handle two types of files , GIF and JPEG , and then only with the file extensions of . gif or . jpg , so something like . jpeg ( fairly common ) would not be included . Not to mention the noble PNG is left out entirely . Fixing this , however , leads us to a more fundamental problem : the images are served through the script . This means that the script has to handle the content-type header , something that is messy to do . A better method , I propose , is for the script to merely serve a temporary redirect header , which sends the browser with a minimum of overhead to the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangential benefits including that it allows the image itself to be cached properly , either by a caching server or the browser itself , and it delegates content negotiation and such to the web server , which is most likely infinitely better at it . <p> So now what we have a script which reads files in a directory , grabs the ones with a user defined set of file extensions , and sends a simple Location header to whichever file is randomly chosen . The complication now that the location of the image is now important in terms of the web server document root . One bonus of Dan Benjamins method is you can use images outside of the web root , though I do n't  know why anyone would want to do this . The script could ask for two variables to be defined , the absolute path to the images and the path to the images through the web server , but I would like for this to be as ridiculously easy to setup as possible . Another option would be to subtract the $DOCUMENTROOT variable from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would require people to know the absolute path of the directory they 're using , and like I said I 'd like this to be easy as humanly possible . The best solution is to use a relative path ; if the users enters nothing its assumed that the images are in the same directory as the script but if they are n't  the path can be entered in a relative manner , like " images/random " or " .. /rand-img " . Easy peasy . <p> Finally , instead of the plain rand() well use mtrand , which is about four times faster and slightly more random . What do you get ? The Photo Matt Random Image Script . I 've tested it thoroughly , but if you have any problems do n't  hesitate to let me know . Its just standard HTTP though so I do n't  foresee any trouble . Something neat about this is that with the code we just wrote , you can also serve random anythingfrom zip files to MP3sjust by changing the extension line . Enjoy ! here 's an example of it in action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphics Jeffrey has been putting up , the rest are snips of photographs I have n't uploaded yet . <p> But would n't it be nice to be able to set a unique alternate text for each image , as well as use images of different sizes ( dimensions ) ? For my part , i just get a random img tag from an array of img tags , each one having its own dimension and alternate text . <p> here 's a scripting challenge for Matt or other . An image randomizer that has a timer for image display AND with each image a link back to the images web site ( and blank ) for a new browser window . The application would be great for randomly displaying logos of participating sponsors or partners . The Java based image scrollers ( like Coffee Cups Applet Headline Factory ) have this feature , but are trapped in a linear display mode . If anyone knows of this script already existing .. please use my email to fill me in on its whereabouts . Thanks Stan <p> I tried using your script for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this method works when browsing with ie6 when using Mozilla Firefox the browser seems to cache the path to the image thus showing always the same image I havnt tried any other browsers . <p> I assume I could use this image rotator code to show a wide variety of headers randomly for my blog ? I think this could be pretty cool . I 'm glad to be learning about this possibility and associated coding . <p> I 'm trying to set up a random-loading image for a header background and I 'm running into the Mozilla/Firefox caching issue where it seems to get stuck and only displays the same image over and over . Is there a fix for this ? <p> Firefox has some unique web caching features that are designed to speed up the browsing process . With scripts like this , Firefox can appear to have its share of issues . <p> To quote an article released on the Scot Finnie Newsletter page he addresses this issue as follows : <p> There 's only one about:config-based tweak that I 'm currently recommending ( although I expect to add others in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people who have fast Internet connections or those who are Webmasters , news junkies , possibly online gaming , anything where its mandatory that clicking the Refresh button always shows you the very latest information on that Web page .

" To change it , simply double-click the **31;301;TOOLONG entry . A small dialog box will open . Type the numeral 1 to change it to " Each Time " and press OK . here 's a description of the available options for this particular setting : <p> I work often with sites/pages that use server-side caching , so PhilMills solution above does n't  work ( as the random number that 's generated would get cached also ! ) . In the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not sure if I can paste code here , so Ill just explain how : <p> 1 ) Output your IMG tag as normal , or using the solution immediately above ( this will ensure it still works if JavaScript is disabled ) 2 ) Give the IMG tag an HTML I 'd ( such as randimage ) 3 ) Immediately after the IMG tag include some inline javascript ( using " script " tags also within a CDATA comment if doctype is xhtml ) : " **38;334;TOOLONG = **38;374;TOOLONG + ? rand= + ( Math.rand() * 10000000 ) ; " <p> I know this post is a few years old , but I just wanted to say that I have looked at every image-related plugin on the wordpress website and none did the job this does .

@@98356042 @2556042/ <h> Macbook &amp; USB-C Review <p> Ill start by saying Im writing this on a 12 ? Macbook in space grey . The screen , weight , size , and weird keyboard have captured my heart and I 'm enjoying using the machine . It has replaced a 15 ? Retina Pro as my primary laptop- for about 2 weeks now , with most of that being on the road . <p> For better and worse , its a lot like an iPad the size and weight feel very natural in your life , and the screen is really gorgeous . Its also not worth plugging anything into it besides its charging cable . It feels great to open and pick up right where you left off . The speed feels more than adequate for everything Ive thrown at it so far , though I have n't tried video editing or photo management outside of the new Apple Photos app . If there was a perfect iPad and keybard combo , it would feel and look like the new Retina Macbook . <p> The second thing I 'll say is I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade-offs , for example I can get 5-6 hours from the battery but its a little shorter than I expected . Its refreshing to have a computer that 's totally silent with no fan , and I 've only had a heat warning once when it was sitting in hot direct sunlight for about 20 minutes . I moved into the shade because I was also wilting a bit from the direct LA sun . <p> The main reason I 'm not sure if I 'd recommend this Macbook right is hopefully ephemeral : USB-C . One of the very coolest things about the new Macbook is it charges ( quickly ) with a new standard called USB 3.1 with a Type-C connector , which is open for anyone to use , is reversible , and I think is going to be the future as I 've written about on this blog before . <p> Today , however , USB-C is bleeding edge . I actually have one other device that uses it , Googles new Chrome Pixel laptop , but when you search on Amazon for " USB-C " there are almost no results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have any USB-C stuff in stock , even in their stores . ( Perhaps related to the general stock issues I ended up writing about last time I tried to pen this Macbook review . ) I was able to get a cable that had male old USB and male USB-C on Amazon , that was pretty much it . The promise of USB-C is incredible : standard cables for charging everything super-quickly , a battery pack that could charge your phone or laptop , smaller power bricks , a next-gen Thunderbolt display with one cable for all data , display , and charging . You can see and imagine a really perfect ecosystem around USB-C , but it does n't  exist today . Some cool stuff has been announced but is n't coming until the summer , even thumb drives . <p> The problem in- one sentence : it is impossible to buy a cable , from Apple or otherwise , that let 's you plug an iPhone 6+ into the Macbook . Theyve announced but not shipped ( to me at least ) an adapter for old USB stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life is another dongle . <p> I think the most perfect tech combo in the world right now might be a 5k iMac at home , an iPhone 6+ as your phone , and the Macbook as an on-the-go device . ( The iPad is n't in my must-have list anymore . ) The strengths of each of these products complement each other , and as Apple gets better about the cloud with things like photos , tethering , keychain sync , and continuity its really becoming a pleasure to use these products together . I also have an Apple Watch in the mix , but still forming my thoughts on that one . <p> The thing I might be most excited about is when some of the new tech in the retina Macbook around the keyboard , screen , trackpad , and battery is applied to their " Pro " series , which will probably be a bit more in my wheelhouse . <p> The USB-C to USB-A adapter was in stock at the Stockton St Apple Store last week . The display adapters are n't  though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacBook , ordered at the same time , shipped last week ) <p> I was able to get all the adapters as an early orderer . I have the USB C to HDMI+USB A+USB C dongle , the USB C to USB A ( female ) dongle , and a USB C to USB A ( male ) cable . The has allowed me to use USB sticks , external drives , SD cards ( from camera ) , and monitors , etc . <p> My only complaint so far is the re-shaped left and right arrow keys for some reason I 'm still struggling with that . I love everything else about this machine . I 'd certainly take more battery , but I 'm getting 8 hours which is a nice upgrade from the 15 ? MBP . <p> Nice review Matt .

@@98356043 @2556043/ 14594 @qwx874594 <h> 5 thoughts on " Future of WP and Jetpack " <p> I 'm definitely bullish on JetPack . It solves a problem too many plugins and plugin authors to worry about when implementing plugins on client sites . <p> After spending the last so many years managing a bunch of different plugins for a bunch of different things , its simply nice to be able to turn to one plugin that handles a bunch of these things at one time , with the ability to turn each feature of the plugin on or off . There 's a lot to like in JetPack . <p> What I have come to realize is that JetPack provides a limited set of base features . The Sharing system is great . Has worked perfectly for me for cross posting to clients sites and adding social sharing buttons to pages , posts , and CPTs . However , the limitation is that you can not roll your own icon pack . I have a restaurant client that is really concerned about image . They looked at both sets of icons for sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we built , but alas , after contacting support at JetPack , I was told that 's not available yet with no plans to implement . <p> The issue there is in order for someone like me to adopt JetPack consistently , I need a little more flexibility in some of the tools , like the Share bar icons . JetPack cant force us just to use what is avail . They have to go the extra mile and allow for custom icons . <p> Matt , based on your post a few months ago about AddThis and services like it putting a tracking cookie in your browser and reporting your comings and goings to 3rd parties , I made the switch to JetPack . But after making the switch , I realized some of the limitations . <p> The key issue is : can the developers at JetPack keep up with the features people want or need from the plugins they supercede or will replace ? <p> Lastly , it would be great to have image compression along with Photon CDN hosting . Its not clear to me whether images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need to go take a look at that , but I 'm using smush.it for image compression . Many clients do n't  know to reduce the size of their files and even though you train them , someone new comes in and starts uploading 3MB photos . Hopefully , a combination of Photon and image compression will solve this problem . <p> I know , for me , having a carousel and gallery native in the WordPress media library replaces my old favorite , NextGen Gallery . I never liked having images stored in both NextGens separate uploads folder and WordPress uploads folder , because when moving sites , some developers might not think to look for the NextGen uploads folder before deleting the entire site from a server . Sure , you have a backup of the entire wp-content folder structure , but I 'm just saying that its better now to have all your images avail in one media library , not two . <p> I 'm also happy that BruteProtect is now part of JetPack . Had it already installed and its help with spam bots tremendously . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency owner , JetPack is solving some problems . I 'm already seeing the benefits and I have to convince those who do n't  to move on this , so they are up to speed . In fact , I gave a JetPack presentation at WordCamp Raleigh last year , knowing that JetPack was really the future of WordPress . So , I was already on the ball on that one , for sure ! <p> I 'm Jeremy , I work for Automattic and help people out with the Jetpack plugin . <p> JetPack ca n't force us just to use what is avail . They have to go the extra mile and allow for custom icons . <p> You should already be able to customize the look of the Jetpack sharing buttons with some custom CSS . You can remove the existing icons , add new ones , change colours , and do other cosmetic changes by adding custom CSS to your theme stylesheet or to the custom CSS editor available under Appearance &gt; Edit CSS in your dashboard .

@@98356053 @2556053/ <h> On the Dvorak Keyboard Layout <p> Its a relatively well-known fact that I am a Dvorak typist , and have been for about four or five years now . Just an introduction for the uninitiated , the Dvorak keyboard layout is just a different arrangements of letters purposively chosen because it is more efficient for typing the English language . For example , instead of my left hand resting on the letters ASDF it rests on the letters AOEU . There have been studies both ways saying it is or is not faster than QWERTY , and frankly I think most of them are useless . Logically you can see that if the letters you use most are right under your fingers , ultimately you 're going to work less while typing . <p> Why did I switch ? If I remember correctly , I was surfing around the website of columnist John Dvorak and on some page he mentioned the Dvorak keyboard layout and linked to a site about it . Several web searches later , I had read all about the layout I could find on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my motivation was that I wanted to be as fast as humanly possible , but it was mostly that I spend a tremendous amount of time typing and I often got pains in my hands and wrists . Switching did not seem like a big obstacle simply because it seemed very similar to learning to play a new instrument , something that as a musician I could relate to and did n't  seem too challenging . <p> I know now that some of my reasons for switching may have been hype on the part of the websites I read , I can offer what I have found in my personal experience to be true . <p> Switching is not as hard as people make it out to be . Even if you are already quite proficient at QWERTY , its not too hard to switch . You do n't  need to buy a new keyboard , in every operating system there is a mechanism for switching what 's called the " keymap " or the mapping between the physical keys on your keyboard and what the operating system prints out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately begin typing dvorak in all your applications . However it can be confusing to press the button labeled T and get a Y , so it is generally better , at least while learning , to give yourself some visual aids . What I did was print out letters on a piece of paper and then stick them to the keys using double-sided tape . Of course I was 14 or 15 and had a lot more time on my hands . For some people it might be enough just to have a printout of the layout by their monitor or keyboard , but there is something to be said for being able to look at the key and seeing what you 're going to type . What I do now , if I want to physically switch a keyboard over , is actually pop off the keys and put them back in the Dvorak positions . <p> This is much easier than it sounds , and probably takes about ten minutes . Of course be careful because sometimes the keys literally pop right off and might jump behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main disadvantage to doing this in that your home keys no longer have ridges on them and because of the bizarre way that keyboards are manufactured , on every keyboard Ive done this two the hook on back of the guide keys ( usually F and J on your keyboard ) is sideways to every other hook for every other key which means that to put those keys someplace else youd have to put them sideways , and whatever key you put in that position will also have to be sideways . This is n't as bad as it sounds because it actually serves as a new guide mechanism , but it looks a little funky . I cant think of a way to do this with a natural keyboard . You can buy keyboards designed for Dvorak , but for me it has never been worth the bother . I do n't  want to have to special-order my keyboard , I just want to pick up whatever is the coolest at the computer store . <p> My writing speed did not increase significantly . Although I could type faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was the way I formulate sentences in my mind , often thinking of several different ways to say something . However in situations where I can type without thinking too much , for example taking notes in class or at a conference , it has been a huge benefit and often I can keep up almost in real time with what 's being said . Of course if I stop to consider something or participate in class discussion I get behind but I think the advantage of actively participating in the class or conference outweighs whatever benefits I would get from having a transcription of it . <p> The big thing for me is comfort . I can now type for long periods of time with no fatigue at all , and that is n't even an issue I think of anymore . I cant point to anything scientific that says for every person Dvorak will be more comfortable , I just know its been a major improvement for me . <p> One advantage I do n't  think I have seen mentioned before is the security aspect . On my laptop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my personal information on it that might be in the hands of anyone . Let 's say that you knew my password , if you picked up my laptop you still would have trouble getting in simply because you would n't know how to type the password in Dvorak . In the grander scheme of things this might only be a minor deterrent , but its enough . In situations where I want other people to use my laptop I can configure a keyboard shortcut to switch between the two layouts transparently , but more often I do n't  even have the QWERTY keymap installed , simply because I do n't  want to switch back and forth accidentally . <p> It would be overly biased of me not to mention some of the disadvantages though . Nearly every problem Ive run into is n't so much a problem with the layout itself , but rather being a Dvorak user in a QWERTY world . Non-configurable keyboard shortcuts are often designed to be convenient on QWERTY and so when you 're under Dvorak they can be awkward . The most notable is X , C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , copy , and paste when used with CTRL , are no longer right next to each other and are instead all over the keyboard . I 've found it to be not that big a deal . Though I am still alright with typing QWERTY , I am often self-conscious while at other peoples computers , because as someone who is supposed to be computer savvy it must look bad to have to hunt and peck . Of course I may just be blowing it out of proportion . If I use QWERTY for anything more than a minute or two it comes back to me and I can at least partially touch-type again , but usually my exposure to it is much shorter than that . There might be something else that has slipped my mind , but those are the only two drawbacks I can think of . <p> I suppose it might be significant that I am the only person I know that uses Dvorak . At some point or another , I know that many of my friends and family have given Dvorak a try , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of possible reasons why , but I suspect with most is they did n't  feel like investing the time . For my it was a no-brainer because I knew that however long it took me to learn it would be incrementally paid for by the increased productivity and comfort in the future . Part of it may have been incentive though , and to make things interesting Im willing to spring for a prize . <p> I will buy a Logitech Elite Keyboard for the first person who switches from QWERTY to Dvorak ( and sticks with it ! ) as a result of this post . <p> The judging is completely subjective , but using Dvorak exclusively for more than a couple of weeks is good enough for me . <p> Funnily enough , this whole thing started out as a simple link/commentary post that was supposed to be about twenty words . Getting to that , there 's an article at Kuro5shin called An Argument for Dvorak that makes some good points . The comments , on par , are mostly useless or misinformed so I would n't weigh them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " On the Dvorak Keyboard Layout " <p> First off , I 've been away for a few days so I missed the switch to the new layout . Very nice ! <p> Ive been thinking of switching to Dvorak , after a lengthy conversation with a fellow programmer . I never learned to type traditionally , so switching from QWERTY will not be a major paradignm shift for me . As you say , its like learning a new instrument . <p> Perhaps a more accurate analogy would be learning a new video game that relies on the keyboard for movement . Its rarely long before the controls become second nature to the player . It all comes down to an individuals motivation . Most folks are lazy and resistant to change of any kind . <p> Your post inspired me to try the Dvorak layout even before you mentioned the prize . In fact , this comment is ( slowly ) being typed using the layout . As a side note , the instructions on the site you linked to for switching the layout were slightly incorrect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the languages tab and then hit details to access the setting . It think its worth mentioning that its really easy to switch back and forth layouts . Just hit ctrl+shift . Ack , this comment took forever to type . <p> Nice to see the perspective of another Dvorak layout user ! I also started using it about 5 years ago , after reading the hype and deciding to give it a shot . I had never learned to properly type in Qwerty I could n't make myself unlearn the bad habits I had started around 10 years old . When switching to Dvorak , I used the excellent ABCD course , which is just a simple web page . Since I was using the campus computer labs , switching the key caps was n't a realistic option for me , so I just kept a graphic of the layout in my user account . It took about a week or two of pain before I was typing proficiently , and Ive never turned back . <p> The only big problems I had with OS settings was in Win98 and older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fortunately , I do n't  use Windows very often , and the latest versions are n't  such a pain . <p> Interesting essay on the Dvorak system . Ive been thinking of switching forever , but I do n't  think its practical for someone who changes jobs and works on-site freelance a lot ( ie , on other peoples computers ) as I do . You suggest its " not too hard to switch " , but only say later that you were 15 years old at the time . I would suggest that its a lot easier to pick up new habits at 15 , as compared with age 35 or 50 . <p> I think no matter how old you are , its never too late to simply improve . The Dvorak layout is an improvement . Its a shame that freelancers that work on-site can face resistance to using a layout other than QWERTY . If were serious about not discriminating against people with disabilities , we should be serious about people who wish to prevent disabilities like carpal tunnel , etc . When they give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be obligated to make the Dvorak layout an option . In the age of computers , the " standard " keyboard simply no longer exists . <p> I switched to Dvorak about 18 months ago , prompted by the onset of RSI . My symptoms have now all but disappeared , though I 'm not sure how much of that is to do with the keyboard and how much is to do with the other measures that I took . At the time I was at university and had enough time to try it out . For the first two or three weeks it was agonisingly slow and frustrating , but after that I was able to type at a reasonable speed . I never bothered with sticking labels to the keys , I just got by with having a piece of paper sitting on my desk . Though perhaps if I had gone with the labels the process would have been faster . Now I have a job it is rather more inconvenient , when other people try to use my computer and get very confused , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having said this , I converted a couple of people at my work to using Dvorak , and I believe one of them is still using it , ten months on . There are so many people I know and work with who have had problems with RSI to an extent . Its a shame that Dvorak is n't more widely known about and used . <p> I have been using Dvorak for 1.5 years right now . I picked it up at 23 years old , and I must say it has improved my typing skills in general ( i never learned qwerty properly ) . Also the fatigue factor is really improved , that was my main motivation to switch layouts . The real hard thing is to explain to people in a qwerty world why you switched and explaining them what dvorak is in comparison to qwerty . I really liked your article and I think more should be written by Dvorak users if only to spread the word about it and perhaps convert a few of them : ) <p> I have been thinking of switching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference ! Only drawbcak : my girlfriend occasionally uses my computer = A couple of notes : the Siemens/Maxim Ergo Delta keyboard ( which I own ) is designed to be able to switch to dvorak ( and WAY cool ) Laptop keyboards are hell , especially the ones with a pointer integrated in the keyboard ( like mine ) , since many keys are one-of-a-kind Laptop users could pick up a TypeMatrix TM101 mini-keyboard which features both layouts <p> I tried Dvorak a few months ago . Maybe its a nice layout if you use QWERTY , but here ( in Belgium ) , we mostly use AZERTY . There are a couple of reasons for that : 1 ) because of the special caracters ( T , F , t , d , a ) ; 2 ) because everybody else in Belgium uses it . <p> I doubt that I could type as fast with Dvorak as with AZERTY in Dutch , because there are a lot of Dutch words that have a French influence . <p> I 'm a student and like every other student in school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keyboard layout every time I log on ( I think its blocked or so : Win2K ) . So we all use AZERTY <p> Came acrossed your site while searching for a Dvorak keyboard for my daughter for Christmas . Switched over to Dvorak two years ago at age 50 . I was unemployed and had time on my hands to learn new things , before being on the job with deadlines . My daughter learned too , at age 10 at the time . My daughter is running into problems at our present school ( rated one of the top school districts in TX ) from teachers who tend to pressure her to " conform " to QWERTY . They tend to resist implementing the keymapping features of the Windows operating system . A teacher has told her that she will run into problems when she gets to high school because all the keyboards will be QWERTY so she should drop Dvorak now . I told her do n't  worry about it , because by the time she gets to high school almost all students will be carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has to do is look down at the keyboard while she 's typing . Presently she 's typing 60-wpm on Dvorak , without errors . <p> Doe , nice story ! I would stick with it and shell be much happier in the long run . I used to get pain in my hands from typing QWERTY and I have n't had it once since I switched . The younger you learn , the better . Let me know what keyboard you end up going with for your daughter . <p> I learned dvorak well enough to get by on it . I peak at about 70wpm querty last time I tested . With Dvorak , I got over the initial hump of learning where the keys are . Although replacing the keys on your keyboard or rearrangin them can be handy , I found it a better learning experience to not rearrange the keys for the same reason I stopped looking at the keys on my querty keyboard when I was learning how to type . At some point in my learning , I was holding myself back by looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them again at one point . I have never looked back , and I 'm glad I did n't  . <p> I think the analogy of learning a new instrument is a good one . Learning dvorak is much easier after learning how to type on the querty keyboard . I 've learned how to learn how to type and so that makes it easier . But I still usually use querty . <p> I got up to about 35 wpm on dvorak . That was the point where I knew the location of the letters with my fingers . That 's where I am , and I havnt picked it back up again . The next problem you run into that may not have presented itself with such tenacity when you learned how to type the first time , is that your fingers have learned combinations which you no longer have to think about . Your hands have learned the combonations like a drummer is able to read complex combinations of rhythms quickly . Cognitive psychologists call this " chunking " . <p> Anyways , it would go quickly if I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me reconsider it . the stumbling block is just putting up with your speed when you are used to typing much more quickly . It certainly does have potential to be much faster . The current world record fastest typist , Barbara Blackburn can maintain 150wpm for 50 minutes . her world record speed is 212 wpm. ( http : **36;414;TOOLONG ) <p> I 'm 19 and I learned about the dvorak layout about 8 months ago . I do n't  even remember exactly how I stumbled upon it , but I read into a bit and decided quickly to try the switch . It was very hard at first because I was fast at qwerty ( about 90wpm ) . It took me a few months to start to get back up to speed on dvorak because I kept fighting with reverting back to qwerty . I just tested my speed today and I 'm still only up to 64wpm , with about 93% accuracy , but I wo n't give up ! ! <p> I in fact used a trial copy of Ten Thumbs Typing Tutor to learn the positions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 's all I needed ) , then I also used the ABCD course mentioned earlier on this page to practice . Anyway , I do n't  know if I 've noticed the benefits of switching to dvorak yet , but I 'm hoping it will be better in the long run . <p> great to find someone else using dvorak .. my typing is so much faster , more intuitive &amp; less painful since i switched about four years ago .. only three hours to learn .. with a printout of the keyboard on the desk so i never had to look at the keys <p> ( wrote my own set of words to practise the thing is you can type over 600 words using the dvorak home keys ie without moving your fingers , compared to around 60 on a QWERTY ) .. yay for us who know , suffer those who will not change <p> What was the result of the promised Logitech keyboard giveaway ( did I miss an update ) ? If it has n't  been claimed yet , I 'd like to do so . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still using Dvorak exclusively to this day . <p> I switched to Dvorak about whoa , has it really been almost 8 years ago ? I work as a paralegal and often was typing all day long . Even with a " natural " keyboard I was having pains in my wrists and forearms , so I said to heck with it , remapped my keyboard one day . I printed out a slip of paper with the Dvorak layout on it and taped it inside of my desk drawer where I could check it if I needed to I found it actually quite beneficial to not be able to look at the keys while typing , because I could n't cheat . It was about six weeks before I was as proficient with Dvorak as I had been with QWERTY . I picked up about 20 wpm in the process , too . = <p> Ergonomics as security this really does work . I invested in a switchable Kinesis keyboard ( which I absolutely love ) a couple of years ago . With my weird keyboard , funky trackball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never have a problem with anyone borrowing my workstation and screwing up my settings . <p> I have translated your text to German and would appreciate being permitted to put it on one of my web sites . I have written a German Dvorak keyboard driver that comes with installation program and everything , ready for download . My considerations have been identical with yours , I play saxophone and some other instruments . I converted to Dvorak three weeks ago ( although not because of your website ) . I have also written a German typing course to be used with KP Typing Tutor . If anyone wants it I can email it . When I have finished polishing it , it will go on my website too . <p> I thought like you did : " This thing is obviously right " . So I switchen from one day to another . That was the hard way , but there are things a mans got to do . <p> Ive been using this layout for 6-7 years .. I am pretty obvious in my office , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk . People think of it as an alien keyboard , but I think of it as a nice , well-worn glove . <p> I 'm wondering how you possibly type as quickly since you have to start with a whole new keyboard layout . I have been typing up all my stuff for 30 years my fingers automatically move in qwerty , and while they sometimes get pained ( on days with lots of keyboarding ) , I do n't  know if I could learn a new system and be as fast ( over 120 ) . I 'd have to think about where my keys are . <p> I switched over to Dvorak about four or five years ago , in part due to some carpal tunnel problems , and also because I wanted to see if it actually did increase my typing speed ( which was stuck around 70 wpm for some time ) . I figured if it ended up being a problem , I 'd just chuck it and stick with QWERTY . So I printed out a copy of the keyboard layout , taped it next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began typing . Painfully slow at first , but the speed came quicker than I dared hope . By the end of the first week , I was typing about 30 wpm not excellent , but at least my work was getting done . By the end of the second week , I was within shouting distance of my old speed . Now I type pretty much as the words come into my head ( " transparent typing " , I believe its called ) I have n't timed myself , but its certainly over 100 wpm , with very few errors . And my arm wearies from using a mouse long before I even get typing fatigue . <p> My job requires me to occasionally use some other keyboards , and those of course are QWERTY . I rarely have a problem with this . Since I tend not to use them much , I simply look at the keys as I type . I do n't  really have to read the letters on the keys simply being in this slightly different position sort of keeps me alert to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and so the T is up there now " . And yes , nobody uses my computer when Im gone everybody knows my computer is set " funny " , and they leave it alone . <p> How well do dvorak keyboards work under Linux ? I know how to switch layouts , but would n't Emacs be a little hard with all the new key positions ? What about commands like ls and mv , which are designed to be quick on QWERTY keyboards ? <p> I use dvorak under Linux At first it was quite hard because I used to remember the shellcommands by positions of the keys . But I relearned them in ca 1 month VIm took a bit longer , but I even use HJKL again ( although they are no longer in the nice positions they are on qwerty ) Regarding ls its surely slower now " l " " s " " return " all right-hand little finger , but after all how often is it the time i need to type " ls " which slows me down ? Only problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " instead of " quit " quite often <p> Just my own experiences with dvorak : I 'm 26 and have been typing since the age of 4 ( talk about ingrained ! ) on QWERTY but switched just recently ( about three weeks ago ) I use ( and have in my house ) just about all the popular OSs aroundand my biggest pain thus far has been switching all the other computers after I 've already gotten used to the new layout ( and passwords were no fun either ) <p> I 'm up to about 30 WPM , but I have no letters on any of the keys ( prefering to learn touch straight away ) I was recently taken aback by a power outage which put my main box ( linux ) back to console , where I was too lazy to get the console switched . I had half expected that I would give up again ( yes , I tried once in college ) <p> And my solution to the ls problem ? Well , t is the only post-switch alteration that I 'll ever do , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I tried to get a listing that I immediately aliased it . <p> I switched to Dvorak about three years ago . One thing that helped was getting a used IBM keyboard , one of the old ones that makes about as much noise as a typewriter . The advantage is that its keys are designed to be swappable , so you can switch to Dvorak ( or invent your own layout ) and not have to deal with either mislabeled keys or an uneven typing surface . For the home row index-finger keys I used part of a sticky label to cover half of each key . The disadvantage is that you ca n't type late at night without keeping everyone in your house awake . But as a consequence of the distinct touch and sound feedback ( you know when you 've pressed a key down all the way ) , my accuracy improves in Qwerty or Dvorak , compared to most keyboards . <p> At first , I was embarrased to be hunting and pecking whenever I used the computers at school , but after some time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to switch back and forth with very little trouble . <p> I lucked into a used Kinesis keyboard for 10 bucks which makes typing considerably more ergomic no matter what layout you 're using . ( The two hands are widely separated ; each hands keys are positioned in a literal bowl shape , so your fingers do n't  have to reach as far ; the keys are aligned in columns so your fingers do n't  have to move sideways ; keys such as Backspace , Enter , Ctrl , and Alt are under your thumbs , so your fingers never have to reach for them ; and wrist rests are built in which you can use comfortably without overstretching your fingers . ) It also allows one to switch between two different customized layouts at the touch of a button , which Ive set up as Qwerty and Dvorak . Now I do n't  even have to mess with software to switch layouts though the Kinesis keyboard still scares away anyone who might want to use my computer . <p> Because some applications I use have extensive keyboard shortcuts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ( to different USB ports the old Kinesis requires an adapter ) , and whenever I need Qwerty ( or , conversely , want to type more comfortably/fluently ) , I switch keyboards . Typing on the contoured Kinesis in Qwerty is something I 've never bothered to learn , and the Kinesis is different enough in other ways that if I want to use Qwerty keyboard shortcuts with enough frequency to give up Dvorak , I 'll switch to a regular keyboard . <p> Overall , I 'm much more comfortable and a bit faster on Dvorak than on Qwerty , although every now and then I fingers get " twisted " ( confused ) , particularly in words where every other letter is a vowel . But even if I were slower and/or less accurate ( neither of which I think is true ) , I would still prefer Dvorak , much as I prefer speaking to yelling when having a conversation and , to extend an already poor metaphor , I would even prefer speaking slowly to yelling quickly , given the choice though if anything I believe I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . I think I am getting better . This truly requires so much time and effort . I guess practice does make perfect with something like this . I will continue to type like this inside this comment because it is so much incredible fun despite the mental streingth required . It is so much fun and pain to do this as I slowly get better and look at the keyboard for non-existant clues . I am still having an inconcievab ( yes ! I found B on my first try . Ok ! I give up . I will keep trying to learn this evil language , but ( yay again ) I doubt I will get any better even though I realize this is the best thing since sliced bread and its brilliant box . Ah ! Why can I never find the I key . This is admittedly very very confusing . Done ! I am done with this at last ! <p> I think I am going to win the prize as I am determined to master the dvorak keyboard . I love it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed on the querty , I continue to use my dvorak board when time is not an issue . At least I can now touchtype and persistance will win out in the long run . I am most anxious to purchase a split keyboard and wonder if you know where I can find one . Thank you . Mary <p> Hi matt , I 'm just wondering how you delt the rearranged shortcuts . Did you end up using the mouse a lot ? Or did you get used to the new positions on the keyboard ? I heard that Apple computers have a Dvorak-qweryt layout . When you use the command key , the keyboard uses qweryt . Ever since I heard that , I 've been looking for a way to do that on Windows machines . <p> I read the history of the qwerty keyboard ; about how it was conceived back in the 19th century to deliberatly slow down the typists of that era who could easily outpace the old mechanical typewriters . Being a design engineer , my whole schtick is to figure out better ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for me ! I also imagine ( ha ! ) that someday I might attempt to write a book and thought that becoming a faster/more accurate typist would certainly help matters in that regard . So I began the re-training process . Do n't  let this sad tale discourage anyone who would like to become a DVORAK typist , but I found the process to be about the most difficult thing I have ever attempted . I had been a touch-typist on querty for about 15 years and before I could remap the muscle-memory and typing patterns in my brain , I first literally had to unlearn quertyrip those patterns and reflexes right out of my brain , as it was . I spent many hours with eyes tightly scrunched , teeth firmly clenched , and beads of sweat emerging from my forhead , forcing my fingers to extend out and find the dang B key ( or whatever ) by sheer force of will . Gaahh ! I struggled , swore , and sweated for about THREE YEARS before I finally became comfortable and fluent with the DVORAK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  regret the effort at all . I will certainly teach my children ( got the first one due in about a month ! ) DVORAK and if the teachers buck , theyll have me to deal with = DVORAK is so much easier and faster to usejust like the metric system , I strongly advocate adopting this superior system to all . <p> PS I have some labels which I found via Google which stick over the keys on my keyboard so that it now reads both the DVORAK and the QUERTY <p> I had always wanted to switch to Dvorak but it took meeting a coworker a couple years ago who typed in it to convince me to switch and I 'm glad I did . Contrary to popular belief , I have n't met anyone who types in Dvorak who claims its faster than Qwerty . I use Linux and there were a couple annoying things to get over about it . One was ls . The right pinky is already overloaded on Dvorak so I switched ls to t and ls -l to te . Another thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so using it in Dvorak was awful . The HJKL keys were in strange places and getting anything done quickly was not easy . I now use command mode in Qwerty and Insert mode in Dvorak . This works well and has the benefit of making me think in Qwerty so its never forgotten . I can still touch type on Qwerty about half as fast as on Dvorak now . <p> I switched to dvorak over the christmas period , at first it was allmost unbearable but by the end of a 3 week long stretch of typing on dvorak i had got rather good . <p> when i went into university after the break . i looked at all the keyboards and was lost . luckly i had forseen this and had bought a mini usb keyboard and had converted that to dvorak. there was a time when i 'd allmost got mavis beacon out to turn back into a " qwertyholic " but i am allmost at the level where i do not need to look at the keys on dvorak . <p> nowerdays , i seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now at the same level of typing ( if not faster ) , and with my skills of not looking coming into play , ill soon be able to use Dvorak on any computer without having to worry about lugging arround hardware . <p> P.S. i have customised the keymap for use with UK Keyboards. this means that shift+2 is now " ani shift+ is @ oh and the +- sign has made its way back on the keyboard = <p> if anyone needs any help with converting XP to what i would call " UK-Dvorak " please send me an email <p> Ive been using Dvorak for a couple of years now also . The thing I notice the most is how we type in words , not letters . The last time I did any DOS or UNIX navigation ( which I used to do a lot of ) was in the QWERTY days . So , even though I type Dvorak now , the " DIR " and " CD " commands come out as old finger motions . Then , I have to backspace and correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't typed in Dvorak before , because it takes a sec to start in out , as opposed to a word like " the " which just rolls off the fingers <p> I love it ! I write software for a living and decided to go for the change because it should be better and it was . I can type faster and more accurately and do n't  have other people using my computer ( qwerty keyboard , dvorak driver easy under Windows . ) The amount of finger movement is considerably less , although it dosnt help my spelling . I 'm 50 , but also stubbon so it was hard work to start with , particularly with no key caps to look at , but I got there in the end . I do n't  think that I would be able ( or want to ) go back to qwerty . Q : How do I get a uk layout I 'm fed up of Alt-156 for the pound sign ? <p> Matt : It was very interesting to read through the Blog . Ive been using a Dvorak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive ever known ; never learned QWERTY . I do n't  use any mechanical modifications to the board . Its just so much easier to use a Dv board that I simply touch type ; no looking at all . Actually , looking just confuses me . Too bad others do n't  see the value of it but , that 's their loss . <p> Ive been typing on a Dvorak layout since I learned it in 1997 . As I saw mentioned by an earlier reply , I too learned with ABCD : A Basic Course in Dvorak by Dan Wood . The Dvorak layout has taken me through the second half of university and the couple of jobs I 've had since . I 've always ensured that my PC at work has been configured to the layout . ( Since Windows has incorporated the keymaps in 2000 and on I do n't  even have to ask IT for help . ) I 've never changed the labels on my keyboard . Theyve been wrong since the day I switched . I never needed them . It works as a rudimentary sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . What convinced me to switch ? I read an article by Jared Diamond ( The Curse of QWERTY ) in Discover magazine ( April 1997 ) . I am a professional engineer and have always been interested in the most efficient ways of doing things . Incidentally I came across this page as I search for ways of incorporating a method of changing keymaps in Gentoo Linux so that my wife wont have any problems logging in . <p> I 'm still typing in Qwerty , but am recently in the process of switching over . I 've already worked on the Dvorak keyboard I bought for myself , and am ready to start . Im excited to know there are people out there testing this thing , and Dr. Dvorak is probably rolling over in his grave , loving what people are doing with his legacy . I love it ! Anyways , cheers to all the Dvorak switchovers , and to new typists ! I will be back to let you know how I do . Oh yeah ! I wanted to say that I 've typed a benchmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , let 's see how well I can do on Dvorak ! ! ! I cant wait ! ! I 'm such a typing freak ! Cheers all ! <p> Not only that , but switching to Dvorak makes you a babe magnet . The faster you type , the faster you can think of witty stuff . This makes you a killer chatter . Do n't  take my word for itjust look at the babe Matt ended up with . : ? ) <p> Dvorak is really , really great indeed . I 've only used the Azerty-layout a year before switching and have been using it for 10 years now . I also live in Belgium , but I strongly disagree with Ben . Typing in Dutch is also much more convenient with Dvorak than in Azerty/Qwerty and I think that 's true for any language because of the positioning of the vowels . Special characters can easily be composed with their keycode ( alt+number ) or a combination of keys . Especially when you program , the special characters are positioned brilliantly . I 'm an IT student , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who uses it and I have n't met anyone who had heard of it before . If you can stick with it for the first couple of weeks , you 'll thank yourself later ! <p> A simple , free , no-installation program for windows that runs in your tray and allows you to quickly toggle between QWERTY and Dvorak without changing any system settings . Activated mode is system-wide ( none of that per-application crap you get with toggling in Windows ) . It even has an optional OSD keyboard layout . <p> Hello Matt , its great to find a place where there is plenty of discussion about dvorak ive been a passionate user for around five years , because of better speed , accuracy , and comfort in my arms . i 'm surprised i did n't  find your post before , cos ive searched often . <p> another idea for people who have to share keyboards is to actually plug two separate keyboards in the machine , and keep one under the desk for when you need to switch , ( as well as use that great dvassist does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up a second hand usb keyboard for $5 . <p> i found it relatively quick to learn ( tho not easy , until i discovered the technique of printing out a keyboard and pasting it to the desk ( or monitor ) , so i never had to pick up my fingers to see the keys . This way , you remap your brain as you type . <p> the main advantage i reckon , when learning , is that once you 've learned the home keys ( only eight keys can take 2-3 hours ) , you already have over 600 crucial words ( only around 60 with the JKL ; version ) . <p> thanks again , its great to know there are other people making sensible choices and not afraid to buck the mainstream for their own comfort , michael <p> My mother is Barbara Blackburn , and I can say that I have been typing DVORAK for about 30 years . I still have the original Apple Computer that she was given to do the Apple Commercial back in 1984 . Wowa computer with the keyboardwhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still alive and kicking , not typing , but here . Sonya <p> Ive been looking up different typing tutors for the longest because I am HORRIBLE . Then I ran across this post randomly and I thought to myself , " Maybe this is what I need " . So I am going to try it ( get someone to switch up my keyboard for me ) and let you know how i fare . First though I have a laptop . is it a good idea to mess with the keyboards on them ? <p> The best reason not to use a Dvorak is that everybody should be able to switch to another persons keyboard without having to learn a completely new keyboard layout ( global ) standardization makes sense , even if it means that for some ( or even all ) languages the most frequently used letters are not placed ideally . If you had a specialized keyboard setting for each language depending on letter frequency etc .

I was working at home . Around age 55 I 'd also started using Dragon whenever I was mainly dictating text , and that eased the transition . Ca n't remember how many weeks I was frustrated by the new challengea few . Mostly I just slowed way down . I know it was a major brain reprogramming for me after making my living often as a typist for decades . At age 62 I 'm still slower than I used to be ( because of errors mainly ) but I 'm more comfortable typing and do n't  mind the loss of speed . <p> Hello again ! I wrote a comment here on January 17 , 2006 . Wow ! I was just in the very beginning of learning Dvorak . Well , let me tell you what a treat its been ! It took me about six months to learn it well , as opposed to Qwerty taking me a few years to attain a 75-85 average range with 101 peak wpm . In Dvorak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75-95 wpm , and I 've peaked many times into the 100s , with the highest at 114 . I went to college last fall and passed the typing class by the end of the first week , only because the first timing test was at the end of the week . I was to get 50 wpm to pass at the end of 8 months . That was nothing ! I also did a powerpoint presentation in computer technology class about Dvorak , and passed the class with an A+ because of it . My teacher was thrilled about my Dvorak . I love that I switched ! I still get the typical answers from people about why they would n't its kind of funny actually , but its okay . I enjoy it that 's the main thing . I 'm trying to recruit the young ones though . Anyways , cheers to all the Dvorak typists ! ! <p> I think I posted here a few months ago when I was just starting with Dvorak . If I remember correctly it took me about 5 minutes to type 2 sentences ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typing faster than ever ! I love Dvorak so much that I try to get everyone I know to convert , then when I ran out of people I started a blog to take the fight online ! ! ( using wordpress of course ) http : //typedvorak.com/ <p> I love the idea of switching to dvorak , i 'm constantly looking for ways to improve my speed , accuracy and comfort with typing . the only problem i am running into is trying to find a hardwired dvorak keyboard . my computer at work is a thin client running as/400 and i remotely connect to a windows machine , so changing the regional settings ( even if i did have access to them ) is out of the question . <p> I was rather hoping i could find a split ergonomic dvorak keyboard , as i have seen a couple of pictures of hardwired ones by dvortyboards , but they seem to be extremely rare in the 100$ and under price range . Right now it appears that my only option is the typematrix , which is obviously not split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially for the price . <p> Does anyone have any suggestions as to where i can find one that is n't going to hurt my hands or my wallet ? ? <p> Many thanks to Andrei Stanescu for the tip about Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator . I managed to use it ( its not entirely straightforward ) and I can now use Dvorak and have a - sign on my keyboard . This is very useful , thank you . <p> Now I just need to dig out Mavis Beacon and relearn touch typing from scratch . <p> Matt , I was just about to post something similar myself , then decided to browse Wikipedia to check a few facts , and that lead me to you . You seem to have said it all . I switched back in 2003 , although I never saw your post until today . The first year , I ran into many of the things you mentioned , plus locking myself out of my computer because unlocking the screensaver and logging in were done in two different layouts . For a long time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable typing . Cheers <p> I just stumbled across your essay , and this is terrific . I read that same article by John C. Dvorak in high school , and forced myself to use the layout while typing a paper ( with little stickers on the keys ) . By the end of the paper , I had it down pretty well and was hooked . I 've gotten a fair amount of grief from people who have no idea that there is more than one keyboard layout , and go nuts when they try to use my computer ( this includes my wife ) . But I always use Dvorak for typing tests and people are amazed at my speed ! I have no trouble reverting to QWERTY when necessary ; its just slower and more uncomfortable and reminds me how lucky I am not to be using it every day . Happy typing ! <p> I am quite proficient using the Qwerty layout of the keyboard , typing at and around 100 wpm with 97-100 percent accuracy using touch-typing . Upon seeing this article , I am quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am currently in high school at the age of 14 , and require using the computers often . Because I do not have administrative rights , I am unable to access the control panel and change the settings to Dvorak . I am also in a Word Processing class where I am required to type at at least 40 wpm . This is not a problem at all using the Qwerty layout , but I am not sure I could become proficient in Dvorak , let alone even get to use it on school computers . I am going to try to confront an administrator at my school , but I 'm probably the only kid here that even knows about this new way of typing . If anyone has any suggestions , I 'd be very pleased to hear from you , otherwise I guess I 'm stuck with Qwertying around for a while . <p> There was a moment after the first two weeks where I was typing some notes , slowly , painfully , in dvorak , and then something went " pop " in by brain ! I suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also immediately no longer able to type proficiently in QWERTY . <p> For those considering switching , it has definitely solved my RSI issues and the pain my wife was feeling in her wrists after she became pregnant . I was already typing quite fast on QWERTY , so my biggest gain was comfort . The thoughtfulness put in the layout means that some common words are just a joy to type , like playing a smooth piano piece . <p> As for the shortcut key issue , the only time that bothers me is when I accidently press Ctrl-W while wanting to press Ctrl-V , which is perilously close to each other and would accidentally close my windows . Ergonomically you are n't  supposed to be using crow-claw like formations to do your keyboard shortcuts , so switching to dvorak will actually help you do your computing in more comfortable ways . I highly recommend it . <p> Oh , and if I gave you the idea that I 'm now no longer able to type in QWERTY , I recovered that after I became comfortable in Dvorak . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keyboard , or laptop ) . I never lost the ability to type in QWERTY using my labeler or on a smartphone . The brain is a funny , wonderful thing . <p> hey . After years of knowing about Dvorak , I suddenly realised that 1 ) I plan to type millions upon millions of characters in the rest of my life ( I 'm 38 ) and 2 ) the rest of the world was n't going to switch for me . So I switched . <p> So two months ago I just changed the settings , and still have a qwerty layout , so no joy from looking down . I think that 's a good move . I 'm up to 43wpm but still feel like a fawn on the new layout , so I 'm confident of reaching 70wpm eventually , and crucially with so much less effort . <p> Older students of my boarding school told me about Dvorak layout and I was very eager to switch it . I have both QWERTY and Dvorak in my computer because a ) Some other people might use it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hotkeys which are way too familiar to me . But with the exception of game hotkeys , I otherwise always use Dvorak . <p> Had a bad car accident in 1984 . I was a production typist for court reporters . Returning to work was a killer on my neck . Thought of stopping work . Daughter saw an article in 1985 about Dvorak . Switched . Took a month . Before I was a fast typist at 80 wpm . Now I am well at 150 wpm . Changed jobs , but the new company let me change the keyboard at the Control Panel . LOVE IT . Wouldnt go back ! <p> I have switched to Dvorak yesterday , thanks to your encouragements , experience and tips . <p> Before switching , I typed 60wpm on Qwerty . I am left-handed , so the idea of 56% qwerty work fall on my left hand is fine to me . I learned that Dvorak typing , on contrary , put 50++% work on the right hand . <p> For software , I have download " Dvorak Assistant " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using TypingTutor 7 to learn Dvorak typing ( Typing Master Pro could also be used ) . I some time take Qwerty test to measure the decline of qwerty speed during Dvorak learning . <p> Some time ago , I read this post . After reading a couple of other Dvorak evangelizing articles from the Internet , I ventured to learn to touch-type with the Dvorak layout using a program called klavaro . <p> After a few weeks of diligent learning and re-mapping my fingers to the Dvorak , now I am happy to announce that I have fully switched to Dvorak for all things that I do on the computer ! . I must thank you for your post which lead me to learn Dvorak . Thank you photoMatt . <p> I 'm just learning Dvorak . Typing it joyfully slowly right now . This is my second day.no wait my third day . HahaI just wanted to go through the added rigamarole of typing all of this . I 'm loving the less-publicized combinationslike : ght , qu , ough. ppy , st , ts , umb , oa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at many other layouts prior and during this switch , and concluded that while the others have their merits , Dvorak keeps you in the home row or above more . <p> That makes a lot of sense to me . And the period key is in a great spot for me , for a key that ( unless you loathe punctuation as many seem to in this day ) will get a ton of use in every document . <p> I also feel that Dvoraks research was much more comprehensive than that which anyone is doing ( or has done ) in this " era " . Some have argued that the u and i keys should be interchanged , but Ive come to realize how short-sighted this is . First , I find myself typing ou more often than I type oi ( most base the move on using the i key much more frequently than the u key ) . However , Dvorak based much of the layout on the ability to type those frequently used combos . Also , should a person decide to customize too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them wherever they go . <p> One very important thing : Its not the worst idea in the world to make your password all numbers while you 're learning , in the event that your computer goes haywireif you 've ever seen haywire , you know what I mean . <p> NOTE : merely switching to Dvorak will NOT have the effect of making your computer go haywire . So do not use that as an excuse not to switch . <p> Also , I have read a lot about hte Macs support for Dvorak and I 'm a bit envious . However , there is the program Dvorak Assist that allows the toggling of the default layout between whatever you have set up ( other than Dvorak ) and Dvorak . <p> However , it has some hiccups in Win 7 64 bit . <p> And if someone decides to pick up development on this ( the creator has other priorities ) , perhaps they could also include some facility by which the user can choose whether to move the system shortcuts to the Dvorak keys , or leave them ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keyboard ) . <p> I hope so . If not , I will be " a toggling " per application . Which is n't terrible , but sometimes I 'd like to not have to do so .

@@98356058 @2556058/ <h> The TimThumb Saga <p> Last week there was a serious flaw found in the code behind TimThumb , an image re-sizing library commonly used in premium themes. * Because the code is commonly embedded in themes its not easy to discretely update like it would be if the code were a plugin , and even when a theme is updated people are hesitant to update because they often customize theme code rather than making child themes , so if they were to overwrite their theme with a new version theyd lose their modifications . That , combined with the severity of the flaw , means that this is one of the more serious issues in the WordPress ecosystem in a while , even more than normal because it was n't in core . <p> * I originally had a long rant here , but here 's the 13-word version : Ive seen no correlation between how much something costs and its code quality. - This is getting better as more people become familiar with the coding standards of core , and PHP in general , but there is still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in your own code , check out Theme Check and Log Deprecated Notices- to start . If you 're looking for code to base your own theme on , its best to start with something like 2010 or 2011 . <p> You should keep your rants in the post . I am neither a coder or techie , but I love creating sites . I have been a long-time WP user . For a while , I used to think the only way to get a quality theme was to pay a lot I was very wrong ! I have since learned a little coding , and with the forums , etc. , now just use 2010 or 2011 and modify it and the best part no expensive theme clubs ! <p> That 's sort of why I pulled the rant : I did n't  want people to see it as a blanket condemnation of paid themes and plugins . The core issue is education WordPress makes it easy for anybody to create a plugin or theme , and market success has more to do with visible elements , like design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code . <p> Because premium and paid products generally are bought more by users than skilled developers , they just have fewer eyes on them than something that was freely shared or in core . However as we create more resources and WordCamp sessions and videos and tutorials to help people up their skills and standards this problem will fade , so ultimately I 'm optimistic . <p> Is there someplace where you lay out the proper way for a consultant to make money on their efforts ? If not paid themes or plugins ? <p> It seems that you are saying that group coding is better than paying an individual or business , giving them a reason to care about the quality of thier code ? <p> Or maybe that a wordpress project is wordpress core developers + the end user with no developer middle man ? <p> Is it really your position that third party developers with a smaller client base are a " problem " that will be resolved by the wordpress core giving end users all the solutions they need to do it themselves ? <p> I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just havent run across it in a coherent form yet . <p> The point I was trying to make is its totally fine to charge for themes or plugins under the GPL , and lots of contributors to WordPress do , but you should n't assume that just because you pay for something that its code is higher quality . <p> I can understand that . I know I had a couple of themes using Tim Thumb and they want you to set one or two folders to 777 which is always a dangerous practice . In fact , with the PHP my host uses , the highest permission you can grant is 755 . I never really understood why they used it , either . The normal WP media library re-sizes and NextGen Gallery works as well . Hopefully , V2 will fix all the issues with T. Thumb ! <p> Do n't  get me wrong , I would prefer that everybody used it since that would make my job easier . <p> There are two things that need to change in WordPress core before I think timthumb will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy way to get the attachment i 'd based on a url . Many existing themes had to role their own featured image(s) functionality and they used urls and not attachment ids to do this . This is the case with one site I 'm doing some work on now and it ha forced me to use timthumb . <p> 2 . WordPress needs to be willing to resize images at run time . If I pass a custom size I expect wordpress to give me an image with said dimension . Instead it will try and give me something close if it exists , I 'm sorry but you can not develop a site if images varying by hundreds of pixels . Instead if you want a specific size you have to add it to the list of image sizes and wordpress will resize new images for you when they are uploaded . No dynamic runtime resizing for you Mr. dev . So instead you have tons of resized images but none of them what you asked for . <p> I 'd like to see WP take up some more of NextGens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do know from hearing at several WordCamps in the past couple weeks from a couple core developers that there is interest to optimize the media section of WP in the future . <p> My main point was with all the site hacking due to php injection , neither Tim Thumb nor any other script should ask or expect you to set permissions to 777 . Luckily the sites I have that do use Tim Thumb seem to run O.K. with permissions of 755 . <p> The WP Media Library needs to be greatly overhauled . Its crazy that at the moment the only way to create galleries in pure WP is adding multiple images to a post/page . And then you cant re-use them in other posts or pages . <p> As for the developer As Daniel says , there 's holes there too . For many devs , TimThumb is a godsend . Personally I do n't  like it , but for those of us who do n't  , we have to go looking for other PHP image processing solutions . Be interesting to know just how many custom solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can bag TimThumbs all we like , but it proves unequivocally there is a need , and I believe a need that WP itself should be meeting . <p> Matt wrote : " If you 're looking for code to base your own theme on , it 's best to start with something like 2010 or 2011 . " <p> That is egotistical , extremely presumptuous , entirely belittling to code developers everywhere . The people who develop TwentyTen and TwentyEleven are not by an intergalactic longshot the only people capable of writing quality secure code . <p> If you have any other suggestions feel free to drop them in the thread . I 'm just saying two that are widely available and that I personally endorse . Theyre reviewed not only by the entire core team but by the larger community of WP developers active on Trac , which is n't common . <p> I wholeheartedly agree with Matt that both TwentyTen and TwentyEleven are great code bases to to start your themes on . This is why naked themes are so popular . Speaking of which , I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance ! <p> TwentyTen and TwentyEleven utilise many of the core and newly released features of WordPress . Its always better to learn from these themes so you do things the WordPress way rather than another way e.g. TimThumb = <p> As Matt said you 're getting the best coders , security and UI people reviewing these themes so they are excellent themes to start with ! <p> Mark , I did n't  read it that way . After using Thesis , Genesis , Connections , Journalist , &amp; Thematic ( &amp; others ? ) , having a couple of " canonical " modern themes which are officially " blessed " by both core and community is a relief . <p> When I saw the notes on TimThumbs flaw , I had made a patch for my own clients who chose specific frameworks that use it . I do not use it myself , but I am really glad of the quick response and teamwork on fixing the issue . Thanks for the update , Matt ! <p> " If you 're looking for code to base your own theme on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 2011 . " <p> I totally agree . I made a child theme of 2011 for my blog recently and I did customize it easily and quickly . I 'm not a designer . I just wanted a unique theme for my blog. 2011 was the best option to base my theme on . And I 'm glad I chose it . I learned a lot of new things about CSS , too ! <p> 1 ) WordPress is a tool that is provided to the public without charge , 2 ) It is a product that saves me incredible time in building a blog or website ; eliminating the need for scratch coding while still allowing the use of child themes for customization , 3 ) response to this issue was immediate and effective , and as pointed out , especially valuable as the community was/is so involved : is n't that the point of " free software " ? <p> I suppose that anyone that has taken issue with this should probably take the time to write their own code and not rely so heavily on the amazing work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WordPress . <p> IGIT Related Posts thumb I guess is the first victim of this vulnerability . It used timthumb and its latest update injected code into wordpress files . It took me a while to remove the code .

More than sixty that number astounds me ! Automattic has grown so far beyond what I originally imagined and every day I 'm amazed by my colleagues and the things they create . Today were growing in another way : Automattic has transferred the WordPress trademark to the WordPress Foundation , the non-profit dedicated to promoting and ensuring access to WordPress and related open source projects in perpetuity . This means that the most central piece of WordPresss identity , its name , is now fully independent from any company . <p> This is a really big deal . <p> I want to recognize and applaud the courage and foresight of Automattics board , investors , and legal counsel who made this possible : Mike Hirshland , Phil Black , Tony Conrad , Toni Schneider , Gunderson Dettmer . I 'd also like to thank Matt Bartus of Dorsey &amp; Whitney for their counsel on the Foundation side . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its not often you see a for-profit company donate one of their most valuable core assets and give up control . However , I know in my heart that this is the right thing for the entire WordPress community , and they followed me on that . It was n't easy , but things worth doing seldom are . <p> When Automattic registered the WordPress trademark back in 2006 , we were a small startup of a few people : a business founded largely to enable us to work on WordPress full-time instead of hacking around our day jobs . A lot has changed since then somehow along the way we ended up with an audience of a quarter billion people but a lot has stayed the same . Were still a group of people in love with WordPress and free/open source software and were lucky to have figured out a way to contribute to the world and flourish as a business while doing it . <p> Automattic might not always be under my influence , so from the beginning I envisioned a structure where for-profit , non-profit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for me to know that WordPress will be protected and that the brand will continue to be a beacon of open source freedom regardless of whether any company is as benevolent as Automattic has been thus far . Its important to me to know that we 've done the right thing . Hopefully , its important to you , too , and you 'll continue your support of WordPress , the WordPress Foundation , and Automattics products and services . We could n't do it without you ! <p> Congratulations Matt for taking such a decision . I 'm really interested in the way WordPress Foundation and Automattic are living in harmony to make a project as great as WordPress possible . <p> I 'm interested because I also run an opensource project called Piwigo ( photo galleries in PHP ) , I own the trademark ( registration in progress ) and I own a company who tries to generate profit based on Piwigo and a Piwigo foundation also exists . Needless to say that such a decision will certainly influence me concerning trademark ownership ! <p> I agree with that Lori . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my feeling is that the way Matt manages the WordPress project partly explains the success WordPress has met in the recent years , beyond WordPress features . <p> Awesome , Matt . I know you will continue to build great things ( and eat great food ) for many years to come , and doing this is simultaneously ballsy , the absolute right thing to do , and very much appreciated . I know very few leaders and especially biggish companies would have the willpower to do this , even though they might talk about it . <p> Wow . Glad I read this post . I previously did n't  realize the WordPress domain name policy . I had a site registered as MauiWordPress.com . Just transferred and redirected that to MauiWP.com . My question now is , what about Twitter and Facebook ? I have @MauiWordPress on twitter and MauiWordPress Facebook page . Should I disable those as well ? I 'm definitely a WP fan and want to be compliant and not mislead folks , so glad to cooperate <p> Congrats , Matt ! I 've always been interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ org/foundation relationship . The trademark transfer is a huge deal which should solidify the legendary WordPress brand . I wear the WordCamp shirts with a little more pride starting today ! = <p> If you may divulge , what were the general terms to the trademark handover ? Obviously Automattic gets exclusive ( transferable ? ) rights to continue using the mark . Any other interesting mentionable points ? Again , congrats for making it happen ! <p> Correct WordPress.com ( Automattic ) and . net/.org ( me ) are grandfathered in as part of the transfer , so theyll continue to operate as before , but no special rights for any new domains which would need to go through the Foundation just like anyone else . I 'm not really worried about that as there are no plans to call anything new " WordPress . " <p> Congratulations Matt and everybody that had a hand in this . It might be a very small step on paper , but it is yet another example of the way the WP community has shown itself to be an innovative leader of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural consciousness in a positive direction for all . <p> Congratulations Matt on the great move . Not only has your work provided the online community with an invaluable tool but your foresight and dedication have ensured that the work will endure . <p> Ill also add , I 'm sure that this will in turn give substantial commercial return from a branding point-of-view , you have essentially managed to bulletproof and lock-in your identity for indefinite period and at a market leading price . <p> Good job , thanks Matt ! Its great to see you protecting WordPress(.org) against the future unknown ( including yourself ) . It really shows that you think WordPress is more important than just one person , or company . <p> I do some work for a " not-just-for-profit " company that makes and hosts fundraising software for non-profits and charities . A few years ago , ownership of the software was transferred to a 501(c)3 charitable foundation . It was a tremendous amount of work and a lot of new ground for lawyers to work through . There were many who thought transferring control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the values and goals of the community we serve into the ownership of that core was simply the right thing to do . <p> All that to say I understand a little bit of the effort and character that goes into a move like this . Thank you for being willing to do all it took to make that important step . <p> that 's amazing news ! Does it bring you great joy to do stuff that 's , a lot of times , the exact opposite of what most minds think of doing these days ? Fear not , the WP foundation and community will see to it that the name " WordPress " shall echo in eternity . <p> Deja vu , I just randomly googled " echoes in eternity " ( with quotes ) , and found the first result to be " Echoes In Eternity is powered by WordPress 2.2.2 " ( www.echoeseq.com ) <p> This is what I love about WordPress and all open source projects that let the community truly own not just the code but the project itself . Many thanks to Automattic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 05 and and recall when the WP brand came into being . I am very confident this will encourage the WP community to continue express their generosity as well . <p> This sound like a great step forward . I totally can not live without wordpress and I 'm glad to see that you have made moves to prolong and extend its longevity . Bravo . Ive been a WP user sine 2006 and Ive seen it grow to an international phenomenon . <p> You have been my role model for ages , the way you have changed the world , using open source , and then , when you could still make profit , you decide to pass this onto a charity , making a difference to the world , protecting your trademark , whilst removing any future personal gain . <p> You were my role model since I even knew about WordPress , and I just think , from the perspective of a 12-year-old , you are a true awesome , cool and terrific man ! Plus you 're under 30 , and you have made such a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are probably only one of the businessmen I know that maintains a blog , with open comments , and sets the time out of your busy schedule , just to maintain user interaction , and for us to see a different , informal approach ! You are a truly awesome person ! <p> Thanks for all of your hard work , Matt . WordPress is just freaking amazing . I 'm celebrating my one year anniversary of being on the platform and my only regret is that it took me so long to see the light . <p> Automattic is a rapidly growing profitable business with more than 65 employees and tens of millions of users . = The WordPress name is hugely valuable but this has nothing to do with taxes ( which are n't  a concern or most startups anyway because they re-invest all the money they make ) . <p> You continue to demonstrate to entrepreneurs everywhere that success in todays environment is about authenticity and doing what 's right .. not necessarily what would be assumed to be profitable or " smart business " . <p> Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I really appreciate all that you do and what you 've achieved ( with no interest in taking credit for any of it ) . <p> Woow ! ! ! Great , Matt ! This is incredibly unbelievable . You have surely set a precedence in the entire open source community and the world at large . <p> I was recently hurt by Java and MySQL being taken over by Oracle . It has caused lots of confusion and we only wait to see what the future holds for the two . <p> However , with such a great move for WordPress , even though the community was certain that WordPress was safe , it is even more certain . Thanks so much for your brave decisions . May WordPress and the community continues to grow and grow .

@@98356071 @2556071/ <p> In 2005 Automattic was small . Through some miracle I had convinced Donncha O Caoimh , Andy Skelton , and Ryan Boren to leave their safe jobs , join a company with almost no money in the bank run by someone with no experience , and whose core idea was to give away and open source all our core IP . There were more questions than answers . Would a hosted version of WordPress move beyond the geek appeal the OS project had ? How would the virtual company with no office work ? Could we develop a service alongside an OS project without screwing both of them up ? Should I raise money ? Most importantly , would it scale ? <p> In 2006 we developed a series of answers ( sometimes hard-learned ) to those questions . WordPress was obviously limited by its installation requirements when it was added as a one-click to web hosts and when WordPress.com ( and other MU hosts ) made it simple to get a blog the popularity grew beyond what I could have ever imagined . In the WordPress.org world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.0 and 2.1 a personal failure but after that initial bump the development really picked up and the community and usage exploded . There have been 5,880,790 downloads of WordPress.org since Automattic started . ( 3,852,554 in the past year alone . ) <p> We ended up raising a small amount of money ( 1.1 million ) to allow the company to take some risks without worrying about payroll but we ended up using very little of that capital because revenues grew quickly , allowing us to remain break-even even as the team scaled to 18 full-time folks and a number of contractors . Toni Schneider left Yahoo to join as CEO , a partner I could n't imagine getting along better with , and we started to look like a real company despite having no office and some of us never meeting in person . <p> Fast forward to 2007 : many of the seeds planted started to really bloom . On WordPress.com 1.8 million new users joined , they created 25 million posts , we served 3.2 billion dynamic pageviews , and grew to reach over 100 million unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogs . Nearly every major media organization , from the NY Times , WSJ , CNN , Fox , Time , People , and more , have embraced WordPress . Finally the approach of serious acquisition or majority-stake investments brought up the biggest question wed faced so far : should we sell , or build out Automattic to be an independent company for many years to come . <p> That decision actually was n't hard . I could n't stop thinking about the opportunities and it became clear that the road ahead was much longer than the road behind us . <p> That brings us to today . The New York Times , the flagship of media , is joining our existing investors Polaris , True , and Radar in expanding their minority stake in the company . Automattic is now positioned to execute on our vision of a better web not just in blogging , but expanding our investment in anti-spam , identity , wikis , forums , and more small , open source pieces , loosely joined with the same approach and philosophy that has brought us this far . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'm very much looking forward to seeing what trails you blaze in the near future . <p> The impact of unseen positive forces ( things like your mother doing the laundry ) can sometimes go unnoticed until they go away . I think Akismet is like that in a lot of ways . I wonder if blogging would have survived if it had been allowed to succumb to the spam that was beginning to plague it . For that , along with many other things , thank you . <p> My personal wish for Automattic to take on with this new funding is wikis I 'd love a wiki with the trademark Automattic simple sensibility and Akismet baked in ! <p> It gives me such a warm fuzzy feeling to think " I knew you when " It seems like only yesterday when WordPress was just a dream without even a name those stats are AMAZING . I 'm just so proud to say I know you . <p> Its good to know that the team leading WP development will still be free of making their own decisions for the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things , as a new investor can only mean good thing to the future of WP as the blogapp/CMS of choice . <p> When I first tested a whole range of blog software and CMSs back in 2005 I found a certain rightness about WordPress that others did n't  have . It just worked , it was easy to grasp , and it was modern . Since then we started to implement it for client sites and had tremendous satisfaction levels , at lower costs . So we decided to put everything into building up what we do with the system . <p> It looks like our faith was well founded , and that the big players are really noticing . So again , well done = <p> I do have to say its been fun to watch WordPress and wheres it going . Watching WordPress in the baby days of " what 's a single page ? " to " are we calling them " folders now ? " to " what 's SEO ? " all the way up to " oooo we have an API for plugins now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but its been fun . <p> As distant as I am in the journey , I 'm glad I could be part of it and watch the history of WordPress progress . <p> You know , people look at me weird when I tell them I blog on sco.tt , so your new name will help me , too . Thanks ! <p> I blog on a different ( gasp ) platform because I could n't figure out how to get a weird TLD to map on WordPress . Now I 'm guessing that 's been fixed ? Please let me know , I 'd love to switch back to WordPress . <p> Congrats ! Its good to see that with great efforts , come great rewards . Makes me all giddy inside , as Im about to launch my own company next Monday , which happens to be my birthday . Talk about rebirth ! = <p> I have been following the development of WordPress &amp; Automattic during the last few month I am am pretty excited . It seems that Open Source is more than just Linux . For me WordPress is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it is easy to install , easy to maintain and the plugin-system actually works . So it is also possible for " newbees " to set up a site that matches a professional one , when it comes to design , funcitonality &amp; SEO . <p> I believe that looking , back in a few years , the coming age of the CMS ( for everyone ) will mark the turning point in the use of the Internet . Ultimately , true freedom of information can only be attained if people can undependently publish their thoughts ( okay let 's leave the search engine argument for a while ) , in a way that they will also be found ( thanks to stuff like wpSEO &amp; simpleTagging ) .

@@98356072 @2556072/ <h> Working &amp; Exercising <p> One benefit of working from home that does n't  get discussed much is the ease of small , but frequent exercise activities through the day . I 'm sure its not outlawed in an office to get out of your chair and do 20 jumping jacks , or plank for a minute , I definitely would feel awkward doing so . This is something on my mind as I 'm working this week around 400 colleagues for our once-a-year Grand Meetup . <p> When I 'm home and have a ton of work to get through , my favorite approach is the Pomodoro Technique with 25 minutes on followed by a 5 minute break . ( I use this app but any timer will do . ) The 5 minute break is a fantastic time to do something small , like a few push-ups , squats , a plank , or even meditate . ( The new Pause app is cool , and of course I love Calm . ) You do n't  have to do a ton , but over the course of a day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite a bit and can kickstart a Tiny Habit . And do n't  even get me started on the benefits of naps . <p> Again , not something that 's impossible in an shared office , just feels a lot more natural and less embarrassing in your private home office . <p> Could not agree more . I either work in blocks of 25 minutes followed by a 5 minute break or 50 minutes with a 10 minute break . It seems counterintuitive at first to take so many breaks but I find I actually get so much more done when I take regular breaks . <p> I like to use the pompdone app ( pomodoneapp.com ) on my desktop so that I can link it with todoist , that way I know exactly which task I need to be working during each session . <p> I agree working from home can make taking exercise breaks easier . For me , that includes playing with a cat with a teaser wand , playing with a dog by throwing around balls or playing tug-of-war , and also going outside to feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also like to think while either pacing or walking outside . Those all would be hard to do working in a conventional office . <p> Treadmill workstations are another option to bring work and exercise together . The human body seems to be adapted to be in one of several positions such as lying , swimming , walking , climbing , and squatting and sitting in a chair is probably not yet one of them . <p> For several years , I 've had DIY treadmill workstation set up I put together using a conventional treadmill with a board across the handles for a keyboard and trackball facing a wall with shelves with LCD monitors on them . I find the rhythm of walking at about 0.5 mph to 1.0 mph can even help sometimes with concentration ( a bit like some music ) , although there are other times when I find walking is a distraction ( same as music sometimes ) . A tall stool let 's me switch between walking , sitting , and standing . I have not been using the treadmill much lately though , including to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in decades at my kids friends birthday party at a roller rink ) . I 've also since learned that walking barefoot on a treadmill is probably not a good idea for me because it can cause foot problems compared to walking with good shoes . I 've also had a knee sometimes bother me , possibly because of the quality of the treadmill deck and also again walking barefoot . The focusing distance to monitors can also be problematical as it is beyond reading glasses but not quite distance , especially for older eyes . I asked my eye doctor to give me a special prescription for the right distance for those monitors ( about three feet away ) although I still find using a laptop is increasingly easier now for focusing for me . There are also commercial treadmill workstations where a desk can rise and lower and the treadmill deck is softer and the motor is designed specifically for walking at lower speeds . Those commercial setups also can accommodate a laptop in a way my DIY setup ca n't . My DIY setup also had several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise probably related to the base cheap treadmill just not being designed well . <p> Such workstation are also not for everyone . I set one up for my wife at the same time in her office , but she does not find she can type on hers while walking . She uses hers mostly as a standing desk . She generally only walks when on a phone call or watching a video ( whereas I never walk when on a call for some reason ) . She also found focusing even more of a problem than I did early on , probably due to having bifocals and focus distance moving somewhat while walking . Standing desks can be good as far as increasing exercise just by maintaining balance . However , standing a lot in one place can cause blood pooling in the legs unless you 're always shuffling around or moving in other ways as a habit .

I also am too shy to do planks or push-ups . Rock on , work-at-homers ! <p> I switched last year from working nights/weekends , not sitting , barely any bathroom breaks ( I am an RN ) to my position in Clinical Informatics .

Stretching and trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sound optimal . <p> I recently switched to a standing desk , and I 'm using an old yoga mat to cushion my feet .

I 'm also seeing a mental improvement standing too . <p> A very motivating post , Matt ! I 've found that short , 10- or 15-minute intervals work well when confronting unfamiliar or " difficult " pieces of music . The short duration helps me plow through procrastination and " jump start " my mind . By the time the timer beeps , I 'm hooked and ready for more .

Generally when things beep annoyingly its one of the UPSes which like to complain loudly after a power outage . The one at my desk and at the closet both had a weird light on back saying " Building Wiring Failure .

( Which reset all of the thermostats to 62 , a chilling fact I realized the next day . ) <p> Eventually , I realized the beeping wasnt coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke detector in my office . I stood on a wheeled chair and sure enough there was a 9-volt battery in there that looked pretty dead , yet it was still wired into the wall in a way I could n't disconnect easily . Now that the problem was identified , I just had to find a 9-volt battery ( I did n't  have any ) and everything would be okay . <p> That was three days ago . Since then , I came to live with the beep . I found that if I closed the office door and my bedroom door I could n't really hear it while sleeping , any more than a cricket chirping . I took calls in my living room instead of my office . Even sitting at my desk , not 5 feet from the smoke detector , I was able to get productive work done with the beeping like a minutely metronome that was hardly noticable .

Were going to spend all day dragging desks around . After that , its time to call the carpet steam cleaner people and get them to clean the carpet . <p> 2 ) I got the speakers on my desk here in a bankruptcy closing ( long story . ) They came with a large cachet of other stuff we got .

Four machines just stacked on top of each other ( not to mention a pair of switches , wireless router , and DSL modem ) , and if something needs to be done to the bottom machine , I have to unhook everything above it , move them out of the closet ( about 4 feet high , so none too good for the back ) , do the work , then move the other machines back into the closet and plug them all back in .

I think these things never get addressed because its more interesting to push forward than it is to clean up what is already built . <p> On the hard wired smoke detectors thread : I woke this am at 2am to the shrieking noise of one going off . Odd , because it was not my expensive alarm system which has a different sound . ALSO odd , because when you have 2 stories and 2 on the 1st floor with an 18 foot ceiling and 3 on the 2nd floor , when one goes off , it all echoes like when they chirp and makes it hard to tell which one it IS ! <p> So I went around and took each battery out ( not realizing they were not chirping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix it . 20 minutes later , another 30 seconds of 120 decibel shrieking ! ! ! OK , now I was mad . And I went downstairs to the one I thought was doing it and took it all down then to realize it was hard wired . They ALL are ! <p> So my question is : Is this caused by ONE of them being bad and if it can be isolated it alone has to just be replaced ? Or does it screw up the rest setting them off also if it is some short in the system feeding them ? I am hoping it is the one bad one and I can just replace it . <p> Another night like last night and I 'll rip them all from the ceiling , except I do n't  want to risk a fire with alot of bare wires dangling . I DO have a heat-smoke central alarm system that works fine and would alert me to smoke , but I 'd rather not risk it . <p> Any input including " Call a dam electrician dude , " would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are in the same room when it goes off and dead asleep , it could cause some health issues with some people it is such a startle .

I feel like when pixels disappear there 's less of a wall between people and the technology , it starts to blend and meld a bit more . Its something I 've been personally passionate about since the first retina iPhone , tirelessly beating the drum at Automattic to make everything we do shine on hi-DPI screens , or leading the WordPress 3.8 release that brought in MP6 project to make- WordPress aesthetics cleaner and vector-based . <p> I 'm sitting in front of a Retina 5k iMac right now typing this to you .

" Translation : Its not comment spam if were getting paid for it . <p> I was just reading some comments the other day and thinking how itd be great to see some sponsored brand content there instead of users , like there already was on the rest of the page . Glad there 's a solution for that on a global basis now . <h> Related 14594 @qwx874594 <h> 40 thoughts on " Disqus Spam + Ads " <p> This is disappointing but not surprising . Why do WordPress bloggers elect to use something other than the already built in commenting system ? I 've never understood that but then again I 've never been in it for the comment counts or advertising revenue . I 'm no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade . JetPack and Akismet manage my comments just fine . the rare times people these days decide to leave a comment that is. = <p> I think the main reason folks use non-native comments is that systems like Disqus offer more features . Remember that Jetpack is not the " built in commenting system " its very similar to Disqus in functionality , and if Automattic wanted to , they could profile Jetpack comment users in the same way that Disqus is profiling their users . I do n't  see Automattic doing this , as they have other revenue streams , but from a technology standpoint the systems seem very similar . <p> I guess one main reason why I use Disqus on the majority of my sites is to somehow lessen the number of people commenting just for the backlinks . I 'm so sick and tired of people saying " nice post " when its so obvious they did n't  even bother reading . <p> I was n't sure about your own URL in that regard , which Ive removed . It is tough when you get comments from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that across every platform including Facebook . <p> I 've heard people say this before but have n't seen any data that Disqus is actually faster for users , seems like its loading a lot of code ( and now ads and tracking ) from a third party which is going to be slower and bigger than anything on-site . I could see if you were doing static page caching and did n't  want comments to invalidate that , which any JS-included solution would help with . <p> If you do n't  sync , though , you lose your data . The fact you can sync is actually one of their better features . I 'm actually a big fan of the Disqus *product* , just not this business model . I wish more companies would have the courage to really try for a non-ads route , at least at first . <p> My main experience with Disqus is a spinning loading circle , during which not only can I not comment , but I cant see any other comments . At least with WordPress , the comments are there . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit I also get embarrassingly confused with the arrangement of comments and the upvoting . Knee jerk ? I assume the top comment is the first , and then on down the line . Disqus confuses the heck out of me . Its a silent shame . <p> And this is why I use Ghostery in Firefox . It blocks Disqus by default . Strange that companies like Disqus would probably decry the privacy practices of the US and other govts yet deem it fine that they build deep profiles . <p> It is good to keep in mind that when a service is free , you are not the customer , but the product . That is not necessarily a bad thing , just make sure you understand the business model of that service . <p> Wil very good point ! ! My free WordPress.com blogs run ads on my site to generate revenue . I 'm ok with that . Better than having to pay for monthly hosting on old content that I 'm just archiving on the freebie site . <p> I do n't  like how some websites use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions . When you make comment you have confirm that via a link . Some websites even ask you to create a login to comment . You do n't  get to choose for email notifications between all comments or reply to your comments . Disqus solves all these problems . Its consistent across networks . <p> " When you make comment you have confirm that via a link " I 'm not sure if I ever experienced this in my life . <p> And I do n't  see anything wrong with websites that require you to register in order to comment . Those site owners want to focus on regular readers and that 's not a bad thing . Regular readers = high quality comments = interesting discussion . <p> The native WordPress comment system is ok but I was getting like 30,000+ spammy comments per month ! Now that I have started using disqus the spam comments I get to dat is 0 . <p> Also due to the spammy comments I was getting using wordpress default system that have a major affect on server and user experience . Thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use them for some time to come . Also if I can opt out not to show comments ads I will . <p> It is worth mentioning that Disqus has , by far , the best comment-voting system and that did not happen by accident , I have seen first-hand how they sweat the details . For blogs of certain types , with a certain size of audience and more geared towards lengthy discussion , the advantages are sufficient to justify the use of non-native comments . If a WordPress plugin offered the same commenting experience , most sites using Disqus would switch to that . <p> LiveFyres Sidenotes , which allows users to leave comments next to a particular paragraph ( similar to comments on Medium.com ) is another example of a feature that simply can not be replicated using currently available WordPress plugins , so , for sites that need that , it is good that LiveFyre makes it possible . <p> Many see comments as unimportant , I completely understand why some chose not to enable them , but I believe they are have been an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am somewhat disappointed that they have not been the focus of more innovation , so , I welcome the efforts of commercial companies are . <p> I do agree , however , that " sponsored " comments are a step too far , it will be interesting to see how sites using Disqus react . <p> I really want to like the Medium-esque sidenotes commenting method , but it feels like fisking to me . I 'd rather they waited until the bottom to comment , having read the whole thing in case I foolishly buried the lede . <p> Yes , I agree that traditional end-of-post commenting is best for most types of content but there are specific types of post that can benefit from the ability to tie comments to specific words , sentences or paragraphs . <p> For example , I used WordPress and Sidenotes to make a simple proof-of-concept website , at RedPen.com , that allows people to post any text they want their friends to proof-read for them . <p> I am pretty sure that many more useful uses for side-commenting will emerge once people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would love to see many more plugin developers turn their attention to comments . <p> Matt , I think the self install version of WordPress core needs to have better support for logins , **27;452;TOOLONG self-moderation and broader moderation terms . A commenter I might want to watch is n't necessarily a spammer . Having a watch list or other functionality would help me get away from Disqus or recommend it for clients . I love being able to tell clients that a commenting systems allows the community to self-police , including unpublishing of comments with a flag count of x . Disqus wins on interface , ease of installation and usability . But the privacy price for that is clearly getting higher . <p> Comment moderation is a huge issue for large sites with active communities and explains , to some degree , the success of Disqus . <p> Having robust community management built-in would go a long way to making the internet a better place . Its been my biggest pet peeve of CMS software since at least 2002:Commenting as a feature is half-baked . <p> Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software , and really require a network approach ( centralized service ) to be effective . I 'd encourage you to explore some of the alternatives to Disqus that do n't  have an advertising model , and perhaps make a list of what you miss the most with screenshots for other product devs as feedback . <p> I do n't  even comment on blogs with Disqus system because it forces me to create an account with them ( and remember passwords , etc. ) in spite of logging in using my facebook profile . Then why have the FB login option ? <p> Once upon a time I used Disqus with a Blogger blog as Blogger did n't  support threaded comment replies back then . But I have deactivated it long since . I am very happy with WP commenting system . I just wish there was an option to email my reply to a particular comment to the commenter , instead of asking them to subscribe to all the comments . The reply notification for logged-in users is a cool feature for WP blogs . <p> There 's an important part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> " Publishers , advertisers , and Disqus will not receive any personally identifiable information about the users brands are targeting . Instead Disqus will create anonymous profiles . " <p> So , not all that different from Automattic in that regard : <p> From Automattics Privacy Policy : <p> " Like most website for users leaving comments on WordPress.com blogs . " <p> " Certain visitors to Automattic 's websites choose to interact with Automattic in ways that require Automattic to gather personally-identifying information . The amount and type of information that Automattic gathers depends on the nature of the interaction . " <p> We have n't seen the full information from Disqus yet . While I do n't  use their system on my own blog ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for family and friends , and the last time Disqus did something like this ( ads at the bottom of posts instead of related content ) , it gave users the option to have this on or off . <p> I feel that this is a weird approach to conversation . This is due to several reasons . <p> 1 . I comment when I have something I need to get off my chest ( like this comment ) . If someone tries to hi-jack my conversation with what I would regard as spam , then I 'm less inclined to actually comment in the first place . <p> 2 . Often I find that the conversation that gifted and intelligent people have regarding an article is of better value than the article itself ( or at least the comments of an article can make the article soooo much better ) . The article is a catalyst for the fruitful conversation . If we now have sponsored comments disrupting the conversation , it will devaluate my attention to the gifted people who comment on the article . And maybe they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shame . <p> 3 . I could start to get doubt regarding where the idea of the article started . Did it start with a great idea/problem that the author encountered , or did it start with the company wanting to send a message , and then the author wrote an article . <p> I fear the scenario where I , not knowing , am reading a sponsored post with sponsored comments , thinking Im getting smarter , but in reality I 'm just getting dumber <p> Your third point is great . At this point , I assume nearly everything is an advertorial . ( Well , that 's a bit of an overstatement . ) <p> I confess that one thing I do appreciate Disqus for is that when someone leaves a particularly rude or bombastic comment , I can click on their name and see their profile and learn whether or not they have a habit of doing that ( the answer is typically yes ) , or if they are generally reasoned commenters who somehow lost it on my post . In that way , Disqus allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into context based on how they tend to respond and what blogs they are reading/commenting on . <p> Just out of curiosity does IntenseDebate not have similar potential tracking issues . In that presumably its also tracking individual users across sites . <p> Is it simply company philosophy that is different in that this data would not be abused , or is their technological difference in the way its siloed ? <p> Is this not a route that comment hosting services are going to be forced down to survive if not how should they be monetised . <p> On a side note be interested to see what a the UK ASA ( Advertising Standards Agency ) thinks of such comment spam , and if they hold the site owner responsible for it and its contents especially if its not clearly branded . 
@@98356082 @2556082/ <h> Five for the Future <p> On Sunday at WordCamp Europe I got a question about how companies contribute back to WordPress , how they 're doing , and what companies should do more of . <p> First on the state of things : there are more companies genuinely and altruistically contributing to growing WordPress than ever before . In our ecosystem web hosts definitely make the most revenue and profits , and its been great to see them stepping up their game , but also the consultancies and agencies around WordPress have been pretty amazing about their people contributions , as demonstrated most recently by the fact the 4.0 and 4.1 release leads both hail from WP agencies ( 10up and Code for the People , respectively ) . <p> I think a good rule of thumb that will scale with the community as it continues to grow is that organizations that want to grow the WordPress pie ( and not just their piece of it ) should dedicate 5% of their people to working on something to do with core be it development , documentation , security , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation or whatever it might be that helps move WordPress mission forward . <p> Five percent does n't  sound like much , but it adds up quickly . As of today Automattic is 277 people , which means we should have about 14 people contributing full-time . That 's a lot of people to not have on things that are more direct or obvious drivers of the business , and were not quite there today , but I 'm working on it and hope Automattic can set a good example for this in the community . I think its just as hard for a 20-person organization to peel 1 person off . <p> Its a big commitment , but I ca n't think of a better long-term investment in the health of WordPress overall . I think it will look incredibly modest in hindsight . This ratio is probably the bare minimum for a sustainable ecosystem , avoiding the tragedy of the commons . I think the 5% rule is one that all open source projects and companies should follow , at least if they want to be vibrant a decade from now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five for the Future " <p> Totally agree with you . We need to invest in the platform that were all building upon even if we do n't  " have " to . At WooThemes we 've tried out a company wide WordPress hack day which was pretty successful . I like the idea of having a full time employee that works on WordPress core but I think I 'd rather have everyone on board and contributing 5% of their time . What do you think about that ? <p> Any percent that people can pitch in is fantastic ! Some tasks divide into smaller pieces better than others , I 'm sure over time you 'll find the balance that maximizes your impact . That actually brings up a good point , its good to look at what impact you 're having I 've seen companies dedicate a person full-time that has n't  really had a big impact , and people working just a few hours a week that have had a big one . Look at the outcomes and results of what you contribute objectively , and if its not working try something different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your article ; " What is a contribution " ? I commend you for stepping out on a limb and presenting a measurable success metric of giving back . <p> I agree more-so that its about people , having an impact , less about businesses dedicating dollars . Its a goal , not a mandate . Surely your words are meant to inspire PEOPLE to be actively &amp; intentionally involved . I know that I want to make a difference in the WordPress community , and I evangelize community involvement at every event I attend . For me its about spreading the word of " WordPress " , which I do n't  measure in %s or dollars , but as you said , I measure the impact I have . <p> Matt , if I have n't already , thank you . WordPress has come to be quite an amazing tool and it would n't have been born without you . <p> Another way to calculate that 5% contribution might be in hours per week per person . Given a " normal " 40-hour work-week , that would be about 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you describe , that would be 2 hours from *everyone* per week . Though , I might amend that to be just the technical staff . <p> For Automattic were pretty much completely a WordPress-based company , and the things we want to contribute tend to take bigger chunks of time , so full-time people make sense . Others it might make sense to take a little bit of a lot of peoples time rather than all of a few peoples time . Its a rule of thumb that I 'm sure people will interpret differently , what really matters is the impact . <p> For those who are n't  swayed by language like " altruistically " and " the mission " and " should " , I 'll be presenting a set of arguments at my WCSF talk that are motivated by practical concerns rather than ideological ones . Different side of the same coin . <p> That 's indeed a great news Matt . I will definitely talk to my management about dedicating at-least person to contribute in core . We have two WordPress community managers working with us right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cloudways is always be there whenever you need us . <p> Totally agree with you . I am not a freelancer , not startup and not receive any income from WP ( I mean having a WP maintenance company , WP hosting ) but I contribute to WP community every day . I am learning a lot of stuffs and at the same time I help others to sort their issues out . This is mi WP profile : https : **32;509;TOOLONG ( as you can see , 90% of my answer conclude with Topic Solved , that 's amazing for me ) . So , I think if someone contribute at least 30 min weekly will be useful for the WP community . <p> Gah .. I wrote a comment and realized I had JS disabled , then thought I saved , and I did n't  .. how annoying .. : ) .. life is hard as a security guy .. <p> In any event <p> Wanted to stop by and say , nice post .. <p> It was interesting to see the thought mature between the time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's such a beautiful process . <p> It will undoubtedly be interpreted a number of ways , some will take it as gospel , some as recommendations , and yet others will dismiss it outright .. such is online life I suppose .. <p> I like it though because its thought provoking . As someone that runs an organization that supports the community , I cant say its dependent on it . If it were to fail , users would adopt another platform and that platform would be supported . Very similar to non-WP centric hosts ( e.g. , GoDaddy , etc ) . That being said , your post makes me wonder , what could we do more of ? <p> Its an interesting predicament though , the more we do , the more it directly impacts the business , and the more clouded things get . And so you find yourself in this odd place trying to figure out where everything fits <p> In any event , apologies for my random thoughts its just something you got me thinking about , so thanks for that . <p> Greeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am so impressed . I am from CatchThemes and we are using this . We have been contributing in theme reviews , theme developments and helping in WordCamp Nepal and WordPress Meetups . Its really wonderful sharing and helping each other . I am so thankful to WordPress Foundation and the community all over the world . <p> I am so much encouraged to contribute more after reading this post . We will try to contribute more and more . <p> The interesting thing about this post is that you mention " 5% of the People " which I automatically translate in " 5% of their time " . I understood Automattic was a distributed company of another kind where actually , especially due to its distributed nature , it was not so much " time " that was the measure , but " impact " or let say " value " ( e.g. value that they deliver , not value that they cost on the payroll ) . ( This is by the way quite intriguing and remarkable to finally be able to run a company this way on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more digit . ) <p> But then I think you must have in mind " 5% of their value " or " 5% of their impact " . Very hard to measure , drive and manage for most organizations <p> Also , another comment that comes to my mind reading this : giving people time where we tell them to contribute and only contribute ( translates in forcing them to contribute ) sounds a bit contradictory with the original essence of contribution to an open project . Should it not be more to leave 5% ( or more ) free time to developer people and letting them contribute to anything they want ( kind of back to the Google 20% thingy ) . If they are working in the WordPress ecosystem , and if they potentially have value , they will probably pick to contribute to WordPress ( and not to Drupal to just name another ) . If not , they will probably contribute to another component of your stack . It seems to me that this 5% statement " for WordPress " at the organization level goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We use it , we will give back . We do this , like to pay the time of our developer for work on core and work on community . Currently we give time for issues , patches and also much more , like the time from " ocean90 " for contribute the core and get time for meetings with the core team . Also is time for the community , translations , a good part in my eyes . We speak on WCEU with a lot of people , there work in companies , there work with WP and the different views was interesting . <p> I agree . We get so much from WordPress and its community and we should give something back to help other people . But I think we should not limit the contribution to the coding or core contribution . Writing blog posts , teaching people , translating WordPress or themes/plugins into other languages , answering questions at support forum are also good ways to give back to the community . Everyone can give back to the community , not just companies .

Anyone interested in working on this ? <p> " jump the shark " is a bit harsh , I think If the choice came down to advertising vs. getting money from users , they might have made the right choice . Once a site accepts advertising , the advertiser becomes the customer and the users become the product to be delivered . <p> There are worse things than depending on your users . <p> Of course , this is n't meant to discourage anyone from working on an open source alternative = <p> Is there a way that Upcoming.org can be used as a Meetup replacement ? Andy has done some great work with this lately , and I 'd love to see it integrated with WordPress in fact , it would be amazing and I would move multiple Meetup groups to it . I 'm very interested in working on this . <p> I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising in a tasteful way , or they could introduce " premium " features that cost more , but charging for something that used to be free is a bad , bad idea . <p> It would be easier to hack a system out of WP1.5 than to build one from the ground up . Future posts , categorized by location , different comment types for RSVPs and questions/comments , a theme to handle it all why not ? <p> Thinking more if you really do distribute it , is n't the best way to share data going to be some kind of XML/RDF format that can be easily indexed and shared ? In the US , the easy way to do that is via ZIP and at one point , I had pointers to lat/long data of centers of ZIP areas for this concert-finder app that never got off the ground , but if you also do a city/state/province RDF/XML , you have something that 's searchable . <p> The key then is to create a toolset that 's good at creating data according to the specification , and then let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find what events are close to them . <p> Well on wordpress.org we already have over 17,000 registered users , a good portion of them have links to their blog in their profile . We could spider for geotag data . We could also allow people to add lat/long or zip code information to their profile and then aggregate people based on that . <p> Lat/long data is a great way to go easy to calculate distances ; ) , but its hard for people to find their lat/long without GPS or someone who knows . I had to do some digging to find mine here in town . <p> Unless , of course , there 's some great tool I 'm missing , or if Google Maps can do lat/long outputs for you and I 've been missing that . <p> You can extract your lat/long from a couple of the map services , that 's how I did it back when I first user GeoURL . If we could make it a wizard of some sort thatd be cool . Like opening Google Maps in a frame and then clicking a button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of location extraction tool is truly needed , and its probably a key cog in making such an engine go . You could search for all coded events in your area , but that seems scattershot ; the ideal way to do it is to index , but at that point , you 're running into storage , indexing , and money problems for open sourcers , I 'd imagine <p> What do people need to know to use such a service ? <p> Where they are . What events are near them . What those events entail . <p> The first two data points are easier to define than the third , because the third is a host-generated datapoint , and my idea of " cool party " and yours might be different , Matt . <p> Re : the lat/long question , you can actually get some of the way there via this kludge : 1 . Go to maps.google.com , and enter the address/ZIP of a place *near* where you want . 2 . Zoom as much as you can . 3 . Change to " satellite " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual address is ) to re-center the map . <p> Note the lat/long . The reason you have to double-click to re-center ( and therefore use a slightly imprecise address ) is because otherwise the link just uses the spn reference , and I 'm not sure how that corresponds to the actual lat/long . Of course , on the other hand , I do n't  know if you really need 8 digits of precision for this sort of stuff anyway <p> Hmmm.if code is what you are looking for , I would be glad to help out . On the same note , this could be a GREAT starting point for the $500 prize for a community plugin for WordPress in the Plugin competition . <p> I was discussing this with Adam Keys the other day ( a fellow Dallas-ite ) and he too pondered whether Upcoming could be made to do this perhaps through a middle-man app which would automatically add new " Meetup " events to the Upcoming calendar each month and invite a set of people ?

@@98356095 @2556095/ <p> About two years ago I went and picked out a new frame to go with my new prescription . I wandered all over the store , but the ones that caught my eye ( so to speak ) were , in hindsight , terrible for me . I have an ovular face , and these were skinny and rectangular . The color was a deep brown , I put them on and felt a little taller , and things looked a little sharper , despite the fact that the prescription was n't in them yet . The design was fairly basic , but they had a brand name on them ( I think Polo ) so they were hideously overpriced . My judgment was influenced by Antitrust , a movie where the handsome main character , Milo , had dark glasses much like these . <p> Once the lenses came in I wore them to school , and the reactions were mixed , to say the least .

@@98356096 @2556096/ <h> In Memoriam : Chuck Mullenweg <p> My father , Chuck Mullenweg , passed one week ago today . After over a month in ICU he had just been transferred to long-term acute care in a different hospital and we were looking forward to a tough but steady road to being back home when he took an unexpected and sudden turn . I 've started and stopped writing this dozens of times since then and words continue to fail me . <p> here 's the rememberance that ran in the paper a few days ago : <p> It is impossible to overstate the influence my father has had on every part of my life : Why did I play saxophone ? Dad did . Computers and programming ? Dad did . Travel ? He was frequently stationed overseas and even when we did n't  visit he would always bring back a cool gift for myself and my sister . He drove me to the HAL-PC office ( local non-profit ) every weekend where I 'd learn so much fixing peoples broken computers and being exposed to open source for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first scripting I learned , and he pointed me toward Mastering Regular Expressions which became the basis of my first contribution to b2 , texturize . <p> We were in a father / son bowling league . I remember admiring his work ethic so much : hed get up before dawn every morning and put on a suit , grab his briefcase , and go to work . He often went in on weekends and I loved to go with him because they had " fast " internet at the office and I could read Dilbert and about Babylon 5 . He was a voracious reader and learner , and loved tinkering whether it was cars or networking . In the other room I can hear a bitcoin mining rig he set up a few years ago . He was independent minded and unafraid to question the status quo . <p> There 's a photo somewhere of my dad mowing the lawn and me following behind him with a toy lawnmower , which is a perfect metaphor for how Ive always followed in his footsteps . <p> I 'm at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born , and its hard to imagine a life without them . Most people reading this will outlive their parents , and deal with their mortality- and often difficult and painful final days as- those who brought us into this world exit it . Ive been reading and reading all the writing I can find on this topic , but nothing really prepares you for it , and nothing makes it better to go through . Its terrible . <p> He was n't someone to tell you what the right way to live was , in fact he was incredibly open minded . He did n't  tell you , he showed you how he lived his life from a place of integrity and trust , how he was in his relationship with my mom , how he was in business . He was n't flashy and seldom talked about his accomplishments or all the people he had helped out along the way . Many of the stories of appreciation coming in I 'm hearing for the first time . In getting his books and taxes together this past week I was humbled- by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not into material things but cherishing relationships and his quiet life in the suburbs with my mother . <p> My biggest blessing has been my family . Every one is the most supportive you can imagine . So inspiring much of what I 've done in the world was in the context of making my parents proud , and their relationship to each other and the amazing man my dad was has set a bar I hope to approach in my lifetime . The last few years he got much better about showing his pride in my sister and I , and even more importantly saying " I love you , " the three words that are among the best gift we can give each other . Do n't  forget to use them , even if it feels cheesy or embarrassing , and for those of you with parents still around please give them some extra time and a hug for me . This was unexpected , we really believed he was on an upward trajectory. - You never know when the words you share with someone might be the last . 
@@98356097 @2556097/ <p> I live and work on the internet , so when I have trouble connecting it really slows me down . About a year or so ago I started looking into multi-WAN routers that would , at least , support two internet connections and failover to the other one , and as a bonus maybe provide some speed benefits as well . here 's the story of that journey . <p> I 'm a little addicted to gadgets , especially Sony laptops which have served as my primary on-the-go machines for the past few years because of their power and portability . When I first saw the Vaio X , Sonys new ultra-thin and ultra-light laptop , I was taken aback . It looked beautiful , but so was the Envy 133 and the Envy was a complete waste of time and money due to a really bad trackpad and performance .

Feels like its from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually threw it up and caught it , particularly with the normal-sized battery . <p> I got the champagne color , which was a good choice . <p> The ethernet port works in a really interesting way . <p> Speed of browsing , installing , everything feels pretty good with Windows 7 , but its obvious the graphics card is pretty underpowered . The moment you turn transparency on or get a flash video on Blip going it starts to stutter a bit . <p> That said , I could imagine using this as my primary machine for short and medium trips . <p> The keyboard takes a bit of getting used to in a way I have n't run into before : the space bar is hard to hit . The keyboard is very compressed in vertical space so your thumb falls below where the space bar is , and you have to retrain your hand to be in a different position which is n't as comfortable . The shift button can be hard to hit but that 's much easier to get used to , Ive done it on other small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , it feels like it could stretch out a bit more . <p> Other big annoyance is the trackpad its really narrow . Windows machines do the trackpad scroll on the right and bottom edges of the pad and I find myself triggering that accidentally because the tracking area is so tiny . Again , lots of apparent space toward the bottom of the laptop just a really narrow tracking area . This is easier to get used to than the keyboard , though , and the trackpad feels nice like most Vaios and unlike the Voodoo Envy . <p> I love that it has two USB ports , and a regular VGA connector instead of some weird micro-display-port you need a dongle for . ( An Apple decision that bugs me almost as much as the recessed headphone connector on the original iPhone . ) <p> Screen is gorgeous , like all recent Vaios . <p> Did I mention its drop-dead gorgeous ? Its the first laptop I 've had in 5 years that I do n't  want to put stickers on . <p> Hardware-wise , way better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Z890 as primary workhorse for now , the X is so light I might take it on my next few trips and use it as a day-top . I 'm especially excited by the prospect of the 14 hour battery life ( probably 10 in real life use ) giving me freedom from power cords through even a whole day at a WordCamp . Well see in a week or two if I 'm able to comfortably adjust to the too-small keyboard and trackpad.

The Powerbeats 2 are light , have great battery life ( they claim 6 hours , that feels about right ) , stay in place even when running in the Houston heat , charge fast , and as a bonus they look cool . ( Beats has always been great about that . ) The sound ? Theyre bad , but good at it . There 's basically no isolation so you can hear traffic and things around you at lower volumes , which is actually a bonus , and if you turn up the volume they get loud enough to drown other stuff out . Buy these for the function , not the sound quality , and you can pick them up from any Best Buy kiosk in the airport or Apple Store if you lose or forget them , so they 're pretty ubiquitous . <p> The sound is the best I 've heard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The noise canceling apparently uses 4 different mics and I 've found it more than sufficient on dozens of plane rides , including passing the noisy baby test . My only complaint is they do n't  " grip " my ears as much , so some sound leaks in that way . They fold up to be pretty small , and I just toss them in my backpack . The battery goes forever , or as they claim 22 hours . You really forget to charge these things for a while and they still have plenty of juice . The volume and other controls actually work with the iPhone , and bluetooth calls have sounded great and people can actually hear me . Only downside is they have basically a proprietary connection for their 1/8th inch cable , so you have ta carry that around , but they charge with standard micro-USB .

You seem very enthused about the benefits of freedom and open-source-ness , and I 'd like to know why the disconnect . Are there situations where the GPL is not the best way to go ? <p> Not in this video , I have spoken about that a few times before at WordCamps though , and Ive thought about it a great deal . In the case of the Akismet server , you have a utility that it generates from blocking spam at an incredibly high accuracy rate , partly due to the spammers not knowing how it works . Then you have the utility of the code being open . I believe the utility of the former is greater , and more good to the world is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting millions of people . <p> Also the most interesting part of Akismet is n't necessarily the code , its the data , billions of comments over 4 years that it has seen now . That couldnt be shared regardless because of privacy reasons . In the practical case of someone running their own Akismet server , the API itself is so simple that its not hard to implement , as Six Apart found when they cloned the API call-for-call for their Typepad Anti-spam service , which they claim is open source ( I think they just made a API wrapper for the Dspam email project ) . Finally , of course , the plugin is fully GPL and they used that to their degree by just replacing the hostname in the plugin and releasing their own version of it under their own name , the rest being identical line for line . That surprised me , but its totally within their rights under the GPL . <p> In theory we could also open source the Akismet server API wrapper and keep all the good bits secret , but that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be that useful to people as the API itself is really easy to implement and there already is a OS implementation in 6As code . <p> Interesting ! I 'm not sure I agree , but its clear that you 're not just ignoring the contradiction , and have in fact given it thought . <p> What about Gravatar and Intense Debate , though ? Do n't  these merely lock people into a proprietary platform provided by Automattic , especially since the former is now integrated by default into GPL-licensed WordPress ? Or is there some value provided to everyone by their not being GPL-licensed ? <p> Gravatar is interesting only a service , a centralized place where you can give a URL and get an image , fast . <p> Polldaddy , IntenseDebate , and After the Deadline are all candidates for being released under an Open Source license in the future , so keep an eye out there . We have released a number of infrastructure projects in preparation for that here : <p> You ended this QA with " suppose you come across something like Thesis which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Shouldnt the community go further and insist that the authors of such themes release at least the PHP of their themes ( as you mentioned earlier ) under the GPL ? They could still continue charging for their customisation services , artwork , access to the surrounding community etc . <p> I would rather emphasize the positive rather than forcing authors to do something they clearly do n't  want to , even though there 's a legal basis for it . Respecting authors is a Good Thing and in the specific case of Thesis they 've got an excellent product and are smart guys , so I would n't be surprised if they came around to the GPL-side of the fence on their own regard . The community already " insists " based on what we link to and promote , the rest is in the authors court . <p> Great video . Based on the video , is it not 100% legit under the GPL for a commercial theme developer to charge for anything other than an unlimited use ? <p> In other words , it is common practice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also an unlimited " developer " license at a higher price . It sounds like the single domain license would be against the GPL ? <p> Do n't  know how much of that was rehearsed or scripted before the interview , but it was very clear and well-spoken . <p> I know at one point , you said you were sticking with GPL v2 and not going to GPL v3 . Is that still true ? Why that choice and do you think it will ever change ? Or , is it not " correct " legally or morally , to change which version of the GPL WordPress is on because of which one it started on ? <p> Anyway , I created 2 WordPress tshirts ( see the design in my blog ) . If you come to Indonesia again for WordCamp Indonesia 2010 , one of this tshirt will be yours . Hahaha .. Because I do n't  know where to send via post to your house in US . <p> I could only find a slight error towards the end as you spoke about distribution . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough if there are two people . <p> So if I write you as my customer a theme , I must provide that one compatible to the GPL otherwise you could not use it ( legally ) . In reality most customers do not care but I think its worth the education what free software is for those . <p> The only exception to that is the case that I provide the theme to myself , then I can have it under a totally proprietary license in conjunction with a GPL licensed wordpress.

Its a simple example oh , I just read " coolest uses " . I have n't been cool since 1988 . The site is part of my WordCamp US talk though so i 'm happy to share it . <p> Well , we have a theme prototype built with Backbone.js and the WP REST API ( v1 ) , sources available on Github : http : //beebeebee.be . ( Were focusing on React so this has n't  been getting as much love lately , I 'm afraid . ) <p> We also built a fashion directory using the REST API that supports a varied ecosystem of web frontends , mobile applications , kiosks and a videowall slideshow app .

The architecture reflects some of your past suggestions that the JSON API for WordPress is an important part of WordPress future . You can try the NarraFirma app either by getting it directly from WordPress.org or by trying a version loaded with demo data here : https : //narrafirma.com/ <p> === More details <p> Conceptually , NarraFirma uses JSON to communicate between the client app in the browser and a backend which stores and retrieves requested data . This data is in the form of stored messages with one table per project . The messages usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to define most application state ( and to support multi-user editing ) . However , some other messages specify large JSON objects that define the results of people answering surveys involving telling real-life experiential stories on topics of concern . That data storage and communications layer is called " Pointrel " and is potentially reusable in a variety of projects beyond NarraFirma that choose a similar architecture . <p> Technically , the NarraFirma client-side app ( 99% of the code , in JavaScript/TypeScript ) calls WordPress admin-ajax.php to send POST requests to add or retrieve data as requests defined in JSON . Those requests are handled in the NarraFirma PHP backend ( about 1% of the code ) by these lines : <p> The PHP part of the code then sends JSON back via calls to : " wpsendjson() " . <p> There is also a small configuration GUI defined by server-side PHP to use for administration to define new projects and set permissions as to who can access them . <p> Business-wise , as something to reflect on , while we expect most people to use the NarraFirma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way and WordPress has a huge installed base , you can currently also run the same client-side application on top of Node.js using the JavaScript equivalent of the small amount of PHP code . We might also add Drupal support in the future as well , depending on demand . Whether that multiple backend support for a webapp is a plus or minus for WordPress in the context of talking about NarraFirma at " State of the Word " is a matter of perspective perhaps . A big part of the JSON focus you 've talked about is not quite as general as we do with NarraFirma but seems likely more about using lots of WordPress-specific JSON calls to modify existing posts and such from JavaScript GUIs , which would tie such applications much more closely to WordPress . So , youd probably want to consider that multi-platform issue and related pros and cons for WordPress before saying anything about NarraFirma . <p> Practically , if NarraFirma was to be mentioned at State of the Word , we might want to upgrade the demo site from shared hosting to something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Automattic could perhaps host a demo version of NarraFirma on its rock-solid high-performance scalable servers ? = <p> Not publicly available , but we have a single multisite installation providing all data for two different sales conference native iOS apps .

She has told me before that I 'm not really the target audience for such a book , but it is certainly something I would like to read , review , and recommend . It seems every day I talk to another client who was paying 4-5 times what they should for hosting and spent a fortune on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was delivered . The days of monolithic development by giant agencies with even bigger budgets are over . Carries book is indicative of the new era coming . I 've ordered my copy . <p> Also as an update to a previous look , I do n't  know what it was about Mozilla that month ( August ) . Heres what is happening currently : <p> 38% Internet Explorer <p> 36% Netscape/Mozilla <p> 6% Googlebot <p> 3% Safari <p> That 's pretty much on par for the course . One interesting note is that IE6 users seem to spend the most time on the site , for whatever that 's worth . As before , let me know how these things stack up in your neck of the woods . <p> What follows is what I consider to be best practice for my personal sites and a guide for those who wish to do the same . Months ago I dropped the www. prefix from my domain in part because I think its redundant and also because I wanted to experiment with how Google treated valid HTTP redirect codes . The experiment has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 301 Permanent Redirects and the change has taken my previously split PageRank has been combined and now I am at 7 . There are other factors that have contributed to this , of course , and people still continue to link to my site and posts with a www. ( or worse ) in front of it , but overall it just feels so much cleaner to have one URI for one resource , all the time . I 'm sure that 's the wrong way to say that , but the feeling is there nonetheless . <p> Now for the meat . What 's a good way to do this ? Let 's look at our goals : <p> No links should break . <p> Visitors should be redirected using a permanent redirect , HTTP code 301 , meaning that the address bar should update and intelligent user agents may change a stored URI <p> It should be transparent to the user . <p> It should also work for mistyped " sub domains " such as ww. or wwww . ( I still get hits from Carries bad link ) <p> So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server . In my case these are Bind and Apache . I am writing about this because at some point the code I put in to catch any subdomain stopped working and while I reimplemented it I decided to write about what I was doing . This method also works with virtual hosts on shared IPs where my previous method did not . <p> In Bind you need to set up a wildcard entry to catch anything that a misguided user or bad typist might enter in front of your domain name . Just like when searching or using regular expressions you use an asterisk ( or splat ) to match any number of any characters the same thing applies in Bind . So at the end of my zone DB file ( **27;633;TOOLONG ) I added the following line : <p> *. photomatt.net. 14400 IN A 64.246.62.114 <p> Note the period after my domain . The IP is my shared IP address . That 's all you need , now restart bind . ( For me /etc/init.d/named restart . ) <p> Now you need to set up Apache to respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just used the convinence of having a dedicated IP for this site and having the redirect VirtualHost entry occur first in my httpd.conf file . That works , but I have a better solution now . So we want to tell Apache to respond to any request on any subdomain ( that does not already have an existing subdomain entry ) and redirect it to photomatt.net . Heres what I have : <p> The two magic lines are the ServerAlias directive which is self explanitory and the RedirectMatch line which redirects all requests to photomatt.net in a permanent manner . <p> There is a catch though . The redirecting VirtualHost entry must come after any valid subdomain VirtualHost entries you may have , for example I have one for cvs.photomatt.net and I had to move that entry up in the httpd.conf because Apache just moves down that file and uses the first one it comes to that matches , so the wildcard should be last .

Their readers made the right decision and voted that it would be disingenuous to accept advertising from a company that , in Michaels words , pollutes the blogosphere . He also notes that TechCrunch is being held to a higher standard than most mainstream media would : <p> The comments that are most interesting to me are the ones that say were selling out if we take their advertising . I understand that we are held to a certain standard ( and we hold ourselves to that standard ) , but its interesting that we supposed to do things that would never be asked of MSM . <p> While Im sure there 's mainstream media which turn away advertisers because of social reasons , the point that we should hold flagship blogs to high standards is a good one . <p> On that point , I would encourage the crew at TechCrunch to re-examine their advertising and implicit endorsement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way PayPerPost does , by selling links with the intention of gaming Google . Just as PayPerPost " posties " were recently penalized by Google and Pagerank was one of the criteria that advertisers looked for when choosing which bloggers to give money to , Text Link Ads has been doing the same thing for years , theyve just been more explicit about it . ( And their corporate site has been penalized in Google for a long time . ) <p> I should also note that if TechCrunch decides that the same reasons it decided to not accept advertising from Izea also apply to Text Link Ads , itll be operating at a higher standard than Google itself , who even though its business is directly impacted by the search engine spamming both of these companies practice allows both TLA and PPP to advertise via Adwords and Adsense . <p> " Let 's face it , were selling links here . Call it buzz all you want , but it boils down to selling links . That skews Googles index and theyve come out against that quite publicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own manner , were a moving target .

This is one of the reasons we took an early stance by banning PPP on WordPress.com , and other blog hosts should do the same . <p> PayPerPost , a company I still consider highly distasteful ( when you 're forced to change a core aspect of your business because of the FTC , that 's a bad thing ) has bought Performancing Metrics .

End of story . I have no problem with bloggers making money , but that info out there and let people make up their own mind . <p> Another way to think about it : If PayPerPost was PayPerComment instead , and they paid people to leave comments shilling various products or services , what would you call it ? What if they paid people to email their friends about something without disclosure ? Would someone start an anti-PayPerPost Akismet , or a Firefox extension to detect and highlight people using them ?

My friend Rene told me how when his hard drive crashed last year he contacted Apple support and they gave him a link to re-download the past 4 years of music hed purchased on iTunes . That 's obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be dragged kicking and screaming toward it . By this time tomorrow itll just be part of the experience when he signs into iTunes on a new computer .

Apple does n't  replace Visa or Mastercard , but they do replace all of those scammy rewards and branded cards that prey on unsophisticated consumers . Google will probably do this first , but itll be like Microsoft Surface , brilliant but two sandwiches short of a picnic . <h> 4 . TVs <p> I recently got one of the new Thunderbolt displays and man , a super-sized version of this would be killer in my living room . ( The speakers are surprisingly good . ) TVs are just so bad , not so much in the hardware which can be beautiful like Samsungs C9000 but in the mediocre software , un-features like Auto Motion ( which makes beautiful films look like they were shot by a Jersey Shore cameraman with a beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  do anything you would expect .

" Smart TVs " look like " smart phones " did in 2005 completely lacking in imagination or joy . <p> But to really imagine the strategic importance of this you need to think beyond a super-sized Thunderbolt display and imagine what replaces iMac , one of Apples most beautiful creations . Peoples need for a desktop is seriously declining for the first time since pundits started predicted the decline of the PC a decade ago . The post-PC ecosystem is in place now touch , battery life , mobile-first applications , ubiquity of internet access , flash memory . ( In Steve Jobs introduction of the first iPod , two things stand out to me : that terrible font , and the fact one of the main features is 20 minutes of skip protection . ) Mobile works and is getting better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years from now . <p> Now imagine Apple has a shining 55 ? monolith smack dab in the middle of your house . How big of a wifi antenna could they put in there ? Could they crush all that lame Cisco teleconference stuff with TV FaceTime ? Is there room for a few disk drives that do n't  need to worry about skipping plus a SSD to make it fast ? If you look at the direction Apple has been heading with Time Capsule locally caching software updates its not hard for something similar to work in the other direction , a digital hub that 's your media server for the house , a large-format display , a time capsule , and an Airplay target all in one . Imagine just one power cable coming out of it , and everything else wireless , just like the iMac , and a few killer apps we cant even imagine yet . <p> Finally , home theatre needs disruption this is a land of $200 Monster HDMI cables and similar gouging that functions like a state lottery , an intelligence tax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do once every few months , it feels like its technology at its worst , the magic of progress used as smoke and mirrors to confuse and dupe consumers rather than make their lives better . The Apple TV is just another form factor for the unified experience Apple wants to create every time you touch an electronic device . <h> 5 . Search <p> There are hints of this in maps , but just like Craigslist is being killed not by a Craigslist-like clone but rather by a thousand highly focused replacements , so too Google will face its existential crisis not from another webpage with a centered white box , but from the interface and context of search changing completely . Many of Googles searches are n't  that valuable , and a huge percentage of the ones that are are n't  going to happen at the desktop anymore . The context of your location ( which your phone already knows ) the " results page " of a fantastic map application and the input of a next-generation search interface , like Siri , completely changes the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted a better phone . <h> 6 . Cars <p> This is the most far-out , but I think most certain . Voice-controlled search through Siri and Apple Maps provide the hands-free framework for a rich interactive experience while driving . Walk down the car stereo aisle in Best Buy and see what $800 gets you , or a $300 GPS from Garmin , vs an iPad or iPhone . The screens feel like a TI-92 calculator . The typography makes my eyes bleed . I find it morally reprehensible how bad these products are because its one of the areas of technology where a bad interface is most directly tied to injuries and deaths . Car folks are making their iPhone/iPod integrations better and better , which may be a glass of ice water in hell , but theyll never make the jump to providing a beautiful marriage of media , search , and navigation that a great in-car experience needs . Right now you can spend 110k on a Tesla Roadster , a car of the future , and for an additional $4,500 ( 9 iPads ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try not to laugh at how bad the interface is . ) Retail it only sets you back 1.4 iPads .

@@98356159 @2556159/ <p> Daniel Jalkut of Red Sweater Software wrote a blog post called Getting Pretty Lonely and and says , among other things , " Whenever I am reminded that WordPress is GPL , my passion for it takes a bit of a dive . I 'm more comfortable with the true freedom of liberally-licensed products . " More importantly , he says that " GPL stifles participation , " and implies the same for adoption . The article was linked by John Gruber at Daring Fireball saying , " Smart essay from Daniel Jalkut on how the GPL discourages participation from many ( if not most ) developers . " <p> For what its worth , from my practical experience in the WordPress world : <p> I 've never encountered a serious client who chose not to use WordPress because it was GPL-licensed , and I think its hard to argue that WordPresss license has had a dampening effect on its adoption , given its success over competitors with widely varying licenses . <p> I think we have an incredibly strong third-party extension , plugin , and theme community that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because of it . <p> I 've seen the absence of GPL in practice ; there have been times in the WordPress world when parts of the community have " gone dark " and claimed their code was under more restrictive licenses , like used to be common with themes . Every time this cycle starts it basically kills innovation in that part of the WordPress world until people start opening up their code again or until a GPL equivalent is available . I 've seen this firsthand several times now . <p> WordPress first used the GPL because it was built on an existing GPL project ( b2 ) . Later I began to really understand the philosophical underpinnings of the GPL and understood it to be the most moral of the open source licenses . Now , in addition to that , my experience over the past 6 years has made me believe it to be the best license for practical purposes as well . <p> GPL was a license written for a different time and on the web its possible to find a thousand loopholes and ways around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you keep in mind the core freedoms and principles share and share alike they provide excellent guidelines for building a rich community and ecosystem : the two things that ultimately have far more to do with product success than the license . ( Competitors to WP have switched to the GPL from proprietary licenses with basically no effect . License does not equal community , its a lot harder than that . ) <p> Ultimately Daniels article falls apart on two levels , the first illustrated in a comment I left on the post : <p> Your biggest fallacy is " the liberal-license communities are attractive to developers from all 3 camps . " <p> I 'm a GPL-friendly developer that is hesitant to be involved with a non-GPL project the same way your " passion for it takes a bit of a dive " when coming into contact with the GPL . <p> You could also make a fairly good argument that the majority of Open Source developers are GPL-friendly simply because the vast majority of Open Source projects are licensed under the GPL . <p> The common-knowledge number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the GPL and ( more importantly ) many of the most crucial and successful ones are . If Grubers " many ( if not most ) developers " avoid the GPL , maybe those folks are n't  that important . ( In reality I think the majority of developers are n't  strongly influenced by licenses as long as they 're open source , something Daniel seems to agree with , saying " the vast majority of developers will participate in any project that is advantageous to them . " ) <p> But more importantly , Mr Jalkut conflates what he perceives as his freedom as a developer with freedom from a users point of view . The things the GPL " takes away " from him , like being able to license his derivatives under a more restrictive license , are in fact protecting the freedoms of the users of his code . Thats who the GPL was written for . From the Free Software Definition : <p> Free software is a matter of the users freedom to run , copy , distribute , study , change and improve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freedom , for the users of the software <p> Its user freedom that the GPL was created to protect , just like the Bill of Rights was created to protect the people , not the President . The GPL introduces checks and balances into an incredibly imbalanced power dynamic , that between a developer and his/her products users . The only thing the GPL says you cant do is take away the rights of your users in your work or something derived from a GPL project , that the user rights are unalienable . You are free to do pretty much whatever you want as long as it does not infringe on the freedoms of others . ( Sound familiar ? ) <p> That 's what software freedom means to me , and its something I believe in strongly enough to fight for and defend even when its not the easy or popular thing to do . ( Especially this weekend as we celebrate the original " fork " of the US from England . ) <p> The only thing why ( at least ) I encode the footer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually spend around 6 hours designing the graphics and coding the theme and some people simply take my link off and some of them even dare to write that the theme was designed and coded by them ! How would you feel if someone took your WordPress script ( since its free ) and said they made it ? Wouldnt you like to bite their head off ? <p> The response became too long for a comment , so here it is : <p> Kate , thousands of people every day remove the WordPress link , or my link , or search and replace the WP logo with their own and redistribute it , use it to spam , distribute hate speech , or any number of awful things you can imagine . So why have hundreds of people spent thousands of hours working on it ? <p> Though the freedom intrinsic in the GPL that has allowed people to abuse WordPress it has allowed even more people to do amazing things and over time the good far , far outweighs the bad . Most importantly I feel like WordPress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  been open from the beginning . ( In fact there were several more functional blogging programs started around the same time that have since withered away . ) <p> Ultimately I know our software is n't going to change anyones spots . Good people will do good things with it , and bad people will do bad things with it regardless of any protections I put in place . Windows Vista , a multi-billion dollar enterprise , was cracked within days . Does any piddling encoding I can do in PHP really matter ? If protection like that is n't broken its a statement of popularity , not security . I suppose could harass the bad guys , shut down their host , send them scary letters , but its just going to stress me out and like cockroaches theyll pop up someplace else . I also know that most projects , software , and ideas die from obscurity , not piracy . <p> If you accept that bad people are going to be bad then the real question becomes how do you maximize the effect of the good instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes to be treated like a criminal . ) In my brief experience here 's three things that work : <p> Give people the tools they need to succeed . This can be interpreted on a lot of levels , but personally Ive found at the most base the freedoms provided by the GPL and other open source licenses are incredibly empowering . <p> Celebrate the successes . Talk , connect , promote , and embrace the people who are creating things on top of your creation . ( The best revenge against someone doing something bad is helping create something awesome . ) <p> Provide a way for people to choose to help you , and try to remove as much friction from that process as possible . Now that you 've ignored the bad people and delighted the good , by their very nature theyll want to give something back . <p> The success stories around this model are numerous and growing every day . People can and do rip-off the entire Wikipedia , but its still become one of the top ten sites on the internet and a marvel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not to mention it is run entirely on open source software . ) WordPress itself was built on top of a pre-existing GPL product called b2/cafelog . Anyone can run the software behind our hosted service WordPress.com and create competitive sites , and many have , but it has n't  hurt us one bit . Linux , GNU , and the thousands of related desktop projects have n't taken a bit longer than folks had hoped , but the impact they 're having , especially on emerging economies , is dramatic . The list goes on and on . Its not hard to join the movement , but first you have to figure out who you 're fighting , who you 're trying to help , and if the price of freedom is something you 're willing to embrace .

At about four this morning I got a comment on an old entry that said : <p> Well , I just wanted to sign a blog on the first time in my life : ) ) <p> Kind of cute , right ? Isnt that nice that some guy , " James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enamored that he decided to leave a comment , his frist ever . Well , two minutes later the exact same comment , URL , and name was left on the WordPress blog . Clue #1 . <p> The URL he left as his with his comment is nositeyet.com , which I 'm not going to link because this may be this spams whole point . I clicked the URL from the comment before realizing it was probably just a newbie way of saying " I do n't  have a site yet . " People I know have left similar things for their URL in the past . Well , the link takes you to some sort of web company with a hideous flash intro and an equally mediocre web site . Hmmmmm . Clue #2 . <p> Clue #3 , each comment came from radically different IP addresses . Let 's give this guy incredible benefit of the doubt and say just maybe he was a newbie user who just came upon an old entry , left a silly comment with what he thought was a fake website , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a slightly old entry , and left the same comment . So why did his IP change ? The first comment came from 195.200.168.250 , which resolves to anaconda.pacwan.net , and the second from 80.58.4.44 , which is a proxy of some sort . Most users , especially the type that would leave this sort of comment , do n't  randomly start using proxies mid-browsing . Strike three . <p> Finally , I decided to look up this guys IP in my access logs , to see what pages he visited . There were no records of his IP visiting any pages on either site in my PHP/Javascript based logging software , which means whatever client was used to leave this comment does n't  support javascript or the &amp;ltnoscript&gt; tag and images . Time to grep the raw logs . No referrer , none of any of the usual signs you would see in a log entry . here 's the relevant lines from my photomatt.net logs : <p> There 's got to be a good story behind this . If this is indeed malicious comment spam then this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the author of two posts he spammed and gotten the email notification I never would have suspected a thing . Has anyone else seen this ? <p> What 's worrying about this whole thing is IP filtering ( reactive ) techniques that are usually used to block comment spam or content filtering ( proactive ) techniques which we 've been experimenting with on WordPress would n't catch this guy . In fact I cant think of any good way to preemptively block this sort of thing . If Google did n't  give blogs so much credence we would n't be having this problem . I suppose now we have to watch every comment with an eagle eye , on the lookout for anything suspicious . <p> Update : I got it reversed above , " he " commented on the WordPress blog first and then here . <p> Just to update on some of the latest changes going on around here as part of the redesign . <p> The biggest changes have come as part of the new " photos " section . In moving the photolog from /p/ which I consider ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about what sort of photographic content I have on the site now and what I 'd like to have in the future . In my mind three sections came to mind , the photolog , selected series of works , and old photos . I 've experimented with putting older photos into the photolog but it does n't  really work well with the reverse chronological organization of the albums . Plus as part of my moving I 've dug up a ton of old pictures that I 'd love to scan and archive online . The series idea never really developed beyond the first two I did ( and its built on the structure of the photolog ) but I really like the idea of it and I 'd like to keep it around . For instance itd be interesting to do a " Best of 2003 " series at the end of the year , or something similar . ( Though the thought of choosing a dozen or two from over 7,000 photos is a little intimidating . ) <p> The re-coding of the photolog itself is actually going much better than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrating sometimes , but I 've managed to get the vast majority of the program completely free of tables , simple syntax errors , and its now using a CSS-based design . I am using one hack to get XHTML 1.1 validation , but its because of a bug in PHP that I will devote an entire post to . As soon as I finish cleaning everything up for the photolog section I 'm going to copy the code over and use it to power the classic photos section . <p> Ive been recoding many of the titles of pages to use the new CSS image text method , and I enjoy the results . When I recently upgraded to PHP 4.3.3 something changed in the Freetype library and now the letters are rendering at what seems to be a lower weight , which is a pleasant surprise because they were a little chunky before . I have no idea why it would do this . Unless perhaps a newer version of Freetype could better understand the font file , which I suppose is the only explanation . <p> I changed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hyphens . Though I like hypenated " filenames " better the problem came in the photolog where there were actual hypens needed in the titles , so having those translated to spaces was a little funky . <p> Finally I 've done a little work on the jazz quotes section of the site . Although I have been neglecting it lately , these pages account for a good fifth of the traffic to this site and its really the only resource of its kind on the net . For some reason before I would seperate the first and last name in the URI with a period , which messed up some simplistic traffic analysis software ( what sort of extension is . Coltrane ? ) but its what I chose for whatever reason . I 've updated all the new URIs to use hypens instead of periods , which is much cleaner in my opinion . There are so many links to these pages and so much search engine traffic that it would just be stupid to break any of the links . Of course the old URIs still work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redirect yet , they just return the page like before . This section still needs a lot more work , in its styling and also just in the backlog of submitted quotes I have to catch up with . <p> The Zeitgeist has been updated to no longer return script errors , but it is n't cached so its very slow , and it needs to be restructured . <p> For too long this site has been beautiful XHTML 1.1 served with the correct DOCTYPE and MIME type save for one section . One major section , with thousands of pages . The photolog . Part of it has been that Gallery is so inflexible I have to make extensive modifications just to get it to look like the rest of the site . The logic and presentation is all a mess in the code , and its quite invalid out of the box . Well , version 1.4 has just been released , and I can live with that until 2 comes out , so I 'm going to use 1.4 as my baseline and get it 100% valid to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pages not working . Wish me luck . The photolog may look quite funny during the process , but give it time and it should be back to its rosy and frequently updated self .

@@98356178 @2556178/ <h> Streak <p> You might have noticed there have been more posts around here lately . Actually until yesterday ( Oct 3 ) there was an unbroken string of at least one post a day since August 25th , 40 posts in total . It started with a tweet from Colin Devroe : <p> Until now I forgot it was only weekdays , so I was doing weekends as well . Friends know I like doing personal experiments just to question assumptions or ingrained behavior , other examples this Ive tried this year are giving up drinking for a month , going without a smartphone for 40 days , and more recently training for a half marathon with my friend Rene . I thought blogging every day would be a burden , but it actually became a great source of joy . It was more a shift in mindset than anything every day I read things I think are interesting , share links with friends , have thoughts that are 80% of a blog post , and write a ton privately , it was just a matter of catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the world . <p> The tools besides WordPress that I found super-helpful in this were Simplenote , which was great for capturing thoughts and drafts when I was on the go , and I 've been using the Editorial Calendar plugin to help me schedule drafts and keep an eye on my progress . The Editorial Calendar plugin is useful but I do n't  love it I wish the calendar view moved week by week rather than replacing the whole table , that it was responsive or worked on mobile , and that it would take over your publish button so you could define a desired posting cadence ( in my case every 24 hours ) and it would put a finished post in the next free slot , or let you bump something to the front of the queue and push all the other posts back a day . There were a few missteps along the way with timezones but overall I 'm happy with how the experiment turned out . <p> So what broke the streak ? It was actually one of the other experiments : running . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in my life , but a few months ago I started trying it and have been training up for a half marathon on November 16 . ( Its also a great opportunity to take photos . ) Yesterday morning I woke up early around 5 AM and as the sun started to come up , and the weather was so nice after I rounded the Bay Bridge ( planned turnaround point ) kept going to Crissy Field where I saw the Golden Gate from afar and thought it would be fun to cross it . After crossing I was starving by and figured 3 more miles would be a half marathon and also put me in Sausalito . The last mile or two was really tough , definitely beyond what I was ready for and I walked a lot , but I was very proud of the result , finishing in around 2 hours 45 minutes . But I had n't  planned to stay out that long , and the rest of my day was full of meetings . I had moved my scheduled post for the day out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( post coming tomorrow ) but the rest of the day was so busy and I got exhausted so early I totally forgot to post . <p> So achieved one life goal while breaking the streak on another , which is not ideal , but today is another day and I want to see if I can break the 39 day streak next . Everything happens one day at a time . = <p> That explains a lot ! I have enjoyed the posts I guess the only downside is I do n't  have time to read every single one like I used to . But , I guess I know I can go back to the blog itself . It makes me more selective in what I get sent so many posts ( i.e. 7x more than you were sending before ! ) .

Ive been talking to Cathy ( the author ) off and on since August and the strangest thing is how much has changed since we first met in a small coffee shop in Montrose . There are a few points I 'd like to expand on or clarify but I 'm exhausted from todays travel right now . <h> The Other Big News <p> If you 've read the article already you 'll notice that it breaks a juicy tidbit that has n't  been published before : I 've accepted a job with CNET Networks . That 's the reason I 'm moving to San Francisco . There were a lot of ways things could have gone and honestly I was n't even planning on leaving Houston originally , but over the course of the past 3-4 months I 've been talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it says in the article part of what they 're paying me for is working on WordPress just like I do now . The rest of my time I 'll be working on various projects , most of them probably so top-secret I cant breathe a word in advance . <p> The reason Im excited about working with CNET is how what I 'll be doing meshes with my thoughts and ideals regarding Open Source , standards , and communities . My principles are n't  changing just because my paycheck is . You can expect the same sort of content here on PhotoMatt.net you 've seen in the past namely unfiltered personal thoughts , jabs , and observations not connected with any corporate entity . This is obviously a pretty significant move for both myself and WordPress so I 'll do my best to entertain any questions you may have in the comments . <p> Recently it leaked on a blog ( there are few secrets in Open Source ) that elements from a design known as " Kubrick " by Michael Heilemann would be incorporated into the default template for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , a set of templates , some plugins , and a removal of a lot of cruft currently in the default template . It makes things much friendlier for readers . Best of all Michael released everything under the GPL and submitted it to WordPress for inclusion . After it had had several iterations I checked it out and saw a lot of great ideas that would make WordPress a better product , especially for new users . Even though no decisions had been made and no code had been committed , a number of questions were raised in peoples minds . A thread was started in the forums that I 'm not even going to link to because its not worth reading past the first page , if that . Many people seemed to misunderstand what was going to be incorporated and what was n't , even though that was stated pretty clearly in the original blog post . <p> Michael is primarily a designer , not a coder , and coding things in a way that works on the variety of platforms and setups that WordPress itself does is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ templates Michael has released . WordPress devs have a lot of experience with those issues , however , and anything added to the core will work just as well ( if not better ) than WordPress does now . Several others questioned the inclusion of graphics in a template . If graphics were included , how would people be able to edit it ? We cant expect people to have graphics editors , so if graphics are included in the final template ( that has n't  been determined yet ) Ive committed to providing an online interface on wordpress.org for people to customize the graphics to match their color choices without needing any software beyond a web browser . There were some questions about the CSS being used in Kubrick , but the CSS used for it in WordPress wont be the same and will be treated like any change to the WordPress code , that is it will go through the normal QA process and be tested across platforms by the developers and the few dozen or so people who keep up with the nightly builds , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once we enter that phase for 1.3 . Any problems will be treated as bugs and fixed as such . Watching trends on the forums and continuing a high level of support is very important to everyone . <p> The problem was after all this was explained the thread continued long after all these questions had been answered with everyone talking past each other . If it shows anything its that people can be very passionate about the smallest of things . Its interesting to note that while this all was occuring what has actually happened in WordPress development in the last week : Dougal wrote a plugin to slow down spambots , literally ; Alex made a new style for the styles page ; Kitten sent in another comment moderation plugin that 's going to be included in the core ; Craig Hartel and Kevin Francis ( amoung many others ) did some great work on the new wiki ; Michel is refactoring the XML-RPC code ; we started the process of moving to a better source control system ; Ryan is coding too much cool stuff to mention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customize and template ever . That 's just off the top of my head , there 's lots of other exciting developments happening . <p> In other words , life moved on . It showed up on a few blogs , but that 's a price of popularity : bad news gets more buzz than good . Numerous examples are in the checkout line of every supermarket . ( Not to mention the blogosphere . ) <p> So what 's the state of the WordPress community today ? I 'd say its better . The number of people who actually got out-of-hand was only a handful , and personally I 'm ready to apologize and move on . I 've never been good at holding grudges . The things that make the WordPress community great havent changed , and several lessons have been learned . Hundreds of new WordPress blogs have been started , testimonials and donations keep coming in , I 've noticed more people helping out on the forums , and best of all there 's a healthy amount of disagreement keeping the project young . <p> So how is the experiment going ? Pretty well I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some words are much harder to write than others . Some words flow while others trickle . Sometimes some words flow where there kshould be no words . A " quota " encourages writing more than editing . So I 'm not tracking word counts anymore , though the part of me that wants to quantify everything than can be quantified really wants to . <p> Everything that can be counted does not necessarily count ; everything that counts can not necessarily be counted . <p> Robert said that " do n't  worry about writing or minimum quotas . Lousy way to learn to write . Just keep blogging , write a web article or two and when you find a good thing to write about for a school assignment , run with it . " He was right and wrong . Explicit quotas are lousy , but the musician inside me knows that discipline is necessary to excel , and daily practice makes perfect . ( To which Kel often counters " But nobodys perfect , why practice ? " I suppose its the thought that counts. )

Its surprising to hear that you use Dvorak . I 'm a Dvorak user and I 'm always interested in learning of other people who use it as well . <p> To Kathy : Matt is asking how to remap his QWERTY keyboard under Linux , so my guess is that he probably does n't  own a Dvorak keyboard . Since remapping is a no-brainer under most Operating Systems nowadays , most Dvorak users do n't  waste their money on a hard-wired Dvorak keyboard . <p> Too bad you cant set only one VC to be Dvorak . That would be ideal for me to run gtypist on vc12 using Dvorak , to learn it when I want but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I know Dvorak . <p> A guy left a tiny old Mac at my place to demon-dial faxes for his theater company , showed me how I could browse in it without breaking anything . It had Mavis Beacon 2 which introduced me to Dvorak , so I read up on that in the library . Staff in computer stores would have their eyes glaze over when I tried to learn more . One guy called me back after researching how many thousand dollars I 'd have to spend to have a programmer convert my computer to dvorak . But there was an article on keyboards in a Canadian computer mag ( The Computer Paper TCP ) which the author turned to addressing ergonomics so he could promote dvorak . This gave me the contacts for Dvorak Intl , which showed me how simple it actually is to install and access the dvorak options . I subscribed to his quarterly newsletter ( hardcopy ) which is a blast , and Ive thought of asking his permission to scan it to pdfs to distribute on the next . A wealth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Underwood Manual in school in the late 60s , often hit 100 wpm with no practice outside the classes . This left me with a solid respect for learning touch typing , and I still do n't  get why so many users seem proud of their total lack of typing skills . I first typed on the small Mac kybds that came with the compact Macs , and cherish them because you can shift the keycaps to Dvorak while maintaining the original surface , unlike most later keyboards which get very wierd and uneven if you move the keys . I often give these old keyboards to new users to help them learn , but I now confidently type upon qwerty caps layout.Benefits of using a tutor and learning to touch type . A friend who worked at the local Mac Store had bad RSI ( articles in the paper began offering dire predictions about kids who grew up with computers having such bad RSI by the time they left highschool that theyd need someone to type for them , or really good voice dictation software . ) He asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set it up in dvorak for him , and after one month , his RSI was gone . I have found few in my area who use dvorak , but began to pester a local paper that since they did seasonal tech articles about RSI and computers , why not include some useful info on Dvorak . So they hired a freelancer to do the story , and it came out great . After some time , I began to use the Apple Adjustable Keyboard , which allowed you to open it to the precise angle your hands are comfortable at . Too bad , it was costly and flaky.the key switches would give out.But I became convinced that a bent keyboard means as much in its own way as does using Dvorak . Then I worked for 3.5 years in cybersweatshopan outsource callcenter supporting highspeed Broadband.A local doctor had been converted by a musician friend to Dvorak , and he wrote me a note requiring my company to get me a bent Dvorak keyboard .

During a flush period , I bought a DvortyBoard just to go with my Linux setup on an Intel towerwhich is what I 'm typing on now . If I upgrade to a newer Mac with usb , I 'll probably buy some bent keyboard for that too . Recently I began getting serious about using Linux ( Ubuntu ) cause I love the whole open source thing and because it now makes sense to learn command line for Mac OS X. So even though I am using a DvortyBoard , the first thing I have learned to do it command line is to change the keyboard back and forth between dvorak and qwerty . My final words of wisdom.even if you do learn to type over 100wpm ( The Guinness Record holder is an elderly lady who types 280wpm.in Dvorak of course ! ) , its NOT ABOUT SPEED . Its about the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more comfortable that way and that it not only does n't  cause RSI , but Dvorak has also been seen to to heal RSI . Say no more ! <p> actually you will still be moving your fingers less distance based on the configuration of the keys . <p> I was/still am a hunt and pecker , but I figured when I switched to dvorak that I would take that chance to learn to touch type . I still hunt and peck when I have to use a Sholes ( Qwerty ) keymaping , but I have now learned to touch type with a dvorak map . I never relabeled my keyboard for learning when switching , that way I never had any reason to look down and be tempted to hunt and peck while learning . <p> Being a programmer , and when sitting at the computer every day I am now very glad that I can touch type . It makes typing a lot easier and copying even better . One does not have to pay attention to the keyboard or even the terminal when touch typing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you learn to touch type and while you are at it you could try out the Dvorak layout if you like . You could always learn to touch type with Qwerty rather then try Dvorak , but I would suggest Dvorak . ( I figured out how to hunt and peck extremely fast on Qwerty over years of repetition , and even though I practically knew where the keys were if it was dark , under the desk , or just copying from paper , I would find I still had to waste time looking at the keyboard . <p> Even if you do n't  want to try out the Dvorak mapping then if I could , I would suggest you consider trying to learn to touch type some time in the future .

You can easily try out Dvorak if you are using a standard Qwerty board with no changes to your computer at all . <p> This program takes you through several practice typing lessons . You can learn to touch type with Dvorak or a normal Qwerty Keyboard with this . If you are interested then I strongly recommend you check it out . <p> There are several arguments ranging from Repetive Stress Injury ( RSI ) such as Carpel tunnels syndrome , to efficiency , and even social reasons . In my opinion , even though the Dvorak keymaping requires less finger movement ( because e-t-a-i-o-n and others of the most frequent letters in the english/latinbased languages , I 'm also a cryptography guy ) , RSI injuries can be avoided even more from ergonomic keyboards . ( Of course I am not a professional in the area , but I do n't  see a huge difference . I could very well be wrong because many people have recovered/feltbetter because of the switch . Also I do not suffer from RSI yet , so I could not say , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion is efficiency . There have been many articles written on why one might choose the Dvorak layout over Qwerty , so I am not going to go into details , but recommend that you google and find your own references and decide for yourself . I just wanted to help others discover that Dvorak is out there and it is a nice Variation from the Qwerty layout that seems to have become the defecto standard . <p> I originally discovered the dvorak layout because I started on designing plans for a hand held input device that would translate binary ( each finger controls a bit ) because I thought it would be a good project to practice in a linux environment . ( Of course in an actual business perspective its not something that you would make millions on , but it is a neat party trick . ) <p> There are other ergonomic keyboards out there and several support the Dvorak layout . It is considered a much more comfortable layout compared to others . <p> <p> Matt : <p> Can you guess why/how I came across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidetracted from looking up one of the ways to load the dvorak keymap on a linux box . ; I was n't looking for the loadkeys program , but of course I stumbled upon this post . loadkeys generaly looks in the paths /usr/share/keymaps/ or /lib/kdb/keymaps/ etc. so that is why loadkeys dvorak can work , you can also try loadkeys dvorak.map etc if it is telling you that it cannon locate the file . <p> <p> PROOF OF EFFICIENCY : <p> Peters case study is great ! This is very similar to something I might have tried had I not run across it when doing research . ( Thank You Peter ! ) Anyway , this is for anyone that wants to see a detailed technical study and probably only interesting to geeks but I have to let others using Dvorak see it . <p> In reference to the best keyboard layout : <p> Could a modern evolutionary algorithm and a huge input sample discover a better arrangement ?

You can see a layout of the 3 side by side on the link below ( Dvorak layout , Sholes layout , Best evolved layout ) . <p> The study also continues and tests the actual usability and further evaluates the Dvorak layout . <p> Yes , I had also attempted to swap all the keys on a newer keyboard and discovered the terrain to be amazingly uneasy for my fingers to traverse . I never realized the old macs I have are all flat and identically sloped . Good to know . <p> - <p> Sam : <p> Not that you should n't have a Sholes layout handy for actual work when you are learning , but it is much easier/faster to learn if you do n't  switch between the two a lot when learning . You may want to leave one computer for tasks that have to get done right away , but leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time limit on them for Dvorak . It will speed up the process . <p> You do n't  have to do that at all , but I 'm just mentioning it because most people benefit from avoiding switching and not using Dvorak in long enough intervals to learn immediately . I 'm mean , obviously we all have to get paid or we wo n't even have the luxury . = <p> - <p> Oh , and I do believe there are a few ways that you can set the Capslock key to Ctrl for the terminal ( when not running X ) but I do n't  remember them off the top of my head . You might search for the sites that are promoting killing your caps key ( ex : http : //www.anticapslock.com/ ) . Emacs has a much easier flow when it is switched to Ctrl similar to the Sun keyboards placement . <p> Ok , enough rambling , back to work . <p> Mike <p> ( If anyone needs help getting the Dvorak Layout setup on Windows or Linux , feel free to drop a message here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want this post to do that and if so then please let us know ) <p> &gt; Now , if there 's an easy way to change the Caps Lock &gt; key to Control at the Linux console , I 'd love to hear it . <p> Easy enough if you have root access : I used dumpkeys to dump the current keymap . Then edit it such that the keycode that was = CapsLock is now = Control . Then load the editted keymap with loadkeys . In Slackware , any script you put in /etc/rc.d/rc.keymap is called automatically at boot . <p> As an aside , I thought this might work for me too but it was n't quite right : loadkeys

Any CMS can be extended to a point where it can serve various purposes . But WordPress is first and foremost a great blogging package . A great , but specialized piece of equipment . I made another decision . I preferred Joomla for my main website and then I tried out the JoomlaBlog tool . It did n't  work for me either . It was way easier ( and more powerful ) to setup Joomla as the front end package and wrap WordPress into it . That way I could use the strength of both , instead of compromising one for the other . <p> I 've set up many sites with WP as a CMS , I love its presentation flexibility , and the ability to easily extend its features with some php . Too bad the newer versions are moving more towards " WordPress for Dummies " and the more professional features are n't  really being extended . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really quite flexible and there 's not much need to tweak the core . Just do some plugins and templates . I do have some problems administering pages , though Anyone know any good plugins for that ? <p> I realize that WordPress has improved greatly in those two years , but would you still agree with your earlier comment that it is a blogging tool and a stretch as a CMS ? If WordPress is a true CMS I think I 'll have to revisit it ( I currently do n't  use any type of blogging software as I do n't  have a blog ) . <p> Alex <p> PS : was that CMS that you said you were making ever released ? I have looked around and I cant seem to find any other references to it .

Isnt this what the search is intended for in the first place ? <p> It sounds interesting but I would hope that you would leave intact and continue to improve upon the built-in search for wordpress.org sites . I 'm not a big fan of relying on external services for my site and do so sparingly . <p> Yes and there is a Google Summer of Code project on this right now , but as with video processing were limited by the resources available to us by default and its something that could be fairly efficiently done as a remote service . <p> I 'm not sure an external ( and centralized ) search engine is needed but improvements to the search features built into WordPress would really kick ass . Advanced search ? Sort by relevance instead of reverse-chronological dump ? Boolean searches ? I suppose if those are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a better , more flexible native search would make more sense first . <p> Well you can already filter search results by category , tag , author , exclusions , date , almost any piece of metadata that is addressable by WPQuery . I 'd be surprised if there was n't a plugin UI for it . <p> Ted , not all content is intended to be found by all users . Assuming some amount of access control in the CMS , youd want access control in the search system as well . <p> External search is n't needed for smaller sites . But once you being to scale to lots of traffic , the built-in CMS search tends not to keep up . Off-loading search to another server , one with data storage and processing power dedicated toward the indexing and retrieval of content , is a quick way to help sites scale . Installing and maintaining those search services , however , is more complex than running your average PHP CMS . Hence the hosted search services . <p> Relevanssi can achieve most of what 's mentioned in this old post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good search engines for WP . <p> In the WP world , I still have to find something better than Relevanssi . Its not ideal yet , as the interface and API ( to show and filter the results ) can be MUCH better , but its much better than the alternative . 
@@98356191 @2556191/ <h> A Cite To See <p> If you notice this sort of thing , the last post and one several days ago about Charles Platt now have visible attribution as part of the inset quote , which is marked up using the HTML &lt;blockquote element . Each of these block quotes has a cite attribute , which is invisible to the user but which I sometimes add when I feel like having million dollar markup . Honestly I had slacked off doing lately because I wonder : if you add an attribute to an element , and no one sees or uses it , does it make a sound ? It does now . <p> The validationists in the audience will notice that am I not using the cite attribute in the strict sense because the value " Albert Einstein " it is n't a URI . They would be right : it is technically in violation of the spec . However it is correct in spirit if not implementation . The URI RFC says " Not all resources are network retrievable ; e.g. , human beings " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to something that has identity . " We 've got the " resource " and " identifier " part down , what about " universal " ? To be fully in line with specification what we need is a protocol to indicate individual people . I propose something like the following : <p> person : //Albert Einstein <p> Thoughts ? Now I just need to work up the javascript chops to hack around with the script , or if I 'm lucky Dunstan will get an itch and beat me to it . The cite attribute checking should probably allow for protocols such as ftp : // and irc : // as well , not just http : // . <h> Related 14594 @qwx874594 <h> 12 thoughts on " A Cite To See " <p> **30;751;TOOLONG power of the Web is in its universality .

It is meant for a specific URI which points to exactly the same text as you are quoting . <p> Person names are irrelevant here , since that is who said it , not where it was written down =&gt; The resource . <p> Am I the only one who thinks hiding human-useful information in an attribute , then using JavaScript to pull it out and make it visible , is well , a bit awkward ? It does n't  work for those with JavaScript turned off , and nor does it work for search engines . For example , if I 'm searching for the quote where Einstein somebody said something about " everything that can be counted " , your post would n't show up , because " Einstein " is n't in the page text . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person element to mark up peoples names .

@@98356195 @2556195/ <h> Category Archives : Apple <p> Ill start by saying Im writing this on a 12 ? Macbook in space grey . The screen , weight , size , and weird keyboard have captured my heart and I 'm enjoying using the machine . It has replaced a 15 ? Retina Pro as my primary laptop- for about 2 weeks now , with most of that being on the road . <p> For better and worse , its a lot like an iPad the size and weight feel very natural in your life , and the screen is really gorgeous . Its also not worth plugging anything into it besides its charging cable . It feels great to open and pick up right where you left off . The speed feels more than adequate for everything Ive thrown at it so far , though I have n't tried video editing or photo management outside of the new Apple Photos app . If there was a perfect iPad and keybard combo , it would feel and look like the new Retina Macbook . <p> The second thing I 'll say is I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade-offs , for example I can get 5-6 hours from the battery but its a little shorter than I expected . Its refreshing to have a computer that 's totally silent with no fan , and I 've only had a heat warning once when it was sitting in hot direct sunlight for about 20 minutes . I moved into the shade because I was also wilting a bit from the direct LA sun . <p> The main reason I 'm not sure if I 'd recommend this Macbook right is hopefully ephemeral : USB-C . One of the very coolest things about the new Macbook is it charges ( quickly ) with a new standard called USB 3.1 with a Type-C connector , which is open for anyone to use , is reversible , and I think is going to be the future as I 've written about on this blog before . <p> Today , however , USB-C is bleeding edge . I actually have one other device that uses it , Googles new Chrome Pixel laptop , but when you search on Amazon for " USB-C " there are almost no results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have any USB-C stuff in stock , even in their stores . ( Perhaps related to the general stock issues I ended up writing about last time I tried to pen this Macbook review . ) I was able to get a cable that had male old USB and male USB-C on Amazon , that was pretty much it . The promise of USB-C is incredible : standard cables for charging everything super-quickly , a battery pack that could charge your phone or laptop , smaller power bricks , a next-gen Thunderbolt display with one cable for all data , display , and charging . You can see and imagine a really perfect ecosystem around USB-C , but it does n't  exist today . Some cool stuff has been announced but is n't coming until the summer , even thumb drives . <p> The problem in- one sentence : it is impossible to buy a cable , from Apple or otherwise , that let 's you plug an iPhone 6+ into the Macbook . Theyve announced but not shipped ( to me at least ) an adapter for old USB stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life is another dongle . <p> I think the most perfect tech combo in the world right now might be a 5k iMac at home , an iPhone 6+ as your phone , and the Macbook as an on-the-go device . ( The iPad is n't in my must-have list anymore . ) The strengths of each of these products complement each other , and as Apple gets better about the cloud with things like photos , tethering , keychain sync , and continuity its really becoming a pleasure to use these products together . I also have an Apple Watch in the mix , but still forming my thoughts on that one . <p> The thing I might be most excited about is when some of the new tech in the retina Macbook around the keyboard , screen , trackpad , and battery is applied to their " Pro " series , which will probably be a bit more in my wheelhouse . <p> Along with about a million other people I bought and read the authorized biography , and did n't  think it portrayed Jobs in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there must have been some things in there that someone who knew him closely felt were so off that as a group they decided to coordinate and speak with a new author to set the record straight , as Eddy Cue said of the new Becoming book , " Well done and first to get it right . " I will never know who Steve Jobs really was , but it is interesting to triangulate and learn from different takes , especially Isaacsons biography that Jobs himself endorsed but might not have read and this new one promoted by his closest friends , colleagues , and family . <p> As an independent third party who does n't  know any of the characters involved personally , I must say that I felt like I got a much- worse impression of Steve Jobs from Becoming than from the authorized biography . It was great to hear the direct voices and anecdotes of so many people close to him that havent spoken much publicly like his wife Laurene he was a very private man and his friends respect that . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the rougher parts of Steves public life , especially the recent ones around options backdating , anti-poaching agreements , book pricing , ( all overblown in my opinion ) or even when trying to show his negotiating acumen with suppliers , Disney , or music labels , they make Jobs look like an insensitive jerk , which seems to be the opposite of what everyone involved was intending . <p> The direct quotes in the book could not be kinder , and its clear from both books that Jobs was incredibly warm , caring , and thoughtful to those closest to him , but Becoming tries so hard to emphasize that it makes the contrast of some of his public and private actions seem especially callous . The personal anecdotes from the author are the best part : one of the most interesting parts of the book is actually when Jobs calls Schlender to invite him for a walk , as one of the people he reached out to and wanted to speak to before he passed , and Schlender not knowing the context actually chastises him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then blows off the meeting , to his lifelong regret . <p> Its tragic , and its very human , and that 's what makes for great stories . No one suggests that Steve Jobs was a saint , nor did he need to be . His legacy is already well-protected both in the incredible results while he was alive , and even more so in what the team he built has accomplished since his passing , both periods which actually amaze and inspire me . Becoming Steve Jobs- tries harder and accomplishes less to honor the man . It is worth reading if , like me , you gobble up every book around the technology leaders of the past 40 years and want a different take on a familiar tune , but if you were only to read one book about Jobs , and get the most positive impression of the man and his genius , I 'd recommend Isaacsons Steve Jobs . <p> So I finally got my hands on a the new Macbook , finally resorting to Craigslist to find someone who had pre-ordered and pay them a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still will , but ended up writing a bunch on the process of buying things from Apple as a loyal customer . <p> I have done the second-market Craigslist dance- with probably 90% of new Apple tablets and phones before , but never for a laptop . I 'm sure every ounce of effort has been expended to capitalize on the hype of the announcements and ship as many of these as possible , but this Macbook/Watch roll-out still seems especially rough with the stores having zero inventory or knowledge of if/when they 're getting anything in , and ship dates now slipping into the summer . There 's a deeper issue though : it- speaks to a lack of Apples knowledge and connection to their customers , even though they have all the data . <p> A great restaurant will track every time you 've eaten there , how much you spent , your preferences , and use that to prioritize reservations and tailor service on subsequent visits . Airlines , for their terrible reputation , actually are decent at this too- with their loyalty programs . On United I 'm a Global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result , with the knowledge that if I do n't  fly a certain amount of miles and spend a certain amount of dollars with them in a calendar year I 'll lose those perks ( as I did for a few months earlier this year ) and so when choosing between two flights to somewhere I 'm more likely to pick the United one . ( Also I think some of airlines bad rep is undeserved , they are flying human beings miles in the air inside tin cans where the cost of an error is catastrophic , everything is highly regulated , and many service factors are literally dependent on the weather . ) <p> I am an unapologetic , unrepentant Apple customer ever since I could afford it . One of the first things I did when I got my job at CNET in 2005 was upgrade my Mom from the inexpensive Linux box I built for her ( all I could afford ) to a Mac Mini . I get almost every new version of everything , including usually 4-6 phones a year ( myself and family ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displays , iMacs , Mac Pros at this point I 'm probably a cumulative $100k customer of Apple , in addition to the millions we spend on Apple hardware at Automattic- ( everyone gets a new computer when they join , and we refresh them every 18-24 months , and a special W version at after 4 years of tenure ) . And I 'm late to the game ! There are Apple customers today who bought their first product decades ago . <p> However when pre-orders creak open at midnight , or people start queueing , the order of access to the latest and greatest from Apple is by whoever shows up first , or now online its essentially random depending on how lucky you are to load and complete the checkout process . In some ways there 's a beautiful equality to that , but for example when I went with Om in London for the 2013 iPhone release , 95% of the line was people just there to buy and flip it , either locally or ship overseas the very front of the line was Apple lovers , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There is some sort of rank ordering inside Apple Karl Lagerfied and Beyonce have Apple Watches already , reviewers from Gruber to Pogue get devices a few weeks early to test but imagine if there was an Apple Loyalty program for the rest of us ? More than almost any other company Apple has been sustained through tough times by the belief and devotion of their best customers . It would be great if you could earn status with monetary ( dollars spent ) and non-monetary ( impact on the world ) points that give you priority ordering access , faster Genius bar appointments , maybe even access to events . <p> Maybe the- truth is Apple does n't  need to do that , I 'm going to keep using them because they make the best products , and when things are rough in the early days ( like with the new Macbook , a few recent versions of OS X and iOS ) I stick it out because I know itll get better . To my knowledge no other tech product maker- has done a great loyalty program- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xiaomi and OnePlus . Most luxury brands from Hermes to Patek are also bad at this , because they do n't  understand technology and data . But how cool would it be if Apple- did reward , or even just recognize , their most loyal customers ? <p> To me one of the most meaningful shifts in computing the past few years has been how the resolution of displays is- getting higher and higher , and interfaces are starting to become resolution independent . I feel like when pixels disappear there 's less of a wall between people and the technology , it starts to blend and meld a bit more . Its something I 've been personally passionate about since the first retina iPhone , tirelessly beating the drum at Automattic to make everything we do shine on hi-DPI screens , or leading the WordPress 3.8 release that brought in MP6 project to make- WordPress aesthetics cleaner and vector-based . <p> I 'm sitting in front of a Retina 5k iMac right now typing this to you . ( It was supposed to arrive on Friday but came a few days early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen , breathtaking at first and then like all great work becomes invisible and you forget that there was ever a time when displays werent this beautiful . ( Until you look at some lesser monitor again . ) <p> Ive been using 4k displays , the Sharp and the ASUS , with Mac Pros for a few months now , and to be honest they come close , but this takes the cake in every possible way , including the design and aesthetics of the computer/display itself which is laptop-thin at the edges . If you 've been on the fence , and you 're okay with the tradeoffs an iMac has in general , get one . I cant wait for them to do a 5k Thunderbolt display ( but it sounds like it might be at least a year away ) . <p> I have no inside information or insight , but historically Apples product improvements have strongly broadcasted where they 're going in the future . Here are six things I think are inevitable for Apple to do over the next decade , from most to least obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cars . <h> 1 . Maps <p> When the iPhone was first released- Steve Jobs called Maps on iPhone- the best version of Google Maps on the planet , with emphasis on what Apples designers had brought to Googles raw technology ( cant find that link ) . Four years later , you cant imagine such a core piece of the mobile experience reliant on their largest competitor . Hopefully this will also give Apple a chance to fill usability gaps in the maps experience today , like that you ca n't click from the " where " field in a calendar appointment straight to maps . ( Drives me crazy . ) Note that the only " Google " branding in maps today is in the bottom left , they know they 're getting replaced and have done an admirable job on the Safari version of maps on iPhone and iPad . <p> Google Maps + Navigation on Android is my favorite mobile app of the past 3 years ( have n't used Siri yet ) its what Garmin should have built $8 billion in revenue and R&amp;D ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to partner in the beginning , but they can , and should , raise the bar . <h> 2. iCloud <p> The abstraction of documents , photos , videos , their equivalents in " bought " media ( iBooks , music , movies , and TV shows from the iTunes store ) , the deemphasis of the filesystem with every iteration of OS X , and the rough ideas of things like MobileMes dock syncing , points to the combination of services that will ultimately disrupt the " magic folder " providers like Dropbox . I love Dropbox , but itll be impossible for them to do the deep OS integration needed to match the direction Apple is heading never thinking about what is where , ever again , just having everything you 've ever created or used available in the same place on all your devices . <p> They know this is best for consumers . My friend Rene told me how when his hard drive crashed last year he contacted Apple support and they gave him a link to re-download the past 4 years of music hed purchased on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if labels have had to be dragged kicking and screaming toward it . By this time tomorrow itll just be part of the experience when he signs into iTunes on a new computer . Update : Apple released iTunes 10.5 a day early with this feature . <h> 3 . Payments <p> Your phone becomes your credit card . Apple does n't  replace Visa or Mastercard , but they do replace all of those scammy rewards and branded cards that prey on unsophisticated consumers . Google will probably do this first , but itll be like Microsoft Surface , brilliant but two sandwiches short of a picnic . <h> 4 . TVs <p> I recently got one of the new Thunderbolt displays and man , a super-sized version of this would be killer in my living room .

When I offload pictures from card I generally drag the 100PENTX folder from the card onto my desktop and I leave things in that folder until I have a chance to compress the pictures , divide them into days , and upload them . Well OS X does this crazy thing where when you drag the folder onto the desktop it asks you if you want to replace the folder with the same name . On Windows I always say yes and it just adds the new pictures to those already in the folder . In OS X it apparently means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover it and replace it with the one you 're dragging .

Updates : John Gruber weighs in , and here 's the exact message in Windows . <p> New update:Robert Scoble put me in touch with Bob Day who had this to say : <p> If the question is just " Why do merge by default ? " , there are lots of answers . <p> 1 . Because it maps well to operations that users are likely trying to accomplish ( see the scenario of dropping a picture folder from a camera ) . 2 . Folder replace can be done by deleting the destination folder first , and then copying . If you have replace be the primary method , then merge becomes a very tedious process . 3 . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a camera that uniquely assigns picture numbers until you reset them becomes very important with this merge behavior . If your pictures are all uniquely named , the default of replacing files with the same name will allow you to not lose any files . <p> Also realize that this is a complicated scenario for most users . Almost any choice is going to be bad for some users . <p> And yes , the behavior is a concious choice . We had to implement this feature in Windows 95 . <p> I followed up that " So before that Windows 95 folders were deleted and overwritten ? " Bob responded : " I need the source code to Windows 3.1 to confirm . Anybody remember " File Manager " ? wow , that is old . " And dug up : <p> Ok , archeological discovery over .

Its called bbPress and is similar to WordPress in a lot of ways , including being Free-as-in-Software . The things that WP does wellunicode , timezones , XHTML , speedit does well too . You can read all about it on the new bbPress site and grok its philosophy , comment on the blog , join the mailing list , checkout the code , submit bugs , patches , et cetera .

Weve learned a lot in the past few years about how the interactive web works , why do most forums look and act the same they did in 2000 ? Why is it still so hard to integrate user systems or mesh designs ? Why cant I ping a thread like I can a weblog post ? Why cant I filter by XFN values ? <p> bbPress is not and will not be right for everyone . There are open source traditional forum packages , like PunBB , that get a lot of things right and push the envelope in interesting ways , so that 's covered . bbPress is not going to have avatars , or put post counts next to your name , or give every user 80 options about how they want their dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that just wo n't work .

@@98356208 @2556208/ <h> PollDaddy Goes Automattic <p> Its another exciting day here at Automattic . Today we finally get to announce that we 've acquired the market-leading poll and survey service PollDaddy . <p> For a year or two now , I 've been minorly obsessed with polls and surveys as a method of lightweight interaction that engages casual users of your website and also can get you some really fun data to play with . I 've also mentioned at a few WordCamps that a polling plugin is one of the top 10 WordPress plugins in the world . Polls are really popular with WordPress users . <p> As we started to look at building out our own service for this , it became more obvious that , while on the surface its a very simple problem , there 's a lot of hidden complexity and opportunities for some really powerful features under the hood . There are probably a dozen companies addressing this space right now , but as we started to survey the space I was struck by how often I 'd see this " PollDaddy " thing pop up . <p> Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with some of the largest and most respected websites using their service on a daily basis . They werent the biggest , but they had the high end of the market . It seemed to be the WordPress of the polling space . <p> I took a secret trip to Sligo and put back a few pints with the team and we decided to make things work . They went to bed every night and woke up every morning thinking about polls and surveys , and were iterating at a great pace . By plugging into Automattics experience at creating internet-scale services and the distribution of WordPress.com , I knew we could take Polldaddy to an entirely new level in a relatively short amount of time . <p> You can read more about the acquisition on the PollDaddy blog , Tonis blog , and the WP.com blog . I 'm super excited to have Lenny and Eoin as part of the Automattic family , and I 'm looking forward to seeing the service flourish with its newfound resources . <p> Just curious if you guys plan on keeping the current pricing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've looked at poll daddy before , but the 10 question limit for free accounts is annoying ( same with surveymonkey ) , especially if you only need to send out a larger survey once or twice a year . <p> just wanted to say that I created a new website based on WordPress ( hybrid CMS/blog ) like my 10th one late last night and when my brain was just about fried , I saw the word " PollDaddy " pop before me . I instantly thought yes , adding a polldaddy poll here would be great . just as it instantly appeared , it vanished . <p> after rolling in bed all night long as is the norm after developing a brand new site i wake up ( early ) and the first word that pops up is " polldaddy " . i skip my usual morning routine and breakfast . typing this in the wordpress plugin search , i can then believe my eyes there 's a polldaddy plugin . <p> i extract the the files . i look at the developer credits . <p> automattic.com <p> little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks , matt and automattic , for sending me a sign ! <p> some things need to be ironed out on the plugin , but knowing that its automattic , itll be essential to almost every WordPress install . <p> We have been using PollDaddy Professional for approx 8 months . I 'm hoping acquisition by Automatic bodes only good things . We are a large US-based media company and despite my original enthusiasm for the product and great 3rd party reviews , reception here has soured . <p> Do n't  get me wrong , it is a lovely , simple interface and we 've got no less than 20 polls going at a time . The trouble is customer service and communication . When I originally inquired about this , I was told that they proactively communicate with clients regarding service outages , regularly scheduled maintenance and ehancement roll outs . Unfortunately , this has not proven to be the case . If and when this very talented team does communicate about issues , it is thru their blog and not with nearly enough specificity . Here are two recent examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) On the morning of 10/8 none of our widgets published . We run anywhere from 10 plus polls a day so this was fairly noticeable . We logged onto the site and looked at the blog . No communication regarding any apparent issues just a notice that there was maintentance time scheduled for October 5th . We sent a note regarding the problem and heard back mid-day on the 9th . Here is the message we got : " Can you save your widget again and copy the new code to where you need it . We have made a change to where the polls are been hosted , which means the old code for the widget is no longer valid . " We had this code which we were relying on in over a dozen places on our site . The maintenance notice made no mention that things like widgets would have to be replaced post move . Had we known we could have easily prepared for this but instead we came into work with half a dozen complaints from folks at our company regarding the tool " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another example also regarding the widget . Up until earlier this week , if you updated via the widget , the change was instantaneous . One day ago this was suddenly no longer the case . Our content producer went in as he normally did to do his update and there was no change . He looked in the blog area to see if perhaps there was a message saying the service was down . No message . Eventually 10 minutes later his update finally appeared on the site . I wrote the polldaddy guys and heard back a day later with the following response from Eon " We are having issues with our encoding for widgets . It has since been fixed . It will now take 10 minutes from the time you edit a poll for changes to be obvious on a site . This is has to do with a cache infrastructure we have recently moved to . We are going to provide a preview of the poll on the PollDaddy site so you can see what changes you make in real time and we hope the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was certainly less of an issue than example 1 , once again , this falls into the example of something she should specifically and proactively tell the customer . I have half a dozen other examples I 'd be happy to share with you . <p> Paying power users like ourselves need better communication . It should also be proactively delivered via email and the admin interface where we log in . It should also contain practical details regarding potential impact . <p> I really believed in the product and am getting increasing criticism here at work for going with what is being perceived as an unreliable and unprofessional company . <p> I would like to sincerely apologize for the frustration you have experienced in the past few weeks with Polldaddy support . We have been extremely busy moving our servers into our new home @automattic and I fully accept that we have been poor at times communicating this move . We did not expect there to be any downtime of any of our products but we were wrong . All of this moving will make for a much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our users . If you contact me directly at lenny @ polldaddy.com I will be happy to jump on the phone with you and sort out any issues you are having . <p> Things should be a lot more stable as we move them to Automattic infrastructure , just like WordPress.com which is relied on by CNN , Fox News , Time , etc . I 'm sorry for the trouble the transition has caused . 
@@98356210 @2556210/ <p> Its also important to read Paul Grahams Acceleration of Addictiveness where he compares addictive technology to alcohol and cigarettes , society developed " antibodies " to the danger of cigarettes , but it took about a hundred years , and technology is changing much faster than that now . <p> The most prescient here is Neil Postmans Amusing Ourselves to Death , originally published in 1985 . Its long , but I 'm going to quote the foreword in its entirety because its worth reading a few times over : <p> We were keeping our eye on 1984 . When the year came and the prophecy did n't  , thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves . The roots of liberal democracy had held . Wherever else the terror had happened , we , at least , had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares . <p> But we had forgotten that alongside Orwells dark vision , there was another slightly older , slightly less well known , equally chilling : Aldous Huxleys Brave New World . Contrary to common belief even among the educated , Huxley and Orwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression . But in Huxleys vision , no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy , maturity and history . As he saw it , people will come to love their oppression , to adore the technologies that undo their wanted to read one . Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information . Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism . Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us . Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance . Orwell feared we would become a captive culture . Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture , preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies , the orgy porgy , and the centrifugal bumblepuppy . As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert to oppose tyranny " failed to take into account mans almost infinite appetite for distractions " . In 1984 , Huxley added , people are controlled by inflicting pain . In Brave New World , they are controlled by inflicting pleasure . In short , Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us . Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us . <p> This book is about the possibility that Huxley , not Orwell , was right . <h> Related 14594 @qwx874594 <h> 42 thoughts on " Culture of Distraction " <p> I re-read Postmans rather prescient book every once in awhile since its so short and the arguments about Las Vegas are so funny and dead-on . <p> Anyway , those of us in journalism are constantly having to rethink what our place in the world is in a time of content oversaturation . <p> Watergate was a big story that was broken because information was too scarce ; it required that reporters suss out and connect dots and knock on doors to bring information to light . <p> Our new world is one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to data journalism and the intersection of programming/journalists who can use big data to discover trends , make it understandable , visualize the masses of information , etc . <p> So the former information " gatekeepers " are thinking about this , the fact that as a society we 've given over our free ability to think over to a technologically driven hegemony . To that end , I 'm more concerned about what it does to how we act as individuals . If you have n't seen this documentary , you must : <p> I 'm Norwegian . And these days , were trialing the mass murderer of Ut+ya , where 76 young lives were lost after the repulsive shooting , plus 7 killed , due to the bomb in our governmental area . We promised then that our response should be more demcoracy , more tranparency . Well , that 's what our Prime Minister said the following days of July 22nd , 2011 . <p> I fear the opposite is happening , somewhat in accordance to what Huxley described . We have only two nationwide TV stations . Both are delivering continous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 2012 from Norway : <p> 1 . Everybody almost cheered when an Iraqi threw a shoe towards the accused in court two weeks ago . The Iraqi lost his brother at Ut+ya , and were in Oslo solely to follow the trial . This behaviour were very understanding ! At least in regard the Iraqi state of mind versus our almost 2000 years of constitutional traditions . But throwing a shoe is not susceptible , in regard of the courts security check , its so-called bomb-proof safety-measures and secured court yard , etc . In short , we were prepared for the worst , and nobody did n't  even care to ask why such a petty incident could take place ? <p> Not even the media ! <p> Are we appropriately prepared ? Or is the worldwide , security business the new Soviet Union in disguise ? <p> 2 . Paris Match printed last week pictures from the casualities at Ut+ya in July , 2011 . Not plausilbe , by all means . In the aftermath however , we insisted on the freedom of the press and speech ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , because the Norewegian Embassy in Damascus , Syria were torched to ruins by an infuriated mob in 2006 . Norewegian flags were burnt in numerous countries by an angry Moslem mob , too . The reason : A small , Christian paper in Oslo had printed some charicatures of the prophet Muhammad , which originated from Denmarks largest paper , JyllandsPosten . <p> After we had violated their feelings in 2006 , we insisted on the freedom of the press . Even more so , last summer . <p> Now , when our feelings are violated , Paris Match were denied distribution nationwide in Norway . Nobody questioned the incident ! And by all means , not in shed of what our Secretary of Foreign Affairs defined as a democratic Gold Standard in 2006 . <p> Not even the media ! <p> Which freedom is violated by whom in regard of such double standard ? <p> That 's in my opinion what Huxleys novel is all about . Ive been thinking of Orwell lately , when I shouldve thought about Huxley ! Thanks for reminding me about that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Matt used this essay to also announce his company 's new comment push notification feature for iOS app-enabled devices such as iPhone , iPod Touch , and iPad . Hmmm ? Now , while some might consider this a paradoxical juxtaposition " the ultimate of postmodern marketing " he still makes some insightful and important points to consider . Especially when it comes to education . After all , how are we teaching students ( as well as parents and adults ) to pay attention and respond appropriately in a culture of distraction ? Could it be that the high-tech solutions we love , require taking more slow-tech time to process what we learn , how we live , and why we 're doing what we 're doing ? <p> I teach alternative HS students in MI . The lack of attention-span in school has diminished dramatically in the pat 2 years alone as the level of distraction has increased . Students do not think they can make it one hour without checking their texts , messages , etc . Talk about distracted ! It never ends . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely limiting their input of knowledge in school . Its very hard to combat this invader . <p> Hey Matt , props to you for pointing this out both here and in the Pando interview . Your reasoning is why I still do n't  own a smartphone today . After years of watching friends and family absorbed in their phones at social gatherings , I 've made it a personal goal to avoid distractions . <p> I find it ironic that while everyone is more connected nowadays to what is happening across the globe , they 're less connected to their immediate surroundings . And I 'd say they 're missing what 's important . <p> A very thought provoking post.A couple of points spring to mind from Andy Adams remark about smart phones . The first paradox is a vision of people in a crowded environment , with ample opportunities of talking and interacting with real people , yet prefering to " chat " with their virtual friends . The second paradox is that while our children probably do more writing voluntarily than ever before , through the nimbleness of their thumbs , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not familiar with " text speak " . <p> It might well be a Huxley -then- Orwell , not a -vs- : the one is a precursor to the other . Once a Huxleyian state has been achieved ; a crowd of well-organised folk might direct and tip that harmony towards an Orwellian state with relative ease ? There will be little or no resistance since the tools of resistance and awareness will largely be lost . An " easy picking " if there ever was one <p> Mixed in that battle is the battle against ADD/ADHD . I think if we can effectively cope with distractions , and more- equip the next generation to handle it better than we are- we can sharpen our awareness and prevent either state from happening LONG ... <p> I remember reading Huxley and having nightmares about it . As I got older , I realized that a lot of his paranoia was inspired by his fondness for psychedelics . Either way , I preferred Brave New World to 1984 if I have a choice , I 'll skip the pain , thank you very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while watching TV = <p> As a Senior , I am so pleased to see this conversation taking place . I managed to teach myself a little DOS in 89 and then I moved along into Bill Gates user friendly world . Now , I am overcoming the initial intimidation of WordPress . I do n't  think my blogging has totally distracted me , but it has come close . I have been distracted ( and overwhelmed at times ) by the techy culture . I have been wondering whatever happened to those hours with a book in a linear world . And I am so very pleased that folks like you , much younger than I , have inspired me to go back now and read Huxley again . I think I shall worry a little less about the virtues of low tech . Your conversation has done good things for this old fart . Thanks . <p> I am not sure that technology is the culprit . We have the ability to choose to engage others but to be truely authentic we must connect with their welfare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , step over and talk over each other without the slightest apology . The phone or technology becomes an excuse we hide behind to justify our failure to put others before ourselves . <p> The hard part these days is making a name for yourself or doing half the jobs in existance without OVER-STIMULATING yourself . I find its nearly impossible to blog , keep up w/Facebook , Twitter , text msgs. , email , etc . It leaves such little time for LIVING LIFE ! I agree , too much of what we LOVE can rob us of living , as much as too much of what we hate . Being mindful of your TIME plugged to a gadget is key . I keep wondering if this generation is going to have an epiphany and just go OFFLINE and start going back to the outdoors and indoors of real life . You know , do things the old fashion way , pick up the phone and call someone that you actually know and forget about the rest . Timely post indeed and great blog too ! <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea , where something worse has transpired . We in the free world may have been distracted when that year passed and we still had our liberty . <p> I am semi-retired . Thanks for this post . I mean really thanks . It makes sense that you would focus on iPhones , texting , etc . I do n't  have an iPhone and my cell is set not to receive texts period . That 's old-fashioned I know , but I 've noted that even at 71 , I have been overly-drawn to the Internet . TV is still high on the list of distractors . As an old English major I worry about the fate of literature and the long novel that requires patience and commitment even the short , profound poem that demands immense concentration , something I seem to have less and less of . The Tortoise has much to tell us of life and living as he slogs across the field at his infinitesimally slow and steady pace . Where he is going is just about as urgent as where we humans are going . Thanks again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I can tell you about the year 1984 , it was chilling when the film came out . Its important to watch it , now . This one ?

This is Newspeak , Matt. http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=eYyN6GmzWI I think you see the kind of massthink when you look at twitter ? But WordPress , because of the search strings ?

At about four this morning I got a comment on an old entry that said : <p> Well , I just wanted to sign a blog on the first time in my life : ) ) <p> Kind of cute , right ? Isnt that nice that some guy , " James Hatchkinson , " came across my site and was so enamored that he decided to leave a comment , his frist ever .

Clue #1 . <p> The URL he left as his with his comment is nositeyet.com , which I 'm not going to link because this may be this spams whole point .

" People I know have left similar things for their URL in the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web company with a hideous flash intro and an equally mediocre web site . Hmmmmm . Clue #2 . <p> Clue #3 , each comment came from radically different IP addresses . Let 's give this guy incredible benefit of the doubt and say just maybe he was a newbie user who just came upon an old entry , left a silly comment with what he thought was a fake website , and then continued browsing to another one of my sites , went to a slightly old entry , and left the same comment . So why did his IP change ? The first comment came from 195.200.168.250 , which resolves to anaconda.pacwan.net , and the second from 80.58.4.44 , which is a proxy of some sort . Most users , especially the type that would leave this sort of comment , do n't  randomly start using proxies mid-browsing .

But here 's what you do , your pages need to check for things inside the browser . Things like Javascript and maybe a plugin or two .

I do n't  know the default setting for the " Site Navigation Bar " is for Mozilla , but to make sure its on go " View &gt; Show/Hide &gt; Site Navigation Bar &gt; Show Only As Needed " to make sure you 'll see what all the fuss is about . <p> First , it was very tricky hard to get this all working with my current setup ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it can be integrated into WordPress , but the steps I had to take were so convoluted that I doubt that any of this will make it into the next release . Anyway the first useful link that came to mind would be " bookmark , " something I specify the rel attribute on my permalink tags but no current browser picks up . So for example the bookmark link for this entry would be like so : <p> &lt;link rel= " bookmark " href= " /p620 " title= " LINK Navigation " /&gt; <p> For any index , individual , archive , or category page you look at on the journal part of this site there will be a set of bookmark links to each of the entries on the page . I have created similar links for commenting and trackbacking entries , that personally Ive found to be an extremely efficient way to get around . Check under your " More " menu in Mozilla to see it all . Mozilla also links nicely to the alternative representations of the content , such as RSS , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really should link to the specific representation of only the content on the current page , so for example the comments page could link to its unique RSS 2 feed . <p> Then some basic navigation elements were in order . The logic of these should be apparent from the code , but there is a link pointing to the top page of this site , a link to the search page , the FAQ , information about myself , and finally copyright information . When you are browsing a single entry you are offered links to the previous and next entry , as well as to the very first entry . This could be expanded once date-based archives are available to allow you to browse from month to month or day to day . Once you start using it , you 'll wonder how you ever navigated any other way . <p> Finally I set the categories to be " sections , " though I 'm not sure if I 'm entirely comfortable with this . If you envision all of the text of this blog as a document , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but after that its open for interpretation . Should categories be sections or chapters ? Could chapters be say , month-based archives ? What if I wanted some arbitrary division of chapters , say by whatever relationship I was in at the time ? Sub-sections seem ill-defined as you cant seem to define several sub-sections as a child of a section , though I may simply need to explore this further . Also I am feeling slightly constrained by the software I use to manage everything , but it would be fascinating to see how someone without those constraints such as Tantek could do with his structure . Ideally some common set of relationships specific to the organization of a weblogmuch like the goal of the Weblog Metadata Initiative ( whered they go ? ) could be agreed upon and implemented by default by the authors of the most common software and templates . Several people already implement a bit of this already , for example Mark , but there is a lot of unrealized potential here . <p> Opera is able to use all of the standard defined links @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IE of course is oblivious to it all . Mozilla gets everything . If you have any information on other browsers let me know . I should be defining the extra rel attributes in a profile document , but there are only a few hours left before I 'm supposed to " wake up " for my classes tomorrow , so some sleep may be in order . <p> I must admit that I have n't touched Opera for some time now , and I never really took it htat seriously as a browser . Tracking its market share is tough because out of the box it identifies as IE6 out of the box , but I always figured that there was just too much wrong with it for it to be that popular . What a surprise their latest version is ! Not only is it blazingly fast like it has always been , it has what I would count as the best designed user interface I have seen thus far in a browser . IE is weak . Phoenix was better . SlimBrowser makes IE nice but puts too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good ol Mozilla has become my main browser for the past couple of weeks and I cant complain . Out of the blue comes Opera , with a interface so dandy I feel like I might be in OS X ( someday ) if the garish start bar at the bottom of my screen did n't  bring me back to reality . The only thing chapping me is the banner , but I would have no problem supporting such finely done software even it was n't my primary browser , just to encourage its development . I cant begin to detail all of the nice touches theyve put into the interface , just try it out . Its only a 3.2 MB download without Java ! ( And who needs Java anyways ? )

On the same day Blogger releases gorgeous XHTML+CSS tempates from Doug and the crew , Google releases its blog with a table-based layout and funky HTML 4 ( with no doctype ) .

Huh ? The reviews had some left-handed compliments ( " for advanced users only " ) but one mentioned getting hooked on the companys other products as well .

These things were too cheap my assumption was it was a Chinese OEM like Zyxel that makes novel but ultimately not the best quality products . <p> At this point I should confess I 'm a bit of a consumer networking geek its a hobby of mine . I really enjoy upgrading peoples routers so they have better range in parts of the house they did n't  before , getting them a DOCSIS 3.0 modem so their connection is faster ( and buying it so they do n't  pay an exorbitant rental fee to their cable company ) , everything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can Airplay things , showing how you can set up two APs with the same SSID and clients will just connect to whatever they 're closest to , you do n't  need each one to have a unique SSID , you can give the 2.4ghz and 5ghz networks the same SSID , Time Machine for backups , setting up failover internet with multiple connections or a USB LTE stick I redo all my home stuff about once every 18 months , and then take the best of what Ive learned and set up friends . I 'm constantly updating firmware . My current best practice setup is Sonos for all audio , usually streaming from Spotify or SiriusXM , a Peplink Balance One router , Netgear Nighthawk R9000 access points ( though I liked the ASUS AC66U just as much ) , if I need a switch I 'll go for a higher-end managed one that support spanning tree protocol ( STP ) properly because otherwise the way the Sonos does bridging can spaz out and overload your network , Nest themostat and smoke detectors , Smartthings for everything else .

That said , they 're impossible to buy without going through a terrible reseller , so I 've never been able to justify using it at home . <p> Back to Ubiquiti . First I come across their forums/community sites , which are ugly and sprawling and full of amazing info from people who do wireless deployments across all of the top companies like Aruba , Ruckus , Aerohive , Xirrus , Meraki . You see people making builds for alternative UPNP packages and that going into their core release months later . ( Everything is Debian based , from what I can tell . ) The company is based in San Jose that went public a few years ago , and is now worth about 3.7B , and the founder ( formerly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have gotten their start with long-haul point-to-point wireless radios that can go dozens of kilometers , which makes sense why their APs would be known for their range .

Even Ubiquitis AC product , which is $300 , is much , much cheaper than the Meraki MR34 which costs $1,400 and requires a yearly license or it stops working . <p> Plus they make these wonderfully cheesy product promo videos : <p> Normally I would n't post about something until I 've tried it in-person , but I was excited to find this whole new ( to me ) world of high-performance , reasonable-cost devices . John Pozazidides , long-time WP community member , did an overview of the Unifi devices on Youtube .

We bought all the equipment from http : //www.radiolabs.com , also from California .

I use their long range M5s to join my home with my photo studio 3km . Get perfect speeds , only need the one internet connection , and Remote Desktop works a treat because of the speed ( which has been invaluable with an 8-week old baby &amp; working from home ) .

Ayrstone has some great products for out of town and rural use for the non technical person . <p> I have the router and the AC AP . Was able to get the AP for free but I would of happily paid for it . Have a 150mbit fios connection and almost any sub 200$ router I tried just could n't keep up . The edgemax stays under 5% cpu with 20+ devices and 30+ VMS maxing out the connection . The AP is faster and gets far better range than my meraki I just wish you did n't  need to install software on a machine for it to run . Thankfully someone has made a port for for synology so I just run it on that , It is a little tricky to setup at first but they now have wizards to assist . Having a router you can ssh in and install using apt is awesome too . Have used MTR on it with verizon before to help resolve issues . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and at home too ) . Mostly the AC products , but I have a half dozen or so of the regular N pro wifi points too . They work great ! Far better than the Cisco/Linksys small business WAP4410n points that required daily reboots to stay active . The best part I 've found ( aside from the price point ) is the software that is included , but completely free it allows you to upload blue-prints/maps and chart out where your points are for rough estimates of coverage area , track granularly which users are on which APs block/reconnect them individually , see history of connections , tell who is on what radio , configure/provision new points easily , etc Honestly , its pretty killer . The ability to see " hey , this point has 300 users on it no wonder it is dead now " is awesome . You can track who is using what amount of bandwidth , how long they 've been active , if they are idle , etc as well . <p> The biggest advantage of Ubiquiti Unifi access points is their ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very expensive . This AP will be very useful in dense/multi-AP deployment scenarios where packet loss due to interference is common . I wonder if this company will someday disrupt the enterprise market .

They allowed me to hang out with them last October for a few days while they were field testing the hardware while I was working on a related research paper . They had hacked the software and hardware to adapt everything to their environment , and subsequently had improved performance and QOS . As their CEO told me , the hardware was so affordable , they could afford to deploy enough kit to deliver broadband to the masses at around 6 bucks a month , including a Netflix like streaming service . Sadly , the Kenya government has so far refused to grant them an operators license , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what I saw and experienced , I can tell you , Ubiquiti rules . <p> It is cool to see that you recently discovered Ubiquiti and think they are as cool as I do .

We have a 3 year old Juniper wireless system that is very similar to Aruba , Aerohive , Meraki , and Ruckus . I wanted to upgrade it , but they feature high priced access points , plus the licensing , plus the controller . I shopped around and discovered Ubiquiti like yourself . I bought four of their long range APs to work in some hard to reach areas of the dorms midway through the year and they have worked great . The controller software is intuitive , flexible and informative . It is only needed to set up the access points and collect stats , but the APs will run without the controller once they are provisioned . <p> This summer I bought 51 of the UniFi AP Pros ( 17 3-packs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Another discovery I made this past year that you may be interested in is Untangle.com .

I tell him about the trouble I 've had registering for Startup Essentials , he says hell note that and pass it on . <p> 3 months since : Complete silence , punctuated by frequent Sun press releases and AP stories about how they 're great for startups , probably millions of dollars of PR . <p> Seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Web 2.0 " just makes Sun seem that much more out of touch with reality and desparate to jump on hype which has already passed . <p> I 'm not writing this , as Joyent did , with the hope of connecting with someone at Sun that will take my money .

Were growing fast and adding infrastructure faster , all on a tight budget , and I 'm less inclined to depart from the LAMP-based architecture that Digg , Flickr , Wikipedia , and dozens of other sites I respect use . <p> This is also what I 've started advising other startups , if we had trouble getting anything going I cant imagine what trouble a brand new startup with a smaller profile would go through .

" I say these in quotes because in a lot of ways they still do n't  get it . They loved the day when startups poured thousands down on expensive setups that where either way more then they needed , or not flexible enough to change . I wont say Sun is one of these businesses but they seem to be showing that . <p> Modern startups seem to be better grounded and less spend the money with no return in sight . <p> Sun stopped being important years ago . x86-based hardware rapidly closed the performance gap between normal desktop hardware and Suns overpriced workstations , Java never ended up selling more of that Sun hardware , and Solaris was sent to the UNIX retirement home once Linux became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products does Sun have anymore ? The products that defined them , Java , Sparc and Solaris , are fading or have faded . There 's not much left to Sun but the shine of its former glory . Its a rudderless boat trying to fight the tide of open standards and interoperability . Youd think they would have learned something from IBM . <p> I 've also always been fascinated by the inability of businesses to take my money . They spend millions marketing to me , then totally fumble when I want to close the deal . How many times a day do you stand in line to pay someone ? Does n't  that bug you ? <p> Jesse , in their defense they do offer x86 hardware , some of it at pretty reasonable prices . Solaris is more interesting since they open-sourced it , but honestly I think well just wait for ZFS to be ported to Linux . <p> Suns got a huge hill to climb to get their hardware and Solaris back on the radar of startups . <p> ZFS , though , is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting to store huge volumes of content on dirt cheap hardware . Once its on Linux , ZFS is going to clean house of ext3 and reiser . <p> I 'm not sure its going to have a big impact on Suns bottom line or adoption of Solaris , but they 're still innovating and shipping the results . <p> I sympathize with the issues you are having with the Sun program , but my company uses Sun in a number of key areas and we are very happy with their support . As for the prognostication of some of the comments , Suns recent number point to just the opposite of the uninformed comments here . Java is in fact on more devices than all the major operating systems combined . In addition , Suns T2000 server just won server of the year award for their new CMT technology . Finally Sun is innovating like crazy not only in SPARC and Solaris , but also with their X86 based systems , which have also been winning awards right and left . <p> So again , hopefully Sun will get their act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do your homework before making generalizations . <p> I worked at Sun for a while . I think that Sun got lucky twice ( what 's the old saw ? " Better to be lucky than good anyday " ) , once with " The Network is the Computer " and again with their positioning ( Telcos ) for the first dot-com boom . I believe their now desperate to try to get lucky again and are shovelling ideas out there to see what sticks . <p> The mistakes in strategy ( Dawdling about Solaris on x86 for 15 years , focus on " Big Enterprise Iron " ) , a total failure to understand what customers wanted ( Scott once ripped someone who called Sun a " solutions company " and told him that Suns a technology company ) , a failure to get any viable software strategy going and the leakage of their good people have really crippled that company and many business units are adrift , disconnected from the other parts of their business , which compounds the problem . <p> Suns a good company , with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do well but I 'm afraid that they have little expertise and ability to execute . <p> I do n't  get people who bitch about Sun , but do n't  get near the marketing attention from say a Gentoo or Canonical . Most who use Gentoo or Ubuntu simply download it , use it , and self support it . But Sun is supposed to come to your house , pull down your pants , and kiss your ass in person ? Please . <p> I am also tired of people fawning over some killer feature in some OS or distro and switching all of their systems to it , rather than just saying " wait until they port it to my favorite distro " , but holding other OSs to a different standard . <p> The double standards become boring , and give you guys zero credibility . You would rather bitch about something than try to improve things . <p> " I downloaded it and it would n't install on my XYZ motherboard . " I remember those days on Linux . And back then if you complained , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just write a script " , or " If it does n't  work , write your own driver " . My , how times have changed . <p> Download Solaris and try it . You do n't  need Sun to come and do it for you . If you like it , use it . But like any OS change , it will take some work to change over to using it . If you do n't  like it , then fine . <p> ZFS , Dtrace , Zones , Fire Engine IP stack , all awesome stuff . Zones does not get enough attention as a security feature . And more stuff coming like Crossbow . If you want innovation at the OS level , this is it . If you want compatibility with 1,000 of systems , Linux is good . <p> And by the way , most Sun x86 hardware ends up running Linux , and running it very well . <p> Sun may be most relevant to startups in the following way people leaving Sun to create startups and put ideas into practice more quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun sometimes bringing those back into the fold through acquisitions . <p> Our founder and myself both came out of Sun and we have a rapidly growing software business for optimization of data-intensive cluster and Grid computing . <p> We have had success partnering with them , not always easy , it depends greatly on the individual relationships you form in the business units and field , much more so than the programs . <p> Hey Mark , I totally agree they have some great technology and some brilliant people there , and I 'm not asking to be hand-held through Solaris , but I 'd rather they make no promises at all than make promises and repeatedly break them . <p> Its totally possible my case was an anomaly and I was the only one of thousands of startups that did n't  have a good experience with them , but I 'm guessing its indicative of a deeper problem , a disconnect between the tech gurus and leadership at Sun and the people behind these programs . <p> I was administering a few sun/solaris/sparc sites in the dot-com times , and felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ databases on them ( cold fusion apps/apache web servers ) . The few PCs with MS/SQL were more problematic and difficult . I felt like that 's kind of decadent now- that we even had competing systems . The Solaris decision it was more expensive getting developers , but the geek &amp; free community were far more involved , than the MSFT one . At that point in time MSFT was really not scalable . <p> I had more tangles with Oracle , as customer support , licensing , weird installations , stuff like that- really than sun . <p> This is n't from a hardware perspective , though my boss managed that aspect and he did grumble quite a bit . I knew a few other startups that were buying Sparcs , or had them lying around , but they were ex-employees . <p> The problems with Sun marketing vs technology do n't  end with startups . Over the years we have pumped a lot of money into Sun and for several reasons will keep doing so on a small scale , but Sun needs a major reality check . ZFS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for production now while Sun has been pushing it for well over a year . Most companies want proven technology and LAMP has proven its worth . Solaris 10 , not yet . The techies will admit this , but marketing is pushing it hard . <p> It just happens too often that Sun comes up with a solution looking for a problem . Sorry , its a beautiful solution but when it does n't  solve my problem I do n't  care ! <p> Mark : Sometimes it would be nice if Sun would deign to sell things to small customers though . The incredible amount of hassle I had just trying to buy some servers from them was immense . It took weeks for me to find someone whod fill the order . <p> Matt , of course every situation is unique and it seems that you did n't  get the particular alignment/support you were looking forhowever I can say that our start-up experience with Sun over the last 18 months has been nothing short of fantastic . Best of luck with your new venture . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How anyone can say building a datacenter into a cargo container that ranks in the worlds top 200 supercomputers and can be deployed anywhere in the world quickly and easily has missed the point . <p> This may not be for every company , but the idea that they can have this on your doorstep possibly within 24 hours , and get your datacenter back online after a complete failure shows they are still in the game . <p> I run a startup that *WAS* accepted into the SE program . I would say we are going to purchase a Thumper within the next 3 months . There is a 60% plus markdown off the device compared to MSRP . WTF is that ? In this day and age , Sun a company billing itself as the iron behind Web 2.0 , still plays the " get as much as you can for it " sales game ? ? ? I mean seriously , as if people do n't  talk and share pricing or use search engines . Instead we are forced to play this ridiculous shell game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Put one price up . Make it fair , make some money on it but for crying out loud , cut this 1960s salesman deal crap . <p> Bureaucracy in all its forms can be difficult , and getting nothing but PR hot air for months and an email misspelling your name is n't the best way to build relationships . But I can say that Sun does have a commitment to assisting startups , I can say that because I work for Sun , and am now responsible for our startup customers in San Francisco . <p> The underlying need for any IT technology- be it a server or a LAMP based web architecture- is to create a dependable platform that can provide a service . The combination of technologies is really going to depend on the needs of company , and the users . A large big iron server is n't going to be the answer to every technical need just as much as a small whitebox server is n't going to be the answer to every workload demand . That being said , Sun provides some innovative products that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it more dependable . Want to deploy a LAMP architecture ? Awesome- Sun has products that can host that at a more dependable and affordable level than almost any other option out there . Interested in deploying apps in a secure , flexible and easily virtualizable environment that 's open sourced ? Download OpenSolaris . At the end of the day , technology for technologys sake wont help a startup be successful . Technology has to address not just the technical needs of an organization ; it has to address the business needs of the organization . <p> I feel our products value and price truly do shine- and startup customers using Sun demonstrate this . Joyent does run their Rails architecture on Solaris and have done an incredible job using it as a platform to deploy their services . Those apps are n't  running on Dell servers anymore , they 're LONG ... <p> I cant defend the way your case was handled , but I can say Sun is committed to our startup customers- and I can demonstrate its not all just PR fluff <p> Matt , thanks posting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . As someone who works for Sun in the OpenSolaris kernel group , it was a difficult post to read , as were most of the ensuing comments . But as sobering as it was to read , I 'm glad you took the time to write it and I do hope you 'll take a second look at what were doing because I know from a technology standpoint there 's an incredible amount of activity which addresses the needs that startups have today and in their future . However , were also aware of how far we need to go . Thanks for the honesty . <p> You do n't  have to use ZFS and Zones to use Solaris 10 . If you want proven filesystem technology , UFS is a very , very stable filesystem . And Solaris 10 running with a single , Global Zone ( i.e. , the default ) is exactly like every other UNIX OS namespace structure . The point is , you can use Solaris 10 the same way as Solaris 9 , or Linux , without Solaris 10s advanced features , and adopt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in February 2005 , the same month as RHEL 4 . Public early access to Solaris 10 , via Solaris Express , occurred a few weeks after the official release of the Linux 2.6 kernel . Solaris 10 is just as proven as RHEL 4 , and Solaris 10 kernel is just as proven as the Linux 2.6 kernel . <p> Solaris development approach drives compatibility and stability first , at the cost of speed of feature add . <p> Perhaps Sun marketing is pushing the advanced features of Solaris 10 , but certainly Red Hat does the same with those features which differentiate RHEL , Novell does the same with SLES , etc . <p> There are good reasons for not using Solaris 10 . Compatibility with new hardware and speed of feature add are two of them . Feature overshoot may be another ( do I really need a 128-bit filesystem ? ) . Certainly the lack of tools like apt-get and Red Carpet is a big factor . But lack of being proven is not one of them . <p> Oh , and all of the complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company is just not structured to do that . And because of that , pursuing all startups simultaneously is not a good marketing strategy for Sun . <p> To digress on a parallel path , I 'd think that it would take time for Jonathan Schwartz to steer the sunny ship in the right direction , but guys , let 's give a round of applause to a big old skool gorilla ( Sun ) for trying to breakdance to hip hop or rock to . I mean , I 'd like to , by comparison and for illustrations sake , see Steve Ballmer &amp; co. blog openly like Schwartz , release the Windows kernel under an OSI license and GPL2 C#2.0 . Try getting the same response from HP or IBM . Open source HPUX or AIX or OS/2 ? Fergettaboutit ! Give them time guys .

I think Sun is taking a model of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their money and trying to apply it here wondering why it wont work . <p> Sun has great products , but start up . coms are looking only to avoid being victims of their own success . The biggest reason this happens is due to your hosting platform not being able to scale and adapt cheaply . <p> Since you are n't  going to really start monetizing until the end of the first year , cashflow is king and Linux is cheap . Sun cant help this effort beyond Open Solaris without shooting themselves in the foot . <p> The first ingredient for making things work is a good plan . Looks like Sun forgot that entirely and started with the cart before the horse . <p> I just found out yesterday that the Storagetek ( now Sun ) disk array I purchased in the not so distant past is not supported any more .. I cant get drive trays , I cant get drivesforget it . Suns only solution is to replace the equipment we paid in the 5 digits for with gear that will cost even more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for the little guy .

But something makes this radical proposal so exciting that people and governments are increasingly willing to try it . Basic income challenges our notions of the social safety net , the relationship between work and income , and how to adapt to technological change . That makes it one of the most audacious social policy experiments in modern history . It could fail disastrously , or it could change everything for the better . <h> 10 thoughts on " 538 on Basic Income " <p> There have been research projects on guaranteed incomes , and some countries are considering their own experiments . This was discussed in a recent Freaknomics podcast : http : **35;850;TOOLONG <p> My family and I are involved in the charity work that humanitarian and spiritual leader Amma does throughout the world .

Ammas reaction was simply " Our job is to build them homes . Their job is to do whatever they do . " I found her statement quite profound , and if it is the right thing to guarantee all people some basic level of subsistence , we should find a way to do it . At the very least , the willingness to test this concept seems the human thing to do . <p> It occurs to me that this is the economic equivalent of open source code : everyone is provided the resources to build their life/career/skills .

Ultimately , creating private welfare states for a part of the global workforce like unions forced the US auto companies to do for a time or like Google is doing now out of self-interest including with special buses in San Francisco , will not solve the global issues of the economic challenge of rising productivity in the face of limited demand ( including from concentration of wealth ) .

I did n't  have as much time to put into the print ( PDF ) version of the paper this time , but its still a nicer way to read it than the HTML below . <p> Every human action is at its root a selfish act ; even acts that are altruistic on the surface are primarily motivated by a deeper selfishness or so a psychological egoist would say . Psychological Egoism is a descriptive theory that rather than suggesting , as ethical or rational egoism does , how people ought to live , suggests how people actually go about their lives . The assumptive nature of the theory introduces a number of possible avenues for refutation , some of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments for psychological egoism states that even though on the surface one persons acts might appear selfish and another persons acts might appear unselfish , in both cases each person is just doing what they want to do , which is inherently selfish . If S donates money to the poor , then S is donating money because that 's what S wants to do . Of course , if helping others is what S wants to do , that is what would generally be defined as altruism , but for a psychological egoist that does n't  counteract the fact that S wanted to do it . Some actions could also be said to be done through a sense of duty rather than a desire , such as paying your insurance or having a bad tooth removed , neither of which is an immediately attractive proposition ; its self-interest , not selfishness . This argument may be countered as still being motivated by larger selfish goals . Anyway a deeper problem should be immediately apparent , as in the course of trying to justify psychological egoism , the theory has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivation for our actions is what we are motivated to do . This is not terribly meaningful in terms of describing human nature . <p> A second argument for psychological egoism suggests that people just do what makes them feel good , thereby making all acts selfish . For example , you might help a turtle across a highway because if you did n't  you would be distressed about its well-being crossing the road . So in order to feel good about yourself , you help the turtle cross the road . The problem with this is it sounds like it is describing an unselfish person , one that derives pleasure from helping others . A selfish person most likely would n't have been terribly concerned for the turtle in the first place . Also , if we look to the deeper motivations of the turtle helpers actions , as the psychological egoists tend to do , and ask why the person derives satisfaction from helping others in general and the turtle specifically , you will most likely run into the conclusion that the person cares about what happens to others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of argument is in fact a confusion of the object of desire and ancillary results of the consummation of that desire ; if once you get married you are extremely satisfied , that does not necessarily suggest that you got married with the desire for that satisfaction in mind , rather the satisfaction is a function of your desire for marriage , and would not exist otherwise . <p> Psychological egoism is a particularly persuasive theory because at its core it is impossible to empirically prove it wrong . However , it is just as hard to empirically prove it right , or to prove its opposite wrong for that matter , and therein lies its fallacy . Once the premises of psychological egoism are accepted , every action can be interpreted to support it . Like the spouse who youve decided is cheating , every action which otherwise may be perfectly innocent is held in question and may be construed in a way that supports your hypothesis but is not true to the action itself . The problem is that psychological egoism rests on the question of moral motivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore psychological egoism is a closed theory , one that rejects competing theories on its own terms and is non-verifiable and non-falsifiable.1 At most psychological egoism could allow you to describe your own motivation for every action , but it would be shallow to try and reduce the incredible breadth of human motivation down to one for the sake of the simplicity in an inherently flawed theory . <p> That 's how long it took to generate the page . I 'm using it for some debugging right now . The problem with psychological egoism is n't so much that it says that people act selfishly , which few would deny , it says that every action all the time is purely selfish , which is a shallow view of human motivations . <p> That was a nice write up ! But I still believe in some altruistic actions . There are times we do thing , not for the sake of ourselves , we even get pain from such acts , yet we go ahead to do it for the sake of others . <p> i was having a hard time understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i came across your paper , it simplified it for me ( thanks ) , but I do hope that we as humans can prove this theory wrong and that we do things out of the good of our hearts , not just because we can benefit from our good deeds . <p> Not a bad paper , but if you do n't  mind me pointing out a mistake or two , i .. er , will . <p> In the paragraph that starts " a second argument for " you seem to confuse ( or conflate ) " self-interest " and " selfishness " , though i suspect this is more from undiciplined use of language since you point out this difference above . <p> Any objection to psychological egoism that mentions pleasure felt for any other sake than self-interest is a stawman , it argues against something psychological egoism is n't saying . <p> Also , the last bit , about the " incredible breadth of human " is unsupported . <p> Anyway , that 's all , if it helped at all . I do mean this to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking with stuff like logical fallacy , closed theory , pseudoscientific , and truism when countering psych egoism . Makes it easier and you do n't  have to get bogged down in their terminology . I <p> I would just like to say that I know of one action which I find 100 percent unselfish . Prayer . When you pray for the people you love and care about to feel better or be happy , there is nothing in it for you . I pray nightly for my friends which I have n't seen in years . Their happiness , which I am praying for , does not affect me at all . I am praying solely for their benefit , and I mean that with my whole heart . So , psychological egoism is fale and very flawed . <p> @Lacey . Praying for friends is still selfish . People in general like to have positivity around them , which usually means its beneficial to want to have those around you happy . So your desire to make them happy is ultimately still a desire to make yourself happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be happy , because you have a desire to be what you perceive to be a " good person " . Theres two possible motives right there . <p> One could argue that you can not pray about others ( there for caring about them ) just to satisfy your self-interest and also be selfish , right ? Because then you care about the self-interest of them also , <p> Although you nor I are the center of the universe , every day MUST be lived for yourself . This may be considered selfishness as well , but putting labels aside , If you try to live your life to benefit another life , or to benefit the world as a whole , and forget entirely about yourself , you are bound to live unfulfilled . If you do these things for yourself , you are bound to fill an empty void . Whatever you were meant to live for is what you should live for as long as you are sure to live with yourself in mind <p> It sems to me we only help animals because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) how an animals mind works , we treat it as if it works like our own , even if we know it does n't  . That 's why we help and care about animals we find attractive and/or child-like ( puppies , turtles , small birds ) , and at the same time we ( most of us ) would n't give a second glance if a vulture , a rat or a crocodile was in trouble . Its the same reason why almost everyone would stop to help a child or a beautiful young woman laying unconscous on the ground , while most of the people would pass an old , smelly drunk in the same situation without a second glance . It does n't  neccessarily mean psychological selfishness , its probably more to do with the " selfish gene " " its in our DNA to make sure that children , women and the best of our men survive , so once we start to perceive animals and other living things as people , weve basically tricked ourselves into caring for someone other than our own species . = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turtle across the road and such , I see the meaning behind it . The big hole that I see as a parent is the unselfish rush to protect your child , some may say you bwould feel bad if something happend to the child so it is there for a selfish act . Well what about the parent who would give their life to save or protect their child ? If they are dead they would not beneifit from saving the child . This theory is arguing for the sake of arguing , <p> @Tiffany You make a good point , but the way I see it psychological egoism only applies if a person is acting rationally . If a person is acting irrationally , then they may be an exception to this rule that all actions are at their core self-beneficial . One could certainly argue that a parent who is willing to die for their child is acting irrationally , i.e. purely out of the evolutionary instinct to protect ones offspring .

Its so nice to not ever worry about cables , or even proximity for the most part , like having your phone charging by the laptop and still able to walk around the room . Audio quality is great now , only downside is having to charge something , but they 're all pretty good about battery now . <p> Ive been enjoying a category I 'll call : Bluetooth , over ear headphones that let people know not to bother you , that you feel kind of cool wearing , that are great for planes , and cost around $300-400 .

More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Overs , so this is a comparison of those two . ( Another contender in this category would be- the Parrot Zik ones , but just skip those . Great idea , annoying in practice . ) <p> Let me start with how the Beats are better : they fold up , look cool , sound pretty decent on calls , and everything works nicely with the iPhone . For me they have two fatal flaws : comfort and noise . The earcups are kind of small , or my ears are kind of huge ; whichever it is , sometimes after wearing them for a few hours my left ear starts to become quite sore . Second is they have active noise cancellation ( ANC ) that causes what can only be described as a constant hiss you can hear both while music is playing and while its off , its like like noise addition rather than noise cancellation .

( Though not in football anymore . ) <p> Main downsides : the cable it comes with does n't  " work " with an iPhone or Mac as a mic or control device , and is also clunky . ( Bluetooth control works fine . ) This is apparently because the remote control resistor on Apple-targeted cables work differently from everyone elses , which I think we can all agree in 2014 is ridiculous for both sides . My fix for this was to use the cable from the Beats , which you can also buy online , which looks cooler , is smaller , and works great with my Mac for G+ Hangouts and Skype calls . Perhaps related to this is when the Beats or many other Bluetooth headsets Ive used are connected to the iPhone there 's a battery indicator and the Samsung does n't  support this , but since the battery life is so good I do n't  worry about this too much . <p> Too long ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is- more comfortable , and is- better made .

The price point is around $185$220 on Amazon , which I linked above and I feel is an excellent value . <p> My final category of usage is travel , particularly on airplanes , where I want the highest fidelity , comfort , and sound isolation . Honestly in price point there 's a dead zone between around $250$900 , including all the Shures which Ive tried and would not recommend anymore .

First you choose your options on the website , I 'd recommend going all-clear for cord and buds , otherwise they look a bit weird . I 've had both the 64 inch and 48 inch cord the 48 is about exactly enough to go under a jacket and from your waist to your ears , but does n't  give you a lot of room otherwise . I have the 64 inch now and the extra inches give me more flexibility and do n't  get in the way . <p> So you go to the website , take out a second mortgage , and plop down $900 for the UE-10 or $1,150 for the UE-11 . They then point you to a local ear specialist , which basically means someplace that does hearing aids , where they will make a mold of your ear . ( Though the second time I did this it was at a cool rock and roll place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but apparently the shape changes and if its been more than a year you should get new ones made . ) This is usually pretty cheap , and theyll mail the molds directly to Ultimate Ears with your information . A few weeks later , your headphones show up in a fancy metal box , which now I think they put your name on . <p> I first got the UE-10s probably 5 years ago and the cost was really prohibitive , but then I realized that I had spent almost that much on a series of crappy headphones that kept breaking . They are also like a first-class upgrade on every flight Ive literally been sitting next to a crying baby in the back seat of economy and these headphones blocked the entire thing out . Close your eyes and let the music take you someplace else . They work so well because they fit your ear perfectly , so create a seal that blocks external noise , rather than having to juggle the sound to compensate like noise-canceling headphones do . <p> The Ultimate Ears have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get yanked really hard , presumably to prevent damage to your ear . Because I had gotten the shorter cord I kept doing this , and eventually ( 4 years in ) I had done this so many times they did n't  really stay together properly and I kept dropping them . They also got a lot of abuse in my bag . Their ultimate demise was after I had dropped them the hundredth time and actually stepped on them , shattering the hard plastic mold .

ShareThis later bought some of Alexs IP and now uses the share icon as their logo , they tried to un-open-source it and began using legal threats to try and put the cat back in the bag for people who had already adopted it .

@@98356273 @2556273/ <h> How Paul Graham Is Wrong <p> I love Paul Grahams essays and his latest is no exception : Let the Other 95% of Great Programmers In . I agree that the US deserves dramatically better immigration policies , but in the meantime Im confused with the head-in-the-sand approach most tech companies are taking simultaneously complaining that there are lots of great people they cant bring into the US , but being stubborn on keeping a company culture that requires people to be physically co-located . <p> In a region that prides itself on disruption and working from first principles , San Franciscos scaling problem is pretty humorous if you look at it from the outside : otherwise smart and inventive founders continue to set up offices and try to hire or move people in the most overheated environment since there were carphones in Cadillac Allantes . This is where I feel like Paul Graham misses the most obvious solution to the problem . <p> If 95% of great programmers are n't  in the US , and an even higher percentage not in the Bay Area , set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength , not a weakness . Use WordPress and P2 , use Slack , use G+ Hangouts , use Skype , use any of the amazing technology that allows us to collaborate as effectively online as previous generations of company did offline . Let people live someplace remarkable instead of paying $2,800 a month for a mediocre one bedroom rental in San Francisco . Or do n't  , and let companies like Automattic and Github hire the best and brightest and let them live and work wherever they like . <p> I wonder if a start up would work , whose main aim is to assist US start ups in finding and employing high calibre remote talent , even managing the logistical issues , subsidiary companies , etc and facilitating payment , tax laws ? <p> I think some people are feeling the pain enough to look for other places to run their businesses from . There 's definitely a migration ( more like a trickle , but growing ) of people and tech businesses moving from SF to Portland right now . <p> My sentiments exactly . I also disagree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just cant pick up and move to Silicon Valley . People have families , and other things they love about the particular place they 've chosen to live . <p> Even those that are willing to move , do NOT want to move to Silicon Valley . <p> In my current location , I can get a 2BR apartment with a riverfront balcony for $510/mo . SV good luck finding anything remotely close to that for less than $3000+ , likely with a longer commute than my current one . ( I spend more time walking in from the parking lot than I do driving to work ) <p> I admit , where I live is pretty extreme in the " low " end of cost-of-living , but Even if they DID want co-location , simply opening up a satellite office in a location that was n't as insanely expensive as SV would be beneficial for many companies . <p> In a related topic some people just do n't  want to live in urban areas regardless of cost of living . For example , even if you do n't  live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you want to work in one of Googles datacenters , you ca n't work for Google without working in a major city . <p> I agree with that , but with reserve . I endorse remote , and actually that 's what I 've been doing in the latest 11 years , living in Europe . But there 's a lot of developers , talented and not , who would love moving to the US , because that 's where all the fun : ) . If I would be given an opportunity , I would say yes , and regardless of whether I 'd have to work remotely or on site , and , with a few exceptions , regardless of the location . <p> But I totally agree that remote is the future the technology is mature enough , there are several tools and services at our disposal , and they keep evolving . When I started freelancing , the primary tool was email , now we have skype , hangouts , VoIP , github etc . Collaboration is much easier and reliable , and distance is not as important as a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want foreign workers because they will work for less money . If they paid a higher salary , more U.S. workers would relocate , and more U.S. students would study tech . Many of my friends and I moved out of tech to get larger salaries . We were all previously solid engineers and coders ( not superstars like though ) . <p> Sure tech companies can get some of the work done remotely . But that is no reason to keep people out of the USA. the best programmers ( and other highly skilled people ) are going to be paying taxes as well as paying people to mow their lawns , build their houses , and educate their children . It is a win for everyone . As far as training people in the US , of course we should be doing that , but just because we open the doors to some skilled people , does n't  mean we cant train at home at the same time . Besides , getting work done remotely does n't  provide for any more local training than allowing immigration . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where all work was " on location " in temporary project offices . 4 times a year we would have a company wide meet-up and sometimes project meets as well . What we did n't  have then was the internet or even mobile phones but we did have collaboration and project management tools . So distributed workforces are not new . <p> But now it is very much easier to work remotely with all the technology . The irony for many people is they would get more " work " done if they were not in a centralised office with all of the " meetings " and interruptions . <p> A distributed workforce works well when there is a strong shared culture , excellent collaboration tools , a project focus and a high level of trust . Open source projects already have the culture which helps . Many companies are better organised into smaller project teams and real economies of scale only apply in say a manufacturing situation . <p> I would argue that a distributed environment with project teams in close collaboration is just the post industrial revolution model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before is better collaboration tools . For knowledge based work especially it will become the norm in my view . <p> Remote working is a niche manufacturing process that either goes really well but does n't  last , or slowly works to the detriment of the worker . here 's why <p> We do n't  trust people with whom we have n't shared a meal <p> Mutual trust is crucial to shared culture <p> Intellectual products require a higher degree of integrated culture , philosophy , virtues , and trust . The organizations competitive advantage is made of these connections . <p> I can purchase an SAE standard #10-24 x 1 ? SS pan head , phillips-drive screw from 1,000 places and I do n't  care much about the philosophy or principles of the people that made it . Because its standardized , I know its going to fit . <p> You do n't  want this to be true of you , your work , or your company . Collectively your intellectual products require the shared tribal knowledge that comes from working together . <p> If you are working remotely , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much organizational insight and is subject to being commoditized . <p> You are one step away from making screws and competing on a commodity basis . <p> Either that , or you are so specialized that the company fears it cant survive without you . <p> This works really well in the short run , but it ignores how companies respond to fear and risk . <p> As long as intellectual products are made by human beings , these people will need to be together in thought and location . <p> I 'm not saying you should throw having a central office out of the picture , but rather have it to compliment a primarily remote work force . Why should someone need to travel for any amount of time each day , to do something that can done with less interruption and more comfort from home . <p> I run a software consultancy so Ive seen the evolution of tech for managing remote developers . Its still ideal to have everyone in the same room but I 'd rather have great remote devs than mediocre local devs any day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent through coaching , in-house training , education reimbursements , and other tactics that make people more competent as individuals and more capable in teams . <p> I guess you can bring that down to a ( financial ) mathematical formula . Its the cost of relocating a talented designer vs. the cost of making distributed teams really work . I have people working for me in The Netherlands , Bulgaria , The Philippines , and in several places in Germany . We use the *usual* cloud mix ( Basecamp , Highrise , Zendesk , Dropbox , GMail , Google Docs , HipChat , Skype , Evernote , WordPress , Wufoo ) to get things done . However it has taken quite a while to figure out how to do this . Not just in sense of " what tools to use " , but rather " how to use which tool for what " . <p> Just like the atoms of the flower are not beautiful in itself it is the structure / the relationship between them that makes for the beauty , the " social architecture " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken quite some time . <p> Some of the time you can kickstart by organizational experience and giving the individual member a head start , but there is some cost / time involved to familiarize yourself with this style of work . And in my experience about 50% of the people do need a ( at least weekly ) direct physical / social interaction with colleagues in the long term . <p> This being said it makes sense for new organizations without experience in this type of socially-distributed work to just pay the premium of having everyone in one room . <p> Being an entrepreneur there is a chance I see : Find out what works and does n't  work for companies like Automattic , GitHub , 37Signals , etc and teach this knowledge to new startups ( and also " normal " businesses ) . <p> I know a great deal about US immigration law ( strangely but life sometimes teaches you things you would n't expect ! ) , and it is very restrictive . I certainly agree that we need to take an honest look at how unworkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , its definitely true that it has never been easier to work remotely , and some companies are beginning to prefer that in lieu of paying expenses to fly out consultants , etc . <p> I think the trick is to be on the cutting edge of what you or your company can offer from a remote location ! <p> Companies mostly do not do this anymore because once they train the people , they are worth more to another company who has no problems paying a new hire that has XXX skills , whereas a company that already has that person hired and is paying them 20% less than what it would cost for someone who has XXX skills and trained them , will usually balk at a raise of more than 5-10% because no one gets raises that high . <p> Matt " Take a look at Steven Berlin Johnsons Where Good Ideas Come From and Edward Glaesers The Triumph of the City .

@@98356283 @2556283/ <p> I live and work on the internet , so when I have trouble connecting it really slows me down . About a year or so ago I started looking into multi-WAN routers that would , at least , support two internet connections and failover to the other one , and as a bonus maybe provide some speed benefits as well . here 's the story of that journey . <p> After a ton of research I ended up with a Peplink , probably in part because their website is the best organized designed of the vendors I found . I 'm very lucky to access to two great internet providers in my building : Webpass , a local ISP which provides- symmetric- 100 Mbps ( albeit- shared with neighbors ) , and Comcast with DOCSIS 3.0 support ( they sometimes market it as Extreme 50 ) which provides around 50-60 Mbps . Because the combined speed was above 50 Mbps put me as a " mid-sized business " according to Peplinks product line-up and I ended up with a Peplink Balance 390 ( which seems to be the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Balance 390 , which Ive used about a year and a half : its a really solid product . It did everything that was promised including the failover , has been rock-solid , and the Peplink-delivered firmware updates have made the interface significantly better since I bought it in December 2009 especially for router-centric things I like to do like have the DHCP reservations and naming . ( The interface is significantly better than what Ive used on Linksys and D-link routers before . ) The 390 only had one downside : its incredibly loud . <p> Now as background I should caveat that I 'm pretty sensitive to ambient noise , especially from computing devices . Over the years Ive gone from 4 computers in my office to just a laptop I take with me , and when I moved one of the things I looked for was the closet with the ethernet patch panel and where all the connectivity came in was far away from where I 'd work or sleep . I 've stopped using devices before , like the Drobo , because they were too loud . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But the " server closet " is actually the closet in my guest room slash TV room , so even though I was relatively shielded from the noise in there my guests were subjected to it , which was made worse because I had so much stuff in there the closet would get quite hot so I would usually leave the door cracked . <p> Late last year I started minimizing everything in there to bring the noise , heat , and my electricity bill down . I went from a couple of switches daisy-chained together to a single 24-port D-Link . For network storage I 'm a big fan of QNAP devices and have owned their 5 , 6 , and 8 drive versions . I had a TS-809U ( rackmount , also really loud ) I shipped off to be an off-site backup , retired the old 5-drive , and standardized on a ( pretty quiet ) TS-639 with 6 1TB drives in RAID6 so about 3.6TB usable . Finally I replaced old desktop machines and Linux servers I had accumulated over the years with a single beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rackmount UPS with this much-quieter Cyberpower and some nifty liberators . ) <p> But I was still stuck with the Balance 390 providing the lifeline of connectivity to the house and sounding like a plane taking off . However after a post on Peplinks bbPress-powered forums I decided to check out two of their new products , the Balance 30 and Balance 310 , as I said : <p> It looks like you guys have some new products that would be a little slower but adequete for my needs . I noticed on the comparisons that the 20/30 is a smaller and lighter than the 210/310 , and they draw the same amount of power . <p> They responded " The 20/30/210/310 are all completely quiet because they do n't  have a fan ! " Awesome , were in business . But how about performance ? Since I 'm in a unique position of having three of their products in front of me , and their website is a bit confusing , I decided to do some rough but real-world tests of each product and found a pretty counter-intuitive results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgraded each device to the latest firmware ( 5.2.2 ) , unplugged everything from the network , and plugged my laptop directly into the LAN port of each router and ran some speed tests as suggested by Peplink themselves , which I found on this thread . Basically the tool just downloads some big files from Adobe , Apple , and Microsoft and tells you how long it took . The following table is the average of a few tests I ran for each while only having a single WAN link plugged in , then I tried some additional tests just on the Microsoft download paired with Comcast since that seemed to be the fastest possible , finally I plugged in both WAN links and kicked off multiple downloads at once and tried to observe the peak throughput . The absolute numbers are n't  as interesting , mostly the maximums . I basically wanted to test their assertion that " The ratings are derived from the actual performance ( combination of sw and hw ) and not limited by software . " <p> Balance 30 <p> Balance 310 <p> Balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Vendor-rated Throughput <p> 50 Mbps <p> 50 Mbps <p> 170 Mbps <p> USB 3G modem support <p> Yes <p> No <p> Yes <p> Adobe Webpass <p> 21.3 Mbps <p> 37.1 Mbps <p> 17.4 Mbps <p> Apple Webpass <p> 22.1 Mbps <p> 36.6 Mbps <p> 18.7 Mbps <p> Microsoft Webpass <p> 22.2 Mbps <p> 41.3 Mbps <p> 22.3 Mbps <p> Adobe Comcast <p> 22.1 Mbps <p> 42.6 Mbps <p> 52.3 Mbps <p> Apple Comcast <p> 21.6 Mbps <p> 44.3 Mbps <p> 46.7 Mbps <p> Microsoft Comcast <p> 22.4 Mbps <p> 46.9 Mbps <p> 57.9 Mbps <p> Microsoft Comcast #2 <p> 31.3 Mbps <p> 47.2 Mbps <p> 57.3 Mbps <p> Observed CPU load <p> 100% <p> 100% <p> 35% <p> Comcast + Webpass Microsoft Download <p> 90.16 Mbps <p> 49.5 Mbps <p> 116.2 Mbps <p> So the conclusions and things I discovered from these numbers : <p> The 390 is the most powerful , it was able to handle 116 Mbps with some room to spare . <p> The 310 interface would freeze up and become completely unresponsive as the transfer got higher . Though it did better than the 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dual-WAN test . The 30 stayed responsive even when the CPU pegged at 100% . <p> The 30 has bonus unadvertised gigabit LAN ports ( the 310 has 10/100 Mbps ports ) which surprised me because it seems from their comparison chart that you only get gigabit LAN ports starting with the 380 . <p> The 30 was able to peak just under 100 Mbps combining the two connections , which is not that far away from the 390 , which is 5 times the cost . And it crushed the 310 which is 4x the cost . <p> Now as for the why of these numbers , I do n't  know , maybe Peplink could comment . This test was pretty unscientific , but I was able to recreate over and over again that plugged into the Balance 30 I got double the performance at a quarter of the cost of the 310 , something I ended up repeating over and over because it was very counter-intuitive to me . Perhaps the 20/30 are just newer generation products and the 210/310 line will catch up in their next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So in summary : Peplink is great , their 380 and above products are fantastic if you need the power and can put them someplace no one will hear them . The 210/310 is a rip-off and should be avoided . The Balance 30 performs above its ratings and I 'd recommend it for anybody like me with multiple internet connections . The " Next Generation Broadband Ready " rating on the 210/310 appears to be incorrect . <p> I 've unplugged my 380 and now have my entire home network going through the Balance 30 , and its as snappy as can be . One of these days I 'll play around with the 3G failover stuff . I can leave the door to my server closet closed now , and guests will sleep peacefully . <p> Matt thanks for posting this . As a work-at-home professional I rely completely on my internet connection as well . Until now I have used my Android phone as a backup in rare instances of ISP failure . Your post has convinced me I need a more reliable second ISP . <p> Nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poked my head in back when the place was being remodeled and it about melted my face off , Indiana Jones style . Ill bet the ambient air temperature was approaching the 90s . <p> So the Peplink does NAT/firewall too ? Or do you have something else between that and the switches ? <p> We 've only had a handful of fiber outages here , so I 've not been tempted to get dual connections . I 've just fallen back to 3G in those instances . But power is absolutely an issue . The fiberoptic lines are buried , but Florida is a mess of above ground power , palm trees with razor-sharp fronds , squirrels who like to build nests in transformers , tropical storms , and in addition , Tampa is the lightning capitol of the world . I have APCs equivalent model of the Cyberpower model you linked . Its saved me bunches of times ( computer , router , monitor , and a few other essentials are powered by it ) . It would be nice to have more juice , though . If you add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops . <p> Some of the UPS units have a USB connection , which is nice , because the UPS can signal the OS that power has been lost . It will alert you , and if power is about to run out , itll do a safe shutdown . <p> Good call on the power strip liberators ! I lose a bit of my sanity every time I lose a plug to a needlessly bulky wall wart . <p> You can do this on a WRT54GL or any other cheap router via OpenWRT . You wo n't get 100Mbps of performance , but considering that most of us live in areas where 5Mbps is considered " high speed " , a cheap router can handle line speed . <p> It has 4x FastEthernet , and room for a crypto accelerator if you feel so inclined . And they 're like $100-200 , instead of $400-2000 . <p> I personally use a Dell SC420 server with PfSense , and its awesome . Feature-rich , powerful , and expandable . And Dell servers are quiet unless they get hot . The fan gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes a lot of heat . I 'm in Vegas , and its never louder than a distant hum . <p> I actually bought that exact Cyberpower UPS a few weeks ago and absolutely love it . I 'm even running the coax cable for my FiOS modem through it . <p> At idle , my power-hungry desktop and two large monitors pull 387 watts through it which is good for about 16 minutes of battery life . That 's pretty dang good . <p> I 'm not sure about Mac support , but it uses a standard printer-style USB cable to let your computer know what its doing ( battery time remaining , etc . ) . The Windows software is also fairly nice allowing you to see all the stats as well as control some of the things that youd normally control from its front panel . <p> Do you happen to know what CPU each of the devices use ? My company develops a similar product and we 've found that the Atom platform is terrific for devices like this- much more power than the Geode processor in the Soekris Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) than a proper Core desktop/server CPU . <p> For those looking to build their own multi-WAN router box , there are a number of good options from Lanner and Portwell . Also , the upcoming Soekris 6000 series is Atom-powered . <p> An alternative to multi-WAN load balancing like Peplink offers is known as WAN bonding , where the on-site device sends and receives packets to/from an aggregation server somewhere on the Internet first , rather than straight to the remote host . The aggregation server then re-assembles the original stream of packets and forwards it on to the destination . This has the benefit of being able to combine the bandwidth of all your links for a single download or upload , whereas the Peplink would max out at the speed of your fastest link for a single transfer ( unless I misunderstand how it operates ) . It also allows a static IP or even a whole block of IPs to be allocated to the device , which do n't  change even if a link goes down . But it does require an intermediate server and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . Peplink advertises a bonded VPN feature with some of their models , which they can do because there they fully control both ends of the connection . I guess you could build your own bonded multi-WAN service by putting a second Peplink in your datacenter , setting up their bonded VPN , and figuring out a clever routing configuration to use the VPN as your route to the Net . <p> Somewhat late to the conversation , but I 'm trying to figure out if there 's a difference between the Peplink products and the Cisco RV line . The top-end RV016 does up to 7 links and costs about as much as the lowest-end peplink . According to Cisco , their NAT throughput is 200Mbps ( as opposed to 100 ) , and it does VPN . The advantage on the Peplink seems to be Gbe ports . I 'm planning an install at a local business and I ruled out the Peplink on cost alone . <p> I actually have the rv016 , two of them to be exact . I also have the rv042 . Theyre solid devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd get peplink products now if I had to recreate my setup . <p> I have three cable modems and use 3 of the 7 wan connections . But the amount of ack/nak packets Knologys Arris C4 head-end sends it causes it to constantly reboot or crash because it thinks its under attack unless I use another router to pre-filter these packets . Knology and Cisco support have been useless , pointing fingers at each other even after I 've provided both with mountains of data . Cisco even initially said that my router was defective after being in service for over five years , so I ended up buying my second one , which now sits here as a paperweight/backup since my original was fine . Even with pre-routers on two of the lines , I still need to reboot every 8hrs . But when it works , its like a tank . There was even a period of two years it worked 24+7 in temps of over 100deg in the summer and &lt;40deg in the winter . This same router is still working today , almost being on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue with the Cisco line . I have 75/15 with my combined bandwidth and can only max out the upload of 15 , not the download . In fact , recent changes in the last two months at Knology make it almost impossible for me to get more than 5Mb download speeds reliably . I still have no idea what changed thisI used to get 20 easy . It would be interesting to test a peplink product in my environment . <p> I have a gateway-to-gateway vpn setup with the rv042 which is 20 miles away . As long as you 're on default settings , this works reliably well . I can see the network there as if it was local here . Very nice . I 've even printed to the network printer there versus faxing that location . <p> Would anyone know if the Peplink 20/30 would work with a satellite connection and DSL ? Our DSL here is so slow that the 1.5Mbps rated is actually a joke . I wonder if the DSL would eliminate the satellite latency and the satellite would allow faster web updates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but lost the comment somehow . Not due to bad connectivity though = <p> Following your recommendation here I got a Balance 20 on a recent trip to San Diego = <p> Ive been wanting to do something like this for a long time now , as a way to make the best out of the poor infrastructure where I live . The Peplink takes two unstable yet potentially speedy connections ( ADSL and cable ) are provides one solid line which maxes out very close to their combined bandwidths . Should also be noted that setup is very easy and not much different then setting up a standard home router . <p> The Balance 20 is Peplinks lowest end model and its currently around $100 less then the next model up , the Balance 30 ( and over $1,000 less then the next model after that ) . As far as I can tell , though I have n't looked too closely at this , the only difference is that the 30 has 3 wired WAN ports and the 20 has only 2 . Both have one spot for a USB WAN modem . 
@@98356284 @2556284/ <h> On the Evolution of Investing <p> Today Y Combinator announced they are adding two new partners , Garry Tan and Aaron Iba . This announcement is unique because it does not list their academic credentials , their previous investments , the boards of companies or non-profits they have sat on , how many years of experience they have , or any of the usual badges of honor investors parade in their biographies and Crunchbase profiles . <p> Instead we get accolades of " rare individuals who can both design and program " and " best hackers among the YC alumni . " Take note of this moment . <p> I was part of a dinner conversation the other night that included institutional and angel investors , entrepreneurs , and someone who was part of the YC program . The group circled with alarming intent on grilling the YC entrepreneur : " How much time did you actually get with PG ? " " Its a cult of personality . " " The average quality of the companies has really dropped as they 've broadened . " " I cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was mostly in jest few topics were spared that night but there was some truth in the defensive undertone . <p> The hackers and engineers of Y Combinator are doing what hackers and engineers do to any industry , they 're efficiently and ruthlessly disrupting the traditional model of venture capital and are going to destroy far more more wealth for their contemporaries than they create for themselves , as broadband did to entertainment , Craigslist did to newspapers , and Amazon did to traditional retailers . This is what outsiders , by definition , do . <p> The dark humor in this is that the same people who delight and celebrate investing in disrupting other industries are blind or in denial about it happening to their own . <p> The question then becomes if you 're an investor with a traditional LP model ( and expectations ) , or a more financial background than an operational one , or an operational background more in management than in design or coding , what should you do to stay relevant through this shift ? <h> Related 14594 @qwx874594 <h> 26 thoughts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting , as you do , what was n't said as well as what was . It may or not be an inflection point . It may simply be a broadening of what " credentials " are acceptable . So far YC has not moved upstream beyond seed investing , and seed investing has always had different characteristics and investor types as participants so its not clear how much of a real harbinger this is . <p> The shift away from traditional credentials like degrees , honors , and past accomplishments has been gradual . <p> In the ancient days , people focused on brands on resumeswhich school did you attend ? Which companies did you work for ? <p> When I was at D. E. Shaw in the 90s , we had a specific list of 25 CS departments we were allowed to recruit from . Resumes from other schools were automatically filtered out . <p> The shift to accomplishments was actually progressrather than relying on brands , we actually cared what people had done . But this was still somewhat unreliable because of the major role luck plays in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on ability , independent of resume brands or the magnitude of accomplishments . EtherPad was a great product ( disclosure , I was an investor ) even though Google shut it down after the acquisition . Posterous is a great product , even though its traffic and traction are overshadowed by Tumblr . <p> I also think that YC is very smart to focus on design and coding for its hires . As an accelerator/seed firm , YC deals with very early stage startups . I often tell founders that until they have a great product , outbound sales and marketing are a waste of time . <p> But I also want to be fair to the many traditional VCs who do a good job . As a company grows beyond the YC stage , considerations like sales , marketing , operations , and people management become increasingly important . <p> Many of these are issues that can only be dealt with based on experience , rather than on what one reads in Hacker News . As you grow , traditional VCs and other grey hairs can actually help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The players may be changing ( at least at YC ) but the game is the same for entrepreneurs : give away 7% equity for $20k ( who does that ? ? ) and the privilege of being associated with a premium brand " a brand that adds limited value outside of silicon valley . <p> This is not disruption . This is rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic . Or at least getting new people to sit in them . <p> So far YC has helped increase the number of startups looking for VC money , so if anything they have been a boost to VCs ( and YC themselves have taken investment from traditional VCs like Sequoia ) . The most disruptive thing that could happen to VCs is the next Google or Facebook figuring out a way to bootstrap itself all the way to profitability . <p> Why would an investor with a strong operational background in design or coding be more valuable than a background in operations or management ? Having a cursory understanding of each area is important , but I often do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaps . <p> The things you note in your post are really only a function of the cycle we are going through . We invested in building a new communication medium ( the internet ) , the infrastructure to support that , the platforms on top of that infrastructure , and now we are building applications on top of that . <p> It does n't  take a lot of money or time to invest on top of this big stack to create applications . However , investments in developing arenas like biotech and green tech generally require large dollars because they do n't  have the infrastructure noted above . <p> Dollars invested should always be a function of the market opportunity . Sometimes we lose sight of the fact that the market controls it , not us ( whoever us is ) . The market does n't  care if you have $300 mm fund or $300 . <p> Druce mentions the disruption going on upstream . I think part of this disruption is sheer creativity of entrepreneurs to find finding through less traditional channels . Debt has dried up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the rise and about time . When it comes to early stage ventures at least , I 'm all for entrepreneurs finding non-VC funds for their start-up . <p> Good commentary . I wonder if the amount and type of investors is actually increasing so fast that people with traditional concept of investing in their mind are getting stuck with the past . Yes , rich will always rule over the weak and poor ( sadly so ) , but new ways of Kiva , Kickstarter , etc. will change more than traditional big money can . Its about getting involved and actually caring about what happens with the resources and giving the inventors ( instead of investors ) and creators will and support to create world with better things . <p> Its great that people have the ability to evaluate and invest but the types of investments have been way out of what people have been used to . There is need for both big and small money and its more about the concept of collaborating and sharing the burden than just at ripping maximum personal returns from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hopefully people would do wisely and invest in things that make life better for all . <p> All cycles have stages and always good to spot the shift from one phase to another . Not always so easy to do as we all know . YC is filling the funnel and hot housing because that works at that end of the circuit . <p> Sean Gourley &amp; the clever folks at http : //quid.com/ right there in SF have some smart visual modeling tools which means some of this shift can be measured and spotted much earlier . Before Quid they tracked a fair sample of the startup activity via Younoodle . <p> Much of what worked in the in the early days was a combination of luck , experience , timing ( portfolio theory ) and a certain amount of strategic thinking about where to look . <p> A simple analogy is connecting the dots between data points . With a fractal pattern , better tools , better analysts ( still luck ) picking patterns in much wider , deeper samples is now possible . <p> OTH I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bed &amp; re-read some of those stories often because inspiration and visionary leadership is still important . <p> Anyone out there who was n't in diapers when the dot.com crash happened ? Way too many folks investing in low barrier to entry companies with no profits or revenue who think they have the world figured out . When groupon , angieslist , etc etc go bankrupt and facebook has a market cap of 9 billion , you can say you heard it here first .

Not by a lot , but they were least expensive . <p> Ok I 'll be the first to admit that our wishlist pretty much stinks .

I was a little nervous about buying from them again this year , because they took a month to ship last Christmas , but they were so communicative during all that , that I decided to use them again . here 's an idea for you developers out there : Amazon has that lovely Gift Center ( with links to others wish lists ) , and the lovely Recommendations page ( for your own account ) why cant they marry the two ?

I have a wishlist there , but never send it to my friends/family when birthday times rolls around . Guess my intuition was correct about it ! <p> I love Amazon and I love looking at others wishlists . In addition to purchasing an item from someones Amazon wishlist to say " Thank you " , I 've also purchased items for them " just because " . = In fact , an item I recently got for a friend " just because " should be arriving today ! <p> Its worth mentioning , too , that the customer service reps responses to you definitely qualify as b*tchy To me , that would magnify the problem greatly .

Instantly I emailed them and they replied telling me to cancel the order , I looked everywhere and there was no option to cancel , I do n't  know if this was because I paid with paypal or if they make it really hard to find . Then I emailed them back and they said that I will have to RMA it after I receive it .. ok but you have n't shipped it yet , so why should I have to waste money on shipping when I live in Canada and it is going to cost a lot . I asked them to please replace it with a shirt that they had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has already been packaged and they can not do that . So now I am being shipped a shirt that is not going to fit me because of a deceiving item listing . The worst part about it is that I contacted them instantly after purchasing and they were still not able to sort this out for me . This is very poor customer support and to me seems like they were really trying to get rid of their small stock of this specific shirt . I have informed them that my friends and I will never buy from them again as they do n't  care about their customers , they only care about getting there stock out of the ware house and getting your money in their pocket . So now after shipping and tax I have paid $50 cdn for something that is absolutely useless to me , maybe it will fit my nephew .

A child of the web , weaned on ADSL , at some point in my development I developed an insatiable thirst for change , newness . Whether this was an inherit quality magnified by the hyperlinked nature of the web or whether it was actually developed as a result of my exposure , I do n't  know . <p> My desktop is a randomly generated fractal pattern , changing every two minutes . Before that it would rotate between about a hundred random photographs from my photolog .

I 've settled down more . <p> I saw my friend Alex Jones today and one thing I like about him is that he never looks the same twice , every time you see him his hair in particular can be completely different from the last time you saw him .

There is a constant stream of new information coming in , and I do n't  even frequent traditional news sites or use a RSS aggregator .

Technorati is an extension of this , cleaning things up and alerting you to something you might have otherwise missed . The WordPress Support Forum has frequent traffic , and represents hours and hours of possible diversions not only in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but a few of my subscriptions to lists , procmail keeping them out of inbox and out of mind , but still there is a constant stream of new communication , beautiful in its asymmetry ; I can address it at any time , and do . Let 's not even touch instant messaging , the killer app of online communication and singly the greatest timesuck of anyone overly connected . <p> I have the same need . I have recently started cooking down the number of information-sources that feed my change and information hunger , but I still frequent a ridiculous number of sites . In that respect , I think you have matured further as an info junkie . <p> I have pondered this need for change quite a bit , and while it has its drawbacks , I have found that it is more of a benefit than a problem . I do n't  think I have experienced a single radical change I can think of , where I have n't been anticipating it with some excitement , even if the change was supposed to be shitty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its more exciting . Adapting to the change after the fact is new , and thus exciting . Considering how many things in your life that are out of your control and which impose change on your life , its a good thing to be on friendly terms with change . People , companies and entities whom are unwilling to change are hardly ever the success stories of life . Adaptability seems to be a key factor to development , and an addiction to change is probably an addiction to exercising this adaptability . <p> Like you , I have also tried different input devices , and ended up with something other than the qwerty keyboard . I attribute this to the same things as you ( painlessness and productivity ) , but also to my need to try and adapt to something new all the time .

@@98356296 @2556296/ <h> Keeping Links Kosher <p> As part of the re-vamp I 've put together a 404 script that emails me whenever its called . This has certainly been an eye-opener as to the misguided traffic that this site gets . An email is so much different than just seeing the hits in your logs , and I would recommend anyone serious about maintaining a site do something similar . <p> There are a fewlinks to my old curly quotes entry that link to a rather funky perversion of a fly-by-night URI scheme that has long since gone by the by . These links worked just fine until I deleted the file that was keeping things going , now its time to move things into the magic . htaccess file . <p> Let 's take a look at the URI in LONG ... <p> My first thought was to just plop latter part of the request and create a rule just for this link , as such . <p> Redirect Permanent /archives/m/200209 ? p=186 http : //photomatt.net/p186 <p> Did n't  work , never matched . Next try I decided to go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 0-9+ ) http : //photomatt.net/p$1 <p> Did n't  work , never matched . Some research found that the problem lies in the query string , and the Apache redirect directives do n't  address the query string . So let 's give modrewrite a go : <p> RewriteRule . *p= ( 0-9+ ) http : //photomatt.net/p$1 R=301 , L <p> Still no luck . ( For those that wonder , the HTTP response code 301 indicates that the resource has been permanently moved . " Permanent " in the first try is just a synonym of " 301 " . ) It looks like the magical modrewrite does n't  match query strings either . Some more research turned up that while redirect does n't  match or rewrite query strings , it does pass them all . So we are left with : <p> Redirect Permanent /archives/m/200209 http : //photomatt.net/ <p> Which , counter-intuitively , works . The ? p=186 on the end is just passed to the root of the site , which gives it to my index file which knows just what to do with it . I would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to http : //photomat.net/p186 but while that would be trivial in any scripting language I cant nail down how to do it on the Apache or modrewrite level . So my options now are to add something to the global header to catch p=something query strings and redirect it , but I 'd like to keep that file clean , so more likely is that I 'll start adding some URI management code into the 404 handler and generally make that file more sophisticated in general . Well see . <p> I put together an intelligent 404 for the company I work for ( Nationwide.co.uk ) , and depending on whether the referrer was a ) a search engine b ) a web site or c ) one of Nationwides sites , the message displayed changed to suggest what went wrong and how we might fix it ; In addition , I chose to make the reporting of the error voluntary , otherwise we would get overloaded it seemed to me to make sense to have those pages that were important to people reported as issing rather than every 404 . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an example : Error 404 direct link , or for other referring sites with incorrect URLs : Page not there <p> Cool for IIS is do this http : **29;1019;TOOLONG however for BSD ? apache/php i find that the 404 redirect is different . I would like to know the ideal page ( probly php code ? ) for that , such that i can preformat the email to include the info i want about the 404 like i do on the asp/IIS sites . <p> NOte that you need the % instead of $ to backreference matches from the RewriteCond . I am also pretty sure that the ? disappears and does not occur in the query string , but I guess that 's kind of a moot point since it would match anyway . This is untested , but at least should lead you down the right track . Hope it helps .

For an example of a business person who actually put those kinds of visions into practice in the 1970s and earlier ( like with the PLATO computer system starting in the 1960s ) , look at William C. Norris , the CEO of Control Data Corporation . Norris was a pioneer in creating a " socially responsible " business , building a big company that still tried to help employees be healthy and happy , and emphasizing public/private partnerships to " meet societys unmet needs " . When other companies fled the inner cities in the lat 1960s with inner-city riots , he asked himself , how can my business help poor people via " social entrepreneurship " ? <p> See especially the pamphlet Norris wrote called " Back to the Countryside Via Technology " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas related to decentralizing farming and manufacturing as small scale local enterprises enabled by computing technology . Those themes reflect Norris personal roots growing up on a farm . His biography , " William C. Norris : Portrait of a Maverick " , by James C. Worthy is a good read for any CEO . <p> While it is true that " software is eating the world " as Marc Andreessen says ( and you quote in your " Four Freedoms " essay ) , the fact remains that without agriculture and manufacturing almost none of us would have anything to eat or a way to cook it . Norris knew that in personal way that many people today find easy to forget ( until the food is n't there ) , so he wrote about ways to support those needs for everyone everywhere with computers as an educational and networking force to support people having small businesses and small farms .

Movable Type has 8 different licenses and the " open source " one does n't  allow any support . The community around WordPress is amazing and most people find it more than adequate for their support needs . <p> Movable Type , which is Six Aparts only Open Source product line now that they 've dumped Livejournal , does n't  even have a public bug tracker , even though they announced it going OS over 9 months ago ! <p> I had held off criticizing them after they went OS and before they decided to start an all-out confrontation because that 's not generally what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once led the market , it had over 90% marketshare in the self-hosted market .

Along the way thousands of people will contribute , as well as every employee of Automattic . What we build will be greater than the sum of its parts because we 've been a community and open source from the beginning , and always will be . <p> Mashable compared MovableType 4 and WordPress 2.2 .

@@98356322 @2556322/ <h> Smart Quotes in PHP <p> One of the true joys I find in reading different websites is when the author of whatever text you see has taken the time to make his text typographically pleasing to the eye through the use of proper typographical elements . CSS has enabled designers to shape text on the web in ways that allow for far greater control over presentation than the creators of HTML ever envisioned . However , I see many sites where its obvious that great pain has been put into the layout and presentation of the text , but there are still things like single and double prime marks being used instead of true quotes or apostrophes . Part of the reason for this is its a pain to enter the proper entities in when you type , especially if the entry is being added through a normal text box like most blogging software use . While I 'm not going to go start a society ( more ) I still have written a small function in PHP that will hopefully make the world a better place , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dad , Mark Pilgrim for inspiration and the code that got me started , and Barrett for help . <p> A little background : This whole thing started a few hours ago when I was writing a paper and when I looked back to proofread I saw that there were a number of occurrences of words like its , where writing out the HTML entities had become so ingrained in me from various situations where I hand code that it was now translating into my normal typing . At that moment I immediately thought of ten other reasons why its probably better for the content to be entered into the database as a single or double prime and then translated to its proper character on display . Most of all , its just easier , and the free flow of ideas into your writing is not impeded in any way .

I would never have even considered a job that prevented me from working on WordPress in any way . = <p> Dorothea , my time spent on WordPress and the IP thereof is spelled out in the contract and I 've had several check it out . I do my best to not be financially dependent on any job I 'm working on so if it ever regresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just leave , which I 've done before and would do again . If there 's anything in particular you think I should watch out for drop me an email . <p> Ste , I 'm the wrong guy to ask what CNET has planned , but we already knew they 're running WordPress internally on their intranet and externally on http : //blogs.zdnet.com/ . <p> Rob , WordPress is still completely independent of CNET , just now I can spend more time on it and still pay the bills . Personally I think charging for blogging software is a little silly , and history has shown it can have a backlash so while under the GPL anyone could charge for WP if they wanted I would never be involved in such a project . Also remember that CNET is a media company , not a software or services company . <p> I have a question myself : Does anyone know what the C in CNET stands for ? I have no idea myself , maybe theyll tell me at orientation . <p> CNET helped out with the development of Vignettes StoryServer back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a struggling , evil , multi-million dollar company . I hope you can have all of the success that you deserve with WP without taking the evil route . If all else fails , adopt a philosophy similar to Googles . <p> Many congratulations on the new job ! Its excellent news to hear that theyll be letting you continue development on WordPress . Thankfully since WordPress is GPL , I do n't  worry about any kind of sudden move into the dark world of proprietary software one of the reasons I ( and many others ) use WordPress rather than that other blogware application <p> Congratulations Matt , As I 'm sure a lot of other people did , I guessed your next big announcement was going to be a job of some description . I hope you do well . Its great to get an employer who supports you in this way . <p> The article is great too . Its very accessible for non techies and very positive . Congrats again man . <p> Matt , I would just like to say that I 'm really inspired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you must be some mystical genius old man , and while it seems you probably are a genius , you 're much more of a real person than I ever thought . Your troubles with school especially touched me , as I 've had similar experiences due to severe symptoms of bipolar disorder . I 'm twenty myself now , and trying to make a living with my various Web-related geekery . ( Though , I 'm failing thus far . ) <p> But to make a long story short , I 've been using WordPress for a few months ( took the dive and made the switch from Blogger and MT ) and it is sexy . Congratulations on your success ! <p> Congrats Matt , and welcome to San Francisco ! Its a great city to live in . If you like sushi , I know all the best places ( I 'm an addict ) . While I have n't posted it yet on my How To Blog site , Im 99.9% sure that after doing my comparisons I 'm going to be using WordPress for all future blogs , so a belated thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 2 friends who used to work for cnet and they loved it while they were there . So kudos , have fun , and good luck ! <p> Sorry I missed it , and even though its well and truly worn out , Congratulations ! I 'm glad you 're being given time to work on WordPress too . That is a very cool job . I really hope you enjoy it along with your new life in SF . <p> Congratulations ! Does this mean there will be more people working on WordPress or will it still be the existing core developers ? <p> You 're living out the fantasy of many developers who would love to be recruited by a big company and paid to be doing what they already do for free . With all of the time and work you 've done , you deserve it . 
@@98356324 @2556324/ <h> The Trouble With WordPress <p> Recently it leaked on a blog ( there are few secrets in Open Source ) that elements from a design known as " Kubrick " by Michael Heilemann would be incorporated into the default template for the next version of WordPress . Kubrick is many things : a design , a set of templates , some plugins , and a removal of a lot of cruft currently in the default template . It makes things much friendlier for readers . Best of all Michael released everything under the GPL and submitted it to WordPress for inclusion . After it had had several iterations I checked it out and saw a lot of great ideas that would make WordPress a better product , especially for new users . Even though no decisions had been made and no code had been committed , a number of questions were raised in peoples minds . A thread was started in the forums that I 'm not even going to link to because its not worth reading past the first page , if that . Many people seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though that was stated pretty clearly in the original blog post . <p> Michael is primarily a designer , not a coder , and coding things in a way that works on the variety of platforms and setups that WordPress itself does is hard , so there are issues with that in the templates Michael has released . WordPress devs have a lot of experience with those issues , however , and anything added to the core will work just as well ( if not better ) than WordPress does now . Several others questioned the inclusion of graphics in a template . If graphics were included , how would people be able to edit it ? We cant expect people to have graphics editors , so if graphics are included in the final template ( that has n't  been determined yet ) Ive committed to providing an online interface on wordpress.org for people to customize the graphics to match their color choices without needing any software beyond a web browser . There were some questions about the CSS being used in Kubrick , but the CSS used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated like any change to the WordPress code , that is it will go through the normal QA process and be tested across platforms by the developers and the few dozen or so people who keep up with the nightly builds , and then extensively tested by the hundreds that use the beta releases once we enter that phase for 1.3 . Any problems will be treated as bugs and fixed as such . Watching trends on the forums and continuing a high level of support is very important to everyone . <p> The problem was after all this was explained the thread continued long after all these questions had been answered with everyone talking past each other . If it shows anything its that people can be very passionate about the smallest of things . Its interesting to note that while this all was occuring what has actually happened in WordPress development in the last week : Dougal wrote a plugin to slow down spambots , literally ; Alex made a new style for the styles page ; Kitten sent in another comment moderation plugin that 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis ( amoung many others ) did some great work on the new wiki ; Michel is refactoring the XML-RPC code ; we started the process of moving to a better source control system ; Ryan is coding too much cool stuff to mention , but the next version of WP be the easiest to customize and template ever . That 's just off the top of my head , there 's lots of other exciting developments happening . <p> In other words , life moved on . It showed up on a few blogs , but that 's a price of popularity : bad news gets more buzz than good . Numerous examples are in the checkout line of every supermarket . ( Not to mention the blogosphere . ) <p> So what 's the state of the WordPress community today ? I 'd say its better . The number of people who actually got out-of-hand was only a handful , and personally I 'm ready to apologize and move on . I 've never been good at holding grudges . The things that make the WordPress community great havent changed , and several lessons have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started , testimonials and donations keep coming in , I 've noticed more people helping out on the forums , and best of all there 's a healthy amount of disagreement keeping the project young . <h> 33 thoughts on " The Trouble With WordPress " <p> I agree with you Matt , design of the wordpress template is all up to the final user of the software . A simple customizable default will always work ; and its up to the creativity of those who patronize wordpress to customize it to their satisfaction . I personally love Michaels design myself and it was a wonderful experience just to implement it to my copy of WP(WordPress) . <p> First off , I love WordPress . I cant say that enough . That whole thread on the Forums was a bit , er , well , odd I just do n't  see the big deal . I may , or may not , use that new Kubrick-esque template , but , as long as I have the other , more basic one , to fall back to , what 's the big deal ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can only think that someones ego got wounded or something . Anyway , you 've got a great tool here and not enough people telling you so . Thanks . <p> This is great news . I do n't  frequent WP support threads but did read that one and it made me sick . Thanks for putting a much better spin on the whole thing and I 'm very glad that the best parts of Kubrick are being considered for WP . <p> Matt , first of all kudos to you and all WordPress developers ! I think you do a good job and looking towards a better default theme for WP is a very good move . Do n't  let the people that jumped to conclusions shouting all kinds of mostly non-sensical things deter you from the goal you have set : to produce a better product . You will never be able to please everyone , that 's just human nature . <p> And while many people think that there are only graphics editors that cost a fortune ( just like many think there is no choice but use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is such a thing as Free Software , and a lot of it is damn good ! The GIMP does n't  get " pimped " often enough , but it is what I use exclusively . <p> Truth is , I have n't followed the brouhaha very closely , though I saw some brief allusions to what was going on at the Support forum . <p> Matt , thanks to you and all the other WordPress gurus and support staff who create such an awesome blogging program with so many capabilities . Its just amazing and I 've been having the greatest time learning how to work with it since I started months ago . I 'm excited ( as are many ) to see what 1.3 will be all about . <p> Just do n't  heed those guys who seem to be envious . Gurus must be indulged in whatever they want , specially when working for free , and we can only thanks the great team of WordPressers that make this available . Continue with that passion and work . <p> I 'm not interested in which design you ship ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and image is important . I personally would n't use a design with lots of graphics , but I think a lot of new users would be swayed by the look and feel just as much as by the features of WordPress . <p> I loved learning more about 1.3 , I 'd like to see more stuff like this on the dev-blog , which seems to have stranded <p> I guess you needed to post this , because some people did n't  half get their pants in a twist <p> Good to hear about the other details , I cant wait for 1.3 ( whenever that will be , care to she 'd some light ? ) . As far as Kubrik stylings go it all seems pretty common sense to me . The forum post got overcome by what I call Slashdot Fever/Aint It Cool Idoicy/Livejournal Drama . <p> I think its wonderful what uve been doing I was following the forum thread .. and it got silly at times . Actually .. the whole thread was silly .. <p> anyway looking at the nightly build Seems like the template has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . Well in some ways its harder to configure .. but for the general people I think its wonderful and should make like a lot simpler Wonderful job . <p> You mentioned that Michel is refactoring the XML-RPC code , but did n't  provide a link or details . Is there some way I could reach him ? I 've a patch that implements **25;1050;TOOLONG and would like to work with him to make sure its included . I submitted it to the bug tracker , but it appears to have fallen on the floor . <p> I 'm still running WP 1.2 but my version is a little hacked up . My headers and footers are in a seperate file . My static pages include these same headers , they just do n't  run the WP Loop . I understand that new users would want a default that looked nice , but I can just imagine that 80% of WP installs would just use the same template without ever changing them because they could n't get it to look as good as the original template . <p> While I think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is still a lot to be said for having a functional template that 's easy to use and easy to understand . Let people who want more eye candy do it themselves and provide them with the tools . <p> Perhaps what the WP n00b community needs is n't a good default template but rather a tool to be able to create well presented styles without learning CSS . From all of the WP installations Ive seen people who are completely new and only begin to learn CSS ( and HTML/XHTML ) when they start to personalise their WP install . After all , the reason the internet has come to exist is that we can freely be ourselves , exchange ideas and be bombarded with spam ( well , maybe no the last one ) . <p> Then is n't this the wrong entry to comment about it in ? = I 'm guessing that Matt , like me , does n't  think that any corporations , regardless of how evil they are , would bother with a single track . Especially a track which is by now , rather old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post : its locked . Anyway , I would n't dare to mess with the Evil Empire , regardless how old the track is . I can not afford a bunch of really good attorneys . <p> I recently looked at Kubrick , even made a blog posting about it . I sure hope that a future version of WordPress does n't  include Michael Heilemanns name on every page , the very demand he has made of users who download his template for current WordPress versions . <p> While Kubric is a beautiful template , the concerns he outlined in his article titled Villagers Demand Credit are precisely why I can not use his template on my blog . <p> I just love WordPress . It provides all the necessary tools for us to design our website or blog in whatever theme we like . Plus , we as the end user will have a lot of satisfaction using it . The best part when I show my WordPress blog to my so called Techie friends , their eyes really open wide as they do n't  believe I ( dummy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the dummy now ? = 
@@98356326 @2556326/ <h> Best Headphone Recommendations <p> My friend Jon Callaghan asked me what I recommended in terms of audiophile headphones , so I thought I 'd share my answer with the world here under the Ask Matt category . I use three headphones on a regular basis , and they fall pretty nicely into low , mid , a high-end . There 's a super-high end I 'm not going to cover here , because once you get into the world of headphones requiring amps you might as well just build a good open air system . I 've tried probably two dozen headphones ranging from $50 to $1,200 . <p> When I 'm walking around on the street with my iPhone , my everyday buds are the step-up Apple In-Ear headphones , which come in around $80 . They have a sweet triangle carrying case which makes them compact in my bag , and as a bonus the mic/volume remote thing works great with the 3GS , so I seldom take my phone out of my pocket . Its also handy if you get a call , people have told me the voice quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included iPhone headphones , which always fell out of my ears too . They 're also easy to share with someone . So that 's my everyday pick . <p> If I 'm listening to headphones at home or for a long period , I 'm not a fan of in-ears because they are n't  as comfortable and my ears get " waxy " after more than about an hour . The most comfortable , best sounding , and least hassle headphones Ive found for everyday use are the Sennheiser HD-595s , which I believe I discovered through Jeremy Zawodny . Theyre big and bulky , and the cord is really long , but they 're just so darn comfortable . You can wear these all day and not mind at all . The price point is around $185$220 on Amazon , which I linked above and I feel is an excellent value . <p> My final category of usage is travel , particularly on airplanes , where I want the highest fidelity , comfort , and sound isolation . Honestly in price point there 's a dead zone between around $250$900 , including all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I used to be a Shure fan and have used their entire range . ) This was the hardest category for me to crack , I tried various sound-cancellation models , but ultimately felt like they distorted the sound . <p> I finally ended up going with Ultimate Ear Custom line , first the UE-10 and later the UE-11 . Now these are a bit of an experience , so let me walk you through what happens when you buy them . First you choose your options on the website , I 'd recommend going all-clear for cord and buds , otherwise they look a bit weird . I 've had both the 64 inch and 48 inch cord the 48 is about exactly enough to go under a jacket and from your waist to your ears , but does n't  give you a lot of room otherwise . I have the 64 inch now and the extra inches give me more flexibility and do n't  get in the way . <p> So you go to the website , take out a second mortgage , and plop down $900 for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to a local ear specialist , which basically means someplace that does hearing aids , where they will make a mold of your ear . ( Though the second time I did this it was at a cool rock and roll place in San Francisco . UE keep your molds on file , but apparently the shape changes and if its been more than a year you should get new ones made . ) This is usually pretty cheap , and theyll mail the molds directly to Ultimate Ears with your information . A few weeks later , your headphones show up in a fancy metal box , which now I think they put your name on . <p> I first got the UE-10s probably 5 years ago and the cost was really prohibitive , but then I realized that I had spent almost that much on a series of crappy headphones that kept breaking . They are also like a first-class upgrade on every flight Ive literally been sitting next to a crying baby in the back seat of economy and these headphones blocked the entire thing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someplace else . They work so well because they fit your ear perfectly , so create a seal that blocks external noise , rather than having to juggle the sound to compensate like noise-canceling headphones do . <p> The Ultimate Ears have a feature where the cord pulls out of the buds if they get yanked really hard , presumably to prevent damage to your ear . Because I had gotten the shorter cord I kept doing this , and eventually ( 4 years in ) I had done this so many times they did n't  really stay together properly and I kept dropping them . They also got a lot of abuse in my bag . Their ultimate demise was after I had dropped them the hundredth time and actually stepped on them , shattering the hard plastic mold . I probably could have gotten them repaired , but they were pretty far gone and decided to go for an upgrade instead for just a bit more , the UE-11s . <p> In the 4 years or so between my two purchases , UE definitely made some improvements to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a wrap , and did n't  seem to tangle as much . The new ones came with a nice carrying case that if I had before I might not have broken the old ones so much . I 've also never had a problem with the cord coming out like I did before . I talked Toni into the UE-10s and his new ones had all the same fit and finish . Unfortunately , do n't  think the audio quality difference between the two warranted the $250 price difference. - I 've been using them about 8 months , and theyve travelled with me hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe . Overall the UE-11s just feel a bit heavier on the bass , but not really noticeably better than the UE-10s . If in 5 years I 'm buying another pair I 'll go back to the UE-10s . A downside , or upside , of the Ultimate Ear Customs is no one else can use them . <p> I highly recommend Etymotics as well , but in a different configuration . I 've owned a set of their custom-molded Musicians Earplugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them because I like attending concerts , do n't  want permanent hearing damage ( ringing ears ) , and hate how foam earplugs remove all mid- and high-frequencies and leave only bass . These earplugs provide flat attenuation across the frequency spectrum , so the music sounds as it should , only quieter . <p> here 's the secondary benefit : you can remove the attenuation " buttons " from the custom-molded housings and install them on Etymotic headphones . So adding Etymotic hf2 or ER-6i headphones gives something similar to the Ultimate Ears Customs for about $300 total price , plus the added benefit of hearing protection . Stepping up to the ER-4 headphones + Musicians Earplugs would cost about $450 total . Much less expensive than Ultimate Ears and a similar result . <p> I still havent found anything as good as what you describe the Ultimate Ears to be , but then again , I do n't  listen to enough music on the go to spend a grand on earphones . <p> I will say two things though : <p> 1 . I bought some Etymotics that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom molds made to see that that would help and it really did n't  . If you do n't  like the sound of a certain bud , sell or return them . Custom molds only make good sound more comfortable . <p> 2 . I have Bose QC3s that I pretty much only use on planes . You may be right to dismiss the sound quality ( they are a bit " shaped " ) , but the noise canceling is second to none . If you just want a comfortable set of headphones that cancel airplane noise and have " reasonable " sound , you could do worse than Bose . <p> Personally I just use the classic behind-the-ear Sony headphones as I go through 2-3 pairs a year ( they 're less than $15 a piece ) . With all the abuse I give them , the cord and the ear puffs tend to wear out , so I just cant justify spending $184 on a good set of headphones . Plus I hate having headphones on top of my head . <p> Youd be surprised at how comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's no weight on your ears like there is with the behind-the-ear variety like you linked . But if you 're comfortable , you 're fine ! Everyones head and ears are different . <p> The cord on the Sennheisers is replaceable it opens up and you can disconnect it inside . As for the ear puffs , they 're not made of foam , they 're fabric . I have n't noticed any wear . I wear them for 6-10 hours a day and have been for 6 months or so . <p> And seconded on comfort . I forget they 're on . They 're much lighter than they look , and the cans do n't  clamp your head tightly ( and I have a big head ) . <p> I also ( independently ) settled on the Sennheiser HD-595s . They sound great , but can be powered with a MacBook Pro or a desktop computer with a decent sound card , whereas the more expensive Sennheisers require a bulky headphone amp . They 're so comfortable , I tend to keep them on even if I 'm not listening to music . Really . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side , to reduce entanglements , and it comes with a nice storage " hook " that clamps to your desk . Recommended without reservation . <p> For travel , I have the Etymotic Research hf2 canal phones , which I reviewed here . I 'm not completely happy with them . Theyre uncomfortable over long periods of time , and if you 're moving around , the seal in your ear canal can be broken , letting in a " whoosh " of sound . That , of course , is subjective , depending on the shape of your ear canal . They 're pretty good if you 're on a plane , holding still . They block out so much noise that you have to take one out whenever a flight attendant wants to talk to you . You cant even hear your own voice ! I 'd considered a custom mold pair , but wanted to see if I 'd be happy with a cheaper solution . Thanks for the OE-10 recommendation I might check that out . How is the comfort level over extended periods ? <p> Ah yes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must-have " list for quite some time . I made do with the Triple-Fi for a while , but the cord frayed every 6 months or so , and I eventually grew tired of replacing it . <p> Right now I 'm using a pair of Shures every day ! Im surprised you havent had luck with them . I have the SE530s , and I find the sound and comfort to be comparable to the UEs . <p> Total audio junkie here ! ! Glad to see your post . You and I have done pretty much the same thing . I went with the Etymotics ER-6i and , like you , went to a local shop to have some ear molds custom-fit. *That* was an experience as I 'm sure you can attest ! I use the custom 6is all the time on planes , etc . I have had them for at least 5 years and they are still working great . <p> If I had to purchase again , I 'd probably go with the $900 ones you mentioned . I know Scoble raved about them . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably hold out for a while yet . <p> Also like you , at home , I have a pair of Sennheisers . I have the HD-590s , which Richard has pretty much stolen at this point = I bought them when they were the equivalent of the 595s YEARS ago ! <p> Surprised you did n't  mention what speakers you have . If you do n't  have some super-awesome speakers , I 'd be surprised ! I splurged on myself for my birthday last year and had Jim Salk of Salk Sound build me some custom towers . here 's the link to what I purchased:http : **28;1077;TOOLONG <p> I got the custom wood job and worked with Jim to pick out the exact slab of wood that would become my speakers . They were delivered in September and they are AMAZING ! They truly blow many $25,000 speakers out of the water . Plus , they look sexy . And I think its super-cool to support a guy who builds speakers in Michigan vs. big-name companies that build them in far away factories . <p> I hooked them up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is also worth every penny . If you use your computers internal sound card to drive sound , you have no idea what you 're missing ! <p> The Stereo-Link is hooked up to a Bob Carver Sunfire stereo amp . Not sure I 'd recommend the Sunfire ; many cheaper amps would do the same job . I 'd probably go with a different brand of stereo amp next time . <p> Anyway , from one audio nut to another , thanks for posting this ! = I love when I see a post about good audio without the bragging about how much you spent ( *cough*AVSForum*cough* ) . I emphasize quality , not high price ! ( Tho I do love AVSForum for helping me find Jim Salk . ) <p> I was traveling a lot for business myself a couple of years ago and stumbled upon in-ear models as opposed to earbuds in my research . After a lot of looking into options and figuring out what I could afford , I landed on the ER-6i models from Etymotic Research . <p> They list for $150 , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment for being on the lower-end of the cost spectrum . They come with several interchangeable tips ( including foam ones ) to fit different ear canals , and do a pretty good job of blocking out external noise , though I do n't  think the bass response is all that awesome . They do sell a step-up model at twice the price for better quality . <p> After using good in-ear models that block out external noise , its hard to go back to using anything else , especially when flying . <p> At just $20 I know audiophiles will instinctively shun the KTXPRO1 but I dare you to give them a try and discover how they are the best budget headphones you 'll ever use http : **30;1107;TOOLONG <p> Because of the price you 'll never worry about losing them and they sound fantastic . If you want them in a more portable format try these http : **30;1139;TOOLONG but I like the KTXPRO1s better ( and earbuds = yuck ) <p> I 've played with Shure , Etymotic Research and Ultimate Ears MetroFi all $25-$150 . The Etymotic Research HF2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound and a good seal plus a mic that is naturally positioned in the right spot ( unfortunately i lost that pair in under a month ) . The Ultimate Ears MetroFi is one of the best deals right now Amazon is offering them for $25 marked down from $60 . For the custom molds , I had musician earplugs made that block out the high and low damaging frequencies . It was much cheaper than the custom earbuds and health insurance paid , though I cant listen to personal audio with them in : ( <p> Something I forgot to mention , the Ultimate Ears looks sort odd , and so I wear them and listen to music all the time when you 're not supposed to on plane take-offs and landings and the stewards never say anything maybe once in the past year they 've noticed . <p> The audio thing I use actually a ton when I 'm on the road that I never expected is the built-in speaker on the iPhone . I find if I want to show someone a song , a quick Youtube video , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to put some tunes in the air , even though its as far as you can get from audiophile as possible . Sometimes I just need the barest recreation and my imagination fills in the rest , it also makes you appreciate it more when you get into a real system . <p> I love Sennheiser headphones . I have had 3 pairs over the years and i 'm currently using the Sennheiser PC350 headset , mind you these headphones are aimed at gamers . I spend about 4 hours a day gaming and the PC350s are perfect for CoD and TF2 . <p> I 'm a Sennheiser fan and my at-work day-to-day cans are a pair of HD 580s . Fantastic sound , particularly when mated to a good amp . I 've since tried the 595s and found them very similar indeed . <p> I struggle with the fit of isolated headphones ( weird shaped ears ? ) but I reckon the UEs would be fantastic . Too expensive to justify for me , though if I were clocking up more air miles I may change my mind Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250s which areadequate . Compared to similarly-priced competitors they 're good but the sound is definitely compromised with the cancelling on . But *so* much better than regular ear bud headphones on a plane . <p> Connected to my iPod are a pair of Sennheiser CX300s which are excellent for the price . Cheap but decent . <p> I had the 595s for a while and upgraded to the 650s I strongly recommend that you do so . The improvement is well worth it . Lots of people say you 'll need an expensive headphone amp for the 650s but try them with your current source first and then you might fancy going amped later ( the Corda Arietta is good value and works great with the 650s ) . Happy listening ! <p> I used to have Boss on-ear which were really great , but stupidly lost them . I tried Boss around-ear and they were far too trebly . <p> These days I use Koss headphones a pair of Porta Pro when I am out and a pair of UR-40 when at my desk . The sounds quality is great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out much ambient noise . They 're really inexpensive , too . <p> As far as headphones , the UE-10 does sound very interesting indeed . However , I need a headset with a microphone , so for years I use the Sennheiser PC 151 ( G40/$55 ) . But now I may very well consider an alternative for travels because the PC 151 is so bulky . <p> I am just curious as to your statement , to wit : Avoid everything Bose . Why ? Care to elaborate ? <p> I am a Bose user now and is looking for an upgrade . I am not a Bose fan or anything and I do n't  have brand-specific biases . I just would like to find out what makes Bose unloved compared to other manufacturers . <p> I just got the Sennheiser MM50IP earbuds for my iPhone . They have better bass than the Apple In-Ear ones and also include a mic and button for making calls . Only negatives are they do n't  have the volume control buttons and I do n't  like how the right ear cord is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way better to me than the Apple In-Ears . <p> Totally agree on the problems with earbud style headphones when you 're sitting at your desk . <p> But I ca n't handle cords so I want high fidelity ( wonderful phrase ) and Bluetooth and a reasonable price andnot neckbased ones ( which are uncomfortable in my experience <p> At the moment this appears to be very hard to find I would love to know if they exist or I may be forced to write a Bluetooth headphone review ( and we do n't  want that ) . The ones I previously had which have just died were the Plantronics P590s but annoyingly they do n't  appear to make them any longer . <p> Other than the Apple headphones for the 3GS ( which I use too ) , I 've never been big on headphones ( mainly because I 've never really sat down and tried to find a pair I like ) . Normally when I work I 'm at home , and I have a fairly decent home audio set up , so I just listen to everything on that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  subject my UE-10s to that . Are the Apple In-Ear any good , or do people recommend something else . I think I 've trashed some Apple standard buds due to moisture that is inherent with a good workout . <p> Ive been using the Etymotic Labs ER6i for about two years now . They are amazing at blocking out sounds which is great for when I 'm in the airplane for 12+ hours . I wear them all day at the office too , though since they are inner-ear headphones my ears tend to get all bitchy towards the end of the day . Sound quality is amazing , too . <p> Last week I started looking for new headphones and this time around-ear ones . I settled with Sennheisers HD380 . I had to order them from America as they are non-existent in Asia ( I 'm living and working in South Korea ) , so I 'm waiting for them to come here . Ca n't wait to try them out , have heard great things about them ! <p> Thanks for the article ! One day I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> If anyones looking for a cheapie set of sound-good comfy on-ear headphones , Sennheisers PX100 pair are great , and come with a hard carrying case they fold into as well . No good for sound isolation , but great for general use . <p> Even though I run a home recording podcast , I do n't  have any genuinely high-end headphones . My recording cans are Audio-Technicas ATH-M50 and Sennheisers HD280Pro . Both are boring black and closed-back , so they provide a lot of isolation ( especially the Senns ) . The audio quality is n't as good as the HD595 or 600 or 650 or 800 , or high-end Grados or AKGs or whatever , but they are very neutral ( clinical , if you do n't  like that ) , stay on tight and keep the sound in and out , great for recording ( even drums ) . The ATs are a little more comfortable , but the Senns give more isolation . <p> I agree that Shure in-ear buds are sometimes fragile , but you can get great isolation out of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the best-sounding closed-back reference headphones I 've ever heard ( the PRO650 ) , as well as some other really good-sounding models for audiophile use . Grados cans are fine all across the line too , from the low to the ( very ! ) high end , even if they look a bit old-fashioned . <p> I recommend headphone.com as a place that sells good headphones , but also reviews them honestly , with frequency charts and recommendations . <p> I 've gone through maybe more headphones than you = The ultimate most comfortable yet BEST SOUNDING EVER ? The Denon AH-D5000 they can be had for around $450 ( a lot , yet so little once you try them on ) . <p> Thanks for all of the great information . Ive been looking around the web for recommendations on headphones for weeks , but nothing was as concrete as your reviews . Thanks ! Ill be picking up the Sennheisers soon . I 'll add the UEs to my wish list . <p> Emanuel I have the Beyerdynamics DT880 the sound is incredible and for me they are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also generally less expensive than the comparable AKG and Sennheisers . <p> For portable in-ear use , I use the q-jays . They are the smallest duel driver IEM on the market and are very balanced . The bass is not heavy , so they are n't going to be for everyone , but for someone looking for a super small IEM that sounds great , it 's a good choice at $200 . I think people considering the UE-10 who are on a limited budget should give them a test drive . <p> The Sony active style headphones are the best I ever had . I left them on a public bus though the other day by accident and am definitely buying a new pair . They never fell out no matter what I was doing . Even while running . and if I fall asleep with them on they fall out but not much . <p> I have the Sennheiser HD280 Pros not bad , not the best either but they 've been with me through college and then some . They 're not that expensive where i 'm worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step up from the usual . <p> Wow , this is a coincidence . I just bought the ASUS XONAR Essence STX PCIe Audio Card ; and decided new headphones were in order . <p> I was just about to click the button on a pair of the Sennheiser 595s when I started reading Matts thread . Ill have to go do some homework on everyones recommendations . Thanks folks ! Although , the Sennheisers are recommended all over the planet they must be well worth the money . <p> Totally agree with Matt on the no-Bose rule . I bought a pair of the QC2s back in the day ( against my better judgement , b/c I do n't  care for their speakers either ) and I think it spent less than 5 minutes on my ears before I returned them . <p> I next tried the Audio Technica QuietPoint ATH-ANC7 ( noise canceling ) . I love em . They 're my airplane and block the world out , I 'm in a zone headphones . Really surprised no one else mentioned them . <p> Ill throw in a vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . <p> PS&gt; if you 're looking at AblePlanet stuff , I 'd probably stay away if I were you .

@@98356328 @2556328/ <p> I think one challenge a lot of the business schools have is they end up attracting students who are very extroverted and have very low conviction , and they put them in this hot house environment for a few years " at the end of which , a large number of people go into whatever was the last trendy thing to do .

@@98356330 @2556330/ <p> The question implicit in your comment is : Could we design a system that offers the ease of accessibility of the first few steps of a PHP programmers career but , as one climbs the learning curve , eventually blossoms into Python or Ruby or even Lisp ? I wish I knew . My best guess as of this morning is that a demigod could design such a system , but its very difficult for mortal humans to do so , because once you know how to program its hard to avoid overdesigning , putting in things that will eventually be useful in year two but are discouraging in year zero . We make terrible pedagogical mistakes , like turning everything into an object . ( Does your ORM seem intuitive to you ? That is why PHP is beating your system in the marketplace . ) <p> Hopefully to a user itd look the same . Under the hood itd be different , but not necessarily better or worse . In a previous life I wrote Perl for money , so I was fairly fluent in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything I 've tried , I like Javascript the best , but its also probably my weakest . <p> I share your hopes that it would look the same to the user ; the backend has amazing design , polish and soul . <p> However , I think given the chance to break backwards compatibility and rewrite from nil , you and your team would probably do a much better job on the internals . For example , It would be nice to have a cleaner separation of view and application logic . <p> Agreed on the Javascript front its a great , dynamic language , but feels a bit like the Wild West ; there is no one " right way " to do anything . <p> The comment is saying that PHPs main advantage is that it maps well to the mental model of people who do n't  know how to program yet , while still being flexible enough to scale up to run complex sites like WordPress.com and Facebook . The original article it was in response to was a fairly comprehensive list of all the things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many languages I never really left the " newb " programmer phase because I ran into too many things that stopped me cold and did n't  have a mentor to help me through when cash or clients were on the line . <p> PHP and JavaScript are the first languages that I feel I 'm somewhat beyond n00b mode . <p> I think what it would look like framework modules . <p> Design me a framework ( like Thematic ) that has done the heavy lifting and allows me to gradually extend my knowledge , and I 'll learn how things like hooks and callbacks and conditional statements and the loop and responsive design works make the next steps automatic . " You must learn how to create a widget area because these widget areas are not handy . You must learn how to design a template page because the existing ones do n't  meet your needs . " And so on . <p> But where to go from there ? Another module , probably . <p> The problem is you 'd have to pass up quite a bit of client work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside and out might be willing to sacrifice the time if someone was footing the bill . <p> Yes , frameworks become your best friends when you know a little bit about what 's under the hood . I guess they also add constraints ( or conventions ) that make things harder to break , because they enforce good practices . Of course , everyone has a different idea of what constitutes a good practice . Its all a delicate balance between ease of use , security , scalability , and design elegance ( whatever that means to each individual developer ) <p> The key for everything sort of appeared with C. Since then , a huge number of languages have ( more or less ) adopted its syntax . It makes transitioning from one language to most others not all that crazy . Usually . Its the function libraries that kill ya they can be frightfully large . <p> I still remember the true craziness I had using FORTRAN , COBOL , and Univac 1100 assembly at school ; Pascal , Ada , and VAX-11 assembly at work ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHPnot so bad . <p> It boils down to having/using the right tools for the job . For the web , PHP is a pretty darned good tool for programming . <p> I 'm at the other end of the scale : I started programming in 1971 , in FORTRAN then I learned System/360 Assembler . I very much like PHP , mainly for its ability to make most things youd ever want to do on the Web , possible in a relatively few lines of readable code . <p> Arguments about what other languages WordPress could be written in forget one important detail : the low entry level bar that PHP represents for would-be programmers . That is extremely important because so much of what some many site owners do with WordPress involves modifying or writing PHP . Can you imagine having to write/modify WordPress customizations in C ? Or VBA ? I cant . <p> I can not think of another open source programming language that is so bloated . Being both a software developer and a teacher , I could handle my students to build a software architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something that ca n't be done with PHP just because you need to stop and explain every feature , make them read the documentation on differences between strrev and strsplit and why the language is inconsistent . PHP developers are crazy , yes they should be in a psychiatrist , not in a room full of computers developing . Seriously . <p> And do n't  tell me that the learning curve is easy , because it " appears " to be easy . Python and Ruby are much easier to learn . <p> Agreed , Ryan . PHP is very easy to " hack around " with , meaning to copy and paste bits of code and make it work somehow . But of course it gets messy once you try do things a bit more professionally . You have to do a lot of housekeeping . Maybe good PHP frameworks can help with that by introducing helpful constraints and conventions , as we discussed with Gabriel in his comment above . What do you think ? Any preferred PHP framework ? <p> Ill never understand why people feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruby and Python all the languages are great and have their own pros and cons . Its not like any of them are evil corporations trying to do the world a dis-service . They 're all open source and there 's enough room on the internet for all of them . Heck there 's even enough space to get a bit of C programming in . <p> If they chose Ruby , its because in their mind its better than PHP or Python , regardless of whether or not its true . To admit otherwise would be admitting that they were wrong to choose Ruby in the first place , and most people hate to admit that they 're wrong . <p> I agree that the point is moot . They 're all programming languages , and what works for one person might not work for another , just as learning one language might be easier than learning another . <p> During the development of my first and biggest PHP project ( register.mu , since then re-written in Java ) , I came across all kinds of inconsistencies with PHP but once I had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as features of the language . <p> But , after reading the original post this comment was made at , I realised that my doubts about PHP were founded . <p> These days , I do n't  think its worth going with PHP when there are so many alternatives .

Lots of folks have it in their ping lists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an RSS aggregator . It accepted pings , then it provided two distinct sets services based on the update info : 1 ) User services for making a list of favorite sites , and seeing when they updated , plus blogroll widgets that you could embed in your own site . 2 ) XML data streams of updates ( a virtual firehose of blog update times ) . This tied in to the whole feedmesh idea mentioned . <p> Ping-O-Matic is ping aggregation : one ping redistributed to multiple other services ( including blo.gs ) . I think at one time we had a page that showed the most recent pings ( but I think it was for internal/admin use only ) . Does the API for checking update times still work ? I had always hoped it would be used to revive the blogroll ordering feature in WordPress . <p> I 'm curious to see what new and interesting things might arise from the merging of the massive Ping-O-Matic update stream with the blo.gs service .

There 's a kernel of truth for the wider economy in a growth-based startup being founded on open-source software . <p> I think like Trevor below ( who has mentioned inflation ) what happens when inflation grows in unison with automationso all of the sudden , there is this financial pressure ( say on the shop keeper ) so all of the sudden , it is n't that it is n't a preference , but a necessity to be able to be a viable business . <p> I think a big issue is many people do n't  have the flexibility or ability of time to pursue humanities , spiritual or physical enrichment or at least the buffer to get thereI know I 'm like that . I know what to do . I know how to meditate , I know how to help . I still remember how to work out ( I think lol ) <p> I have no idea , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visualize some of these things , Ive seen things change so much . Remember , I have 10 years on you haha . #&amp; ! *@**$ ( not that Ive done better with them ) . <p> I watched this when you posted itwas literally thinking about it all day today in my travels , coffee shop , street crowds . How many of those happy people will undergo a complete lifestyle change . I can think through big changes even in a 5 year window . The fact that custom orders are n't  a big deal and there is no exhaustion factor . It does make you think . <p> You can think back in multiple levels and also understand that that type of approach may not be so stable anymore . I could go on and on , but I also thought of the advertising post , of which I only saw the headline , but I had to wait for that to view the video heh . <p> We humans are very adaptable . I remember hearing that computers would increase productivity so much that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . Our quality of life would improve dramatically . As computing became more prominent , the amount of work expected to be done grew as well . And we also got the added workload of keeping up with and managing all our technological gadgets . There has been a big change in the way people work just from 25 years ago . <p> Of course robotics will take jobs from humans they already have . And the jobs of managing them , building them , maintaining them are not as many as the jobs they have replaced . But we must remember we humans consume the product of all that productivity ! And we slowly adapt our lifestyle to fit the reality of our lives . <p> Take a look at Spain for example . The country suffered dramatically from " La Crisis " ( economic downturn ) that quickly left 25% of its workforce unemployed . And even those with jobs were getting paid sporadically and sometimes not at all . So extended family started living together . People took temporary gigs and started getting creative in how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give up looking for work and just take care of the household . Many people went overseas to look for jobs . It has been a struggle , but people are surviving and adjusting their lives and their expectations . <p> We see a lighter version of this in the US where the Millennial generation is much more comfortable living at home or getting economic help from their parents . So many of these people did n't  get the chance to work a menial first job as the traditional fast food , supermarket and retail jobs are now being occupied by people in their 30s rather than teens . My generation would rather survive on five for a dollar Ramen noodles than move back home ! But then we did n't  see all our friends graduate from college with very few opportunities to put their degrees to work . <p> Remember seeing this while back .. CBPGrey is very smart , but I think he overshot it here . There 's this assumption that because it becomes cheaper to automate things , humans become superfluous . There 's no way this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disproportion of wealth that we have currently . If it starts happening in rich countries movements are going to arise to keep peoples jobs ( like Grey hints at in the video ) and of course the general distrust in robots is going to become very apparent . Its going to be a very slow process . Not to say that it wont eventually happen though . <p> In a utopia where wealth is distributed evenly , there 's no racism , all wars have ended and robots do all of our manual labour for us , I truly believe that we can continue living and prosper . As a species I think were held back from further accelerating our knowledge about the universe and our own existence because were globally still very much tied up in the very basic human needs . In a world where shelter , food , and prosperity is a given , humans could attempt to uncover the very depths of our intellect and focus solely on creating a better existence for ourselves and everything around us . <p> I mean , if were having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mastered time travel , would we really want to talk about how awesome it is to not have to work for food or would we causally discuss the meaning of Pi ? <p> @Isaac I think a good question to ponder is the middle ground between here and there , which is what the video provokes ( for me at least ) . <p> As humans we need a challenge to tackle . Productive and creative labour is disappearing . What do we point our attention to next ? How do we create a transition from a growth-based economy based on consumption of physical goods to something that caters to human nature in a world where those problems are taken care of ? <p> As we move away from an economy of " things " it becomes even more difficult to fairly value things . If I 'm selling you a bushel of wheat , $10 or $1000 will buy me something like a couple orders of magnitude " a bagful or a truckful . But what about where we are headed now , to humans exchanging experiences and meaning ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10 ? $100 ? $1000 ? Can you buy 100x more spiritual experience for 100x more money ? Suddenly the value propositions that make sense in a physical age stop having meaningful anchor points . <p> I 'm not really an advocate for eliminating fiat currency . It works really well for things we can hold in our hands . What I think we need is another layer on top " a software layer " that begins to give us a way to value and exchange things that are meaningful to us . <p> I have some ideas " Stellar is a step in the right direction " but I 'm not sure where and how these ideas might move forward . <p> There are a few logical flaws in this demonstration . It is brilliant , informative , but I do n't  think they have considered the right perimeter . <p> First thing : when they say that we have so few new jobs in highly innovative economies , therefore we would have 45% of unemployement , they forget the time adjustment : new jobs become important in numbers after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ones , its free workforce finding new things to do . <p> Second thing : they reason on a developped country only view , considering that machines will always be cheaper than humans . That 's not true . In many countries , automation is not there because people are cheaper . What will happen might not be unemployement , but impoverishment , like it started in the USA . Eg. Amazon still employs a lot of manual workers in its warehouses , because they are cheaper than machines . In Europe , things are different . <p> There are many other things that can be discussed . Including our own capacity or not to enslave ourselves . Horses are not humans , and the humans who drove cars never had brothers , sisters , friends , lovers that were horses . sound stupid , but it means the paradigm is actually different . <p> I 'm with you with the ( bot ) music . The whole video did leave some depressing / bitter taste here the music , the speed and the monotony of the speaker not to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can trigger emotions with that little illusions ( projections ) we are somehow confronted more and more in all parts of life . If these are generated from some big mechanical bot mind without some natural human heart and soul , we kinda could enter a real cold and mechanical world , greated by ourselves . How sad . <p> Had to think about Bjorks " All Is Full Of Love " <p> And BMW needs to change their slogan soon Freude am Fahren / Sheer Driving Pleasure for whom for the bots ? In a land with speed limit and huge distances ? <p> BTW there 's a much more beautiful video ( link ) in the Info section of the video if you watch it via YouTube . Its about the Mandelbrot Set complex distance problem included : <p> Very interesting video . There will definitely be large parts of the population that lose their jobs in the future due to automation &amp; computers and something we should think about . On a similar note to this , Stephen Hawkings is worried about artificial intelligence in robots &amp; computers . 
@@98356347 @2556347/ <h> Infrastructure as Competitive Advantage <p> There 's an interesting post at GigaOM : Web 2.0 , Please Meet Your Host , the Internet . Its a good read , though could be shorter , but a few things struck me after reading it . I do n't  disagree with him per se , I just think the emphasis is on the wrong thing . ( Probably for effect . ) <p> Infrastructure can be a competitive advantage today the speed and reliability of WordPress.com has certainly put us in a favorable light with users , especially large customers but that 's going to disappear over time . Were very much at version 0.1 of things like Amazons web services and App Engine , but its not hard to read the writing on the wall and understand that level of abstraction is going to be the future foundation of web applications . I 'm not counting on infrastructure to be a long-term competitive advantage for Automattic . <p> Second , Allan describes a case of a DDOS attack hurting a friends startup who had very little information about how to stop it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed by the blogosphere . The application has suffered from a stream of bad publicity ; it 's also missed a major window of opportunity for user adoption , which has sloped significantly downward since the DDOS attack and shows no sign of recovering . <p> We can all name startups or sites that are n't  particularly known for their performance , but that flourished in spite of it . Twitter and MySpace comes to mind . If we dug a little deeper we could also find thousands of startups who were prepared for the world to show up to their door , and it never did . Building something people want is much harder than scaling it . ( In most cases . ) If you solve the what-people-want problem , theyll use you no matter how bad your interface is , how slow your site is , just give them somewhere worth waiting for . I would suspect the friend here is n't seeing their usage decline because on their Techcrunch day the site was n't responsive , its that they 're probably still in the before market fit stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of performance , but most people forget that on the web 80-95% of performance is on the front end not the page generation time . ( I realize I 'm saying this on a site with a 140kb header graphic . : ) ) Yahoo has fantastic resources on this . When a website " pops " it probably has very little to do with their underlying server infrastructure and a lot to do with the perceived performance largely driven by how its coded at the HTML , CSS , and Javascript level . This , incidentally , is one of the reasons Google Gears is going to change the web as we know it today LocalServer will obsolete CDNs as we know them . ( Look for this in WordPress soonish . ) <p> Finally , for the next few years before we have true utility computing , there are some great " hardware as a service " providers like Layered Tech and Server Beach that essentially handle everything from the power to the network to hardware , and let you take over from the operating system up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WordPress.org , and its great . Its allowed us to focus on what matters our software and service . You still need a pro like Allan describes to handle things at the OS level ( most performance problems I see are badly configured servers , not hardware limitations ) but leave networking and hardware to people with economies of scale . This comment nails it . <p> Damn it Matt , I 'm never visiting your site on my 3G mobile if its 140Kb just for that pretty ( and I do place emphasis on pretty ) header image ! <p> Great post , other tools to assist developers in optimising front-end coding include Web Developer and Firebug for Firefox as well as Dragonfly for Opera users . Today there really is no excuse for poorly structured and performance optimised front-end coding now that we have W3C and mature development tools <p> If you solve the what-people-want problem , they 'll use you no matter how bad your interface is , how slow your site is <p> Disagree . All the usability in the world wont make a useless service useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless . There are any number of organisations whose products or services I wanted , but which I have abandoned because I could not get their website to work , <p> Infrastructure will become a competitive advantage for specialist infrastructure providers . Application innovation will be done by specialist application innoators but few companies will succeed in doing both . <p> That 's why things like Google Application Engine are so important . They finally let application innovators forget about / no longer have to live or die by their infrastructure ability . <p> " Google Gears is going to change the web as we know it today LocalServer will obsolete CDNs as we know them " <p> Do you mean that you see the users installation of Gears slurping down the entire website/blog in the background , giving desktop app speeds as the user surfs within the website ? Wouldnt that result in horrific bandwidth costs and CPU contention ? <p> Also , enjoy Milan , awesome food but , seriously , be careful not to display an expensive camera when you 're out and about because Milanese muggers do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , we need you to not be brain-damaged . <p> I think you 're insulated from a lot of the bad choices that startups make because you have an excellent team particularly Barry . That speaks volumes about how your company was able to attract and hire top-of-the-line talent so you do n't  have to worry about hosting . <p> However , I have to say , WordPress is not typical in this regard . Because of your superb team , you 're able to use unmanaged dedicated servers and have your team work out all the kinks . Even so , I know you had problems with a particular unmanaged dedicated server provider in SF . <p> What I 'm saying is that your success is not typical . Its far more typical to do what Twitter has done and assume that Verio can handle " everything " and then 1 ) refuse to hire and 2 ) let go of anyone on your staff who knows anything about scaling . <p> When I talked to the Twitter guys , I was shocked to find that they had decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Barry " on their team who really gets this stuff . And they outsourced to a hosting company that charges a lot of money , but no one on their team knew enough about it to understand whether the hosting company was feeding them a line of BS . <p> Your experiences can not be applied to most startups . All startups that expect to massively scale need a " Barry " . But your post seems to imply that unmanaged hosting is still the way to go for these startups . I have to disagree . <p> Optimally , most startups should pick managed hosting AND have a " Barry " on call . Barrys are expensive , but worth their weight in gold , and its to him and your team that you owe your decision to go with unmanaged hosting . Without him , I do n't  think you would have nearly the success you 've had with unmanaged hosting . <p> The underlying presumption is that sites are live . A majority of people still waste all their time on radio and TV and these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch potato to actively search for content . Infrastructure is important only to the extent the average couch potato is competent . <p> @WordSkill : What Matt means is you can use the Gears LocalServer functionality LONG ... to bring down bundles of your web applications user-interface , such as CSS , HTML , JavaScript , etc . Then , Gears will serve this up to the browser whether you are on- or off-line , so that the UI flashes on to the page quickly . Standard HTTP 1.1 caching is fine for many uses , but because Gears can bundle a set of UI resources and efficiently update them things can be faster in some scenarios . <p> In terms of overloading a users machine , you want to be intelligent in what you push down . You obviously would not push down all of Wikipedia = Instead , bundling up your static resources can really help , especially if you have an Ajax style application that is primarily driven by JavaScript or more classic web apps that have Ajax sections . Check out the PubTools open source library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make this stuff much easier without having to delve into JavaScript ( http : **35;1209;TOOLONG ) . <p> Good post , Matt . Reliability is a key success factor for web hosts and web sites . It can be hard to find a Barry to address reliability and scalability issues before they affect revenue . Managed hosting can be a big help , though . <p> I 'd be interested in hearing a bit more on your ideas around Google Gears . I read a lot about it when it first came out and sort of shrugged it off as " hey , that 's neat , " but that 's where it ended . It only helps things when you 're offline and want to get at content , or construct content offline and push it when you 're online . How often does the average person find themselves offline ? Not very often for me , and I live in Canada without an unlimited data plan ( if I were in the states , I 'd be online all the time conceivably , except on airplanes ) . I 'm not sure what 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browsers on all platforms ( last time I checked , they still did n't  have anything for Mac browsers ) , or wireless penetration will allow most people to be online nearly all the time and eliminate the need for Gears . <p> Its a neat idea , and I 'm interested to see what you guys do with it and WordPress . But the jury is still out in my mind on whether or not its necessary . <p> " If you solve the what-people-want problem , they 'll use you no matter how bad your interface is , how slow your site is , just give them somewhere worth waiting for . " <p> Well , there 's a limit . For years I heard about how great Wikipedia was , but whenever I visited the images would n't load , and half the time the text page itself would timeout before it finished loading . 
@@98356353 @2556353/ <h> Jawbone UP vs Basis <p> I 've always been into personal analytics . From Wakemate to the Nike Fuelband I 've tried pretty much every device that 's come on the market to help you become more self-aware of your activities , and hopefully improve them as well . <p> Lately Ive settled on two that I think are really high quality : the Jawbone UP- and the Basis watch . I would recommend either above the Nike Fuelband or Fitbit , but let me share some brief thoughts about my experiences with each : <p> The UP is beautiful its easy to wear with pretty much any outfit , even with formal wear I find I can move it up my arm a little bit inside my sleeve above my shirt cuff thanks to the flexible nature of the band . The social app they have for it is cool , though it can be a little weird to see your teammates minute-by-minute sleeping habits ( " Hey ! I noticed you were up between 3:32 and 3:50 AM last night . How bout them Giants ? " ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery life is over a week so you never have to think about it , but you do have to carry around a proprietary connector for it which I keep losing leaving me ( like right now ) with an uncharged and useless device . To sync you plug the band into your phones headphone port and the sync takes a few seconds , its a fun process I do usually first thing in the morning to see how I slept the night before and its also fun to demo to friends . The first one I had was in their " mint green " color and I ended up wearing it out it started to look dirty and I broke it where the headphone jack comes out making it difficult to charge and sync . That said , I was pretty rough on it . My new one is blue and I like it much better . My only big complaint about how the whole thing works is it does n't  detect when you go to sleep , you have to press and hold the button on the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would frequently forget to do . I really like the idea of the smart alarm and power nap features even though I never used them . <p> The Basis is a bit clunky and retro looking , but functionality-wise it provides some really cool data : it tracks your heart rate , skin temperature , perspiration level , steps , and sleep . It detects automatically when you 're asleep , no buttons to push . The data is presented in a really cool web app that let 's you compare some of the data points and that I learned cool things from , like my heart rate jumps about 20 beats per minute when I wake up , and I 'm most warm about two thirds into my sleep cycle . There do n't  appear any social features that Ive seen in the software , though its habit formation tracking seems pretty slick . The way the " buttons " work on the device is pretty cool , the silver dots in the corners are touch-sensitive . There 's a button on the side that I have n't figured out what it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UP its got an even clunkier proprietary USB thing that both syncs to your computer and charges , but because the display can show you how you 're doing as you go throughout the day I do n't  feel the need to- synchronize- it as often . The heart rate tracking is by far my favorite feature . Its comfortable to wear , but does n't  disappear like the UP . Finally , as an added bonus , it tells the time . ( Surprising useful . ) If it somehow merged with the Pebble I 'd be in geek heaven . <p> If I had to pick between the two I 'd just use the Basis . The awkwardness of the device is outweighed by the richness of the data it provides . For right now I 'm not choosing : I wear one on each wrist and compare the data . ( Its always within a few % of each other for things they both do . ) If I were hiking in the woods for a week I 'd probably just take the UP as its battery would last the entire time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these systems are , they do n't  talk to each other at all and it appears unlikely they ever will . <p> Long-term I think we really need an open source package you can run on your own servers that can ingest the data from all of these services , say from back when I used to use a Wakemate- sleep tracking to todays Fitbit Aria scale , the meals I track in the UP app with my Basis heart rate data and Runkeeper- and Hundred Pushup- logs , and provide you with a single data store for all the personal analytics you generate across various services . I think there 's going to be a lot of competition in this space in the next few years . <p> I agree . We definitely need an open source solution . I have an ActiveLink from Weight Watchers and I like it , but have also played with the Fitbit stuff . But the problem I keep running into is that there 's all this data that 's being tracked , and I cant access it because none of these devices have interfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to see something like WordPress that would allow me to take data from something like a wristband and see whatever stats I 'm generating , export them , compare them between days , ETC . <p> My problem with both of these devices is very simple i just ca n't get them they are always out of stock and not being sold in my country ( and when i come to a country which does sell them they are out of stock ) . I 'm also curious about getting such a great sleep any secrets about it ? = <p> 1 . I do n't  drink any caffeine from soft drinks or coffee , I might have a green tea or two earlier in a day . 2 . I go to sleep when Im tired , but do n't  do movies or TV near bedtime because I find those keep me awake artificially . ( Screens are fine , just not motion pictures. ) 3 . I leave my curtains open and wake up with the light usually , no alarms 4 . If I get tired in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though seldom successful its nice to relax for a bit . <p> This is what works well now , but always experimenting and iterating . The exception to my caffeine rule is speaking overseas , where I 'll have some Red Bull to avoid dozing off on stage . = <p> All good tips ! The number one for me is to unplug from my desktop at least an hour and a half before I go to bed . Once I get riled up from my evening freelance web monkeying it takes me a while to get web off the brain ! <p> I bought but never really got into the habit of using the FitBit . I guess that 's mainly because it does n't  capture my main form of exercise , cycling , but I was underwhelmed by their online service anyway . <p> A Wi-Fi weighing scale , on the other hand , is something I would recommend to anyone . Stepping onto a scale for a few seconds fits seamlessly into your morning routine , so , for the effort of establishing a simple habit , you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FitBit Aria but I presume the Withings is pretty much the same , every weighing scale should have Wi-Fi . <p> Sure , your could keep a pen and paper near a normal scale and keep a manual record but the truth is that , if you add that many steps , 99% of people wont bother I sure as Hell never did . So , yeah , devices and services that make quantifying your activity and your results easier are going to be massive and do a massive amount of good . I reckon the resulting awareness will then lead to a secondary explosion in innovative fitness products such as walking desks . <p> So great to hear your insights after simultaneous usage of 2 devices . I recently did a similar experiment for http : //lifestreamblog.com/ testing 4 devices simultaneously which included the Jawbone Up , Nike Fuelband , Fitbit One and Bodymedia armband . I would have loved to also test the Basis which has additional sensors like the Bodymedia armband . Those sensors are pretty important for getting more accurate data . I 'm finalizing my roundup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will include a comparison matrix . I can tell you that in the end though there is no perfect device and choosing one is a personal decision based on which factors are most important to you and ultimately will help you modify your behavior in a positive fashion . <p> I 'm a bit annoyed with the Up Band . In December they offered a $150 credit for folks who bought the older model ( so we could upgrade to the new better one ) . After 4 months of repeatedly being told my credit rebate is coming , it never arrives . If Jawbone is THIS disorganized now , what will they be like if they can manufacture stock for demand and their device takes off ? ! I 'm disgusted with them now and am looking for another Brand to replace my UP altogether . <p> RE the UP even if I wake up before the alarm and turn it to the normal day mode , the alarm still goes off at or near the time I set it for , so maybe its not actually tied into sleep mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its an action you have to perform and could easily be forgotten . If that is the case , you can use the app on the phone to roughly put in when you went to and woke up from sleep . I 've never had to do that , but I assume it knows how to calculate what it may have interpreted as steps into sleep ! <p> This is really cool . I kinda like the jawbone up bracelet . The product reviews you used to do are really cool . keepem coming . Since we are on health stuff , I recommend doing 20 min of exercise per day . Really easy and does n't  have to be strenuous . Walking , swimming , etc . Just 20 min at the end of a work day daily . After a period of time , you will see the benefits <p> I have had the Jawbone Up for a few months now , and love it . I have actually been working on something simliar to your last paragraph with the unofficial UP API and some public APIs and manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , and seeing data about yourself is really interesting , especially when you start comparing it to everyday life and actions , and finding some correlation to the things you do . <p> Matt , in case you have n't heard , Jawbone just purchased Bodymedia which is a leader in the body sensor space . Along with the purchase , Jawbone also announced the release of a bi-directional API and launched an updated app that let 's you connect to Runkeeper , Withings , IFTTT and others . Your wish of being able to aggregate Jawbone data is coming to fruition . Take a look at @tictrac which I 've recently started using which is a great new aggregation dashboard which . I feel Jawbone has just catapulted themselves to the top of this market . <p> Thanks for the writeup . I am in love the extra sensors on the Basis but they were out of stock so I just went with an Up . They have allowed a few other apps to integrate with it and I used IFTTT recipes to prompt me via SMS to log my mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm up to with diet and exercise although I 'm still working on the habit of logging my meals . Let 's hope Jawbone let 's the API out of the bag for all developers sooner rather than later ! <p> I tried the UP but i couldnt stand it for more than 2 hours of typing and working with a keyboard/mouse . I ended up buying the Fitbit Ultra and i 'm super happy with it . Less intrusive to my lifestyle . Still , the data and sleep score/quality the Wakemate offered is unmatchable . I 'm considering buying the new Fitbit Flex now , <p> I love your site and am a huge fan of what you have done for the internet blogging community . Thank you for that . Having said that , the sad part is that the bands that you have reviewed are not available in our country Maybe soon . = <p> This reminds me of my Nike Sports Watch which I use for tracking my running and cycling activities . I love it when I 'm wearing it . Its terrific , lighter than most of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally all around better . But I cant pull the danged information off of it to do anything cool with it . The most I can do is reboot my MacBook into OSX and pull the basic data out into some graphs . There 's no option to grab the raw data and I have to use a piece of proprietary software which only works in OSX or Windows , neither OS of which I actually use . I randomly happen to have OSX on my machine as it came preinstalled and I cant get rid of it . <p> An open source setup would solve all my problems with the Nike Sports Watch . In fact I could probably use it to do a heck of a lot more than track my running and cycling if I had access to raw data as I could probably use it for generally tracking my daily activities if I were running it all day long . But the meagre data analysis available in the proprietary software assumed that you are using the device for a very specific task and so it is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Thanks to reasonable licensing , companies other than Sun/MySQL are able to enhance and fix the software and give their changes back to the world . <p> In terms of innovation , the most interesting developments have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I would not be surprised if this moment is for Drizzle what Movable Type changing their licensing was for WordPress , even though in this case they 're both Open Source . ) <p> I 've met a number of people at Sun who are incredibly smart , and if they stick around I expect cool things to continue to come out . <p> There are some new developments in the WordPress world , namely that I think it would be possible to add support for databases other than MySQL without changing every $wpdb call or breaking any plugins or themes . It wont be easy , but the coolest stuff seldom is . <p> has n't  Oracle owned the underlying MySQL drivers for a long time anyway ? I used to work for Oracle as an intern and am now back at University they are a great company to work for filled with friendly people , seriously . <p> When I first saw the news that Oracle was acquiring Sun Microsystems I was a little concerned for the future of MySQL , but then I remembered that its open source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that could happen for the MySQL community . I seriously doubt that Oracle will close-source future releases of MySQL server ( I 'm not even sure they could if they wanted to ) , but I 'm hoping they will add some of the features that make their Oracle DBMS so great . At least they hopefully put an end to the stagnation of in-house development since MySQL was acquired by Sun . <p> By trade , I am a PeopleSoft BA/developer during the day Oracles acquisition of that popular software suite has n't  diminished its popularity amongst the customers still using it . <p> Part of that had to do with Oracle announcing 10 years of support per release . That stemmed from the high number of companies that had already sunk millions into their investment . I 'd imagine there are a higher number of online ventures that have done the same with MySQL , and Oracle should n't have any interest in tarnishing any of these new customer relationships they just bought . <p> Hi Matt , thank you for an insightful post . Oracle also acquired Berkeley DB in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open source and used extensively by the likes of Google etc . I think Oracle do realize the value of open source much more than other companies making proprietary software so I think MySQL can only stand to benefit from this . <p> When I first saw the news that Oracle was acquiring Sun Microsystems I was a little concerned for the future of MySQL , but then I remembered that MySQL releases have been sucking wind since it was acquired by Sun anyway . <p> In the cases of Innobase and PeopleSoft , did Oracle have a competing product of their own ? It seems like MySQL is somewhat of a different case , because its potentially taken a lot of wind from the sails of Oracles flagship database products . <p> PeopleSofts competitors within Oracle were ( and are ) Oracle e-Business Suite and Oracle Fusion , the latter of which was the original serious competitor but has now simmered into more of a middleware product . <p> When Oracle acquired PeopleSoft , it was to corner that portion of the ERP market and compete with SAP . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current users ) along with it . <p> The smartest move for Oracle would be to keep MySQL the way it is and make it a snap for people to upgrade to Oracle . If Oracle plays their cards right , perhaps WordPress will be running on Oracle itself in a few years . ( Which might be an awesome upgrade for WordPress as well . ) <p> Right now its still wishful thinking , but it would also be the smartest thing for Oracle to do . <p> Speaking as a BA at a large Oracle shop , someday offering the option to run WP on Oracle would assist with its adoption . My companys IT team does n't  support anything they can not license for example , I am currently porting a LAMP app to . NET/SQL Server because of the need to have it done with supported toolsets . <p> Matt- Frankly , I was very surprised by the negative tweets yesterday from many in the tech field about the deal . While I agree that the cultures are different and that could cause a problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oracles part and had little to no concern about SQL issues . Very glad that you 've taken the time to calm the community . <p> I 'm actually glad to hear the news . All the time I spent into OpenSolaris and MySQL is n't for nothing . On the other hand , I 'm also worried about the feature of MySQL . Maybe its time to start switching to PostgreSQL ? <p> Although its pretty logical to state MySQL will be around .. it is open source after all good post , summing up some of the key points . Something interesting to reflect on is that had Microsoft bought MySQL there would have been a lot more mainstream fuss made .. = <p> " I would not be surprised if this moment is for Drizzle what Movable Type changing their licensing was for WordPress , even though in this case they 're both Open Source . ) " <p> You never miss a beat do you Matt ? = <p> Do you really think that this deal has the honest to god potential to be a watershed moment for Drizzle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ways has this change in ownership really changed anything about how the source is governed and distributed ? How conscious were people of the fact that MySQL was purchased by Sun in the first place ( outside of the Valley that is ) ? And if *that* change in ownership did n't  adversely affect MySQL users , why on earth would this one ? <p> WordPress supporting other dbs would be cool ! Always willing to help for it . <p> ps : maybe Oracle bought Sun because Sun bought MySQL enabling Sun to provide full packages of software ( app server/db and hardware ; 2 fisherman fishing in the same pool . Now its one big ship fishing in that pool .. easier to throw some things overboard and stack other stuff in the same container ? <p> Oracle has been acquiring underlying tech that is important to mySQL for a while now . The fact that that has n't  lead tobad things yet does n't  mean it wo n't in the future . Actually , arguably , the acquisition of Innodb did have a negative impact on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falcon ? ) which drew resources for defensive development that could have gone to advancing mySQL . <p> It seems to me that there is very little Oracle could that makes much difference for open source projects and web services built on open source that are happy using mySQL now . They could screw the codebase up , but that would just lend momentum to fork . <p> What they can do is slow mySQL down . They can divert their internal resources away from development and maintenence . They can make licensing for use in closed source products more expensive , which might drive away some 3rd party vendors and users , reducing the pool of potential competitors . The uncertainty they are already causing can cause new and existing open source projects to question their commitment and lea to them supporting something like Postgres instead of or in addition to mySQL . This ends up diluting the mySQL community . <p> It is hard not to imagine that this willbe good for Postgres ( even though I think there are still some Postgres devs on Suns payroll ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the Drizzles roadmap is more attractive than muSQLs . <p> This certainly gives Oracle more influence over a disruptor that is probably eating up into their DB business from the low end and it allows them to draw revenue from people who would n't otherwise be Oracle customers ( or not for long ) without seriously threatening pricepoints on Oracle " classic " <p> I think though that the acqusition is aS much about keeping Suns customer base out of the hands of anyone who has a real competitor to Oracles DB and enterprise apps . <p> What I do n't  quite get about Oracle and MySQL is just why Oracle wants/needs MySQL . I 'm not familiar with MySQL related financials however how does Oracle intend to make a financial profit from MySQL ? or does MySQL offer some strategic advantage ? Or , as you mention , EAS , is this a competitive strategy being employed by Oracle ? <p> This documentation is NOT distributed under a GPL license . Use of this documentation is subject to the following terms : You may create a printed copy of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly would be a good idea to separate out the DB access enough that people can easily add their own layer to handle the operations . Actually I would n't mind using a flat-file backend if possible . But the API for the DB queries still needs to be there . <p> As Oracle DBA I 'm not concerned at all . I know Oracle database even better then mysql . I can give you two more reasons for reassurance : 1 . Oracle Exadata : they now have the hardware too . Together with a very optimized Oracle software you get Oracle exadata 2 . As Oracle uses very much Java well they now have it . <p> And Java was the main reason to take over Sun . So do n't  worry about mysql . <p> Maybe a bit off-topic , but I 'd like to comment : I do n't  understand Franss comment about Oracle Exadata . I wonder how many people want to run WordPress on an Exadata environment . Its a bit over the Top I think and Oracles licenses would cause your bankruptcy . Oracle XE would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( non-commercial ) , tunable and understandable for every Oracle DBA ( like me ; - ) ) . However , developing WP ( or a plugin ) requires good knowledge of PL/SQL and datamodelling . Without that , do n't  even let it cross your mind . Like many other WP users , I suffer from lack of performance . The causes for that is mainly NOT MySQL , but poorly written sql and datamodels . For example , statpress is a great plugin , but the column-datatypes are to cry your eyes out . So , when you create a plugin , performance must not be underestimated . OK , enough whining . Great plugin . Just love it . Merry Christmas !

Yes a post could have a link and a video and a quote , but you just ask people not to do that . And what does fauxml have to do with anything ? <p> If you wanted to be fancy a theme could use its functions.php to add additional simple screens under " write " that are better for entering different types of content , that basically just help out formatting the post .

We can not use the Gmail spell checker in WordPress , since it is behind an auth wall , but this open API that the toolbar uses sounds interesting at first , but since the API is not supposed to be used by third-parties then any plugin will always just be a hack and with every little change google makes it will break all installs .

Downside is that dictionary files are large . <p> At the moment I am leaning towards D as the best solution . Though probably not the right solution . 
@@98356362 @2556362/ <h> RSS Bandwidth Usage <p> Robert Scoble looks at RSS bandwidth usage but unfortunately does n't  give real numbers . There are a couple of important points in looking at HTML vs . RSS bandwidth usage , some brought up in his comments but I 'll review here : <p> RSS is not a transport mechanism , and these problems should be handled on the HTTP level . This is faster , better tested , works with caches and proxies , et cetera . <p> I do n't  care if an aggregator checks my feed every 5 minutes , if they support HTTP properly ( last-modified headers ) the load is neglible for me and them . The bandwidth used each time is around 250 bytes . <p> Speaking of HTTP , gzip encoding works just as well for RSS feeds . <p> Bloated HTML in full content feeds will make for bloated feeds . We 've upped our standards , up yours . <p> Adjust your number of items to match your posting schedule . If you update two or three times a week , you do n't  need 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you update a lot like myself or Robert you run the opposite risk : people who do n't  check your feed for a while might actually miss content . I talked to aggregator developers a few months ago about a way to address this , perhaps we need to look at this again . <p> A visit to a homepage like this generates a lot of requests . First you get the HTML , then your browser requests the CSS files , then it gets all the images , probably about a dozen of them . RSS is generally a single request , and then images embedded in posts may be requested later if that entry is viewed . <p> That out of the way , how about some real numbers ? I can give the best stats for photomatt.net because my RSS feed is on a separate subdomain . Heres bandwidth usage for August : <p> photomatt.net HTML and images , et cetera <p> 56.0 GB <p> xml.photomatt.net RSS and other variants <p> 1.7 GB <p> The ratio for July was similar , 77.6/2.0 GB , I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front page is an average of 17K HTML and about 30K of images , so let 's say 50K . The images and CSS are all cached , but I do n't  output the proper headers on the HTML because it would be a pain . I would have to check the time of the latest post , check the latest updated link , make sure there 's not a random photo , basically go through a lot of trouble that is n't really worth it . ( When I was caching everything with Staticize the page was stored in its entirety so I sent correct headers , but I do n't  bother with that anymore because everything is so fast it does n't  really make a difference . ) All that said , I 'm happy with the level of optimization , my HTML and CSS is as streamlined as I want it to be . <p> My feed , on the other hand , is completely self-contained . I can send headers with confidence because I know everything in that file and can say authoritively when it was last changed . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about it . ) Most of the aggregators that hit my site support this . I do n't  think about it and they do n't  think about it , HTTP just works . My feed has 25 items because of my posting frequency , more than twice the number of items most feeds have . The feed is usually around 10K , and as I already mentioned its only one request . <p> here 's the kicker : my RSS feed is requested 3 times for every time my front page is loaded . So a HTML page with 1/3 the traffic is using over 30 times the bandwidth . What was that about scalability again ? <h> Related 14594 @qwx874594 <h> 21 thoughts on " RSS Bandwidth Usage " <p> I imagine that the big problem with the weblogs.asp.net feed ( which kicked off this whole discussion ) is that it was aggregating all of the posts by all of the MS bloggers . New posts were coming in at a rate of several an hour , so even with conditional GET support the feed /always/ had something new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing every time they polled ) . This ends up being compounded by the length of the items and the fact that the number of items in the feed needs to be high to make sure subscribers do n't  miss anything . <p> RSS may scale fine for feeds which are n't  being updated frequently , but its hard to make a case that a frequently updated , highly popular feed wont suffer from severe bandwidth problems . <p> Another thing : the real problem with the above example when it comes to bandwidth is that aggregators end up pulling the whole thing even if only one new item has been added . On esolution would be to dynamically generate the feed , only including entries that were posted since the Last-Modified header specified in the request . This would up the load on the server but would dramatically increase the size of many of the outgoing feeds , saving a big chunk of bandwidth . <p> While I agree somewhat that we need to get over the " if you try to grab my RSS more than once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " attitude that 's mostly carried over from before we knew enough to use conditional GET , I wonder : suppose bug #251842 gets fixed , and the bookmark/Livemark UI comes back in Firefox 1.1 , and a whole bunch of people with no exposure to RSS mores start using it , and since they 've got plenty of connection bandwidth and CPU , and no patience , they all set it to check every minute . How are you going to be faring for Apache connections , next time you get Slashdotted ? <p> Simon : every time the " dynamic feed based on Last-Modified " comes up , people who know what they are talking about with caches say you break cacheability doing that ( and suddenly find out that AOL and the like have been saving you several hundred or thousand hits an hour with their cache ) . <p> Its always appealed to me , too : there they are telling you what theyve seen , and you cant just give them the new stuff . <p> What does strike me as having potential is Russ Karchers idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 301 redirecting for stats you were talking about the other day . Make your public-facing feed URL excerpts only , with a sticky post saying " If your reader demonstrates that it plays well with the intarwebnet , this will turn into a full-content feed next time it refreshes . " No support for compression ? It never does . An If-Modified-Since that 's too recent , based on your caching headers and in-feed things like ttl or updateFrequency ? ( Being sure it is n't a cache checking freshness . ) No full content for you , two weeks ! <p> Last I checked ( right after Scobles post was published ) , all blogs on blogs.msdn.com returned a 200 OK status everytime they were requested . Talk about a joke . = <p> Also , most comments on Scobles post were about scalability of RSS with big feeds ( 1MB and up ) . Since were talking about big feeds , why are we surprised that they take so much bandwidth ? In the case of big feeds updated frequently , the solution seems to just reduce the update frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I bet I should patent that idea ! <p> Dave L , try the 2nd link on that lineits from the inimitable ( sp ? ! ) Joe Clark . ( Matt , that 's one of my favorite quotes too . ) <p> I tried making the bandwidth point re : RSS vs HTML et al to someone a while back , and I do n't  know if it sunk in. there 's definitely a perspective of " oh my god your program is auto-checking the file every $X ? ! that must be costing us bandwidth ! ! ! ! " <p> Dave L : I know Matt attributed the quote to Joe Clark , but I think Pat Paulsen may have said it as well . But of course , Joe Clark used it when talking about the kind of standards Matt was talking about . Though when Joe said it a while back , he attributed it simply to " Comedy Central " . Its still a great quote though . <p> Phil , Simon : If they were reallly sending 1MB+ feeds with constant updates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving that much bandwidth . In that case , I think that setting cache-control to private and serving Last-Modified time based diffs would probably save net bandwidth , at least for the aggregated feeds . <p> My front page is an average of 17K HTML and about 30K of images , so let 's say 50K . <p> I used this optimization tool which you referred to recently as well to bring my own blog frontpage down to about 40K . Typing in your main URL , http : //photomatt.com/ , gives a bit of a mixed result . Maybe you could still reduce your HTML bandwidth usage a bit . You are right to point out that images may be cached , but you might lose a few new readers . Not that you 're short of them , though . <p> I 'm maintaining a list of servers and clients that support RFC3229 delta encoding for RSS and/or Atom files .

There is a much larger precedent for putting the most recent items at top than just weblogs : most email and webmail software I 've used , every press release page , news sites like CNN , Zeldman , the Board of Governors , the White House . Breaking the convention of thousands of familar sites for the benefit of the occasional reader who checks back every week or so but is really annoyed at having to scroll funny to what theyve missed breaks the Hippocratic Oath of design .

Enjoy . <p> One benefit to a completely dynamic system is that you can change views on the fly pretty easily .

( If there 's any place for continuity in a weblogs archives , it would make the most sense in a categorical archive . ) Visiting a new weblog is more like walking into the middle of a conversation ; forcing someone to start again from the beginning ( for the benefit of the new guy ) is just a hindrance to the discussion . The great thing about non-linear text ( i.e. hypertext ) is that you can choose to go back in the conversation if you want to and review what you missed .

" <p> Actually , it can save bandwidth over time . For someone reading through the archives , downloading the month of March once ( with a single set of navigation links , footer , masthead , etc. ) requires less total bandwidth ( and server hits ) than clicking through the archives at one page per day ( eahc of which has all the extra stuff surrounding the post content ) . The flip side , of course , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to download a whole months archives . Figuring out which is more popular is , well , not easy . I suppose that an archiving system that allowed for both would be ideal , but creating it would probably take more time than I have at present . <p> " On the front page , which is where Eric has his main beef , the most relevant thing to at least 95% of visitors is going to be the latest items . " <p> Even if we substitute " important " for " relevant " ( because the most relevant thing is whatever will be of the most benefit to the user , no matter when it happened ) I do n't  agree . But if you 're serious that the most recent entry is that important , then I cant wait for you to fix your comment ordering so that the most recent comment is first , and the first comment made comes last . The most recent reaction to your post would be the most relevant , after all would n't it ? <p> " There is a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just weblogs : most email and webmail software I 've used " <p> And Usenet software . I hate top-posting ; I 'd meant to mention that in my post but forgot . I have a signature file that reads : <p> Yes . &gt;Are you sure ? &gt;&gt;Because it reverses the logical flow of conversation . &gt;&gt;&gt;Why is top-posting so annoying ? <p> I find the same true of reverse-order weblogs . <p> " Weblogs are n't ordered the way they are because of some freak historical accident , they 're ordered this way because it works . " <p> From where I sit , it does n't  work as well as would chronologically ordered posts , assuming a good UI can be found . ( And there 's the rub , at least for the moment . ) There are a lot of examples where something was widely adopted and everyone just went with it , later claiming it was superior because it " just works " table-and-spacer layout comes to mind right away . <p> " A sidenote about the bandwidth issue : it 's dead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need to stop the whole CSS thing and get back to promoting table-driven spacer-GIF layout , because frankly it works more consistently than CSS-driven layout across multiple browsers . A main reason I 'm still pushing for the use of CSS is that it saves bandwidth , and ( as you say ) makes the user experience better . Without it , things may be a little slower , but at least itll be more consistent for the users . <p> That probably sounds like a hyperbolic piece of rhetoric , but it is n't : I 'm serious . Bandwidth efficiencies are a big reason for using standards-oriented markup . If that concern is dead , then so is a big chunk of the rationale behind the standards push , and I do n't  have the time to devote to losing causes . As it happens , I do n't  agree with you , so I 'll keep soldiering on for now . Perhaps I 'm looking at the wrong facts here as well . <p> I happen to agree with both you and Eric and of course fall back on the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some weblogs may simply be short blurbs of thought or a few comments on a handful of links . For these , the subject and content of the posts usually do n't  depend on any other post . An anchored monthly archive page is fine as it allows you to quickly read many posts at once , and reverse chronological order also works because it gives you the most recent ( and topical ) content first . ( Imagine a blog started September 11 , 2001 but whose content covers anything in the news . Would prefer your first reading on this blog be of 9/11 commentary , or of commentary on the presidential race/mars rovers/superbowl controversy ? ) <p> Other blogs , with lengthy paragraphs of posts , may be more like journals . For these , understanding of each new post may rely on knowledge gained from previous posts . In this case , page-per-post archives work best because they allow you to read a whole post without being distracted from chronologically previous ( though not necessarily subject-related ) posts . <p> Perhaps what is needed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as what is needed for the short-post types of blogs ( newest posts on top order ) . Perhaps these need a layout where the most recent post is the only one shown on the home page , with short summaries and links to other subject-related posts below . This way , new visitors to the site can get an idea of the writting/subject of the site , and if they want to read more , they can quickly find the start of the " story " . <p> While well written , I somehow get the impressions that Eric has issues . What gets me is the bandwidth arguement . It just does n't  fly with me . If he is worried about bandwidth , then you DO want the newset entries at the top where they are easy to find . Other wise , one would have to wait for the " old " content to load , then click a link ( presumably ) and wait for the new content to be sent . Twice now , the user used bandwidth that could have been saved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secondly , the arguement regarding cross linked posts . In my personal opinion , that 's a lazy blog writter . Usually , when I post something that is related to another post of mine , I will include the link . It save the reader the hassle of trying to find it , and saves on the bandwidth as well . I have to admit , I do n't  always get it right , but I do my best . I also agree with your point about the bandwidth issue being dead . With all the AOL Optimizers and NetZero Accelerator and DSL/Cable modems out there , the only time its an issue is at the webhost . If you are getting that much traffic , well , either the page itself needs to be optimized , or you need to spring for that extra capability . If only I had that problem . But , for the 90% of the bloggers out there , I do n't  think its an issue . <p> Another precident to the newer first , older last convention is the use of forums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where new posts are listed first over older posts . Does that mean they too are broken ? No , its a feature . In fact , I 'd be lost in most forums with out it . <p> I 'm not sure just what set off Eric , or what he s smoking , but I think things are fine . <p> Sorry for the double comments , I had moderation turned on without meaning to . Of course since the first and second comments are n't  identical , I 'm not sure whether to drop the first one , which presumably was less edited or thesecond one to preserve temporal integrity . Or reorder the comments with the newest on top . = <p> Stephen , you 're too cool . Interesting approach altering the array and not the query . That actually works better with postspaged enabled . <p> Joe , I think even for weblogs that focus on longer entries , like this one , reading things strictly chronologically does n't  give you a lot of benefit . When a weblog entry speficially relates to a previous one , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to link to the new one . If I blog about Lockergnome , post a bunch of silly jokes , and blog Lockergnome again , reading chronologically is n't going to help you follow the thread much better . I 'm about to post again about Dvorak , which I have n't written about in months , should you have to read through those months of archives to follow the thread ? I do n't  think so . <p> Eric , monthly archives are good for catching up , though honestly when I get that far behind I just let it go . Ideally you should have several different representations of your posts ( by month , by category , etc ) and I think that 's one of the defening characteristics of a good weblog . It is impossible to know whether someone is on your archive page for a single post or for the whole month the way you have it set up because people do n't  have an option either way . If you offered both you could look at the stats to see which people use more . For me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although in the situation you set up a monthly archive would save bandwidth , I would say that 's the exception to the rule . Surges in traffic usually come from Slashdot or Instapundit or Zeldman sending a couple of thousand new friends your way to check out an entry the found worth linking . This is very common and I think that is the source of most bandwidth anomalies , and its percisely the type of situation that overwhelmingly favors individual entry permalinks . <p> " I ca n't wait for you to fix your comment ordering so that the most recent comment is first , and the first comment made comes last . " <p> I know of sites that do this , and it would be useful if every comment was a reply to the post itself , and there was no other metric for ordering the comments ( like quality ) . However as this very comment illustrates , mine tend to be more conversations , and putting them in reverse order would be like top-posting . <p> " I hate top-posting ; I 'd meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As do I , to an extent . However I was n't referring to the conversation within the email itself , but rather many email/webmail programs organize the inbox with the newest items on top by default . This is true of every webmail I 've used , but not so much for desktop clients . My other examples are stronger . <p> " If the bandwidth issue really is dead , then I need to stop the whole CSS thing " <p> You know were in complete agreement here . Page should be as small as possible for every user , but on the aggregate the bandwidth savings is n't a user issue but a publisher issue . Bandwidth savings on the aggregate can present an easily-quantifiable business argument for smaller pages , and I 'm sure that has convinced many of your clients , but I still think the biggest benefit ( though not an easily quantifiable one ) is to the users for whom the page responds faster . Also were talking issues of scale . If AOL or ESPN comes to you , they talk in scale of millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes on their sites . That aside paragraph was more directed at the people I know who end up writing checks of $50100 to their hosting company just because they had a few popular posts . Hosting is a commodity , and they should shop around . The large companies should still hire you , and I have every confidence that the " CSS thing " will continue to work pretty well for you in the future . = <p> " On the front page , which is where Eric has his main beef , the most relevant thing to at least 95% of visitors is going to be the latest items . Anything else is going to be making the site less useful to the majority of users for the benefit of a few . " ( emphansis mine ) <p> First of all , Matt , if you 're going to link to previous and following posts , why not add tags describing these relations to the header aswell ? Enables me to use my link toolbar : ) . <p> Second , I agree that reverse chronological order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Erics different ordering for his frontpage and his archives are confusing ) . As has been said before , and something which I very much agree with , not all posts are about the same topic , so forcibly having to read them while they have nothing to do with the actual entry you 're interested in does n't  make sense to me . Reading previous posts on a certain topic can in some cases surely be interesting , and for that a well-placed link can point your readers to it . However there are also a lot of cases ( especially for incidental visitors ) when you do n't  want to do a 2-hour reading job of previous related posts before you can get to the actual message of your interest ( which you for example read about on say , slashdot ) . <p> There is no universal truth about chronological vs. reverse-chronological order , it depends on the context . Blogs are not a forum , nor a newsgroup , nor blog comments for that matter , which contain a list of replies on one topic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its just not do-able to read the last replies without the context of the previous , so yes , you should never use reverse chronological order . However , you probably know those 10-page topics which you are interested in , and which take hours to read through before you caught up Though interesting , otherwise you would n't be reading it at all , its a bit of a waste of your time . So you are presented with a choice , am I going to read all of it , which is quite excessive in comparison to my interest in the topic , or will I just not read it at all , even though I am interested in it ? <p> Fortunately , weblogs are not written like forum posts ( meyerweb.com included ) . They are usually written like seperate entries , with hyperlinks in them to refer to previous context . what I ( and I guess everyone else ) do if I read this sentence " While I knew I was staking out a position that was likely to cause some controversy , I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weirdness. " is that when I do n't  know what this is referring to exactly , I immediately click on that link to catch up with the context ( well , maybe giving it a quick scan first ) . <p> I think this is a good way of writing weblogs , a blog entry should be like an individual text , which refers to the older entries . This is also how most scientific documents are written , because they *are* usually presented as individual texts , published in different magazines , different issues of magazines , or different books . Out of nessecity , one might say , but I do n't  think its a bad thing , its just a different style of writing , and a nice one if you ask me . And fortunately this is the internet , we are blessed with hyperlinks , so all this becomes a lot easier . <p> Maybe something that Erics entry could be improved on a little is to include a small introductionary text for the new readers , who do n't  know the context of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this weblog entry by Matt is the sentence " His thesis is that it 's easy to read chronological items that relate to each other from top to bottom on a page . " That immediately brings your readers up to speed with what its all about , and if someone wants to know more details about what Eric said , he or she can follow the link . A similar sentence could also be written when referring to one of your own web log entries . <p> The same goes for the top posting vs. the bottom posting issue by the way . In my opinion , it is not true that top-posting is always wrong . Your signature is a wonderful and very funny example of where this is the case ( I 'll remember it so I can quote it sometimes : ) ) . But when a reply is written like a letter , in prose , maybe even having a small introduction and conclusion and all I do not see any reason to bottom-post ! And as it happens I know several people who reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the situation calls for it I myself sometimes do it aswell . Its a very interesting way of writing emails , not the point by point replies you 're used to but a whole new story each mail . Ofcourse , in that case quoting really would n't be nessecary at all , and on newsgroups you can always read up the thread , but I guess that in case you 're interested having some context of the previous discussion at the bottom of the post could come in handy ( especially on a mailing list where people might join in on the list any time ) . <p> My email client sorts chronologically , and moves to my last read message somewhere at the bottom of the list . This is a preferrence which can be set in basically every email client , and also in most webmail accounts , so apparantly many people have a different preferrence . However , this really does n't  matter . I read all messages which just came in and are marked as unread , and I read the one with the oldest date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferrence but if it was the other way around , it would n't alter the order in which I read them , nor would it make it any more difficult to do . <p> One final example This big comment basically draws only on Erics and Matts blog entries Would it really be nessecary to have this chronologically ordered ? If you ask me , it would be easier if I just linked ( Erics , Matts ) to them . Because reading all these other chronologically-ordered comments really is n't nessecary . <p> Conclusion : when writing hyperlinked texts , the ordering does not matter for the content itself ( as long as it is applied with some consistency ) . Ordering is meant to give users easier access to the content . As I said , my email client sorts chronological , but moves the focus down to the bottom of the list , so that I have easy access to my latest emails . As moving focus down the list is somewhat hard to achieve in web browsers ( and when done through javascript may be found annoying ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember what the user read last , reverse-chronological ordering makes sense . Another option such as Eric discussed in his latest weblog entry , as long as the end result is user friendly , is just another option . <p> Matt- You can display posts in chronological order even easier in . htaccess . Just add " &amp;order=asc " at the end of the relevant rewrite rules . That way its invisible to users and does n't  make your URIs longer . I 'm sure you knew that , but I thought I 'd post it for people like me who got here via google looking for a solution to the sorting issue . 
@@98356367 @2556367/ <p> Cool ! ( Half the reason I 'm posting this is to see what pattern I get ) I 'm always looking for enhancements for our blog , perhaps I 'll add this . None of my commenters have gravatars yet , so I do n't  show avatars at the moment at all . <p> Hmm , never mind . I just realised that the Identicon changes patterns according to the email address provided and is consistent to the email address , allowing for a generated unique and consistently identifiable gravatar for users who do n't  have their own . I suppose that might be useful . I prefer using a default to force a stigma of banality on users who do n't  have a proper gravatar. &gt;&gt; <p> These identicons are n't  just useful for blogs either , they have uses for lots of other things too . I 'm making use of them on a new forum which I have under construction at the moment Pixo Point forum <p> Thank you very much for pointing this feature out Matt . I had never even thought of this concept before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people was to leave a bland default image for them all . <p> Mare if the commenter does n't  like the image , they can just upload their own gravatar . <p> Charles gravatars are the little images beside everyones comments here on Matts blog . Identicons/wavatars are the little geometric shapes which are displayed when someone has n't  associated an image with their email address at gravatar.com . <p> Bryan Perhaps it would be possible to display an identicon and underneath that , have a small linked text saying " No gravatar " ? That way you could have the benefit of the identicon , but with the handy tip for your commenters on how to get one I suspect that many simply do n't  know what gravatar is ( yet ) . I 'm not sure how you would detect in advance if an email address was gravatar enabled or not though , but if it is possible , then I think that would be a good idea . Matt , do you know if this is possible ? <p> The purpose of identicons is to expose people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses . Theyve really reduced the crap at our blog . However , they put a load on the server , despite the fact that they are cached . We cant figure it out , but on days we activate the plug-in , our server craps out during the noonday rush . <p> Ryan , the Identicon is derived from the IP address , so spammers run out of those pretty quick ( home , work , etc . ) . Dial-up and the like will somewhat defeat this , but in general , same Identicon , same person , same person , one Identicon . <p> Between sites this does n't  work , because you can set the way the Identicon is generated ( number of squares , colors , etc . ) . <p> The built-in Gravitar service is only used for Gravitars , not Identicons . I think we can take Matts infatuation with Identicons as a sign that they will be integrated into WordPress in the future , but for now you need the Identicon plug-in , which has had Gravitar support for quite a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The identicons are built into Gravatar , there is no need for a plugin to use them . They work with a default WordPress install and they 're generated from the email address , not the IP address . You encrypt the email address before sending it to gravatar which sends back the associated image . In the case of identicons , it sends back an image based on the email address . SInce the IP address is never sent , there is no way the image could be based on that . <p> There are instructions on how to do this on the Gravatar site . Matt probably has some links to it above too ( I have n't checked ) . <p> My new support forum which uses these is now live . They seem to be working quite well . I was expecting some questions from users by now about why on earth they have a crazy looking little monster beside their posts , but as yet no one has questioned it . <p> It has been a handy way to add an easy method of identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one off posts in my forum and I doubt anyone would bother to enter an avatar for a single post , so having the gravatars for some and little monsters for everyone else has been quite helpful . It adds a nice personalisation to each persons posts and aids in remembering them when they post on another part of the forum . <p> Do any of you know of any other examples of these being used on a forum ? I have n't found any but am assuming I 'm not the first .

It changes the host name to 127.0.0.1 . Isnt that the IP address one uses to ping himself ? <p> Dreamweaver does n't  contact the remote site , it contacts plink , locally . The same address to ping yourself , yes . I cant get it to work either : plink connects and then the prompt gets all messed up . I 'm still in the right directory though , but when I try to connect with DW , it times out . I 've SEEN it work on someone elses computer , and they had the same settings I did . Weird . <p> PROBLEM SOLVED . Some servers just do n't  work with PuTTY or SSH ( the program , not the protocol ) , at least not remotely or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servers have different versions of the SSH software running , and that may have something to do with it , but the solution I found that works on every single server I try is MindTerm , a stand-alone java applet . You connect with it , then set Dreamweaver to contact " localhost " , rather than the server address . Then go BACK to mindterm and select " plugins &gt; FTP to SFTP BRIDGE " and turn it on . Then go BACK to dreamweaver and connect . Bam , you 're there . Just make sure the remote server home directory info you have in dreamweaver is correct . It may sound complicated but its really fast . From then on , when you want to connect just select the correct server from MindTerms memory and connect , select the bridge , then connect with dreamweaver . Go here : http : **29;1273;TOOLONG and good luck ! <p> The instructions on Macromedias site that detail PuTTy only encrypt the LOGIN not the transfer itself .

My campus set up the server so that there is not a directory for my username ( /home/username ) so every time I connect it kicks me off immediately , saying that the directory does not exist . Does anyone know how to get around this ( perhaps by setting a default initial directory ) ? <p> The mindterm solution described above works well . When you set Dreamweaver to use localhost for the remote host , make sure to specify the port that you used with the mindterm bridge , e.g. , localhost:21 . <p> Problem solved ! yes it was when I followed Daves advice in downloading and istalling mindterm . I spent hours with that frustrating documentation from Macromedia. it took about 30 minutes to download and install Mindterm and it worked . As Dave said besure to have the remote directory set correctly and point Dreamweaver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to , for some reason , be more complicated than anyones standard docs , I 'd like to mention that neither the MindTerm nor PuTTYs were working for me .

DWMX2004 and beyond ( and EditPlus v2.2+ ) have an " sFTP " checkbox which did n't  work for me either . <p> SOLUTION : Server config ! sFTP worked fine for me on a redhat 9 ( openSSH 3.5 ) box but not on my SuSE 9 ( openSSH 3.8 ) machines . Changing the sshd config file ( /etc/ssh/sshdconfig ) by commenting out " PasswordAuthentication = no " I am able to still securely use SSH and now sFTP thru SSH with no problem . <p> OMG ! !

I almost always travel with hand luggage only and most people I know think I 'm crazy but really , you just do n't  need that much kit with you . Its very freeing . <p> Serendipitously apropos post for me . We just bought one way tickets this week to Europe . My wife and I depart in October for 12 months abroad . Never knew how philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying the process of evaluating what is " really " important to carry . BTW : Thanks for WP it changed our lives . <p> My wife and I have been traveling around the world continuously for 3.5 years ( and doing some work along the way ) . I wish I could say that our bags have shrunk over time , but they have n't . I find that the more complex the destination ( in terms of connectivity , security and ability to replace equipment ) , the more compelled we are to pack more stuff . <p> My wife and I live on a sailboat ( 14 years now ! ) , so minimalism is essential with almost everything we do . When we land-travel it is always with a single , simple pack each . Unfortunately , when we visit family we always end up transporting boat parts back with us ; never a simple exercise . WP has changed the whole way the family communicates with each other . <p> Interesting , I see a conection between this post and the other recent one where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  travel half as much as you do , its the opposite with me . Maybe its because I 'm a woman , too and we " need " to carrry more stuff and clothes and everything than man usually do . I was always worried about not carrying too many things when travelling , making the job of packing a real torment , but now , I decided that as long as I 'm not carrying my luggage on my back all the way down my destination , I 'll carry everything I can , if I do n't  use it , its ok , at least I wont regret not bringing that important thing I left behind . = <p> *grin* I know what you mean . I travel almost none at all yet when I do I 've learned to have just what fits in a small pack . I learned this as a child . There were seven of us plus grand parents and parents . We each were responsible for all of our own stuff plus something else . It made you learn to pack lite . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tiny cottage , with my wife and kids . We have very little stuff . A few computers , books , not a whole lot more . Keeps it simple . <p> Your post reminds me of what life was like when I traveled the comic book convention circuit , all my table gear and books in a large locker , delicate items wrapped in clothing , my necessities in a messenger bag across my side . I used the bus usually to get from one town to another . I was very careful about acquiring things . Everything had to fit perfectly with everything else . I feel I was more productive and less consumptive in those years . <p> Because in a previous life ( age 17-23 ) , before I was a web designer , I was an award-winning comic creator , making webcomics for teenage girls at gURL.com . I went to conventions to sell self-published paper editions , meet my fans , and promote my work . It was a lovely life experience . <p> I love the scene from " Up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast efficiency . <p> Ive been using the Eagle Creek Twist for a year now . Its a roller bag , which saves me from lugging a backpack around everywhere , but also has ( high quality ) backpack straps so if I 'm on walking through city streets or somewhere a roller bag would be cumbersome I can whip out the straps and use as a regular backpack . It does n't  look near as dorky as it sounds = <p> So long as I do n't  overpack it fits perfectly in overheads , fits a decent amount of clothes , laptop , books and extras perfectly . <p> For my " murse " I have a small bag from Manhattan Portage which has some unique designs and easy to carry around . <p> I 've used those two combined for weekend to three week trips , and keep it packed with shirts , socks and my cosmetics so its ready to go for a road trip or last minute flight .

@@98356410 @2556410/ <h> Kindle Statistics <p> Dear Kindle Team , one of my favorite features of Google Reader has always been its " Trends " or more simply its statistics that give you insight into your reading patterns and volume . <p> As the Kindle has become a bigger and bigger part of my life , much of my reading time has shifted from RSS-based sources to content on my Kindle , but I 'm really curious how much time , how many words , at what times of day , etc I 'm consuming all this new content . I think providing stats would also encourage people to read more , and highlight to them how the Kindle has changed their habits . <h> 32 thoughts on " Kindle Statistics " <p> Good idea . But please tell me , why do these folks not ship their Kindle to Cambodia ? Why this white Western chauvinism in place , that makes that about 50 American multinationals do not ship products to any non-US destination , among them Microsoft and Amazon , to name only these two ? I cant buy any books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items , nor can I enjoy any MP3 Downloads , despite the fact that I have a company in USA . The mere fact of my browser saying I am in Cambodia puts me off the board . I call this Internet fascism . <p> I understand where this guy is coming from , because just the other day I tried to get a book for my students from a website which was free and worked fine when I was in the US , but when I went to it here it said I was n't allowed to use the site from this country ( Mexico ) . So I can understand Pierres irritation , especially because I was being deprived of educational materials that I wanted for my class . <p> However , I also think you are right , Matt , about the licensing and copyright issues . All these different countries do n't  necessarily overlap in their laws and that really gets in the way of materials being shared internationally . <p> Matt , I thought so as well . I am a retired lawyer . I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quoting a listing of all companies that are following this policy . He did n't  reply . I 've had several times an issue with paying for software to American companies as Cambodia was not listed among the countries , well was Cameroun <p> Okay , joke aside , speculations do not help us . Fact is that the USA is such a strong market that for most companies the hassle to go international is not worth it , I suppose , because the American market alone gives them more than 90% of their revenues , with relatively little investment compared to the huge expenses , namely for settling all those licensing issues . This costs a lot of money , given the values of trademarks , and the like . So , I think this is the unspoken reason why there is not really an effort done in that direction . The lesson is to help building a real global economy ; even Europe has n't  so far reached the American standard of a REALLY homogeneous market structure . <p> It really bothers me that people are using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a radical and authoritarian nationalist political ideology " is ridiculous , to put it lightly . Read up on fascism on Wikipedia at least , before you start spouting off . <p> Obviously this is very late to the game here , but they are now shipping to Cambodia .

I also wonder if there is any basis in fact to this . <p> I see the Kindle as an adjunct to books . Its a great gadget to have when traveling . I do n't  know how many other ways it might be used . But for those of us who love books , no gadget will ever replace a real book . <p> I am writing a huge analytical essay right now on the very subject of printed books versus electronical sources , like the Kindle .

I think I could organize drop shipping and re-shipping from US and Europe . <p> First , a response to Pierres query : its doubtful your question could be answered here . My stab in the dark would be restrictions on commerce , shipping , fulfillment any number of possibilities , but I 'd check with the parties in question directly . Have you ? A cursory look at Amazon UK shows they do ship to Cambodia .

( yes , I 've shipped oversees and YES , my client was " missing " their product because it made a " pit stop " with the local postal office . ) <p> To Matts post , I was soooo looking for stats here , but instead , all you 've done is move the Kindle to my wishlist , and I thank you for it . <p> To be more precise , all amazon stores do ship their regular products here , but not the Sellers , as you rightly suspected , with some exceptions however , who do . What I do n't  understand is that they do n't  ship stationary here , for example such useful things as CD and DVD jewel cases . There are no double DVD jewel cases to be found here which is why I wanted to order them . No way .

One of the arguments against the early idea of e-books was that those devices emit some form of light and that that was disturbing the retina . I was myself a fan of e-books from the start and published all my stuff myself but got to hear from friends that its troublesome to read a book on a computer or handheld , that it was more relaxing to have the lightsource outside of the book . So is there any real advancement in Kindle technology that makes its not giving strain to the eyes as a computer screen does ? Thanks in advance . Pierre <p> I bought a Kindle on Amazon and had them ship it to Cambodia when it was $259 . I also had a case shipped that was $30 . I only had them ship it because they use DHL to ship to PP and I figured if DHL was shipping it would at least get here and I knew I 'd pay a hefty " customs duty " and was prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was held up in customs and I needed to pay $50USD . I tried talking them down to no avail and paid the $50USD . <p> The screen uses something they call e-ink technology and it is almost just like reading on paper . It is not a back lit screen . Think of an etch a sketch screen . It is easy to read in broad daylight even sitting on the beach and there is no glare at all as it has a matte screen . It is not backlit so if you want to read it on a bus at night you will need an external light just like reading a normal book . <p> Dear Aaron , Thanks so much , dear friend . This is exactly the information I was asking and waiting for , and nobody else wanted to give it to me . Some people are unable to put words on things . I have an American friend who had a Kindle and was unable to even understand what I meant . This means , when I evaluate what you say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the Apple iPad technology is basically an LCD backlit kind of thing that puts you off when you 're sleepy and want to read a few pages in bed . Fortunately , in the meantime Amazon ships Kindle devices to Cambodia and also the network is working here for downloading the books . If you are in Phnom Penh , like me , and youd like to have a beer with me , let us meet . <p> The Kindle is no doubt superior to the iPad if you 're sole reason for purchasing it is to read a lot of books . That was my sole purpose in buying it . <p> For people who just read the odd magazine or newspaper ( like Phnom Penh Post ) and a few pages of a book every once in a while they might prefer the iPad as it is more versatile with all its internet capabilities , backlit color screen and watching videos , storing photos etc . I have a laptop to do all the other things that an iPad will do . <p> Magazines with color photos or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display better on an iPad or the free Kindle software you can install on a laptop or iPad . The Kindle , in my opinion , is not great for reading newspapers or magazines that have a lot of graphics . For instance if you read Time magazine you get the text only . But text based magazines like the economist are displayed nicely on the Kindle . Graphics and newspapers might be better on the larger Kindle DX , but I did n't  want something that large . <p> The Kindle is a book reader whose sole function is to read books . The iPad is a multipurpose device which is basically a scaled down laptop with a touch screen rather than a keyboard . <p> I was initially unimpressed with the Kindle . When I took it out of the box the screen seemed very small and I did n't  like the design . That lasted about a day until I used it a lot . The screen is actually very functional and I read faster on the Kindle and read more books as well . The built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to highlight text , keep bookmarks etc . If you 're in Cambodia you 'll need to download the books to a laptop first and then transfer them to the Kindle or they charge International delivery charges . Magazines will need to be downloaded manually as well , but its very easy . <p> The other things is I 've read all the photocopied books that I want to read in Phnom Penh . If I were a billionaire and stayed in Phnom Penh all the time I 'd just buy all my books at monument bookstore . But instead I trade with the devil and buy a lot of books for the Kindle instead . Monument is a little pricey and most of the books I 'm reading are not stocked there either . <p> There are still an aweful lot of titles not available from Amazon so its not as if it will do away with all printed books at the moment . <p> I have used my Cambodia ANZ visa card to purchase the Kindle and all my Kindle books . I have also had Amazon ship real books directly to Bangkok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought the shipping was reasonable . <p> This comment thread has been extremely helpful to me and I really appreciate the time and thought that have gone into the replies here . <p> As a joint birthday &amp; Christmas present , my parents have just ordered a Kindle ( along with case with the reading light ) for me from Amazon US . It will be delivered to Cambodia , hopefully , within the next two weeks . I am assuming I 'll get hit with some customs charges , but I 'm quite happy to deal with that . <p> Shipping was G24 or so . <p> Between this thread and other things I have read I 'm actually extremely excited about this present and am really looking forward to reading more often and having a bit more choice of books than is available here in Cambodia . I think I will be finished the Hakuri Nakamura book ( physical ) I 'm currently reading by the time it arrives . <p> Hurrah for early Christmas presents ( helped by my birthday being at the start of December ) . <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your replies and concerns , all my problems with shipment of electronic items are solved , after I contacted the amazon customer servicer and explained my situation . All this stuff is checked out and shipped to my friend in San Francisco who ships me the stuff here . Of course , its my problem to deal with the heavy 36% import tax here , but that 's okay . Sometimes a bottle of wine can do wonders here with government and police , so I do n't  worry , but I get my wonderful amazon.com stuff here now . And the amazon staff has not expressed any disapproval of my strategy , so my initial negative comments are to be traced out or invalid . Amazon is one of the greatest companies on earth , I publish all my books and media with them now , here is my Amazon Author LONG ... <p> Kind regards to all of you and of course to Matt .
