In the early days , it was easy to know all of the features well and keep up with the regular updates . Now , it has grown so much that it is becoming difficult to keep up and be knowledgeable about all aspects of the solution . <p> Depending on how you work with Salesforce.com , it can make sense to specialize in a particular area . In order to recognize and evaluate knowledge in the different aspects of the solution , specific certifications have been created . <h> Why Should I Take the Certification Exams ? <p> The Salesforce.com certification is a way to show that you have the understanding in specific areas of salesforce . Salesforce covers so much functionality , certification can help to organize your learning efforts , that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide that lists the topics that will be covered , so it gives you an objective and target for your study . <p> Salesforce offers a number of different certifications focussing on different areas of the solution . The certifications are put together by salesforce . The exam format varies by certification : <p> Salesforce certification is useful if you are looking for a Salesforce role , either as : <p> With a Salesforce customer With a Salesforce partner <p> Increasingly , employers either customers or partners will expect that you will have some level of certification when applying for a role . For example , you would need to have the Certified Administrator Certification if you are applying for a Salesforce administrator role and you would need the Platform Developer II Certification if applying to be a developer that writes code . <p> Salesforce.com currently offers the following levels of certification : <p> Certification <p> Format <p> Cost <p> Certified Administrator <p> 60 multiple choice questions <p> USD$200 <p> Certified Advanced Administrator <p> 60 multiple choice questions <p> USD$200 <p> Certified Sales Cloud Consultant <p> 60 multiple choice questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice questions <p> USD$200 <p> Certified Force.com Platform App Builder <p> 60 multiple choice questions <p> USD$200 <p> Certified Force.com Platform Developer I <p> 60 multiple choice questions <p> USD$200 <p> Certified Force.com Platform Developer II <p> 60 multiple choice questions <p> Programming Assignment <p> Essay Exam <p> USD$400 <p> Certified Technical Architect <p> Self Evaluation <p> Multiple Choice Questions <p> Review Board Presentation <p> USD$500 Multiple choice exam <p> USD$6000 Review Board Presentation <p> Note : This is the format and cost as of October 2015 . Check the individual study guides from the Saleforce.com website for the most up to date information . <p> In September 2015 , Salesforce changed the developer certifications . Prior to this , there was the Developer 401 certification and the Advanced Developer certification . The Developer 401 certification was a multiple choice exam and the advanced developer included multiple choice and a programming assignment . Even though it was named Developer Certification it did n't  require any skills that you would normally associate with a developer such as programming and coding in Visualforce and APEX . This caused some confusion , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had the developer certification , as many APEX and Visualforce developers only had the Developer certification and not Advanced Developer . <p> So Salesforce has changed the Developer 401 certification into a new certification Platform App Builder . This covers much of the old developer certification but adds some of the newer capabilities of process builder , visual workflow , lightning and mobile . It also adds a section around App Deployment , to cover off how an app deployment and lifecycle is managed in an enterprise environment . This requires understanding of a typical app lifecycle , deployments between environments , change-sets and the use of managed and unmanaged packages . <p> Two new certifications have replaced the Advanced Developer certification . The first one is the Platform Developer I , which consists of a multiple choice exam and then Platform Developer II , which is similar to the old Advanced Developer in that it includes a multiple choice exam and a programming assignment . <p> These are the prerequisites for the various certifications . <p> The Administrator Certification is the base level and is a prerequisite for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even though it is n't mentioned as required for developer and technical architect , it is fundamental knowledge that everyone should have that works with Salesforce . <p> The Sales and Service cloud certificates are part of the functional track and contain questions on Sales and Service functionality within the product . <p> The name of the Certified Force.com developer could have been misleading , as it could be taken to mean development with code . If you have a developer certification from other platforms or languages , you would assume it involves programming . However , the foce.com developer certification is all about being able to develop a force.com application with clicks , not code . It does require the knowledge of when code is necessary , but you do n't  need to know how to code yourself . <h> How to Study <p> Salesforce provides a study guide for each exam and some guidelines on what material to be familiar with . The study guide is very useful as it lists the topics that you should know and it also tells you the weighting of the topic , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know all of the topics in the study guide well . Salesforce covers so much functionality , it is likely that even if you have worked with Salesforce for some time , you have n't used some of the features that are covered in the exam . In that case , get familiar with the facts , but also try to use the functionality yourself in a trial or test org . <h> How to Take the Certification Exam ? <p> Salesforce uses the Webassessor online testing platform to administer the exams . On the Salesforce certification page , there is a small register link that will take you to the Webassessor login page . If you do n't  already have a Webassessor account you will need to create one . Once you have created your login , you will get an email confirming the account has been created . <p> Once logged into your Webassessor account , you will be able to register for one of the certification exams . <p> When you register , you will need to choose a testing centre to take the test and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One point to note is that if you need to reschedule , you have to give 72 hours notice , otherwise a reschedule fee is charged . So you need to decide 3 days before the scheduled date if you think you are ready , and if not reschedule ! <p> Once you have registered and paid , you will receive an email with the payment receipt and also confirming the date and time that test is scheduled . You need to arrive 15 minutes prior to the scheduled start date , and bring two forms of identification . The email also contains a test take code which you will need to supply . Either print the email or show the code to the test administrator on your phone . <p> Once you are done with the test , you will get the result straight away . You can then breathe a sigh of relief that you passed and are now a Salesforce certified consultant or think about the areas you were not sure on if you did n't  , so you can focus on studying those for your next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your result : <p> Webassessor also keeps track of the results of all of the exams you have taken . <h> How Employers can Verify your Certifications <p> By passing the certification exams , you will be able to represent yourself as a salesforce certified consultant . Salesforce has introduced a way to verify certification credentials online at this LONG ... By entering a full name or email address employers will be able to verify with Salesforce directly which qualifications someone has . The tool will display a listing of the certifications and the dates that were passed , such as this one :

When using DataLoader or another integration tool to update data , the external i 'd can be used instead of the Salesforce i 'd to uniquely identify records . <p> External Ids can also be used when you need to load data into an object that has lookups , and the objects that the looksups are associated with have external ids defined .

The object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Transaction Date . Account and Product are lookups to their respective objects . <p> The Account object has an external i 'd defined Account Code . <p> The Product object also has an external i 'd defined , Product Code . <p> We have an account record with an Account Code defined : <p> And also a product record with an External Product Code : <p> Now we want to load data using a CSV file into the transaction object , and use the external ids for the Account and Product . The csv file looks like this : <p> Now we can use DataLoader to load the data . The first step is to make sure you choose UPSERT and not INSERT . This will make sure that you will get the option to specify the external i 'd fields . <p> Now at step 2a , you can choose the external ids for the objects : <p> Then when you get to the mapping step , map the external i 'd fields to the relationship fields . <p> And finally , our record is loaded with the lookup fields of account and product populated correctly . 
@@106251672 @1651672/ <h> Macros in Salesforce <h> Macros in Salesforce <p> Have you ever had to perform the same action on multiple records in Salesforce ? Wished there was a better way to save time ? You may have thought about the possibilities in Microsoft Word or Excel to use macros to perform repetitive actions and wished there was something similar in Salesforce . Well there is ! There is a macro capability and from the Spring 16 release , it is available for all standard and custom feed based objects . A macro can include actions like sending email , updating status , selecting templates and creating tasks . In a single click multiple actions can be performed on single or multiple records . Single clicks not only save time but also help achieving a consistent process . Time is money for support agents who handle multiple activities at a time . <p> Macros are more or less like a set of computer instructions which provide you functionality like sending email , updating field , creating tasks , etc. with a single click . Macros work with the feed based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed needs to be enabled for that specific object . Earlier macros were only supported on feed based layouts for Account , Contact , Lead , and Case objects . With the Spring 16 release it has been made available for all standard and custom feed based objects . One point to watch out for , macros are currently only available in Salesforce Classic . <p> So let 's save some time and clicks and see how to setup Macros . Before setting up Macros , we need to take into consideration a few things as below : <p> In this example , we will setup a macro for the standard object " Opportunities " . <h> Enabling Feed Tracking <p> In order to enable feed tracking , go to Setup-&gt; Customize -&gt; Chatter -&gt; Feed tracking or you can directly go to Setup and search for Feed Tracking in the quick find/search box on the left . Now select the " Opportunities " object and check the " Enable feed tracking " check box on the top . Also select the fields that you need to be tracked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to a maximum of 20 fields for feed tracking . <p> Feed Tracking <h> Creating a Feed Based Page Layout <p> If a feed based page layout has not already been created for the Opportunities object . Feed based layout creates separate tabs for the feed view and detail view for the page . Go to Setup-&gt; Customization -&gt; Opportunities -&gt; Page layouts -&gt; Create New . After clicking create new you will see the screen below : provide a name for the page layout and check the " Feed-based layout " checkbox , and click next and save . <p> NOTE : You need to set the feed page layout in the page layout assignments as required . <p> Feed Layout Creation <h> Publisher actions setup <p> If we need to use an Email action in macros , then we need to add Email action to the Opportunities page layout . Go to the page layout that has been created and add the quick actions by dragging and dropping to the quick actions section as in the screenshot below . <p> Publisher Actions on the page layout <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last step that needs to be performed for the setting up of Macros . Go to Setup -&gt; Create -&gt; Apps -&gt; New Console app . This will create a new console app and you need to add the " Macro browser " widget to the newly create console app in order to make it visible on the Console app . <p> Macro browser added to the console app <h> Permissions required for Macros <p> For any user able to create and edit Macros , the user profile should have the following permissions : <p> Go to Setup-&gt; profiles -&gt; Select the profile for the user who should be able to create and edit Macros . Once the profile is selected go to " Object settings " and search for Macros and grant the read , create , edit and delete permission as required . In order to run " Bulk Macros " , you should also enable the " Run Macros on multiple Records " option under the system permissions for the profile . <p> Once the above tasks are completed we are all set to use Macros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macros , go to the Console app on which the " Macro Browser " widget has been made available , you should see something as follows at the bottom right corner . <p> Click on Macros , and you should see a widget open as follows , click on " +create macro " . <p> Once you click on " +Create Macro " you should see the following screen with the options to add the actions . Under the " Macro Instructions " section you will have the option to " +Add Instruction " . Once you click on " + Add Instruction " , you should see something as follows , a list with all the possible actions possible . Once a instruction is added you can just click on " Done " and add multiple instructions . Add the instructions as per the requirement . <p> In the below screenshot i have created a " new task creation " macro instruction , so for any opportunity that is open and if i click on the macro and run it , it will create the new task for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instructions <p> Once you are done , save the macro . Now go to the console app where the macro widget has been added and open an active opportunity tab . Once you open the tab , click on macro and search for the macro that you recently created and click on the " Play " button or just hit enter . <p> You should see a new task for the opportunity get created once the macro is run and you wont have to perform multiple clicks in order to create the new task . If all the Macro instructions run successfully you should see an instruction written in green saying macro executed successfully , if not executed successfully you should see a red dot at the specific instruction at which the macro was not able to execute . <p> NOTE : A macro with a blue bolt indicates that these macro actions can not be undone and a macro with green bolt and double lines under it indicates that it is a bulk macro which can be performed in increments of 10 . <h> Bulk Macro <p> Similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macros . To do this we need to grant the permission to " Run Macros on multiple records " which is symbolized with a green bolt along with two lines . To grant the " Run Macros on multiple records " permission , go to Setup-&gt; select Profile -&gt; App Permissions -&gt; Check the " Run Macros on multiple records " check box and save it . <p> Once this permission has been granted you can select 10 records together and execute the macro . In order to run a bulk macro , select a minimum of 10 Opportunities as bulk macros can be performed in increments of 10 only . Once selected open the macros widget and you should see the Green bolt with double lines under it . Just click on run and it is done . With a single click you will be able to apply the same macro to over 10 Opportunities . This would save a lot of time as compared to the conventional way of sending emails individually . <p> So that was how to create a Macro for any object . Macros are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@106251685 @1651685/ <h> Salesforce Sandboxes <h> Salesforce Sandboxes <h> What is a Salesforce Sandbox ? <p> Although it is very easy and possible to make changes directly to configuration in Salesforce , it is a better idea to test out those changes in another environment which wont affect your users . That 's why Salesforce includes a sandbox for every production organisation where changes can be made and tested before moving them to production . This type of environment is called a sandbox . The number you can create and the types available depend on which edition you have , some come standard and some are available for an extra cost . <p> Each production organisation can have one or more sandboxes attached to it and they can be of differen types . For example , most larger organisations will have at least 3 environments , a development environment , a test environment and a production environment . To cater for this , you would use sandboxes for the development and test environments . Changes can be developed in the development environment , tested in the test environment and when you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be moved into the production environment using changesets . It is also useful to use sandboxes to evaluate Apps from the Appexchange . <p> Refresh : A refresh allows you to copy configuration , code and data ( depending on the type of sandbox ) from the production organisation into a sandbox . This is useful when you first create a new sandbox and you have an existing production organisation , so that you make sure the environments are in synch . It is also useful to do a a refresh of a full copy sandbox from time to time , to make sure that the data is in synch with production , so that you can be confident that the testing that is done is done on production data and there wont be any suprises when the changes are moved into production . A refresh will replace an existing sandbox with a new copy . <p> Developer Sandbox A developer sandbox is for developing new functionality , configuration and code and testing it . Multiple users can login to a developer sandbox . In the past they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very limiting , but Salesforce has increased this to the current limit of 200MB . You can refresh the configuration from production although it will not copy any data . It can be refreshed once a day . <p> Developer Pro sandbox A Developer Pro sandbox is similar to a Developer sandbox , in that it contains a copy of of all production organisation configuration , and no data is copied across . The difference is in the amount of data and file storage , it has a higher limit of 500MB , which will be enough for many organisations to load enough data to test production scenarios . It can also be refreshed once a day . <p> Partial Copy sandbox The partial copy sandbox is a new addition to the type of sandboxes that Salesforce offers . It offers a high 5GB of data and file storage . The difference between the full copy and partial copy is that the partial copy allows you to use templates to define the data that will be copied ( e.g. select the objects ) . Up to 10,000 records per objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom object records , it will also copy documents and attachments . The refresh interval is shorter than the full copy at 5 days . The partial copy sandbox is attractive as it is cheaper than a full copy , can be refreshed much more frequently and if you do not have a high volume of data will allow you to have all or most of the data copied across . <p> Full Copy Sandbox The full copy sandbox is a copy of the entire production setup , including configuration , data , documents and attachments . It is usually used for UAT ( user acceptance testing ) for new or changed functionality before it is moved into production . It is also used for troubleshooting issues that occurred in production . As it does a complete copy of everything , Salesforce limits the refresh interval to 29 days . <p> Type <p> Purpose <p> Storage Limit <p> Data <p> Refresh <p> Developer <p> Development and configuration of new functionality <p> 200MB Data storage 200MB File storage <p> Configuration only <p> 1 day <p> Developer Pro <p> Development where larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Data storage 1GB File storage <p> Configuration only <p> 1 day <p> Partial Copy <p> Testing or Training where a subset of the data is sufficient <p> 5GB Data storage 5GB File storage <p> Subset of data determined by template <p> 5 day <p> Full Copy <p> Testing in an environment that is identical to production <p> Same as Production <p> All Data <p> 29 days <p> Notes : <p> Sandboxes will have a different organisation i 'd to your production organisation <p> Salesforce record Ids are copied over for full copy sandboxes <p> When you create or refresh a sandbox , the status will be have the status Copying . Once done the status will change to Ready for Use . The copy time depends on the amount of data and may take from a few minutes to a number of hours . <p> To login to a Sandbox after a refresh , use https : //test.salesforce.com . Salesforce automatically appends the sandbox name to any users tha are copied over . e.g. if the new Sandbox name is fullcopy , then the user john.smith@company.com will become **31;0;TOOLONG . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emails are not been sent from a new sandbox . This is because Salesforce sets the email deliverability to System Email Only to prevent emails being accidentally sent from your test environments to outside contacts . This can be changed within the Email Deliverability settings .

@@106251695 @1651695/ <h> Salesforce Multiple Record Types Example <h> Salesforce Multiple Record Types Example <p> Creating Multiple Record Types <p> Creating brand new custom objects in Salesforce , while necessary , can be time consuming and tedious . Often times you will need to create a different page layout or new selections for a particular picklist field but the only way you know how to do this is create an entirely different custom object and customize it as needed . This is where creating multiple record types for one object come in to play , allowing you to customize various aspects of an object based on profile settings . <p> - What are Record Types ? <p> Record types allow administrators to configure different page layouts , business processes , and picklist values . It is important to note that record types are based on a user 's profile and not standard across the organization . Record types can be used in a variety of ways , from displaying different page layouts for one object based on a set of criteria , to displaying different picklist values based on the user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types do not influence record level security . Meaning , if a user does not have permission to view/edit an object ( or field within that object ) in their profile settings they will not have the ability to view/edit that object even if a record type is made available to their user profile . <p> - Adding Record Types to Profiles <p> Profiles can be associated with one or more record types . This can be done when creating the record type , or later when editing a specified profile . When more than one record type is available you must choose a default for each profile . The default record type should be the one which is used most often , and will therefore be the primary selection for users . Profiles associated with only one record type will never be asked to select a record type when creating a record . This will make more sense once we go through the example below. - <p> Setting a Default Record Type <p> When you have created multiple record types you can set one record type as the default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users tend to use one record type much more often than others . This can be done with the following steps : <p> Manage Users -&gt;Profiles ( select a profile ) -&gt;- Object Settings ( select the object ) -&gt;Edit -&gt;Select from the available list of record types <p> Multiple Record Types Example <p> Your organization works with two types of clients , corporate and armed services , and therefore sees these as two separate account types . For corporate accounts you will need to capture the size in revenue of the corporation , while for armed forces accounts you will need to capture the branch of armed forces of the account . We therefore need to create two record types for the account object with two different picklist field options for each . <p> Understanding the Scenario <p> Because we are have two different account types , Corporate and Armed Forces , as well as two different fields we want to capture for each , it makes sense to create two record types and page layouts for each of these account types . We want the appropriate picklist field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As we can see in the table below , visibility of each field is only necessary when creating the account type in association with that field . <p> Step 1 " Create Page Layouts <p> From the setup screen , click Customize -&gt; Accounts -&gt; Page Layouts <p> Click New <p> Select an existing page layout to clone , or start from scratch .

Let 's say what you want is to take two dates and times , for example 20/01/2014 09:00am and 21/01/2014 10:20am and calculate the duration of time between them in hours and minutes , and display the result like this : 24:20 or 24h:20m . <p> If we just create a formula field and subtract the two dates , we will end up with something like this : <p> Using a straight subtraction Salesforce gives us the difference of the dates in days and fractions of days . In the example above , it is 44.96 , almost 45 days . <p> To calculate and display the difference in hours and minutes , we have some work to do . <p> Firstly , let 's calculate the number of hours difference between the two dates . The formula for this calculation is simple , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of days and multiplies by 24 to get the number of hours . It uses the FLOOR function to round down the result to the nearest integer , so if the difference is 44.96 like in the previous example , we want 44 days not 45 days to use in the calculation of the number of hours . We also use an IF statement to add a 0 to the result so we get 09 and not just 9 if the number of hours is less than 10 . <p> Then the duration in minutes . This one is a little more complex . We use the MOD function to give us the remainder of a division , in this case the number of minutes that are left over . We also use the ROUND function to remove decimal points . The formula looks a bit more complex as we are firstly testing to see if the number of minutes is less than 10 , and if so adding a 0 to the result so we get 07 and not just 7 . <p> Finally , let 's put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula fields together , and also replaces 0:0 ( if there was no result ) with 00:00 . <p> And now in action . The first example is when the open and close dates are on the same days . The result is a calculation of 5 hours and 7 minutes . We have left the calculated fields for the hours and minutes on the page layout , just for demonstration purposes , you would remove them and just leave the final result . <p> The second example is when the open and close dates go over one day . Here the result is 25 hours and 5 minutes .

Here is an example : You have added a custom field to the Product object to record the cost of a product . You want the total cost of all products added displayed on an opportunity . In the screenshot below you can see Widget A has a cost of $50 . <p> When we add a product to an opportunity , we want the product cost displayed . So we add it to the related list . <p> There is a solution , however it may not apply to all situations . To be able to rollup the value of the cost field , we need to copy it to a custom currency field on the opportunity product record . Then we can use that field for the rollup summary . <p> Now with the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is automatically calculated and displayed in the opportunity value field . <p> So , we now create a roll-up summary field and try to add our Product Cost field . However , as it is a formula field , it is not available for use . <p> There is a solution , but it will only apply in certain situations . To be able to rollup the product cost field , we need to copy the value from the formula field to a custom currency field on the opportunity product object . We can then use that field for the rollup summary . To do the copy we use a workflow rule and field update . <p> First we create the custom currency field on the opportunity product object . <p> Next we create the workflow rule and field update . <p> So for testing purposes , we add the new field to the related list . <p> At this point , there is no value in our new field , as the workflow rule did not exist when we added the products . To get the value populated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now the workflow rule runs when we add the product and you can see below that the field has been populated . <p> Now we can go back to adding the roll-up summary field . Our custom field is available to select . <p> And finally , here is the sum of the product cost on the Opportunity Layout . <p> Now as mentioned earlier , this solution may not work for all situations . The reason being , that the value of the formula field is copied when the opportunity product record is created or edited . That means , for example if the product cost is updated after the product is added to the opportunity , the formula field will show the updated value , but the custom field that we added for use in the rollup summary will not . <p> That would be preferable in our case , as we would want the cost of the product when it was added to be recorded on the opportunity and used for the rollup . If the cost was updated months later , we would n't want that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple solution that does n't  need code and uses standard Salesforce workflow . There maybe other cases where the current value is always required , or required for any open opportunities . In that case , you would need a trigger to update the opportunity product record when a change is made to the object that the formula sources its value from .

@@106251712 @1651712/ <p> Some people may wonder whether integration to an email client such as Outlook is even necessary . If Salesforce could send and automatically process incoming emails , then could n't users just live in Salesforce and use it for all work emails ? <p> So what can Salesforce do with emails ? Within the application it is possible to send emails to contacts related to Salesforce records e.g. leads , contacts , opportunities and cases . <p> Note : The from email address will be the email address you set in your email settings . In the email settings , you set the sender name , the email address that will be used as the reply address for the email that is sent and also whether to bcc the reply address that you are using when emails are sent from Salesforce . Setting a reply email address means that it will go to that email address , and not to Salesforce . <p> Workflows rules can be setup to send emails . Workflow emails work the same way as sending an email manually from a record , except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from address to use . When sending Salesforce emails from workflow , you can also choose the template to use . <p> Either you can use the current users email address , or if you have setup organisation wide email addresses you could select one of those . For example you may setup an organisation wide email address such as info@companyname.com and the replies to this email box could be monitored by a number of people . <p> Its also possible to copy emails sent from your email client and associate with Salesforce records . The way to do this is to use the My Email to Salesforce function . My Email to Salesforce is accessable under Personal Setup Email . Once enabled , this feature will give each user a unique email address that can be used as a bcc adddress when sending emails . If this address is used as a bcc , Salesforce will try and match the to email address to a record in Salesforce and if a match is found will save the email as an activity , for example on a lead , contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied tool for integrating Salesforce and Outlook . It does not have any additional cost . It is software that is installed on each users computer and adds features to Outlook to allow synchronisation and recording emails . Each user determines what synchs individually . Salesforce for Outlook does n't  support terminal servers , such as Citrix . <p> If you are in a Citrix environment , then you will need to look for an alternative to Saleforce for Outlook , as it is n't supported . Some products have been developed such as LinkPoint that add features to Outlook that enables synchronisation of contacts , events and tasks . It also allows for a click to record inbound and outbound emails to Salesforce . It can also display related information to the contact of the email such as opportunities and cases . <p> Another alternative if you are using Microsoft exchange is to setup Exchange integration . This is software installed directly on the Exchange server that enables synchronizing information directly between Salesforce and your Exchange server . The synchronization options and rules are setup on the Exchange server centrally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Contacts , Events and Tasks can be synchronized and categories can be used to determine which records will synch . It can also be setup to manually select emails to record in Salesforce or to automate the logging of all inbound and outbound emails . <p> Exchange integration also supports mobile devices , meaning that the emails you send out on the road from your phone can also be recorded in Salesforce . <p> The Email to Salesforce functionality will work with gmail , so to copy emails to Salesforce bcc the generated email address and Salesforce will try to match the to email address to a record in Salesforce . There is also an additional feature that Salesforce offers to make this easier . When activated it will add gmail links and buttons next to all email fields and in the activity history related lists for leads and contacts , and will automatically populate the bcc address . <p> The other option is to use a product such as Cirrus Insight , to synchronize and even view and create records directly from gmail . <p> An email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoming email to a specific address and to process them . For example , you can setup an email address for your partners to send orders to , in a specific format . The email handler could interpret the email and create or update records based on the contents of the email . Creating an email handler requires development and APEX to write the code . <p> There you have multiple options for working with emails in Salesforce , both for sending emails from Salesforce and receiving and processing . <h> Comments <p> I was initially very skeptical about registering on Focus on Force .

It is possible to choose to send the email now or schedule it to be sent in the future . Giving the mass email will allow you to check on the status . <p> Once the emails have been sent , an email will be sent to you to confirm the emails have been sent , including how many it was addressed to and how many were actually sent . <p> Here are some considerations when you are using mass email : <h> Mass Email Limits <p> The mass email functionality is not intended to be used for email marketing campaigns sent to thousands of users . Depending on your edition , there are limits of how many emails can be sent each day ( with a day defined as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Mass Email is n't available at all for Personal , Contact Manager and Group Editions . For Professional Edition , the limit is 250 . Enterprise Edition allows 500 emails a day and with Unlimited and Performance edition , it rises to 1,000 per day . <h> Other Considerations <p> Cost : The mass emails you can send from Salesforce ( up to your limit defined by your edition ) can be sent for no additional cost . <p> From Email Address : Salesforce uses the senders email address as the from address . Its not possible to change this , so keep this in mind when you choose which Salesforce user is used to send the emails . <p> Tracking : Tracking can be enabled in Activity Settings for HTML emails . Tracking only works for HTML emails , as Salesforce includes a transparent image in the email that is hosted on the Salesforce server , and when the image is displayed Salesforce registers that the email has been opened . This does n't  work if the user has disabled downloading images . Tracking records the date the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was opened and the most recent date is was opened . <p> Tracking is displayed against the contact in the HTML Email Status related list . After an email is sent , a record will be created that will show when the email was sent . <p> After the email has been opened , the record will be updated with the open date , number of times opened and the last opened date .

@@106251723 @1651723/ <h> Salesforce Email Templates <h> Salesforce Email Templates <p> When you send an email from Salesforce , such as when you use the Send Email button or triggered from a workflow , you can select an email template . Email Templates in Salesforce come in four different types : <p> Plain Text <p> HTML using Letterhead <p> HTML Custom <p> Visualforce <h> Plain Text Email Template <p> This is the simplest email template to create . You can create it very quickly by entering the email text and including the merge fields that you would like to use . Although this kind of template is easy to create , it does not allow images to be included and tracking of if the email was opened , which is available with the other types . Often a text email template is used as a notification to internal users , as branding and tracking is not so important . <p> In the example above , an email template has been created to notify of a case assignment . Merge fields for the case number and case subject have been used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be included in the email body . When the email is sent , data from the related record is used to populate the merge fields . <h> HTML using Letterhead <p> The next step up from a plain text is to create an HTML using Letterhead template . The email sent is formatted using HTML but you do n't  need to know HTML to create one . You define a letterhead , and then format text and merge fields into the email body . <p> The example above shows a HTML letterhead template with its various sections . At the top is the header where you can insert a company logo and set the background color . Then there is the email body , where you can again set the background color and insert text and merge fields . Finally there is the footer where you can insert a different logo and set the color . The letterhead is predefined and can be reused as the basis for your template , and then the text and merge fields added . Formatting controls are available to customize the look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ template is that you get a professional looking email branded with your logos , background colors and formatted text without needing to know any HTML or CSS . <h> HTML Custom <p> Use custom HTML templates when you have HTML skills and want to have total control over the look of the email . You can enter html , including images ( remember the images will be hosted by Salesforce and so you must load them into the documents folder and then carefully construct the image URL ) . <h> Visualforce Email Templates <p> Visualforce email templates are used when you need total control of not only the presentation of the email but the data as well . With Visualforce email templates you can : <p> Define CSS styles that will apply to the HTML tags within the email <p> Use Visualforce to include a set of records in the email ( e.g. all cases related to an account ) <p> Use a custom controller to retrieve specific data for use in the email

I could n't find one , so I made my own . Once a lead is qualified , the next step is to convert the lead . In Salesforce , when you convert a lead , there are a number of options that are part of the process flow . <p> The first step is to press the convert button . Salesforce will then display the Convert Lead page . The main decisions to be made on this page are : <p> 1 . What account should the lead be related to . The options are to create a new account , select an account ( Salesforce will display the exact or near matches in the dropdown ) or search and select an existing account . <p> 2 . Should the lead be attached to an existing contact . It could be the case that the lead already exists in the system as a contact and if so , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new data can be added to the contact record . This avoids creating duplicate contact records for the same person . <p> 3 . Should an opportunity be created . In most cases an opportunity would be created , as the lead was qualified , and an opportunity tracks the next steps in moving through a sales process . <p> There is also an option to create a task , that will be related to the contact and opportunity . <h> Custom Field Mapping <p> Finally , it is also possible to make sure that any custom fields that you have added to the lead to gather more information about the lead is not lost and is transferred over to the newly created or existing contact , account or opportunity record . This is done by using lead custom field mapping . <p> This is done with the Map Lead Fields button , which is found on the Lead fields page in the custom fields and relationships sections . <p> Here you can select any of the custom fields that have been added to the lead object , and select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map it to . On lead conversion , the value from the lead custom field will be transferred into the mapped field .

However , sometimes we can not achieve exactly what we need either in terms of the way the data is presented , or having a requirement to report on data that is not related in a way that can be consolidated in a report . That is when we may consider a Visualforce report . A Visualforce report is Visualforce page , that allows us to enter selection criteria and options , and use APEX to retrieve the data and present it back to us in a Visualforce page . Although this requires development skills to create and maintain , it is an option worth investigating if the standard reporting tools do not satisfy your requirements . <p> The following example explains how a Visualforce report can be built to report on Opportunities and the related Opportunity team . It has been kept relatively simple , and yes the same data could be extracted from a standard report , but just not presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same row as each Opportunity . It also demonstrates how filters can be applied to the data . <h> Step 1 : Create the page and controller <p> We need to start by creating a Visualforce page and controller . This needs to be a custom controller as this page does n't relate to any specific record . <p> We need two list of opportunities , one will be our master list that we query in the constructor and this is the list we base our filter from . The second list is the filtered opportunities , these are the ones we want displayed on our page . When the page loads , we want all the opportunities to be displayed so in the constructor we initialize this list as a copy of the list of all opportunities . <p> Our Visualforce page has a table that displays the list of Opportunities in the display Opportunities list . We put all the fields we want displayed as columns in apex:column tags within a page block table . <h> Step 2 : Create the filter <p> To create the filter we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controller to the page . We use this to capture the input values and take advantage of the Salesforce standard way of displaying fields . Doing this means we only have to specify the field we want , and Salesforce manages the type of control including any picklist values . As we are using this object to pass data back to the controller the fields need to be wrapped in apex:form tags . <p> Now for the filter . We want to display only those opportunities that match the filter Opportunity dummy record that we create . To do this we loop through our master record of opportunities and compare them to each field we want from the dummy filter Opportunity . We want to check first of all that the field is not null ( or an empty string ) this means that nothing has been selected as the filter . If they match we add it to <p> 9 <p> 10 <p> publicvoidfilter() <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> **34;33;TOOLONG <p> LONG ... <p> **27;69;TOOLONG ; <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> On the Visualforce page we add action support to the filter fields , this tells the controller that we want the filter method to be called when the field changes , and then we want to rerender the table of our Opportunities . <p> JavaScript <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> &lt;apex:inputfield value= " ! filterOpportunity.Type " &gt; <p> &lt;apex:actionsupport event= " onchange " action= " ! filter " <p> rerender= " opportunityTable " /&gt; <p> &lt;/apex:inputfield&gt; <h> Step 3 : Getting the related OpportunityTeamMember records <p> In the controller we need to query all the opportunity team member records related to the opportunities we have and create a map from Opportunity I 'd to a list of Opportunity Team Members . <p> Then in the Visualforce page we can put another page block table within one of the columns . This page block table iterates over the list Opportunity Team Members that we get from the map using the key that is the Opportunity I 'd . Within this table we can add whatever columns we choose .

While we can set the unique indicator on a custom field to prevent duplicate values for one field across records , how do we prevent records inserted with duplicate values across all or some of the fields ? Do we need to write a trigger to handle this ? Or is there a config only solution to the problem ? <p> In this example , we are using a custom object Transaction . The Transaction object has lookups to Account and Product and a Transaction Date and Amount . We want to make sure that no duplicate transactions for the same Account , Product , Transaction Date and Amount can be saved . <p> To setup our config duplicate check , we follow step 1 and add a custom field Unique Record Key to the Transaction object . Note that it is marked as Unique . The type and length is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough as it is holding 2 i 'd fields , a date and an amount . <p> Next we need to add a workflow rule . The rule criteria is True and the evaluation criteria is set to created and every time edited , to make sure that it will always fire for new and for any edits to existing records . <p> The field update concatenates the values of the Account I 'd , Product I 'd , Transaction Date and Transaction Amount and updates the Unique Record Key with the result . Notice that the non text fields need to use the TEXT function to convert them to text to be able to use the concatenate function . <p> Here we see the Unique Record Key added temporarily to the page layout , so we can see that the field update is working .

@@106251734 @1651734/ <h> Salesforce Instances vs Orgs vs Environments <h> Salesforce Instances vs Orgs vs Environments <p> Once you start getting involved with Salesforce , you will hear a number of terms such as Instance , Org , Environment and even POD . Its easy to get these confused or even not to even be aware of what they really mean . One person may refer to the development instance and another the development environment . Some organisations may refer to the fact that they have multiple instances of Salesforce , and another multiple orgs . Here is a quick guide to the Salesforce terminology . <p> To understand the Salesforce terminology , you must first understand the multi-tenancy concept . Salesforce uses a multi-tenancy architecture , meaning that a number of customers share IT resources such as database servers , application servers and infrastructure required to run applications , resulting in an environment that can be standardised and optimised for all efficiently and a lower cost for each tenant as the resources are managed centrally . <h> Salesforce Instance or POD <p> Salesforce groups together around 10,000 customers together into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A POD is also known as an Instance and it is a self contained unit that contains all that is required to run Salesforce , including the application server , database server , database itself , search and file system . Each customer is allocated to one and only POD and that is where their data resides . As of July 2014 , there are currently 21 Instances in North America , 2 in Asia Pacific , 4 in EMEA and 25 Sandbox Instances . A Sandbox instance is non production environment . <p> The complete list of Salesforce instances and the current status of each one is listed at Salesforce Trust . <p> Below is a list of some of the North American Instances . You can see that each instance can have a different status . All of the instances except for NA1 have an informational message . Informational messages can be used to inform customers of an upgrade to a new release is starting or has completed . On July 11 there was a performance issue with NA0 , but this did not affect any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are using , check the URL after you login into Salesforce . In the example below , the customer is on the ap1 instance . <p> In the case of a Sandbox , the URL will be one of the cs instances such as cs6 in the case below . <p> In maybe that you do n't  see the instance in the URL if you are using a custom domain , in that case the URL will be something like : https : **37;98;TOOLONG , where xxx is your company name . Salesforce offers a lookup service from the trust site , for you to enter your custom domain and it will return the instance it is using . <h> Salesforce Org <p> Now we understand what an Instance or POD is , what is a Salesforce Org or Organisation ? An org is an identifier that represents a customers version of Salesforce and its data within an instance . Each org can be highly customised including custom fields , custom objects , workflows , data sharing rules , visualforce pages and apex coding . You can find your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you request to enable a feature such as person accounts , territory management or multi-currency , Salesforce will request your org i 'd , so that it can enable the feature just for your org . <p> As all customers within an instance are sharing the same database , the org i 'd is stored in every table to ensure that every row of data is linked back to the correct customer and the data from other customers sharing the same instance can not be mixed up . <h> Salesforce Environments <p> So , finally what are Salesforce environments ? An environment is a Salesforce org that is used for a specific purpose . Salesforce customers will have an org that is used as their production or live environment . They will also usually have additional orgs used for development , testing , integration or training purposes , and these are referred to as development environments , testing environments etc . Non production orgs will be housed in one of the Sandbox instances . <h> Salesforce Data Centre , Instances , Orgs and Environments <p> The diagram below pulls everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of data centres around the world . In each datacentre are a number of instances . Each instance will support around 10,000 customers each with their own Salesforce org . The org will be used as a production environment , unless it is housed on a Sandbox instance , in which case the org will be used for development , testing , integration testing , training or another non production purpose .

One area that is important to understand but easy to overlook is search layouts . Search layouts allow us to customize the fields both standard and custom that are displayed in various results lists . It is worth the time to customize , as it can improve productivity by ensuring that the most useful fields are displayed in the search results . Let 's take a look at what is possible : <p> Here are the search layouts available on Account . <p> Let 's go through each of them . <p> Search Results The Search Results search layout determines the fields that are displayed when we do a global search .

After searching on go* , 3 accounts are returned with the fields Account Name , Parent Account and Type . <p> Lookup Phone Dialogs Lookup Phone Dialog search layout is used with the Salesforce CRM Call Center soft phone . The soft phone provides a lookup icon and the it is possible to search for accounts . The search layout is used for display of the search results . <p> Accounts Tab The Accounts Tab Search search layout determines the fields that are displayed on the Accounts home tab for recently viewed , created or modified records ( determined by the easy to miss picklist on the right ) . This layout is set to display the Account Name , Billing City , Billing State and Billing Country . <p> Accounts List View Naming this search layout Accounts List View is a bit misleading , as it does n't  allow you to modify the fields in the Account List View as you may expect .

In the example below , a search has been done on accounts starting with go . This has returned 3 results . Clicking the show filters link , displays the filter fields that have been configured , which are Account Name and Type . After applying a search filter on Customer and applying the filter , the 2 customer accounts are displayed . <p> Notes : <p> If a field is included in a search layout , but is hidden via field level security it wont be displayed . <p> Search Layouts can be customised for custom objects in the same way as standard objects . <p> You can add up to 10 fields , but can not remove identifying fields such as account or case number .

It is the Email to Salesforce features and when enabled , allows users to bcc a unique bcc email address to automatically create activity records against records in Salesforce . To use this feature , firstly the Salesforce Administrator has to enabled it , and then each user can grab their own bcc address and adjust the way the feature will work for them . <p> The first step is to enable the feature . You will find it by following : **30;137;TOOLONG Administration-&gt;Email to Salesforce <p> Then , just tick the Active checkbox . <p> Next , Salesforce gives you an option to notify all users that the feature has been enabled . You can customise the message or just skip the step . <p> Now Salesforce will confirm that you have enabled the feature . <p> Now its the users turn . They need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they want the feature to work for them . <p> These settings are found by following the menu path : My **25;169;TOOLONG Email to Salesforce . <p> On the page will be the Email to Salesforce email address . This is unique for each user and is a very long address that starts with emailtosalesforce . <p> You also need to tell Salesforce which email addresses you will send from , in the My Acceptable Email Addresses box . If you do n't  , you will get a send error like this:SenderAuthorization : focusonforce@gmail.com is not authorized to send emails to this service . <p> Last step is for the user to choose how they want the feature to work . You would normally choose automatic assignment to Leads and Contacts and possibly open opportunities that a contact is associated with . You can also choose if email attachments are also saved into Salesforce , and if you would like a confirmation email each time Salesfoce saves an email . This last option may be useful for testing purposes , but once the feature is setup and running , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just fill up your inbox . <p> So , now that it is all setup , let 's see how it works . Below is an example email , being sent to a contact Jon Amos that has been setup in the Salesforce system . We have added our Email to Salesforce email address in the bcc field . When the email is sent , Salesforce will search the To : and CC : fields and check if the email addresses match any leads or contacts in the system . If they do , the email will be saved and logged as a completed task under the matching contact or lead record . <p> And here is the result . Under our contact Jon Amos in the Activity History related list , we can see our email has been logged . Clicking on the subject field opens up the task details , and we can see the body of the email has been saved in the comments field , and the task has been set to completed . <p> But what if the lead or contact does n't  exist ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , it will save the email in the unresolved items list . In our example below , Salesforce couldn not find a lead or contact with the email address **35;196;TOOLONG and added it to the unresolved items . From there , you can either manually select and assign it to a lead or contact or do n't  assign it . <h> Tips for using Email to Salesforce : <p> If you wondering how are you going to remember the Email to Salesforce address , just create a contact named sfdc or salesforce-email with the complete long email address and add this contact to the emails you want to save . <p> If you are thinking that this feature is great for sending emails to contacts or leads and associating the emails to the records , but what happens when the person replies ? The email wont automatically get saved into Salesforce . There is a feature that can be used for this just forward the email to your BCC Email to Salesforce address without any addresses in the To : or CC : . Salesforce will check the forwarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address . If you do that , you can save your replies against the correct records in Salesforce as well . <p> Another option is to make it easier to use this feature is to automatically include the address in every email you send . Instructions on how to set this up for gmail are available in a number of blogs including this LONG ... Although it is convenient to automatically include the bcc address in every email , it will mean that your unresolved items will build up and will need regular cleaning out .

It runs in a multi-tenant environment whereas a single resource can be shared by all different Salesforce organisations or instances . In this case , it is crucial to ensure that no organisation would monopolise the resources . Salesforce.com enforced a set of restrictions or limits to ensure the efficient use of resources in the force.com platform . These governor execution limits are applied per transaction basis , and when crossed , throws- an error and halts- the execution of the program . <p> As a developer , it is significant to ensure that our codes are scalable and can- prevent the enforced limits .

Salesforce has a long history of acquiring companies that extend and complement Salesforce functionality and this is in the mid range of the scale , with ExactTarget ( $2.5 billion in 2013 ) and Buddy Media ( $745 million in 2012 ) at the high end and comparable with the more recent purchase of RelateIQ ( $390 million in 2014 ) Interestingly , Salesforce Ventures had invested in SteelBrick back in February 2015 . So what functionality does SteelBrick provide and why would Salesforce be interested in purchasing it ? <p> SteelBrick has developed a native Salesforce app that covers Quote to Cash functionality . You may be familiar with Configure , Price and Quote ( also referred to as CPQ ) , Quote to Cash adds on top of that to include billing ( the cash part ) . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salesforce is quite basic , there is no order configuration capability and it is also lacking in any billing functionality . This has resulted in customers doing custom development to enhance the existing functionality to meet project requirements or implementing functionality of a number of AppExchange vendors who have seized the opportunity to plug these gaps with their own app . There are many companies in this space either offering general CPQ functionality like SteelBrick , Apptus , Big Machines or focusing on a niche such as Zuora for subscriptions or CloudSense for the Telecoms industry . <p> If you are not familiar with CPQ functionality , here is some examples of - the functionality it offers : <h> Configure <p> In the Sales Cloud , you are on your own when it comes to adding products to an opportunity or quote . You select a price book and then can add any combination of products from that price book that match the currency of the opportunity . Many companies have rules around what products make sense or can be sold together . CPQ applications help to make sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purchasing SasaS software ( e.g. Salesforce ) and the various options of editions , feature licences , storage and support plans . Another example is a combination of products and services . I worked on a project where the customer was selling satellite bandwidth and the quotes included the services ( satellite transponder bandwidth , teleport hub charges , support etc. ) and physical products ( satellite dish , modem , etc. ) which needed to be suitable for the satellite provider chosen . <p> So CPQ functionality for configuring products can include : <p> Use questions and filters to guide the product configuration process to a valid combination of products ( guided selling ) <p> Only allow compatible products to be added to quotes or orders <p> Be able to specify when only one of a set of products can be selected <p> Have multiple levels of product configuration <p> Steelbrick Configuration <h> Price <p> The Sales cloud allows you to store a list price in a price book , which can be overridden with a sales price when adding a product to an opportunity . It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item . But what if you need to apply a discount to the whole quote or there is pricing based on the product and services bundle ? This is where CPQ apps can : <p> Apply discounts to individual line items or to the entire quote <p> Price according to the mix of products and services <p> Configure if approvals are required at the line item level <p> Configure volume discounts <h> Quote <p> After adding products and services to an opportunity , you end up with one amount . This does n't  cater for situations where there may be a mix of one time charges and recurring charges . Salesforce has basic quote templates , but these only meet very basic needs . Customers will often turn to other solutions such as Conga for document generation . CPQ Apps can : <p> Provide a breakdown of the quote price if there are one time and recurring charges <p> Configure quote templates and configure if additional materials ( such as a product sheet ) should be included in the quote documentation <p> Include Cover Letters in the document pack <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Quote to Cash . Billing or Invoicing functionality extends into traditional ERP territory with features such as : <p> Producing Invoices <p> Collecting Payments <p> Integration with payment gateways <p> Integrating with accounting / ERP systems <p> It will be interesting to see how Salesforce integrates this functionality into the Sales Cloud . It will most likely be via a feature licence as was done with Knowledge , CRM Content and Live Agent . So although this acquisition may have the other CPQ and Quote to Cash AppExchange vendors concerned , it may come at an additional cost for customers , meaning there will still be competition in the space . Also , Salesforce Ventures have continued to invest in Apttus , a competitor of SteelBrick , as recently as September 2015. 
@@106251756 @1651756/ <h> Salesforce VLOOKUP Example <h> Salesforce VLOOKUP Example <p> Many people are aware of the Microsoft Excel vlookup function , that will return a value in a table ( or defined range of cells ) based on an identifier . Salesforce has a function with the same name , and this post will explain how it can be used using an example . <p> Let 's say that you have a business requirement that only cases that have been open for a certain period of time can be set to High priority . For example , you only want cases that have been open for at least 12 hours to be set to High priority , otherwise an error should be displayed . <p> We can do this with a validation rule , but what if you would like the number of hours to be set by someone that is not the Salesforce Administrator and is not familiar with validation rules ? Alternatively you may occassionaly have the need to update this value as an Administrator , but do not want to change the rule and update all other environments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the number of hours in a parameter object , it can be maintained by any appropriate user . In the example below , we can see a record created in the Parameter object . This is a simple object that just contains a code and value . In our example we have created a parameter with the code CASEOPENHOURS to represent the number of hours that a case needs to be open before it can be set to High priority . This record has the value 12 to represent 12 hours . <p> Now that we have our Parameter defined , we can use it and the vlookup function in a validation rule . <p> This validation rule is checking if the number of hours the case has been open is smaller than the parameter values and the Priority picklist value is set to High then display the error Case has not exceeded open hours . <p> Let 's have a closer look at how the Salesforce vlookup function has been used : <p> Now with the validation rule in place , if we try to update a case to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( set at 12 in the Parameter object ) , an error will be displayed : <p> However , if the case has exceeded the parameter value , we can update the priority . <p> So there we have an example of using the vlookup function in a validation rule , that has saved us from hard coding the value . Any users that we give access to the parameter table can update the value .

@@106251767 @1651767/ <h> Merge Fields in Salesforce Tasks <h> Merge Fields in Salesforce Tasks <p> Using Workflow to create followup tasks or reminders is a common use case . It is also simple to setup , just create a workflow rule with a rule trigger date a number of days in the future . Say we wanted to have a followup task generated 5 days before the Opportunity close date . This is easy , but standard workflow comes with a limitation , merge fields can not be used for field values . This means that all of the tasks created would have the same subject and description . In this article we will look at how Process Builder can be used as an alternative , to create Task Records with merge fields . <p> First let 's review how it would be done with Workflow . First we create the workflow rule with a time trigger 5 days before the Opportunity:Close Date . <p> Then we configure the workflow task that should be created . <p> So , with a few minutes of work , we have our time dependent workflow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a task for the Opportunity Owner , to remind them to followup as the close date of the Opportunity is approaching . <p> Great . Job Done ? Well let 's have a look at the result . As you can see below , the Tasks are created , but they all have the same subject . Although you can see what Opportunity they are related to and the Account , it would be useful to have more information in the task subject and comments about the opportunity , instead of the three tasks related to three different opportunities having the same subject and description . This limitation was recognised way back in 2008 where it was raised as an idea here : Merge Fields in Workflow Tasks <p> Now that Process Builder is available , there is an alternative . Let 's see how it can be used to create tasks with merge fields . Here is the view of the Process . The object is Opportunity and the process will start when a record is created or edited . <p> The scheduled action is defined to defined to execute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get to the interesting part . The ability to create a Task record with Merge Fields . As you can see use the Create a Record action and choose Task as the Record Type . We then can set any of the Task object fields with values , that can be Reference , Picklists or Formulas . To create the record and link to the related Opportunity , we must set the Assigned To I 'd field using a reference to the Opportunity Owner field . Not shown in the screenshot , but critical to linking the task to the Opportunity is setting the Related To I 'd to the Opportunity I 'd . If we do n't  do this , the task will be created with the Opportunity Owner as the owner of the task , but not linked to the opportunity . We set the Priority and Status using the Picklist values . The subject is where we can get creative and build up a string that refers to values in the Opportunity Record . In this case the formula includes the Opportunity Type ( to know whether it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Opportunity Amount , so we have some idea of the size of the opportunity , all from the Task Subject . If there is too much to fit in the subject , we can also use the Description field . <p> Once Opportunity records are created and have a pending scheduled action , they will be visible as a Paused Flow Interview . <p> The final result , showing the tasks that have been created with merge field values from the Opportunity .

It can be used to merge Salesforce data to produce documents in Word , Excel , Powerpoint , HTML Email and PDF format . Here is a quick guide to generating an Excel spreadsheet with data from Salesforce. <h> 1 . Create Your Excel Template <p> The first step is to define the Excel template . Create labels and leave room for the field values . If there will be any tables of data think about how many rows you need , so you can define the layout around that . For example you may want a list of open opportunities sorted by amount value . Perhaps you only want the top 5 for a particular account . In that case you can design your template around a table with 5 rows . <h> 2 . Define the Fields and Reports it will use <p> List the fields that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having any tables of data , define or create the reports that will supply the data . Make sure the fields you need are in the reports . If the Excel table will only have a limited number of rows , use the row limit feature in Salesforce reports to make sure that the report will only return a certain number of rows . <h> 3 . Add the Merge Fields to the Excel Template <p> Add the fields from the master object and any report fields to the template . For the master fields , use the syntax : &amp;=Master.FIELDNAME <p> Conga Excel Merge Fields <p> For reports , you can reference the report by an alias that you define in the conga button , and then reference the field names . In this case , the opportunity report alias is OPPS . <p> Conga Excel Table Report Merge Fields <h> 4 . Create a Salesforce Conga Template Record <p> In this step , you create the conga template record that is referenced by the Conga Button . You create a Conga Template record and attach the actual template @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the i 'd of the record and use that in your Conga button definition . Remember to update the i 'd when deploying into a new environment as it will be different . <p> Conga Account Profile Template Record <h> 5 . Setup Your Conga Button <p> Conga Button Setup <p> The basic setup of the button to work with Excel is no different to setting it up to work with Word . After the Conga URL , in this case the button is on Account so we provide the Account I 'd and then use the various Conga parameters to control the behaviour of the document generation . In the example we are using the following parameters : <p> FP0 : Controls whether to lock the output as PDF . In our case , we are not . <p> OFN : Used to generate the file name of the produced document . In this case it will be Profile For and then the Account Name . <p> LG3 : Used to control if a generated document is attached to the account record . We are using 0 for no attachment . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated over time , especially if being used for quotes or order documents . <p> LG4 : Used to control if an activity is logged against the account record . We are using 0 for not logging an activity . <p> DS7 : Used to control background mode . When the document is being developed this is usually set to 0 , but once you are complete it is set to 13 so that the document is generated automatically and delivered to the browser . <p> BML : Message displayed when the document is being generated . <p> Template I 'd : This is the I 'd of the Conga Template record you created and attached the template file . <p> Report I 'd : If a report is being used as a data source for the template , the I 'd is specified here .

For those who have experience with database queries or other report writing tools , the name Joined report can raise expectations that it will be possible to report on data joined from different objects in the one report . A way to think of joined reports is of separate block reports where the data can be optionally grouped to join the data . <p> The most basic use case of a joined report is to display different views of data from the same object in the same report . For example , create an opportunity report and change the type to joined . Once the report type is changed , the report fields are grouped together in a block . Dragging fields to an area to the right of the first block will create a second block . Up to 5 blocks can be created in the one joined report . In this example there are 3 blocks and each block will have its own filter criteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own report block . <p> This is essentially three separate opportunity reports , each with their own set of fields and filters . The next step is to add a cross block grouping field . In this case we have added the Opportunity Owner . Now we can see how we can use this to group the data across the reports .

In this article you will learn how to create some key metrics for summary reports by using the PARENTGROUPVAL function within a summary , joined or a matrix report . The function obtains the summary value from a parent group , which is a grouping that is a level above the current grouping . The syntax varies based on the report type in context : <p> Case I:Tracking Lead Source effectiveness <p> Consider the case where an organization wishes to track the Lead Source effectiveness , and to do that it tags all of its Leads with a Lead Source . If management would like to know the percentage contribution of each lead source towards the total lead count " conceptually you could envision this as a summary report , grouped based on Lead Source . However to get the percentage figure , you would need to divide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leads . In this case , PARENTGROUPVAL would help you get the total number of leads ( denominator ) . Let 's see how : <p> STEP 2 : Use a custom formula field to extract the percentage contribution of a lead source versus the total lead count . <p> Now , you have your group level summaries , for instance , you know Lead Source = Web gave you seven leads over the current calendar year .

@@106251843 @1651843/ <h> Salesforce Data Security <h> Salesforce Data Security <p> By : Nick Kurbatov , Digital Business Analyst <p> Data Security when I see these two words the first thing that comes to my mind is " Johnny Mnemonic " , where the brain of the main character is used as data storage and antagonists are trying to break and steal the data . <p> Data Security is without a doubt one of the biggest trends in IT nowadays . According to the current speed of the Internet spreading its only a matter of time when all of us will be connected in a single grid . <p> According to Gartner research , in 2020 , 25 billion connected " Things " will be in use . Taking that into consideration , the question of data protection arises in a completely different perspective . <p> I will cover BYOD ( Bring Your Own Device ) in more details as this is directly connected to data security . I can share the experience of using BYOD in Salesforce.com CRM at my previous company . <p> The idea of BYOD is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to work on Macs not PCs , or vice versa , get used to Android mobiles not iOS . In my experience , BYOD was very useful in terms of the following question : do I really want to enroll ( this is a procedure of creating an additional tier of authentication , according to company policy , in order to use your device ) my device and set-up a work e-mail agent or I want to leave my work at the company provided hardware ? <p> Part of my role was closely connected to customer service , so I had to be online at all times . I can easily enter some meeting notes , create activities and contacts just by using my personal smartphone . I have chosen the first option . I 've never regretted this decision . For example , work e-mail agent was really useful for quick replying to customers ' e-mails without delay from anywhere . I suffered only because of the enormous password I had to enter in order to unlock the phone ( that was before TouchID ) , but on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gets stolen I can sleep well . <p> At the end of the day , most companies have that rule for the employee because the company needs to be sure about the access the employee has to corporate data . BYOD creates a challenge for the IT team to control employees access . But if you take a look at this situation from another side ? An employee having a secure and safe access to corporate data ( fully observed by IT team ) from a personal perspective , they would be more loyal to the company and could be a more efficient worker because they knows how to work with his own devices ( that will eliminate some of the IT-Helpdesk tickets as well ) . In a long-term perspective , it will be a benefit for a company . <p> When it comes to Salesforce , of course there is the world class security at the data centres , but that is protection against physical data loss . Security breaches are more likely to be via social engineering or from current employees accessing or downloading data . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides , that we can take advantage of to secure access to the system and data . <h> Single Sign-On <p> Salesforce has its own system of user authentication , but some companies prefer to use an existing single sign-on capability to simplify and standardize their user authentication . <h> Network-Based Security <p> Network-based security limits where users can log in from , and when they can log in . This is different from user authentication , which only determines who can log in . Use network-based security to limit the window of opportunity for an attacker and to make it more difficult for an attacker to use stolen credentials . <h> CAPTCHA Security for Data Exports <p> By request , Salesforce can require users to pass a simple text-entry user verification test to export data from Salesforce . This type of network-based security helps prevent malicious users from accessing your organization 's data , and can reduce the risk of automated attacks . <h> Restrict Where and When Users Can Log In to Salesforce <p> You can restrict the hours during which users can log in and the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from . If IP address restrictions are defined for a user 's profile and a login originates from an unknown IP address , Salesforce does not allow the login . These restrictions help protect your data from unauthorized access and phishing attacks . <h> Two-Factor Authentication <p> As a Salesforce Admin , you can enhance your org 's security by requiring a second level of authentication for every user login . You can also require two-factor authentication when a user meets certain criteria , such as attempting to view reports or access a connected app . <h> Custom Login Flows <p> Login flows allow administrators to build post-authentication processes to match their business practices , associate the flow with a user profile , and send the user through that flow when logging in . Use login flows to collect registration information from users , provide terms of service acceptance form , prompt the user for the second factor of authentication , and other customization . <h> Platform Encryption <p> Back at the data layer , recently Salesforce has been focussing on introducing enhanced data encryption , called Platform Encryption . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide : Shield Platform Encryption relies on a unique tenant secret that you control and a master secret that 's maintained by Salesforce . We combine these secrets to create your unique data encryption key . We use that key to encrypt data that your users put into Salesforce , and to decrypt data when your authorized users need it . Encrypting files , fields , and attachments have no effect on your organization 's storage limits . <h> Event Monitoring <p> As the name suggests , allows certain events to be monitored in real time . Examples include the number of logins , apex executions and report exports . If someone is planning to leave an organization and starts downloading data through reports , with event monitoring this activity can be monitored and acted upon proactively . <p> Now let 's switch to the global scale of data protection . <p> According to MarketsAndMarkets research mobile , the data protection market will grow to 3.54 Billion dollars by 2019 . That number could give you a good overview of the size of demand . I 'm personally worried about the speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to connect the world ) as it gives an enormous opportunity to bad guys to get to your data . If they get access to your personal data , they can be you in terms of the IT-systems . <p> Its scary , but it also creates demand from me , as an end-user and from my business to have the best protection possible to protect vital corporate data .

@@106251887 @1651887/ <h> The Wonders of Custom Settings in Salesforce <h> The Wonders of Custom Settings in Salesforce <p> If you have delved into the world of custom objects in the Salesforce platform , you have more than likely used Custom Objects to interact with your Apex code , and , depending on your permissions , even had your APIs call on those custom objects . Amazing , right ? <p> There is another level to custom objects called Custom Settings which , for some reason , loads of developers either are n't aware of or simply do n't understand , despite their ease of use and practical applicability . Although not as powerful as Custom Objects , Custom Settings are a definite must-have and deserve their rightful place in your organization . In fact , if you use Data Loader or something similar , you will notice that both Custom Objects and Custom Settings are listed together . Custom Settings are a special type of Custom Object , with fewer bells and whistles . Custom Objects are record tables , while Custom Settings are configuration tables . <p> But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple . Think of Custom Objects as a chainsaw , and Custom Settings as a scalpel ; each has its specific use and purpose even though they are very similar in function . <p> Lets- start off by discussing what these two have in common before we get to the eureka moment and realize how amazing Custom Settings are : Custom Objects and Custom Settings both allow developers to create custom sets of data in addition to creating and associating custom data for a user , profile , or organization . <p> You can define custom fields in both , but Custom Settings has fewer field types ( only checkbox , currency , date , date/time , email , number , percent , phone , text , text area , and URL ) . Specifically , Custom Settings do n't have some of Custom Objects ' great custom fields such as Formula , Picklist , or relationship-defining Lookup or Master/Detail . There are also no lookups from Custom Objects to Custom Settings . <p> There are no page layouts or record types for Custom Settings , so you are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part , these are not meant to be seen by your average Salesforce user . You can allow for some user manipulation of this data , but you will have to create Visualforce pages to do so . <p> There is also no defining of validation rules , workflow rules , or triggers in Custom Settings . Any data validation or related records updates that you might normally use a Custom Object to trigger must be implemented differently for a Custom Setting . <p> But wait , these all sound like drawbacks . I thought you said there would be a eureka moment about how great Custom Settings are ? <p> Get ready for it : <p> Custom Settings data is stored in the application cache , which enables efficient access without the cost of multiple repeated queries to the database . In fact , using Custom Settings avoids Governor Limits almost completely . As long as you query the Custom Settings using GET methods rather than an SOQL query you can retrieve all of the values with literally zero impact on the governor 's count of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that you will want almost all of your reference data to live life as a Custom Setting rather than as a Custom Object since the limits allow only 100 SQL queries and 150 DML operations maximum per transaction before resulting in an error . Keep in mind that other Governor Limits such as heap size and a number of script statements do still apply , but aside from these , Custom Settings can really help out with limits on queries and rows . ( To dig into other ways to avoid exceeding governor limits , check out Apex Best Practices " Avoid Exceeding Governor Limits ) <p> Moreover , there are actually two different types of Custom Settings : List and Hierarchy . <p> A List Custom Setting is very similar to the way Custom Objects work . It caches your data , meaning access to data is low-cost and efficient , and there is no need to use SOQL queries that count against the aforementioned Governor Limits . The data in this type of setting does not vary between users or profiles and is available across the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of static data that can be accessed across your organization , particularly for sets of data that are frequently used within your application . <p> For instance , the developer enabled the State and Country Territory Picklists in the org and implemented a custom page that overrides the input of users for their account record address . You can utilize the custom settings so that in the page it would show the State Names and whenever the record is saved , the equivalent State Code is processed in Salesforce . Using custom settings makes the functionality easier to main for the developer would not need to update the custom page controller for any additional State Codes he can just configure this in the custom settings. - <p> A Hierarchy Custom Setting , on the other hand , is exactly why you want to use Custom Settings . It uses an integrated hierarchical logic that allows you to personalize settings for and associate-specific rows with specific profiles or users . It checks the organization , profile , and user settings for the current user and returns the most specific value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undefined or otherwise stated ) . The settings for an organization become subject to the specific profile settings in use which in turn become subject to the individual user settings in use , kind of like a hierarchy . This ability to define hierarchical data is extremely powerful and is commonly used to define application-specific defaults on a user-by-user basis . <p> For example , you could define a Hierarchy Custom Setting that associates different points of contact within an organization depending on the level or role of the user . So , if you want your CEO to have direct contact with the Organization ABC 's CEO , this field will automatically appear as his or her organizational contact , whereas lower-level employees in your organization should n't have that kind of direct access , instead of having their contact field populate with their appropriate point of contact . So your sales manager has their acquisition manager as their contact , your shipping manager has their warehouse manager as their contact , and so on so that if your shipping manager needs to escalate something with Organization ABC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without first escalating it internally . This can be set by the profile in use or even as specifically as the user , with the default point of contact being Organization ABC 's front desk . This logic can extend to rates of pay or commission amongst sales reps , to types and level of detail for shipping information depending on how much or how little of this information is required by different organizational departments . <p> Overall , when you combine the power of Hierarchy Custom Settings with the desirability of avoiding Governor Limits , while still having much of the same application and value of Custom Objects , it is easy to see why Custom Settings really are a wonderful tool worth exploring and deploying in your organization .

@@106251896 @1651896/ <h> What is the Approval Process in Salesforce ? <h> What is the Approval Process in Salesforce ? <p> Salesforce CRM is n't the number one customer relationship management program for nothing . Aside from the core functionality , however , there is so much opportunity and peripheral usefulness built into the Salesforce platform that it has evolved into its own ecosystem in which organizations can live and self-sustain without much need to venture into other software . The drawback to this ecosystem is simply that each niche requires exploration to discover why , how , and to what extent it can be useful to any given organization . In the spirit of exploration and adventure , today we will dive into the Approval Process in the Salesforce Organization . <p> First of all , what is the approval process ? In technical terms , it is an automated process used by organizations to approve Records within Salesforce CRM . What is a Record , you ask ? Well , data in Salesforce feeds from standard or custom objects created by each organization 's developers based on that organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table made up of columns and rows containing all sorts of important data and information . A Record is a single row in its entirety contained within that database table ( Object ) . <p> The approval process specifies the steps that are necessary for certain records to be approved , and who must approve this record at various steps in the approval process . It dictates the actions to be taken when the record is approved or rejected or recalled , or even when the record is initially submitted for approval . <p> The Salesforce approval process is very similar to a workflow and actually extends workflow functionality to allow users to approve or reject records while simultaneously tracking and creating an audit trail on the approval history for each record . <h> But what does all of this mean ? When will I even use this ? <p> Funny you should ask ; there are tons of everyday uses for the approval process for any organization . For example , if an organization requires job candidates to go through several levels of management approval prior to being issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be created requiring approval from these different management levels before a letter can be sent . <p> Organizations can also use this for their Opportunities . Let 's say that a sales rep is able to offer discounts to clients and potential clients . This is a great incentive to obtain and retain sales , and the sales reps have a certain degree of autonomy and discretion in offering these discounts . That being said , the organization must have some checks and balances , so it has the ability to create an approval process that requires CEO approval before the sales rep can issue a discount of 25% or higher . <p> Additionally , organizations can use the approval process to have employees request any sort of paid leave or time off , have each request escalated to the approving manager , and even have that approved request forwarded to the human resources department for final approval . Or if an organization 's employees file expense reports , the approval process can be used to approve expenses . In fact , with the approval process , the organization can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two heads of department , while expenses below that cap but above a very low threshold require only direct manager approval , and at the very lowest level , the expenses are approved automatically . <h> Well , this sounds super useful , how can I set this up ? <p> As mentioned , the Salesforce approval process extends workflow functionality . When defining an approval process , keep in mind that the organization needs to specify who must approve the record and in what order the approval flow must go . This allows the organization to set up initial actions , actions on various steps in the process , and even actions for after the record has been fully approved ( or rejected ) . <p> To set up an approval process , the organization must first set up its entry criteria to define when to start the approval process . Next up , the organization needs to determine who needs to approve each individual record or set of records once the approval process begins " this needs to be done at each step in the flow process for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organization will need to define a set of actions to execute both when the approval begins and when it ends . <p> Using the previous examples , the organization may need to set conditions for approval , so that any value submitted that is less than value x flows to approval route 1 , any value submitted that is greater than value x but less than value y flows to approval route 2 , and any value submitted that is greater than value y flows to approval route 3 ( e.g. expense reports ) . Similarly , it may be more of a flow ; once the approval process begins it flows to the department manager first , the HR manager second , and finally to the CEO before being fully approved ( e.g. hiring process ) . It can also be a simple one-step verification : the employee books time off and it gets kicked up to his or her manager to approve , or , the sales rep wants to give Company XYZ a 30% discount and this requires approval from the CEO . <p> The approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update a field in Salesforce , or generate a task once initiated . The entire process can also be tracked in the approval history related list on each record type 's detail page meaning that there is a full audit trail showing where the record type is within the approval process and when it is approved or rejected at each step in the process . This gives the organization a lot of oversight and control over each approval process and makes it easy to identify who approved or denied what decisions . <p> All in all , this makes the Salesforce approval process a very enticing option for any organization or user . It can free up precious hours spent tracking paper or email requests , reduce human error , improve validation rules , create a visual workflow and ensure that the right queries and submissions are being sent to the right people for approval requests . Moreover , the ability to track the approval process , coupled with the sheer functionality of it , means that more and more processes can become autonomous , giving employees more opportunity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive , and giving organizations a way to reduce errors and oversights by keeping detailed logs of approval flows , ultimately increasing performance and productivity .

@@106252007 @1652007/ <h> Deploying with ANT <h> Deploying with ANT <p> As Salesforce projects and deployments get more complex , it is a good idea to learn more about the different deployment options that Salesforce provides . When starting with Salesforce , you learn about how change sets can be used to deploy changes between related orgs . Change sets are only one of the many ways available by which you can deploy one Salesforce Org 's components to other . <p> For example : <p> Change sets <p> Eclipse IDE <p> ANT <p> Custom Tool ( you can create your own custom utility to deploy/retrieve metadata using the metadata API ) <p> Let 's understand a little more about each of them : <p> Change sets : Change sets are primarily available only in Production and Sandbox instances , you can not use Change sets to deploy/retrieve metadata to other unrelated Salesforce Orgs . <p> Eclipse IDE : By using Eclipse IDE you can deploy Salesforce metadata from one org to another but it involves more manual intervention . <p> ANT : A free tool from Apache that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salesforce , retrieve and deploy one Salesforce org 's metadata to any other org . ANT uses XML instructions to perform the appropriate operation like deploy , retrieve , list metadata and so on . ANT performs actions faster than other two . <p> Let 's see how we can use ANT to deploy or retrieve one Salesforce Org 's metadata to another org . The example below will describe a practical example of migration from one org to another org including code . <p> ANT uses XML instructions to perform the actions but to use it you do n't need to have prior knowledge of Java or Salesforce API 's ( Metadata or any other ) , you just need a basic knowledge of XML and the ANT commands available . So let 's see a simple demo at work with ANT . <p> Steps : <p> 1 . Download &amp; Installation <p> Before you install ANT you must first install the Java(JDK/JRE) minimum of 1.5. x version . The Salesforce documentation mentions that you should have Java version 1.7. x or later for better security and TLS support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine confirm the version by typing java version using the command prompt or terminal . <p> Download the latest apache ANT ( http : **32;262;TOOLONG ) . This is the base package for all ANT related commands . Extract it to C : Softwareant <p> Once the download is completed , Extract this to a folder and give it a name with a proper destination path which we will use later to set environment variables . <p> Since we are migrating metadata of one Salesforce org to another Salesforce org , we need some mechanism which understands Salesforce and can be used with the combination of ANT tools . <p> This is why we need to download something called the Force.com Migration Tool . <p> To download it simply follow the steps : <p> Login to Salesforce ( https : **26;296;TOOLONG ) <p> Navigate/Click on Setup <p> Go to -&gt; Develop -&gt; Tools <p> Click Force.com Migration Tool . <p> It will download a zip folder named salesforceantxxx.zip unzip this folder and store it on your computer . C : Softwaressalesforce-ant <p> A sample build.properties file that you must edit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample ant tasks in build.xml <p> A sample build.xml file , that exercises the deploy and retrieve API calls <p> 2 . Set environment variables <p> You need to set the environment path variables which will help you to access ant tools from any folder through the command line . <p> Create a ANTHOME and JAVAHOME variable in your system advanced properties section ( In case Mac OS X and Linux systems you have to set these using command i.e. SET PATH or set $PATH whichever applicable ) <p> Please make sure that you do n't confuse yourself in setting path variables . <p> The first step : Add JDK , JRE and ANT home folder path to OS PATH variable <p> If you see the message you have successfully configured ANT on your machine else if the error message is that ANT does not exist , then your ANT installation was not successful or environment variables were not set properly . <p> We have configured everything pretty much here but just make note that there is one more configuration remaining which we will cover later on in this post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will move on and see how this actually can be used with Salesforce ! <p> To get started first let 's understand the important files available inside the salesforce-ant folder . <p> The Salesforce Ant Migration Tool ant-salesforce.jar is an ANT extension that adds Salesforce-specific tasks to Ant . build.xml , the main file containing all the possible tasks to perform , here tasks that we might want Ant to perform for our project i.e. deploy , retrieve and so on in a specific format . <p> When you give Ant a command , it will read the build.xml configuration file , searching for the target matching that name and once it finds it , it will execute it . <p> We may wonder how ANT connects to our target Salesforce instance , that 's where an important file comes into the picture i.e. build.properties where you can specify the Salesforce instance details such as test login , username and password with security token . <p> This is how build.properties file looks like , provide your instance details there and save this file . <p> Now it 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build.xml file is a very good example with all the possible operations that can be done using ant . Read all the comments and you will understand everything there . <p> The target names are nothing but ANT commands which we are going to use in a minute . Ex : deployCode , deployZip , retrievePkg and so on . These can be used with ANT as an option . Ex : ant deployCode <p> Since in this example we are going to use retrieve and deploy operations we will focus on them . <p> You may have observed that every folder inside the sample folder contains the package.xml file which contains the info about what all classes , triggers , pages , objects you want to deploy or retrieve . In our example the classes folder package.xml contains . <p> We are going to migrate code from the 1st org to 2nd , to proceed with this , we first need to identify all the components which want to migrate like Objects ( Custom , Standard ) , Fields , Apex classes , pages and so on . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list and put it into the package.xml file when we run ANT it will check for the package.xml file and list of components . See below screenshot for reference , you will get to know that we 've to specify the components in element you can either specify individual component names or specify * for all components for that type like ( ApexClass , ApexTrigger , Pages , and so on ) . For more info on component types LONG ... <p> In the above code focus on two most important attributes , retrieveTarget and unpackaged , the first attribute is for , where exactly ( directory ) you want to retrieve the code , in my case I am providing codepkg folder , the second important attribute is to specify the location of package.xml file , in my case I put that created/modified file inside the folder itself . <p> Now we can execute the ant command to retrieve all components , ant retrieveCode <p> Once you hit enter , it will actually start executing the program and fetch all components mentioned in the package.xml and put into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screenshot , we got all the components in just 15 Seconds . <p> Since we fetched all the related components in a folder now , we want to copy the same code to my second org . In order to that follow the below steps : <p> Open the build.properties file and replace the credentials with second org credentials . <p> Go to build.xml to see the configuration for deployCode tag <p> JavaScript <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> 5 <p> &lt;target name= " deployCode " &gt; <p> &lt; ! --Upload the contents of the " codepkg " directory , running the tests forjust1class--&gt; <p> In the above element the most important attributes are deployRoot ( path to the source code ) testLevel to specify whether you want run all the test classes or specific test classes , rollbackOnError to rollback if any error comes . <p> Now let 's deploy the code to the other org <p> Open the command prompt and navigate until the you source code folder ( where we saved our code ) . <p> Enter command ant deployCode it will start deploying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs using the deployAPI call , using the sample class and Account trigger provided with the Force.com Migration Tool . The ant deployCode calls the Ant target named deploy in the build.xml file . <p> By using the same technique , you can perform other commands too . <p> 5 . Monitor changes by logging into your Salesforce account <p> Things can go wrong on your end ( e.g. Terminal quits , computer dies ) , do n't worry . As soon as are start a deployment , it is happening in the cloud . <p> You can not stop a deployment once it is started from a terminal . Control-C does nothing except stop Ant from reporting to your terminal window . <p> To view the deployment status or terminate a deployment , you must log into Salesforce as a System Administrator .

This meant that you needed multiple processes defined to execute chronologically scheduled actions " like reminder emails or field updates to be sent at different times . <p> Process Builder multiple scheduled actions <p> As shown in the example above , a single process can be now be used to schedule 2 reminder emails , as well as update an SLA reached ' marker field . <p> Another use case for having multiple scheduled actions are to send cascading survey emails , when a Case or Opportunity is closed . <p> Note that the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed . Multiple scheduled actions are only available when a process is defined to execute only when an object is created , or only when a field is updated to meet a specified criterion . <h> Process Builder is Bulkified <p> While this may not be an enhancement that can be visually identified , Salesforce has enhanced Process Builder under the hood to respect the bulkified design paradigm . This means that Process Builder now handles batch updates to data better , without throwing limit exceptions . It now works to bucket SOQL queries , and process the entire transaction in batches . <p> This enhancement would allow larger enterprises to adopt process builder without having to worry about impacts from batch DML operations . <h> Easily Choose to Update the Record that Started the Process <p> As a usability improvement Salesforce Process Builder now gives you the option to directly choose to update fields on the record that started the process flow . Prior to this release , you needed to explicitly identify this record , but now it is provided as a simple direct option on field update @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Potentially , one could use a scheduled action to execute an email notification with merge fields , many days after the process is triggered . Until Winter ' 16 , Salesforce Process Builder would use the data as it was at the time of process trigger to generate this email . <p> As of Winter 16 , Process Builder schedules actions have been enhanced to ensure the most current data on the record is picked up , when executing the scheduled action . This accounts for cases where the record have been updated since the start of the process , and schedule action occurs later .

I also found that studying for the Salesforce Admin exam without having Salesforce experience was challenging . <p> However , I overcame by : getting the free Developer Edition of Salesforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogs that spoke of how other professionals found different careers in Salesforce ; using exam-prep sites like FocusOnForce gave me the structured exam practice I needed to prepare for ADM 201 . <p> I received my Salesforce Administrator certification in June 2016 and have not begun studies for another certification yet . <p> I begin a new role as a Salesforce Consultant in a Canadian Salesforce brokerage on January 16 .

@@106252204 @1652204/ <h> A Data Quality Project <h> A Data Quality Project <p> Data Quality what do you think about when somebody mentions these words ? <p> Have you ever imagined what would happen if your address book or files on your computer suddenly go mad , because there are no unique identifiers(IDs) in your data ? <p> It would be a mess . You would n't be able to easily find your colleague 's date of birth or the name of your favorite restaurant unless you have IDs for them ( that is applicable for large amount of data of course ) . <p> In a previous article we started a topic about data that has been entered by sales people into Salesforce.com via a mobile device , but what exactly did they enter ? Did they follow the rules of data quality or did they just enter the data the way they like ? This is the topic that I 'll describe here . <p> The Project Manager should set and confirm to all stakeholders ( e.g. : CIO and regional GMs ) the necessity of Data Quality Rules . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salespeople as the main actors who enter the data into the system <p> Data should be entered in the same way for the entire organization . There 's no exception for any country or business department <p> A company should follow the Data deduplication rules prior to creating any new records in the system <p> A company should have in-house or outsourced full-time resources to run Data Quality campaigns on a weekly or monthly basis ( frequency depending on the amount of data ) <p> Set-up required fields which you have to fill out in order to create a record <p> Use dependent picklists as much as you can to avoid data chaos from the salesperson 's side ; <p> Next , I will describe how I set up these rules in the organization . After that I ran a simple report showing the number of opportunities per account . I found that a large number of opportunities are lacking the information regarding the number of order attached from ERP system , which is one of the main proof that a salesperson made a successful deal with a customer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was calculated from SUM of product lines ) . That information is looking good in terms of the pipeline and presented as a big number in dashboards , but is it reliable ? <p> No , it is n't unless the SUM of opportunities is equal to the SUM of orders . <p> The solution was the following : together with the stakeholders we decided to link orders from the ERP system to Salesforce.com and set the KPIs that will be directly connected to the SUM of orders which are linked to opportunities . <p> Another big Data Quality issue I identified was regarding the information that 's been entered in an account object . The problem was that salespeople were filling only certain fields and in the manner they prefer ( e.g. : there are 5 different variations of an account name ) . Some of the most important fields such as website were omitted as they was n't mandatory . <p> The solution for this issue : I set up a strict account object naming convention ( later we applied this to opportunities and contacts as well ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business point of view of course ) in order to see the major information about the account in one single page . <p> To track all of these changes I created a Data Quality dashboard and I run it on weekly basis to track the data health . In a period of 6 months after I launched this Data Quality Project , the total amount of duplicated data was reduced from 30% to 10% . I consider it a success . <p> You cant regulate everything as well as set up rules for each activity of a salesperson as it will immediately influence employee satisfaction from performing activities in CRM or any other system . You always need to have 10% of freedom in choosing the way you want to work with systems . <p> To conclude , I would like to say that every rule you apply regarding the usage of a CRM system ( or any other ) should be dictated first of all from the business perspective not IT or any other , because the first and foremost reason of existence of CRM systems ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be more efficient , to be more client-focused , and to predict customers ' behavior . Without answering " yes " to at least one of those , it would be useless to implement any Data Quality rules ( or any other ) as there would be no business sense behind it . <p> In this article we covered entering data and data quality . In the next article I will cover Data Security as this is one of the most current trends in our digital world
