These structural components are defined as follows : <p> Career cluster : a grouping of occupations and broad industries based on a core of common knowledge and skills <p> Pathway : a broad subdivision of a career cluster leading to a number of related occupations <p> Occupation : one of several specific job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Several courses from one CTE program area may be chosen for completion in a coherent sequence , forming a concentration that prepares students for one or more occupations and supports additional education and training in the industry . Courses from various CTE program areas may also be combined in a program mix to enhance career goals . Course concentration sequences are identified in the CTE Administrative Planning Guide ( APG ) , found online at www.cteresource.org/apg/ . <p> A CTE completer is a student who meets the requirements for a CTE concentration and all other requirements for high school graduation or an approved alternative education program . Completers of certain CTE courses may be eligible for certification by an industry , professional organization , or trade association , or for licensure from the Commonwealth of Virginia . Completers may also be qualified to receive the Virginia Board of Education 's Advanced Mathematics and Technology Seal or its Career and Technical Education Seal and/or a student-selected verified credit .

Any tasks/competencies not designated as essential are considered optional and may be taught at the discretion of the school division .
