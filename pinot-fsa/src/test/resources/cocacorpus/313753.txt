The best advice I can give is to wear something in which you feel good and also comfortable . You do n't have to get all dressed up , but how you appear will leave an impression -- good , neutral or bad . Do n't wear anything that is provocative , unprofessional or sloppy . For guys : Wear a favorite shirt , khaki pants , maybe a sweater if it 's cold outside . For girls : Wear whatever clothes make you feel like a million bucks , such as a nice skirt , pants and a blouse or sweater . Everyone should wear comfortable shoes , but please no flip-flops . <p> Pull together some basic information about what kind of student you are , including your overall GPA , test scores , number of honors and/or AP classes you are or have taken , and a list of activities in which you are very involved .

Your goal in visiting different college tables is not only to get information , but also make a connection with the college admissions representative . You never know when a casual meeting with a rep could turn into a friendship or lead to his/her becoming an advocate for you in the application selection process . <p> When you arrive at the fair venue , get the list of colleges that are at the fair and mark on the college fair map where they are located . Decide how much time you want to spend with each of the colleges , allowing for more time at the schools in which you are most interested . Also , leave time to just wander around and stop by schools whose booths or information look particularly intriguing . <p> Introducing Yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college table or booth , sign the college guest book or sign-up sheet .
