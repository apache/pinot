The difference of the two appliances can be seen in the shape and design of their respective blades and containers . <p> Blenders are narrow and deep with a small and fast fixed blade , making them more suitable for pureeing softer ingredients- and liquids. - Depending on the strength of the blade and power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include in frozen drinks and smoothies . <p> They have wider bowls and sharper blades- designed for chopping tougher products , and their various disc attachments allow for slicing and shredding capabilities . In summary , use a blender for milkshakes and smoothies . Use a food processor for just about everything else ! <h> What size Model do I need ? <p> - The size of unit you choose should depend on the complexity of your everyday cooking needs. - There are essentially three sizes to choose from : full , compact , and mini . The bowls on full-sized units- generally have a volume between 9 and 13 cups . <p> You 'll find full-sized , commercial-grade processors- in professional restaurant kitchens where they are used for a variety of prep tasks. - Serious home cooks may also consider full-sized units , especially those who regularly prepare meals for their large families or get-togethers . <p> Compact models are appropriate for casual home cooks and those who may not have the counter or storage space all the appliances he or she wants ! - Mini models are perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ultimately , if you invest in the largest size available with the most powerful motor- you will yield the best all-around results . <p> What do I have personally ? Well , I have a full-sized unit but on the smaller side . We have a fairly small kitchen and counter space is a premium ! It is n't as bad as when I was in an apartment ( my single days ! ) but we do n't have room for a 14 cup unit . <p> My 9- cup unit does the job and it is rare that I ever wish I had the 14 cup model . We just do n't make that much food very often . <h> What is the pulse function used for ? <p> Pulsing is an important technique " one of the primary - tasks. - Pulsing involves turning the motor on and off in short , quick bursts. - This function gives the ingredients- being processed time to fall down near the blade in between each pulse ' as to avoid inconsistencies in texture . <p> In general , pulsing allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prevent it from being over-processed in one , continuous blade rotation ( like a blender ) . For instance , when making salsa you 're better of administering 4 " 5 one-second pulses to process the tomatoes to prevent from- turning them into a liquid consistency . <h> What types of accessories do I need ? <p> All sorts of accessories are available . The biggest advantage over blenders is their acceptance of a variety of attachments- for handling different prep tasks. - The standard components of all models are the motor/stand , shaft , and bowl/lid . <p> Both the standard blade and any extra attachments fit over top the shaft once the bottom bowl is fitted and locked into place. - Attachment blades and discs are most often made of metal to retain their sharpness and durability , though plastic blades and attachments are also available . <p> The standard blade is the Sabatier , or S-shaped blade. - The Sabatier blade rests at the bottom of the bowl and consists of two curved blades on either side of the shaft that form an S ' shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disc-shaped and rest at the top of the bowl over the shaft . The cook pushes food down the feed tube where it is shredded , sliced , or julienned by the disc before falling into the bowl below . <p> The different holes and grooves on these discs may process fine or coarse bits of ingredients- depending on its intended use. - If not already included with your model , the following attachments may be separately purchased- to give your machine more versatility : <p> Egg whip " two open paddles that create air to whip fluffy eggs and cream <p> Keep in mind that attachments are usually only available for full-sized units . <p> Some compact models may include a few attachments that fit the bowl of that particular sized model , but very few mini models will include attachment blades . <h> What safety features are important ? <p> They are relatively straightforward in terms of operation , but there are a few aspects to pay attention to in terms of safety features. - The first thing is the safety lock that keep the bowl and lid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents while processing . <p> Not all models feature safety locks , but those that do should feel solid and snug if made from quality materials . Another safety feature is a place to store the power cord within the base of the appliance to prevent it from being damaged or severed when not in use . <p> Most models include a plunger to help push the food down the feed tube towards the blade or disc attachment . Plungers are designed to force the food into the bowl without coming into contact with the blade or disc , and are thus much safer to use than a kitchen utensil or your fingers . <h> What should I not process ? <p> Though they are generally capable of processing harder and tougher ingredients- than blenders , there are certain things- that food processors are n't good for. - They include : <p> Mashed potatoes " starch in potatoes yields gummy consistency <p> Whipped cream " result is stiff and could turn to butter ; best suited for mixer <p> Egg whites/meringue " same as above : result is stiff <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hand <p> Meat loaf " will over-process and result in a dense finished product <p> Coffee " suited for mini processors only ; larger bowls will create chunky grind that sticks to the side ; coffee must be ground fine <p> Ice " too hard and risks dulling the blade ; best suited for blenders <p> Soup " bowls often too small to prevent spillage ; best suited for blenders <h> What is a food chute and what is it used for ? <p> Some versions come with food chutes integrated into the lid that allow you to process ingredients- in quantities beyond the capacity of the bowl. - Models with this feature allow you to continuously push materials- through the feed tube and create a homogenous mixture that exits the bowl into an external vessel. - This feature allows you to shred cheese , puree fruit or vegetable juice , and mix soups in larger quantities than the volume of the bowl . <h> What do the best versions incorporate ? <p> - With processors , like any kitchen appliance , you typically get what you pay for. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models with powerful motors and solid construction . <p> A few things to look for when buying include : <p> Solid , heavy base that wo n't move on the counter <p> Sturdy bowls and strong blades that lock in place and remain secure <p> Ease of assembly " some models do n't start unless every piece is aligned and/or the plunger is in the feed tube <p> Wide feed tube " narrow tubes require more pre-chopping <p> Quiet operation " mini models tend to be louder <p> Warranty protection of appliance and motor and ease of service <p> Easy to clean removable parts and base controls <p> Can I make bread dough in one ?

It probably has to do with what your family uses ( We drove Fords around here ! ) <p> These are all Wagners I got them for $13 ! <p> Let 's take a brief look at the history of these companies . <h> A brief history of Griswold <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , because it was a joint venture between Matthew Griswold and his cousins Samuel and J.C . Seldon . The company was founded in Erie , Pennsylvania near the Erie Canal . The company originally manufactured only light hardware , but expanded their operations in the 1870s to include cast iron cookware . <p> In 1884 , Mattew Griswold bought the Seldon brothers interest in the company and in 1887 the company name was officially changed to Griswold Manufacturing Company . Matthew Griswold Jr . took ownership of the company from his father in 1905 . In 1914 , he turned the company over to his brother , Marvin . Under Marvin 's leadership the company expanded its operations to begin selling their products globally . <p> By the 1940s , the quality of the cast iron the company produced had begun to diminish . In 1946 the Griswold family sold the company to Wagner Manufacturing Company . Finally , in 1957 the Erie plant was closed . <h> A brief history of Wagner <p> Wagner Manufacturing Company was founded in 1891 by two brothers , Bernard P. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first produced only cast iron wares , but soon expanded their operation to include nickel-plated products and became the first manufacturers of aluminum cookware . <p> When the company bought Sidney Hollow Ware in 1897 , another brother named William H.

This curiosity is fueled by a universal passion to understand the world and its many inner workings , as well as to have a good smoker so they have good food ! <p> A pioneer in the field , Benjamin Franklin , carried out the risky experiment that discovered lightning was electricity. - Nearly a century after , Thomas Edison was acclaimed for discovering the means needed to provide light . This discovery opened society to a much brighter world and better-smoked meats and vegetables , lit by Edison 's incandescent bulb . Electric smokers were not one of the initial goals or Mr. Edison or Franklin but I 'm glad they helped out !

Modern application of smoking meat was made possible by curious minds to follow . <h> Primitive Smoking Methods to Today <p> Although smoking meat is considered a serious craft or hobby of many modern Americans , this historically primitive practice began out of necessity . Normally , people would cook in simple huts , which featured little ventilation . When the people realized the smoky atmosphere affected the flavor of their drying meats , they began to intentionally practice the art of smoking meat . <p> After people discovered the usefulness of smoke , they began implementing a combination of smoking and brining in order to cure meats for preservation . Not until modern times did we see smoking of meat for the purpose other than preservation .

This is important . <p> Properly trim and season the meat to your liking , with your seasoning of preference . Make sure to include an acidic ( citrus components are always good ) element in your marinade when cooking in an electric smoker . The acid will help assure you the tenderest meat possible . If you are able , let this marinade sit overnight ( 8 hours minimum ) for the fullest flavor . <p> Today is cookout day ! Make sure to power on your electric unit and fill its water pan fully .

Then get ready for a tasty treat . <h> Tasty Smoked Treats <p> Meat : Stop by your favorite butcher shop or local grocer and select the winning beef brisket of the evening . A meat with a little fat is just fine and actually better than a cut without fat . The fat adds flavor and makes the meat tender . Once you get your brisket home , it is best to leave it out to warm a bit ( room temperature ) until suppertime . Cold meat on a hot surface tends to lose all of its tenderness and moisture before even properly cooking . We recommend rubbing your room temp brisket down with Texas-style seasoning , packing flavor with chili powder , garlic , paprika and many other spices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will certainly have a smoky and successful evening .

Go ahead and add seasonings of your choice to the beer ( garlic , onion , hot sauce ) , we especially recommend garlic , onion and vinegar as good additions . Once your beer-can concoction is complete and totally prepared , the tricky part is balancing the chicken in your barbecue box . Go slow , be careful , and be steady ! After about 3 to 4 hours of smoking time , you will have a succulently smoked chicken . Yum , yum . You can even smoke a turkey ! <p> Pork : Unsure of what to do with your rack of ribs ?

You will love it . <p> Fish : Pick up the catch of the day or pull some filets out of the freezer for deliciously smoked fish . The night before smoking fish , you must brine it , letting the fish lay in a shallow pan of salt water overnight , refrigerated . The next day , allow the fish to dry for about half an hour before placing the fish in the smoker . Make sure the surface of the smoker is well greased so the delicate fish does not fall apart .

Leaving fat on the meat will guarantee great smoked flavor and the fat burns off in the barbecuer- anyway ! Fat is good . <p> Try changing up your flavor palette by experimenting with juices or produce in the water pan of the smoke unit . This water will be heated in the chamber , infusing the meat . Orange juice is an excellent and unusual choice . <p> Letting your meat rise to room temperature and rest after smoking are equally important elements to the actual smoking of the meat .

Electrical barbecue units- utilize power as an appropriate source of heat for many reasons . The major reason electrical smoking is so suitable is there is no fretting over goods like gas , wood , or charcoal .

Let 's take a look at some of the differences between the two models .

If the color matters to you , that seems to be the main difference between the two ! <h> Differences <p> The Chef 's Choice 120 model has a pre-sharpening stage , which is used for very dull knives . In theory , this should mean that the 120 should sharpen dull blades a little faster than the 130 , but comparing them side by side , I 'd say the difference is minimal . <p> The 130 has a steeling stage , which means that it creates tiny serrations on the edge of the blade , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge . This edge helps when cutting tough fibrous plants or meat . The 120 uses a flexible strop for the sharpening stage , whereas the 130 uses combined honing . <h> Colors <p> While both come in a variety of colors , the choices differ between the two models . <p> The 120 is available in white , black , platinum , brushed metal , chrome , and red . <p> The 130 comes in white , black , platinum , brushed metal , and green . <p> Now that we 've seen the differences between these sharpeners , let 's take a look at what both sharpeners do well . <p> The 120 and 130 each weigh four and a half pounds , which gives them a very sturdy feel without being cumbersome . Both are a modest 10 inches in length and four and a half inches in width and height . Additionally , these sharpeners are fast ! If you 're creating an edge on an extremely dull knife , the process takes approximately one minute . If you 're doing regular maintenance , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere 10 seconds . <p> The three different stages of abrasives progress from coarse to fine grit abrasives to return even extremely dull knives to a level of sharpness that exceeds its original factory edge . The first stage is a diamond abrasive , designed to add bite to a very dull edge and prepare it for further sharpening . The second stage is finer grit diamond abrasive . If your knife is not extremely dull , you can start sharpening at this stage . The angle changes slightly to provide a durable beveled edge . The final stage uses the finest grit abrasive using a patented material to create a surgically sharpened edge . Chef 's Choice stands behind both products with a three year warranty . <h> Conclusion <p> The Chef 's Choice 120 and 130 are both excellent knife sharpeners . Both models are amply prepared to put a quality edge on a variety of different cutlery . <p> The differences between the two models are , truthfully , pretty minute . <p> Some users may prefer the honing disks of the 130 over the ceramic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different feel , it 's entirely a personal preference . <p> If I had to pick one , I 'd go with the 130 simply because I cook with a lot of fresh vegetables and I prefer a steeled edge . <p> If you 're trying to decide between the two , you may also wish to take a look at the different color options . If your kitchen has a green colors scheme , for example , you 'll probably want to go with 130 . <p> Both of these knife sharpeners are well-made units that will last for years and put a quality edge on a variety of blades .

Now you can find American and European-made Japanese-style blades as well as traditional European styles manufactured by Asian brands . <h> What 's the Angle ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you probably do n't pay much attention to the specs of your kitchen blades . <p> Most people pick a practical assortment of affordable knives and hope they are sharp enough to get the job done and built to last . <p> That 's okay , but even the most novice of cooks should be in possession of some kind of knife sharpener and know the degree to which each blade in the drawer should be sharpened . <p> While specialty knife makers have come up with varying degrees of blade angles intended for different functions , most kitchen knives are sharpened at facets of either 15- or 20- , for a total angle of 30- and 40- , respectively . <h> American/European blades- <p> Standard American and European kitchen knives are double-beveled and sharpened on both sides of the blade at 20- facets ( 40- angle total ) .

The fact is that both 20- and 15- faceted blades can be sharpened to equal perfection and perform precisely as intended while holding their edge . <p> However , since 15- blades are typically thinner and lighter , they do create less friction when cutting and slicing " but that is not to say that they are actually sharper .

Western-style knives are sharpened to a 20 degree angle , whereas Japanese knives are sharpened to a steeper 15 degree angle . Expand your knowledge on the importance and variety of knife sharpening angles here . The reason many chefs appreciate Japanese style blades is because this angle creates a noticeably sharper edge . This means speed , accuracy , and less effort to cut through through fibrous foods . <p> One consideration to keep in mind , however , is that because of this steep angle , Japanese knives will become dull a bit sooner than their western counterparts and need to be sharpened more often .

Since most chefs have at least one or two wester angle knives , this let 's you avoid buying a separate knife sharpener and meets all your sharpening needs in one unit . It is capable of sharpening almost any kitchen knife , including those with serrated edges , such as steak knives and bread knives . <h> Specifications <p> The 15 Trizor XV is a solidly constructed sharpener . It weighs 4.6 pounds , making it sturdy but not unwieldy . It 's also fairly compact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up too much space on your countertop . It is available in a brushed metal or platinum finish . <p> Due to the high quality abrasives it uses , this sharpener removes a minimal amount of metal from your knives . This means that it actually extends the lifespan of your knives as opposed to other electric knife sharpeners . <p> The metal dust is then trapped in a magnetized dust collector , which is easy to access and clean . The abrasives actually create micro grooves in the edge which act as tiny serrations and add bite and grip to the cutting edge of the blade . This is especially helpful in cutting fibrous vegetables or even meat . <p> Let 's take a look at the three sharpening stages of the Chef 's Choice 15 Trizor XV electric sharpener . <h> Stage 1 <p> The first stage , known as pre-sharpening , is used to restore a precision edge to extremely dull blades .

This stage uses flexible abrasive stropping discs , removes very little metal from the knife , and creates a surgically sharp edge . This is the stage to use for knives with serrated edges as well . <h> Sharpens 15 and 20 degree angle knives quickly <p> The Chef 's Choice Trizor 15 XV electric knife sharpener is my top pick among 15 degree angle knife sharpeners .

It is also true that by using high quality diamond abrasive discs , the Trizor removes less metal and extends the life of your knives . If you own expensive kitchen knives , it is important that your sharpener is of the same quality . I also like the fact the Chef 's Choice stands behind this product with a three year warranty . <p> After your knives have been sharpened do n't  forget to store them in a safe and secure location which limits and nicks or dulling of the blade .

They are simple , yet used for a variety of culinary tasks on a daily basis . But the very cutting edge that we rely on " and the source of the knife 's power " is nearly invisible to the unaided eye , a reason why we seem to take these trusty instruments for granted . <p> The majority of kitchen knives are flat ground , meaning the blade begins to taper from the spine to the edge . However , knife edges come in a variety of styles " differences in the way the blade is ground to make it sharp . <p> Fortunately , learning just a little bit about your knives and their various edges will teach you how to best maintain them and keep them sharp . <h> Knife Edge Styles <p> Every knife blade is ground uniquely to form a sharpened edge . Each side of the blade that has honed an edge is referred to as a bevel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knives , you should notice a part at the very edge that angles more steeply " this is the bevel . <p> If you look closely at the blade of your kitchen knives , you should notice a part at the very edge that angles more steeply " this is the primary bevel . Most of the time people refer to the Edge Angle " see the image below . Typically , this is about 15- to 25- for kitchen knives . See the best 15- knife sharpener . <p> A hunting or pocket knife maybe closer to 25- to 30- since the wider less sharp angle provides more durability to cut things . <h> V-edge <p> The V-edge is the most common style for kitchen knives. - Like the letter V , these blades slant directly from the spine to the edge at a symmetric angle . <p> V-edges are the preferred design for most kitchen knife makers as they are easy to sharpen and hold their edge longer , though durability is sacrificed in favor of a fine edge . <h> Double bevel or Compound Edge <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is essentially a double-layered V-edge . Picture a large V with a smaller V on top of it . This is my favorite overall . Its sharp and durable . <p> The secondary bevel , also known as a relief angle , serves to make the metal behind the edge thinner . In principle , a thinner-edged blade has a greater cutting ability given its lack of friction " but it is also more likely to sustain damage . <p> The idea behind a double bevel is to make the edge stronger and more resistant to rolling and cracking with the support of the secondary bevel . <p> A couple Chefs Choice knife sharpeners work this way " The M1520- ( click to see a review ) - and the M120- ( click to see a review ) for example . <h> Chisel edge <p> Chisel edges are most commonly found on Japanese sushi knives like Santokus and Nakiris . <p> These blades are only ground on one side to form a single primary bevel , while the other side is left straight and flat . For this reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and right-handed varieties . <p> The edge is usually sharpened between 20- and 25- , which comprises the total angle of the edge ( the flat side has an angle of 0 ) . - Such an acute angle makes chisel edges exceptionally thin and sharp compared to most American and European knives . <h> Convex edge <p> Convex edge blades feature two outward arcs that slope in and intersect at the edge . The resulting look of the edge resembles the slope of an airplane wing . <p> The curved design puts more steel behind the edge , making it stronger and sharper than V-edged blades . <p> Since the creation of a convex edge is a bit more sophisticated than others , they can be more difficult to sharpen effectively with home sharpeners . Because of this , convex edges often lose their shape and are eventually shaved down to V-edges . <h> Hollow edge <p> These blades can get very sharp , but the limited steel supporting the edge makes them more susceptible to damage . Hollow edges are usually reserved for hunting and survival knives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but most quality kitchen sets will feature a stronger V-edge . <h> Serrated edge <p> Like chisel edges , serrated-edged blades are ground on only one side . The distinguishing features of serrated edges are the mini-arches , or teeth , that serve to protect the actual cutting surface and keep the edge sharp . <p> Serrated edges are typically reserved for bread knives , tomato knives , and steak knives . The wavy edge of the blade puts greater pressure on the product being sliced , but the flat grind makes for a sharper and more precise cut . The complexity of the edge makes for a near impossible sharpening process . For this reason , serrated edged knives are best replaced after losing the cutting effectiveness . <h> Granton edge <p> Knives featuring a Granton edge are easily identified by the hollowed out grooves on the surface of the blade . Granton-edged blades typically utilize a V-edge design , but the grooves on the bevels of these knives give them a unique slicing quality . <p> These blades can achieve thin and even slices without tearing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fats and juices .

I personally eat meat . However , I mix it up every now and then , and try to eat a vegan or vegetarian diet for a few days .

I love those creamy spuds , but you do n't  need a metric ton of them ! <h> Thawing <p> Another part of planning ahead is thawing your turkey then brining it ( if you are brining ) . The right way to thaw a turkey is in the fridge or in a cooler that 's at 38- , or at least under 40- . It takes longer " yes " but it keeps the bird out of the danger zone . <p> Plan about 24 hours for every 4 pounds , so a 16 pound bird will take about 4 days in the fridge . <h> Brining <p> It takes about 8 16 hours to brine . If you have n't done it before , it seems a tad overwhelming , but it really is n't so hard . Just make sure you have the space to brine , like a 5 gallon bucket .

No one likes dry turkey ! <h> Leftovers <p> Get some " to-go " or reusable containers so people can take home leftovers in a simple way . ( Reusable containers are preferred to reduce waste , of course . ) Heavy duty zip top freezer bags always come in handy , too . <p> If you 're hosting folks of all different dietary ilks , you can easily accommodate their needs with simple , but delicious sides that can be vegan , gluten free , and dairy-free . <p> I love roasting brussels sprouts with maple syrup for a tasty touch , making truffled mushroom risotto that can double as a main , stuffing acorn squash with quinoa , spices , and currants for an elegant side that can double as a main for veggie-folk , and making vegan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional type is a breeze when you use garlic , unsweetened coconut milk , and vegan margarine and spices . <p> Or , if cooking to accommodate dietary needs is too overwhelming , ask everyone coming to your table to bring a signature dish to share .

You can create an impressive traditional and tasty meal that will knock the socks off your guests and all you need is a little pre-planning . <p> My advice is to start the preparation early and figure out anything you can make ahead of time such as side dishes , sauces and dips .

You may even have to wiggle the leg into position . The larger the slit , the more chance of a leg popping out , and your truss disappearing . <p> Once you 've mastered this technique , you 'll never return to string again .

The high points of the serrations touch the material first , giving those points higher pressure per area than if the same pressure was applied to a plain blade . This allows the serration to puncture more easily . <p> Additionally , serrations are typically chisel-ground into the blade , meaning they are thinner ( and thus cut better ) than the comparable plain blade. - Chisel-ground just means that one side of the blade is sharpened to an angle , like 25- and the other is flat .

This can be extra fine , fine , medium , coarse , or ceramic . The fine grit will provide a good cutting edge and will sharpen at a good rate , for most knives The coarse grit is optional for a faster sharpening rate on very dull serrated knives . The extra-fine and ceramic grits will provide a polished edge . <p> We recommend using the coarse first , then the medium , and last the fine sharpener for a typical serrated knife . <p> Next , match- the cone diameter of the sharpener to the size of the gullet ( the serration ) .

A burr is formed during the knife sharpening process as metal is drawn up and up over the edge of the tip of the knife . It can also be felt on the opposite side that you are sharpening on by running your thumb , carefully , up and across the edge . <p> The burr is important because it shows you are making progress and that you are sharpening in the correct location .

In my opinion this is a great safety feature . I mean the last thing you want is that hot turkey slipping off your counter top ! <p> And yes , the heat resistant silicon covered handles go into the oven with the rack . From my research the handles are rated to handle up to 500 degrees faranheit . <p> I really like this basic stainless steel roasting rack .

This is the only drawback I can see and I still recommend using the same caution you would with any hot object . <p> The silicon is BPA-free so do n't  worry about any toxins seeping into your food . And its rated to handle 500 degrees F. <p> And because its all silicon , nothing will stick to it . This is great if you hand wash your dishes . There are no more grubby pieces your you to scrub off after you 're left to clean up the dirty dishes . <p> And if you 're the dish washer kind of cook , you 'll like the fact that this rack is safe to pop in your dish washer too . <p> You can probably tell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to find fault with it . <p> But , nothing in life is perfect . <p> So its worth mentioning that the area of the turkey touching the silicon , will brown slower than the rest of the bird . <p> But , it wont be raw .

Of course using something abrasive like a kitchen scourer is a no no . <p> And if you like to pop your kitchenware in your dish washer , you 'll be happy to know this one is 100% safe to do so . <p> The rack itself is v-shaped with sturdy sides and solid fixed handles .

Which tells me the non-stick coating on the roasing pan is high quality . <p> From my research , the rack does a great job of evenly browning turkeys , chickens , pork and beef roasts . <p> Something that popped up over and over with other customers it the poor coating of the rack itself . - There were many complaints that the coating on the rack started to peel after only a few uses . But from my research the last of these complaints were a few years ago . <p> Overall I think the All-Clad Roaster with Rack is n't a bad option .

Adding a smoker to your arsenal of meat-preparation appliances is sure to elevate your cooking game , and earn you some high marks among your neighbors when barbecue season rolls around . <h> Why should I buy a smoker thermometer ? <p> Did you know that your smoker is only as good as the thermometer reading its temperature ? Nothing 's worse than a faulty smoker thermometer reading 200- Fahrenheit when it 's actually 450- Fahrenheit . Instead of going outside to a succulent roast , you find a charred and unsalvageable mess . Your dinner is ruined and now you have to order pizza ( or make it yourself ) . <p> Like the temperature readings on a conventional oven , smoker thermometers attached to the unit are likely to display temperatures that differ from the actual temperature . I 'd recommend you do n't go by just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a few degrees off , which could be the difference between delicious and destroyed when it comes to smoking meat . <p> In order to keep a watchful eye on your prized meat , it 's important to invest in a thermometer that is both reliable and durable . You 're going to need a thermometer that will stand the test of time , while still delivering impressively fast and accurate results . <h> What should I be looking for in a smoker thermometer ? <p> Since we 're modern human beings , I definitely recommend you spring for a digital thermometer . Digital thermometers are highly accurate and usually render a reading within seconds . <p> Any BBQ enthusiast will tell you that smoking meat at home can be a messy process . A waterproof and splash-proof thermometer is a must " you never know when a big hunk of meat might splatter you with grease as you 're checking its internal temperature . <p> If you have a waterproof and splash-proof thermometer , you 're guaranteeing a decently long lifespan . Not only will the thermometer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , it 'll also be able to repel the water from a passing rainstorm if you happen to leave the thermometer outside . <p> Since you 're now a barbecue fanatic , consider investing in an instant-read thermometer for your smoker and the smoked meats inside .

The answer is : not as much time as you would think . <p> Sometimes the default thermometer gives inaccurate readings . <h> What makes a really good smoker thermometer ? <p> If you 're considering taking your meat-smoking skills to the next level , you 're going to need some top-notch equipment to bring you from zero to meat hero . A smoker thermometer worthy of your time will be digital , have dual probes ( one for the internal temperature of the meat and one for the temperature inside the smoker ) , and will have remote capabilities so you can smoke a hefty rack of ribs while you 're watching the game . <p> A high-tech smoker thermometer might also have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain thresholds .

It could also save you from any variables that might make the smoker get too hot . <p> If you 're planning on smoking a cut that needs to be cooked low and slow overnight , you might consider a thermostat controller thermometer for your smoker . A thermostat controller works by having all but one of the smoker 's air intakes closed . A fan is hooked up to the probe of the thermometer and can regulate the temperature inside your smoker by adding oxygen to fuel the fire . <h> Do I have to be home while my meat smokes ? <p> In the days of yore , smoking a cut would have meant being tied to the task for a whole day , if not overnight .

As you slice into your first perfectly smoked turkey or a juicy prime rib , you 'll be glad you did . <p> You might also want to consider picking up an infrared thermometer for grilling .

In a traditional oven , heat is generated from the top and bottom of the oven to cook the food . Convection ovens , instead , have a fan that helps to improve internal air circulation . This reduces those potential cold spots that sometimes develop . The exhaust system removes moisture from the oven so food becomes crispier and develops an even brownness . - Faster cooking times and more evenly-cooked food is always going to be a winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of adjustment . You 'll find that the time and temperatures you are used to need to be altered slightly to get the best results . As a rough rule of thumb , lower the standard temperature by 25- F , or reduce the cooking time by about a 10% to 15% . For large items , like a chicken or loaf of bread , this reduction needs to be increased to about 20% . <h> Oven-baked cookies , convection-style ! <p> The greatest benefit when using a convection oven is that , owing to the dispersion of the heat , you wo n't need to rotate or move your cookies as much . The whole oven is heated evenly , so you can make use of all available shelf space . No more situations where the top shelf cookies burn while the middle ones are undercooked ! Also , you 'll find that your cookies turn out a little crispier because of the exhaust system removing excess moisture . <p> As air circulation is all-important , keep this in mind when looking at cookie sheets .

It 's durable , and a good aluminum tray should last the longest with heavy usage . They also tend to heat up consistently and evenly across the sheet . <p> With this option , you 'll need some cooking oil or parchment paper to prevent your cookies from sticking to the bottom . Instead of oil , you can also buy reusable silicone and fiberglass baking mats that are easy to wash . <h> Material : Carbon Steel <p> This is a popular option , but steel is not a great heat conductor .

There 's also some evidence that , when exposed to high temperatures , they can give off gas containing the chemicals that they have been coated in . <h> Recommended cookie sheet for convection ovens <p> A rimless baking sheet is ideal for cookie making in convection ovens . <p> Considering all these factors , my top recommendation for a cookie sheet for convection ovens is the T-fal AirBake Natural 2 Pack Cookie Sheet .

However you go on to say , " If any food debris is left , clean it with soap and a sponge " , which is TOTALLY WRONG ! ! ! You should only clean any seasoned cast iron with water and a stiff scrubber . I personally use a kitchen sponge with the scrub pad on one side with warm , not even hot , water . You can also use a copper scrub pad if absolutely necessary as long as you do so very very gently so as to NOT scrub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NEVER USE SOAP EVER ! ! ! If you have tough stuck on food in the bottom of a pan add some water and put the pan back on the heat to soften it up until it comes off but be sure , as always , to thoroughly dry the pan afterwards . I place mine over the heat on a burner , if I 'm home , to dry the pans , or over the fire if camping , to make sure they are dry of all water as rust is an enemy of cast iron . After all the cleaning and drying is done I apply a little cooking oil , wipe off as much as I possibly can with paper towels , and put the pans back over moderate ( medium ) heat for about 5 minutes then let them cool before storing until I use them next . PLEASE NEVER , EVER , USE SOAP ! ! <p> Additionally , if you store pans with their lids place a toothpick or small folded piece of paper between the lid and pan to allow air to flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rust inside with lids left on tightly possibly because they were not 100% dry , but keeping a very small space between the lid and the pan will help avoid this problem . Enjoy your cast iron , I know I do . <p> You might want to tell people not to use plastic scrapers , like the Lodge scrapers you recommend , in hot pans . Slightly warm , like a pan you can handle with a bare hand , is alright , but you do n't  want people melting plastic onto their cast iron pans .

@@107475361 @2875361/ <h> Selecting the best knife sharpener under $50 <p> When you 're shopping for any knife sharpener , it 's important to understand the basics of how sharpeners work .

In electric units , the abrasives spin so that the blade can be sharpened more quickly , sometimes in a single pass . If you 're on a budget , however , manual sharpeners are the way to go . <p> They are generally less expensive than their electric counterparts and perform every bit as well , albeit with a little more effort on the user 's part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about 2 minutes , and if you only need a small touch up , then it only takes about 30 seconds .

Today is your day . <p> There are , of course , some secret tips to producing a fantastic grilled pork loin . And , as we all know , secrets are meant to be shared ! <h> Step 1 : Choose your cut <p> The first is to make sure you have a pork loin . I know , it sounds obvious , but stick with me ! Pork loin and pork tenderloin may sound similar , but they are different cuts of meat . Both of them come from below the spine on either side of the pig , but tenderloin is the most tender cut on the whole animal .

One way to do this is by brining . <p> Brining helps to break down the thick muscle meat and allow the meat to stay moist , even when grilling . A basic brine recipe for pork is a quart of water , a quarter cup of salt , and a quarter cup of brown sugar . <p> You can also add spices , chopped garlic or onion , or even a dash of molasses or brandy . <h> How to brine your loin <p> Adjust the recipe to make sure your entire loin is submersed .

Leave in the refrigerator overnight . <h> Step 4 : Preparing the loin <p> Remove the pork loin from the brine solution and pat dry with paper towels . Prepare a paste by mincing five or six cloves of garlic , then drag your knife across the minced garlic , pressing and pushing down firmly with your knife . Work in a bit of oil and some kosher salt and ground pepper . <h> Step 5 : Grilling the loin <p> Let 's get grillin <p> Place the loin on the high heat side of the grill and cover with a sheet of heavy aluminum foil or a disposable aluminum roasting pan turned over .

Even although you might not need it . <p> The water tank is removable so its easy to fill up and it can hold 24 oz of water . <p> This espresso machine runs on a pump system and it has a thermo block . This means it heats up fast . And according to the Nespresso the Pixie heats up in 30 seconds and you 're good to go for a delicious brew . <p> Of course , its got the standard LED light indicators . So you know what where your machine is in the process of heating and brewing . And to give you a heads up when the tank needs refilling . <p> Tip : High quality water will improve the aroma of your espresso. - If you can , use filtered or reverse osmosis water . <p> And remember the folding drip tray I mentioned ? <p> Well its not just a space-saving design ! <p> It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup or lungo . And its as simple as lifting the drip tray and hitting the correct button which is clearly marked . <p> Also , you do n't  need to remove the used capsule after each use . The Pixie can hold up to 10 used ones . A nice feature if you 're a lazy coffee drinker like me ! <p> I like the Pixie . But like with anything , there are a few gripes I have . <p> I 'm old school so I like pulling my espresso with freshly ground beans . And the Pixie wont let me ! This is a deal breaker for me . <p> But you might prefer the idea of pods . If you do , the Pixie wont mind ! <p> Also , there 's no frother . I 'm not too phased about this because this is an espresso machine , no a cappuccino maker . <p> Espresso is meant to be enjoyed black ! <p> But I know a bunch of people who would love the choice of both . If you 're one of those people , the Pixie is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most worrying problem I 've noticed <p> A lot , and I mean A LOT of customers have complained about a mysterious leaking . <p> Apparently , its not from the tank . So it might be a flaw in the design or some machines were made on a Friday ! LOL ! <p> Okay , granted , not all customers had this problem . And Amazon is really good about issuing refunds . So my advice is , try the machine out immediately to make sure your machine does n't  leak . <p> Overall the Nespresso Pixie Espresso Maker is a great little machine with features I like . Youll have your first hit of caffeine while reading the headlines before work . <p> Its definitely worth considering but its not the cheapest . <p> Its also got a 1 year warranty which you can rely on if something goes wrong . Just make sure you register your machine on their website as soon as it arrives . <p> A nice touch is when you buy this machine you get 16 complimentary pods . So you get to experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decaf is not included with the free pod collection . <p> From my research I 've found that a few customers complained about the leaking water tank . Although this seems to be a trend with ALL espresso makers . The tanks do n't  seem to fit as snug as they should . <p> But a couple of reviewers gave a very simple solution . Just give it a little bang and it pops into place . <p> Not ideal I suppose , but who has n't  banged an appliance into submission before ? <p> Another issue is people have noted that the tamper included with the machine is rubbish . <p> But seriously ! Who actually uses a tamper ? I 've never seen one used on my trips to Italy . If the Italians do n't  use them then why should we ! <p> In my house we just use a soup spoon . Does the trick perfectly . And it avoids compacting the grind too much . <p> The frother also got a lot of people complaining its too short . Okay granted , this can be a pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one reviewer rightly pointed out that in Italy a cappuccino is a shot of espresso with a tiny bit of foam . So of course they use only a small frothing pitcher . <p> If you own espresso shot glasses they will not fit under the spigot . This is something some customers were not happy about . <h> Saeco Poemia Top Espresso Machine <p> The Saeco Poemia is by far the smallest espresso machines made by Saeco . And its also in the most affordable price class . <p> The machines body is made from plastic with a stainless steel casing . Which is a standard design with all non-commercial home espresso machines . <p> Its a nice looking machine thatll make you feel like a barista in your own kitchen . <p> Like I mentioned the Poemia is the smallest machine Saeco makes . But its not a sissy ! It stands 12.6 inches high and weighs a whopping 10 lbs . <p> So unless you want a warm up workout before your caffeine boost , you 'll need to give this espresso a spot to live on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home espresso makers the Poemia has a 15 bar pump . There 's no pressure gauge so you cant see this . <p> But its not really important . As long as you 're getting 9 bars , you 'll be pulling perfect espresso in seconds . <p> The Poemia has a 42 oz water tank and it runs on a pump system which means it heats up super fast . And its got all the must-have lights to let you know where its at with heating . <p> Its worth mentioning that you ca n't brew and steam at the same time . <p> And if you want to switch from steaming to brewing you 'll need to flip the dial to brew and cool it down . <p> The machine does all the hard work by pulling cold water from the tank . <p> It only takes a few seconds and voila ! <p> You 're ready to brew . <p> But , my favorite design feature is the portafilter system . So what does that mean ? <p> Well , it means your grind does n't  have to be perfect to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not fine enough . <p> But the portafilter will compensate for this . Nice touch if you ask me ! <p> Also , you do n't  need to tamp your coffee because the portafilter does it for you . But if you like the nuances of making coffee there is a tamping tool on the back of the scoop that comes with the machine . <p> So , if I 'm talking about tamping then it means this machine can handle ground beans and pods . I love this feature too ! <p> And to top it off its got a double and single basket for brewing . So you can make 2 espressos at the same time ! <p> Just remember this machine does n't  turn off automatically . So keep en eye on it or your drip tray will be filled with coffee . <p> From my research I 've noticed that most customers are happy with the quality of the espresso they pull from this machine . <p> But there have been a few complaints and they are all rather similar <p> First , more than a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . <p> But , a buck gets ten they did n't  read the manual properly . If they did theyd know there 's a tiny pin hole on the frother which is where the air gets sucked in to froth the milk . <p> If that pin hole is blocked , you wo n't get any air injected into the milk and so no froth will develop . <p> Sticking with the frother here , it is a little tricky to get a frothing pitcher under it . And once your milk is frothed its even harder to get it out . So stick with a 12 oz pitcher and do n't  over fill it and you 'll be golden . <p> Similar to the DeLonghi EC155 I picked up complaints about mysterious leaking . <p> But in general , most of the complaints were about the machine suddenly dying and no longer working after a few months . <p> Although its a very reasonable price , there 's no way around this , its a deal breaker for me . <h> Mr. Coffee Automatic Dual Shot Espresso &amp; Cappuccino System <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just got a button for pulling espresso and one for frothing . <p> Easy as pie to operate and you still get that barista feeling . I like easy as pie ! <p> Its a decent size standing at a height of 11.42 inches . And it weighs almost 9 lbs . So , if you have a small urban kitchen , but if you love your espresso , you 'll make a plan ! <p> It also has a 40 oz water tank which is pretty big for this machine . <p> As standard with these home espresso makers this one by Mr. Coffee has a 15 bar pump system and a thermo pressure block . <p> In a nutshell , this means it heats up fast . You can have a single shot of espresso ready in 20 seconds flat . And for a double shot , 40 seconds ! <p> Yup , that 's pretty fast in my book . <p> And it scores a couple of brownie points there . I mean , it just torture to wait around for that first fix of crema in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has what it needs to do the job the way its meant to be done . So I 'm not too phased that it does n't  work with pods . <p> I 'm a freshly ground kinda gal . So if you like to make your java fix with pods look at something like the DeLonghi EC155 instead . <p> And yes , it has all the lights you need to know when its ready and when its on the steam or brew setting . <p> The portafilter comes with a single or double basket so you can pull a single or a double shot for yourself . Or pull a shot each for you and your significant other ! <p> But one of the main features I love is the fact that the frother rotates away from the machine . This might sound like a silly thing for me to get so excited about . <p> But its not <p> Because this is where most other machines fall short . Its usually near impossible to get a decent sized froth pitcher into place . But like I said , this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frother without spilling . <p> I also particularly like the frother because its a standard one . And in my opinion , this makes a much better froth than the pannarello of the Saeco does . <p> Like taking your java on the go ? - Check out the best thermoses for work and hunting ! <p> I 'm a gadget geek and this is a small feature I 'm going to geek out over . But <p> The spoon this machine comes with has 3 functions . Its a scoop , its a tamper AND you can use it to take apart your frother to give it a good clean . <p> A clean frother is essential to making that lush froth so I think this handy tool is a nice touch . <p> I also like tha fact that this machine is automatic . This is a nice feature for me since I get sucked into the news headlines and sometimes forget I 'm pulling my morning fix . <p> So if you do n't  like ending up with soupy watered down espresso and an overflowing drip tray , you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a lot about this espresso and cappuccino machine from Mr. Coffee that I like . <p> But from my research there are a few complaints worth mentioning here <p> Some customers had the bad experience of getting a machine that was DOA . Of course Amazon has great customer service and you 're guaranteed of a replacement . <p> There were also a few complaints about leaking . But I 'll bet its because the water tank was not placed into the machine correctly . So just make sure the tank clips into place and you 'll be fine . <p> Also , if you tamp your grind too much , it will affect the brewing . So you 'll need to experiment there . But if you 're an espresso connoisseur like I am , you know its all about experimenting ! <p> All-in-all I like the Mr. Coffee automatic Espresso and Cappuccino machine . <p> You can pull one shot or two . Its got an amazing frother . There are no annoying dials to turn this way and that . And a 40 second wait for a double shot of espresso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doubt , you get so much more from this machine that what the price suggests . So in my opinion its a definite contender as one of the best , cheapest espresso makers worth buying . <p> Its a simple and easy to operate machine and it makes a great espresso . <p> Like the DeLonghi , its got the kind of frother I like to make light puffy froth . And as a major plus point , its more flexible than the DeLonghis so you wont struggle to squeeze your pitcher under it . <p> 20 seconds to pull a single shot and 40 seconds for a double is a big winner in my book . <p> The reason its second on my list is because it does n't  have the versatility of the DeLonghi . You do n't  have the option to use pods for those lazy mornings . <p> That 's not a problem for me . But with the DeLonghi , you get that extra choice in the same price range which I think is great value for money . <p> And Mr. Coffee also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're new to the luxurious world of home brewed espresso . <p> here 's a cool how-to video on how to make the best froth <p> Third on my list is the Nespresso Pixie . The only reason its number three is because it only takes pods . But if that 's your thing then the Pixie is for you . <p> Also , its not the cheapest of the bunch I 've reviewed here . But its one of the most affordable Nespresso machines . It also comes with a 1 year warranty and 16 Nespresso pods to get you experimenting . <p> In all honesty , the Saeco does n't  even make my list . But I guess I have to mention it here . I do n't  think its worth the money at all . <p> There are too many complaints about it being faulty and it sure as sugar ai n't  cheap . Its proof that price does n't  always equal quality . <h> Conclusion <p> Figuring out which espresso machine is worth your money is daunting . There are so many choices and wading through the specs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and you 've got a pretty good idea of what 's value for money and quality . <p> Now you 're armed with everything you need to shop with confidence and choose the best espresso machine for you . So you 'll be pulling shots of espresso like the barista in your favorite cafe . <h> How Does an Espresso Machine Work ? <p> Hot ( but not boiling ) water is forced under pressure through ground coffee beans to give an extra special flavor . <p> An espresso machine will use this process to produce a dark brown color and a satisfyingly creamy head or crema . Whether you plan to enjoy it black , or want to add some sugar and skimmed milk , having a coffee maker at home allows you to save money .

Wine made from grapes comes in two general categories , un-carbonated wine , and carbonated wines . The sparkling types , such as Champagne , fall into the second category .

Mead is a wine made with honey as its primary ingredient . <h> Winemaking 101 <p> After the harvest , grapes are prepared for primary fermentation . For red wines , the skins are kept with the liquid after the pressing . With white wines , the skins are removed at this stage . This primary fermentation takes between one and two weeks .

Next , a process called cold stabilization causes secondary malolactic fermentation . After these processes are complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fining . Preservatives are added at this stage before filtration and bottling . <p> Of course , it is the quality of the grape that is the most important deciding factor in the taste of the finished product . This quality can be affected by weather , soil mineral content and acidity , the time of harvest , and even the pruning methods ( this is often what 's referred to as terroir ) . <p> The United States is the fourth largest wine producer in the world after France , Italy , and Spain . <h> Home winemaking <p> People have been making homemade wine almost as long as they have been making homemade beer . On a home level , in North America , wine is made more than beer owing to cultural , legal , and production reasons . Part of the reason for such popularity is the ability to use indigenous fruits and vegetables . As long as a source of sugar is available , virtually any fruit or vegetable growing locally can be made into wine . <h> The history of home winemaking <p> When prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on home winemaking was left to individual states . Most states allowed it to take place . The legislative oversight on beer was much more strict . Making beer at home remained a violation of federal law until 1979 . <p> There was a huge surge of interest in home wine-making in the early 1970s . Small speciality shops sprang up across the states . After a couple of years , they disappeared almost as quickly as they arrived . One of the main reasons for this disappearance was because , apart from a few states such as California , consumers could n't easily access the quality ingredients they needed . <p> These days , home winemaking is making a comeback , especially in Canada . Its picking up steam in the United States as well . Part of this is because there 's a large demand for wines that are n't  produced using questionable farming techniques . <h> Wine kits <p> The introduction of boxed wine kits has also been helpful in encouraging home winemaking . A wide variety of wine types can be enjoyed this way . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these kits , however . Some are definitely better than others . For instance , if the second ingredient is invert sugar , then this will likely make the wine taste thin . Invert sugar is good for baking and perhaps country wines . Its not good for regular wine making because it leaves a tart aftertaste . The next thing to check is where the fruit for the wine you want comes from . Finally , if the price of what seems like a good quality wine is too good to be true , then it is . <p> The provenance of the grapes , and how they are harvested , makes a difference in how your wines will taste . <h> Corks for homemade wine makers <p> The type of cork you use to seal your wine bottles is crucially important . It can be the difference between producing a very good wine , or a very bad one . <h> Agglomerate corks <p> Wine making stores often stock something called agglomerate cork .

This is the cork most used by wineries . The use of top quality cork by wineries is supposed to help cut down on spoilage . However , about 5% of all wine produced commercially is spoiled . That is 1 in every 20 bottles ! This spoilage is attributed to a fungus on the corks . For this reason , many wineries are changing over to synthetic corks or metal screw tops . <h> Synthetic corks <p> Synthetic corks are a good option for you if you wish to avoid the problem of fungus spoiling the wine . <p> They are also cheap if you buy in bulk .

This means its quick-dry and prevents that ugly residue , we all dislike , from building up . <p> With the removable glass rack your glasses will dry without puddling . So no more unsightly spots on those beautiful Bordeaux wine glasses . <p> We all know how tricky it can be to stack pots and pans on the dish drainer . So , the bigger the dish drainer , the better . <p> The main feature of the SimpleHuman Steel Frame Dish Rack is its size . Its a monster ! Measuring in at a whopping 21.8 x 20.2 x 14.3 inches . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pans and lids , without them crashing down . <p> And if you need more space , just remove the glass dripper by simply lifting it off the rack . <p> You 'll also be happy to know the frame is stainless steel , which makes it rust proof . So no more rusting at the joins and corners like some other dish drainers . <p> My kitchen is where I go to escape and I like to keep it spotless . The slightest smudge or drop of water sends me reaching for a cleaning cloth . So I love the fact that this SimpleHuman dish drainer has a fingerprint-proof finish . <p> Cleaning the dish drainer is easy as pie too . A weekly once-over with window cleaner will do the trick and keep up the beautiful shine . <p> If you have low-set cabinets you might experience one drawback because the rubber attachments raise the SimpleHuman Dish Rack even higher off the counter . <p> Depending on the space available you might you need to remove the rubber attachments which could leave scuff marks on your counter tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks can easily be polished out . <p> And , SimpleHuman wo n't leave you high and dry if something does go wrong with your dish drainer . They offer a 5 year warranty on their dish rack . <p> With its large modern design , unique drainage system and stylish look , the SimpleHuman Dish Rack is a definite contender for best dish drainer for pots and pans . <p> The Zojila has by far the highest elevation at more than an inch . This means it plays nice with all overmount sinks . Even high lipped sinks like porcelain ones . <p> The Zojila Rohans dimensions are 18 x 13.5 x 7.5 inches . And it can handle 2 or 3 average-sized pots or pans and lids , as well as all your plates and glasses . <p> In fact , it holds 13 dishes , 8 tumblers or pots or pans . As well as 50 pieces of cutlery , making it ideal for a family kitchen . <p> If you 're cooking for a large family or a dinner party it also works well for those over-sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pots so I like the fact that even with heavy pots the Zojila Rohan wont tip over . <p> And you have the option of placing the drainer on either side of your sink and the rack is reversible too . <p> Nothing stays spotless forever , and the Zojila Rohan is no different . It will need a cleanup to keep its shine and remove mineral build up . I recommend a good monthly clean with a cleaning cloth and some window cleaner . <p> From my research I noticed that some reviewers have complained about a brown build up on the stainless steel . They have mistaken this for rust . <p> But these brown spots are totally normal especially in areas with high mineral content in the water . - Brown spots like these can be prevented and removed with a regular clean as I mentioned before . <p> Several owners complained about the poor design of the utensil holder . And the manufacturers listened . They redesigned the utensil holder and shipped out the improved version to all their customers . That says a lot about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner of the Zojila Rohan dish drainer you 'll get the new and improved version with your rack . <p> The manufacturer of the Zojila Rohan dish drainer believe in their product so much , that they offer a lifetime guarantee .

And with the lifetime guarantee , you 'll never spend another green back on a dish drainer again . <p> The Zojila Rohan Dish Rack is by far the number 1 contender for the best dish drainer for pots and pans . <h> Polder Advantage Dish Rack <p> Next in line is the 4 piece Polder Advantage Dish Rack . It comes with a dish drainer , drain tray , a sturdy cutlery holder with split compartments and a slide out drain tray for extra space . <p> Like all high end dish drainers the Polder Advantage Dish Racks design also features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drain perfectly , even over high lipped sinks like porcelain ones . And they also protect your countertops from scuffing and scratching . <p> The Polder Advantage Dish Rack is made from brushed stainless steel . The brushed steel makes it- quick dry , easy to clean and rust resistant . So it can take the punch when it comes to constantly dealing with water . <p> Both the drain trays are made from plastic and they slide out with ease , even if the dish rack is not completely empty . So no more fumbling around when you 're washing up and need more space . <p> The plastic lip of the drain rack hangs over your sink . And the large ribs allow the water to flow easily into your sink . And the plastic material of the drain rack means no more pooling of water . <p> The slide out drain mat also has a plastic lip so when you need that extra space you 'll also have the drainage you need . <p> Thanks to the elevation of the Polder , cleaning under the rack is simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rack is full . <p> Cleaning the rest of the Polder is just as easy . The top drain tray and cutlery holder are dishwasher safe . Only the rack and the extra drain tray should be hand cleaned . <p> In the past several reviewers complained of smaller items falling out of the sides of the rack . Polder paid attention to this and added an extra rail . Although , I 'd like to see at least 2 more rails added to the design . <p> One gripe I have with the Polder is the shallowness of the cutlery holder . I think this could be deeper because large cutlery like chef knives tend to tip out . <p> Also , some reviewers have reported making slight DIY changes to improve the elevation and drainage . In my opinion , for the price of the dish rack , it should come perfectly functional . So this is a drawback for me . <p> Although the Polder Advantage Dish Rack can hold a lot of dishes , from my research I 've noticed that larger pots and pans tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy cast iron pots , this could be a deal breaker . <p> Only the short side can be placed over the sink for drainage . So if you have tricky space around your sink , the Polder is not for you . - You should rather consider a dish drainer like the SimpleHuman dish drainer . <p> And lastly , if you have only 1 sink using the extra drying tray will be a problem because it needs its own sink to drain into . So you wo n't get the benefit of the extra drying space . <p> The Polder Advantage Dish Rack is my least favorite dish drainer for pots and pans . Yes , it has some great features , but none that you cant get with another drainer in the same price range . <h> PremiumRacks Professional Dish Rack <p> Next in the lineup of best dish drainers for pots and pans is the Premium Racks Professional Dish Rack . <p> This fully customizable dish drainer gives you a ton of choices to suit your needs . <p> Its designed with : <p> 2 separate draining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting board attachment . <p> a wide utensil holder . <p> a knife holder . <p> And everything can be moved around to fit in with the space you have available and the load of dishes you have to tackle . <p> The top shelf can be flipped , moved from front to back or- even completely removed .

So , they can hold large cutlery loads and also make the perfect space to store your sponges . <p> And a bonus is the knife holder has space for large chefs- knives as well as steak knives . <p> The feet elevate the dish rack off your counter top . This feature means no more annoying water on your counters . But unlike other dish drainers , this one does not have rubber stoppers that fit over the feet . <p> When you 're dealing with awkward pots and pans , size really matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want an inconvenient dish drainer taking up precious space on your counter top . <p> If you 're kitchen conscious you 'll be happy to know that the Premium Racks has a beautiful cool grey chrome finish .

This tray does not have a drainage spout . But the plastic used in the design is fast drying . Not one reviewer complained about this tray filling up with water . <p> But depending on how often and how many dishes you wash , you might need to empty it out from time to time . <p> The second tray has an innovate drainage design . In the center of the tray there is a rose shaped drainage system that guides the water to the spout and into your sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loads and the spouted tray for heavy loads like pots , pans and lids . <p> Also , the utensil holder can be moved front to back with the top rack .

But like I mentioned before , a good wipe down with some window cleaner will do the trick . Youll be happy to know that the extras like the cup holders , knife and utensil holder are all dishwasher safe . <p> The Premium Racks manufacturer also offers a 1 year no questions asked warranty on their dish drainers . I think this shows how much the company believes in their product . And how highly they value their customers . <p> One gripe I have with the Premium Racks Professional Dish Rack is the missing rubber feet . I think these feet are a must to protect your counter tops and to prevent slippage . Although reviewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this dish drainers stability . <p> The next issue is not a gripe per say , but if you have low positioned cabinets the height of the Premium Racks might be a problem . With the top rack in place the height is 17.5 inches which could restrict you when loading plates . <p> The Premium Racks Professional Dish Rack is my favorite choices for the best dish drainers for pots and pans .

Suggestions from other owners is a good clean once a week with Tilex or regular dish soap . <p> Because its small and compact , I do n't  think the OXO dish drainer will take the punch of a large household .

If you plan on injecting a lot of meat , this feature will definitely save you a few hand cramps down the line . This injector mechanism more closely resembles the handle of a squeeze bottle , rather than the uncomfortable basic-style needle injector . <p> If you are going to be entering BBQ competitions in the future , or foresee needing an injector that can handle industrial-sized jobs , there are also models equipped with a motorized or hand pump mechanism that can deliver a steady stream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that come along with hand-injecting larger cuts . <h> What other features should I be looking for ? <p> A sturdy meat injector will allow for countless flavor injections .

This will also be helpful if you are injecting a tougher cut of meat , as plastic can sometimes have a hard time moving through muscle fibers . <p> Keep an eye out for a model that is both durable and dishwasher safe , so you can rest easy when it comes time to clean up . <p> All in all , when it 's time to bump up the flavor below the surface , investing in a quality meat injector for your BBQ is definitely a step in the right direction .

@@107475476 @2875476/ <h> Why You Should be Using a Food Mill <p> A food mill is an incredibly useful kitchen utensil to have if you 're a frequent and committed chef , either domestically or professionally . Its perfect for those who want to expand the variety of foods that they can produce . The main functions of a food mill are to mash and sieve soft foods , such as tomatoes and potatoes . <h> What is a food mill ? <p> A food mill will typically consist of three parts . The bowl is where a soft food is initially placed . There 's also crank attached to a metal blade that rotates , which mashes the food in the bowl . <p> Perhaps most importantly , there 's a bottom plate with a sieve at the base of the bowl . When you turn the crank , food is forced through the sieve . The bottom plate can be a permanent fixture or removable , so that different plates may be used . Plates with bigger holes produce foods with different consistencies than those with smaller holes . Its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Typically , a food mill will have three feet to keep it firmly in place while you rotate the crank . At the rim of the bow are usually two ears and a handle , as with your standard cooking pot . <h> Types of food mills <p> Food mills are usually made from stainless or aluminum , making them sturdy utensils . However , smaller versions are often constructed with plastic . These smaller models are often intended for making baby food . <h> Why food mills are a better choice . <p> The food mill has bridged the gap between the sieve and the food blender , making for a highly efficient and useful piece of kitchen equipment . Some of the most common uses of the food mill include removing the seeds from cooked tomatoes for a tomato sauce and removing pulp from certain foods ( such like applesauce ) . You can also use them for making mashed potatoes or sp+tzle . <h> What should you look for in a food mill ? <p> When you set out to purchase a food mill , you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They may not be as versatile as a food processor or a blender , but there are many specific jobs for which a food mill is the absolute best option . <p> Focus on the material , size , and the discs . The best food mill will also be easy to clean . For example , plastic can leave a slight taste to sensitive palates , and it 's certainly not machine-washable . A plastic model wo n't last as long as a stainless steel food mill . <h> Consider buying a large food mill <p> A professional chef will always insist that you purchase a large food mill . It makes the most sense , as most of the foods you 'll put through it ( and most of the foods you produce ) will be in large batches . If its too small , you 'll have to make several batches of a smaller quantity . Once you have a food mill , you 'll never mash potatoes any other way . Potatoes can get pretty big , and you 'll want to be able to fit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make mashed potatoes with a food mill <p> Craving garlic mashed potatoes ? For that , you 'll need a large food mill . First , boil your potatoes and garlic until tender . Many chefs would use a blender at this point , but a blender ca n't create the light , airy texture you get with a food mill . Plus , with the mill , mashing and blending is all done in one easy motion . <h> ( Mashed potatoes with another ingredient ) <p> For mashed potatoes with chunkier additional ingredients , such as green or red onions , you 'll want to mash the potatoes separately using the food mill . <p> First , boil the peeled potatoes until soft . Now add your milk or butter to the food mill . Churn the potatoes using the crank . Again , I suggest using plates with smaller holes for a light , smooth texture . Stir in some salt and pepper . Then , once you 're potatoes are mashed , add in your finely chopped onions . <p> With this method , you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use a bottom plate with holes large enough to accommodate the onion , you 're not going to get a creamy texture . Of course , if you prefer chunkier mashed potatoes , then use the plates with large holes . You do you ! <h> How to make tomato sauce with a food mill <p> Many of us would claim that making tomato sauce is an easy task , but talk to anyone from Italy about making tomato sauce and theyll tell you differently . <p> Tomato sauce should taste like it was made from fresh tomatoes . It should have a vibrant color and a fresh and fruity flavor . Otherwise , you may as well just use canned . It should also have a sauce-like consistency , with sweet notes . This means cooking off much of the tomato 's natural water content and caramelizing its natural sugars to produce a natural sweetness . If you do n't  , the sauce will be thin and tart . <p> The best way to make a good tomato sauce is to boil the tomatoes for 10 minutes , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method allows pectin to make the sauce thicker and thus requires less reduction overall. - This process preserves the fresh flavor of the tomato , creating a fresher-tasting sauce . <p> Once the pulp is softened , put your tomatoes into a large food mill and pass them through the bottom plate . What makes the food mill so useful for making tomato sauces is that it removes the seeds and the skin , leaving only the desired flesh-turned-sauce of the tomato . <p> For tomato sauce , use a bottom plate with small holes to prevent the seeds from falling through . The seeds will add bitterness and tartness to a tomato sauce , which takes away from the freshness and sweetness developed during the cooking process . Add your top secret herb and spice blend , and enjoy the best tomato sauce you 've ever made ! <h> How to use a food mill for canning <p> Instead of buying your cousin another pair of socks , give them home-canned sauce for the holidays ! <p> Canning at home is a great way to save or make money with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food mill makes it that much easier . Many of us can our tomato sauces at home- and then use them later , or give them out as gifts . <h> Why can in large batches ? <p> Canning is a bit of a process , so always can in large batches to reduce the amount of work involved . Making a quality tomato sauce takes time and precision . It 's not worth canning just one jar , so commit and go all out ! Get a large food mill and several pounds of tomatoes . Go through the aforementioned steps to creating the perfect , fresh-tasting tomato sauce and run it through the large food mill . <h> How to can applesauce or jam <p> Preparing applesauce in just a few easy steps ! <p> Depending on how you like your applesauce , you might want to consider a food mill that comes with a bottom plate featuring larger holes . Such plates produce a slightly thicker , chunkier applesauce . The same goes for jams . <p> To make applesauce or jam , prepare your fruit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as you would when making tomato sauce . Once sufficiently soft , add your sugar , spices , and other seasonings to the whole fruits before you put it through the food mill .

The Weston is definitely a versatile machine . It has a generous two-quart capacity and it 's very easy to clean . This model is crank-operated and features a steel milling disc .

This compartment slides out and is perfect for utensils like spatulas , whisks , flippers , tippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with smart little dividers which help to organize your flatware in less space . - And the smaller , vertical compartment is perfect for can openers , vegetable peelers and even cheese knives . <p> OXO also added a fantastic feature by giving it a non-slip coating underneath . I love this because a pet peeve of mine is utensil holders that slide around when I open and close my drawers . <p> If you have particularly odd shaped drawers or narrow ones the OXO is ideal for making storage a breeze . - Because of the slide-out compartment it expands from 9.75 inches to 16.45 inches . The 3 horizontal compartments measure in at 14 x 2.5 inches and the 4th smaller compartment is 8.5 x 4 inches . <p> And the handy slide-out compartment is 10.5 inches when its fully open . But the beauty is you can slide it less if you have a smaller space . - With all these sizes , you can customize in any way you like , to suit your needs . <p> The OXO Good Grips Expandable Utensil Organizer comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divider is 9.75 inches and the larger one is 15.5 inches . - So you can pick the one that meets your organizing desires . <p> Although the OXO utensil holder is a smart space saver it can hold a surprising amount of flatware . This is because of the generous compartments and the genius dividers . <p> You have various options available to you . You can stack your flatware in opposite directions and use the dividers to keep them in place so no more playing hide-and-seek to find that elusive fork . Or you can remove the dividers to handle all shapes and sizes of flatware . <p> If you have fancy flatware with molded handles do n't  worry . The OXO will hold these perfectly even with the dividers . One reviewer organizes her chunky 12-piece Mikasa flatware set comfortably . <p> The OXO is made from lightweight molded plastic .

But even if you 're not , you 'll also love the rounded corners of the OXO . This design makes cleaning as simple as a quick wipe with a cleaning cloth because there 's no room for dirt to collect in corners . <p> OXOs cleaning instructions are to " wipe clean with a damp cloth " but from my research many reviewers are popping it in the dishwasher . If you want to do this , I suggest only using the top shelf and a low setting . This is not a guarantee that it wo n't get damaged , so its at your own risk . <p> The OXO Good Grips Expandable Utensil Organizer is a super addition to any kitchen . But like everything there are some drawbacks . And things that can be improved . <p> You might be disappointed to find out that the plastic dividers are not rubber coated . But I think this is a good thing . Rubber can be hard to clean and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grubby . <p> Although the OXO fits well into narrow drawers , if you have extra narrow drawers you might not be able to fully extend the slide-out compartment . But if you need just that extra space it still works well . <p> Another improvement I 'd like to see is a way to lock the slide-out compartment into place . Not being able to lock it into place does n't  affect its functionality , I just think itll be a neat feature . <p> The OXO utensil organizer is not your average kitchen accessory . Its versatility , durable design and modern look makes it something special in its class . And the extra slide-out compartment alone makes it one of my favorite drawer organizer for any kitchen . <p> Its designed with 5 dividers . It has 4 horizontal compartments and one shorter vertical compartment . - So you can sort and organize all your flatware like , knives , forks , spoons and even those handy kitchen gadgets . <p> Although this Bamboo Cutlery Tray is reasonably sized , its more suited for organizing flatware . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gadgets . But larger kitchen tools like chefs knives , spatulas and serving spoons will be too big . <p> Even with its compact design you 'll be happy to know it can handle a fair amount of flatware . Many owners of this product keep an 8 piece flatware set in this organizer , with room to spare . <p> A great space saving tip is to organize your flatware in opposite directions giving you even more room for organizing . <p> Like I mentioned before , the environmentally friendly material of this drawer organizer is what caught my eye . - Bamboo is sustainably sourced and renewable making eco-friendly . Its also FDA and FSC approved . <p> Cleaning the Bamboo cutlery tray is as simple as wiping it down with a clean , damp cloth . Utopia Kitchen says the organizer can be washed with mild soap and water . <p> One reviewer said she washes hers by submerging it in water . Although this works for her , I would n't recommend it . Because regular exposure to a lot of water could cause the Bamboo to swell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer divider . But its not perfect . There are a few drawbacks just like there is to anything . <p> In 2016 a reviewer commented on a strong toxic-like smell when he received his organizer . Another customer made a similar comment later in the same year . In all honesty this would have put me off too . <p> But in January 2017 another customer remarked on the feel-good , natural smell of the tray , and how her old drawers now smell fresh . And there have been no other remarks on a toxic smell . From what I can tell , the manufacturer is using nails instead of glue to piece the tray together . - Which accounts for the fresher , more natural smell . <p> Also , the width of the compartments are a little narrow . Which makes it tricky to reach down to grab something from the bottom . On the plus side , the length of the compartments are roomy enough to hold flatware with a longer design . <p> The Bamboo Cutlery Tray is well designed and sturdy . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as other drawer organizers . I think its ideal for a 8 piece set or less maximum a 12 piece set . Anymore , and it might start coming apart at the seams . <p> I 'm a fan of this Bamboo Cutlery Tray by Utopia Kitchen . It fits most standard sized drawers and can easily hold the everyday flatware for a family of 4 . And , if you 're eco-conscious , you 'll be happy to know you 're doing something great for the environment . While at the same time keeping your kitchen organized and beautiful . <h> Honey-Can-Do Steel Mesh 7-Compartment Drawer Organizer <p> Honey-Can-Do products are well known especially in the kitchen . This drawer organizer a straightforward divider with a few twists . - Its designed to be expandable and offers 7 compartments . The expandable compartments offer you space to fit just about any drawer . <p> The problem with such large drawer organizers is they often do n't  fit into regular sized drawers . But Honey-Can-Do have designed this one with a 2 inch low profile making it an easy fit . - And its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel . <p> This utility drawer organizers regular size is 16.5 x 20.2 x 16.5 inches . And it expands to a whopping 19 inches . This is a very useful feature . <p> If you need more space just expand it , if you need less just retract it . Whatever your space needs are you can pretty much get what you need with this feature . <p> With 7 different compartments when its fully extended you 'll have space for all your steak knives , forks , spoons , teaspoons and butter knives . And do n't  forget those elusive kitchen gadgets that disappear into big black holes . Youll have enough space to keep them close at hand . <p> Also , the tray can be separated . This gives you even more options in terms of how you want to organize your drawers . <p> The Honey-Can-Do drawer organizer is made from stainless steel which is great to fight off rust . Many reviewers have been using their drawer organizer for over 2 years with no rust issues . <p> Of course its up to you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a rule stainless steel is rust resistant . <p> And theyve powder coated it with material which is scratch resistant . The manufacturer claims it wont scratch your flatware , but in the long run , I have my doubts about that . Metal on metal will always cause some scratching . <p> As you can imagine , cleaning a stainless steel mesh tray couldnt be easier . The powder coating I mentioned earlier helps keep dirt and grit from collecting . But like anything if you leave it uncleaned for too long it will become sticky and gritty . <p> I recommend cleaning it with warm soapy water and a clean cloth . Its also best to let it air dry and then wipe down with a drying cloth . That way you can make doubly sure there are no drops of water hiding anywhere . <p> The Honey-Can-Do drawer divider does come with a few drawbacks through . <p> In 2015 one reviewer ended up with a ruined divider after putting it in the dishwasher . This may have been a bad batch or the reviewer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't recommend putting this organizer in the dishwasher . So , if you do n't  like hand washing , this might be a problem for you . <p> I think there will be a problem with knife and fork tips getting stuck in the little holes of the mesh . One reviewer did mention this . Although he found it very funny watching his wife try to pry the fork out . But jokes aside , this might irritate you . <p> Also , the expandable compartment are not joined in any way , so you can pull them apart completely to set up the way you like . Some reviewers found this to be a drawback , but I think this is a great feature . Giving you the freedom to arrange things just the way you like them . <p> The Honey-Can-Do expandable drawer divider is not a bad choice if you want lots of options in terms of space . Its well made and pretty tough if you consider some reviewers use it to organize heavy tools like hammers , screwdrivers and cutters . <p> But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my kitchen . I think its more suited to utility rooms , offices and garages . And I do n't  think its particularly pretty either . <h> A surprise inside every drawer ! <p> Like your drawers , this market may seem flooded with little difference in options . But look closer ! There 's a world of kitchen drawer organizers out there . It 's just a matter of finding the one that 's right for you .

@@107475505 @2875505/ <h> The Best Salad Spinners on the Market <p> We all could use more veggies in our diet . The thing is , preparing those veggies can be a pain . Ever go through the trouble of chopping up lettuce and preparing a salad , only to realize the leaves are dripping wet ? Never suffer soggy salad again ! All you need is a handy dandy salad spinner ! <h> What 's a salad spinner ? <p> Salad spinners are designed to dry your greens . They have all worked in basically the same way since two French designers came up with the concept in the 1970s . <p> A salad spinner has a perforated basket that sits inside a larger bowl . There is a mechanism , normally in the lid , that spins this basket around at high speeds . This action pushes the contents of the bowl to the side , where excess liquids pass through the perforation and collect inside the bowl . <p> After washing your salad , the spinner is essential to dry the greens . Why ? Because nobody likes soggy leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll find that salad dressings and oils will attach better and not just slide over your salad . <h> Designs <p> Salad spinner come in a number of designs . Let 's quickly run through them ! <h> Traditional <p> The traditional crank or handle requires the user turn the basket through a gear system by rotating a handle . The downside is that they can be cumbersome . For the frail , they may require too much effort to operate . <h> Pump <p> In a push or pump model , the spinner is operated through pushing down on a pump at the top . This is a very popular design . Usually , the pump can be locked down to make storage of the device easier . <h> Electronic <p> Industrial and commercial venues may use an electronically powered spinner . This can turn and churn far greater volumes of salads in one go . However , they are not viable for the domestic kitchen , owing to their price . <h> Material <p> While there are some metal spinners on the market , all the models I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to use , which make them great for the home kitchen . <p> The pump-operated version is a popular take on salad spinners . <h> The Best Salad Spinners on the Market <h> Progressive Prepworks Salad Spinner <p> For value for money , my pick would be the Prepworks salad spinner by Progressive . Its easy to use and has two different spouts to pour away excess water ( great for right or left handers ) . <p> Being a cheaper model , there has to be a drawback . For this device , it is the size . The capacity is really only enough for a maximum of two people . If you are preparing a salad for a large meal , then this is probably not the most efficient choice for you . <p> Also , while it does dry the lettuce , it is not the best for this purpose . It may take a big longer to get rid of all the excess water . However , it does what its supposed to , and can be cleaned in the dishwasher without affecting the functionality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buck , this might be the salad spinner for you . <h> Cuisinart Salad Spinner <p> The Cuisinart spinner is another fine choice . Its very good at drying , which is the most important thing . With only three parts , its also easy to clean . That said , the bulky handle can sometimes be a pain for storage if you 're trying to fit it into tight spaces . <h> Jobox Salad Spinner <p> The Jobox is another spinner that I liked a lot . First , and this has both good and bad points , is that its a 5-liter container . Great for big salads , not as great if you do n't  have a lot of space . However , the handle does fold down , which is a useful feature that makes it a little easier to store . <h> OXO Good Grips Green Salad Spinner <p> Universally , it seems this spinner is considered the best . I think so , and I 'm certainly not the only one . This model is dishwasher safe , which makes cleaning easy . The bottom has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance of your greens ending up on the kitchen floor . <p> The basket that collects the dried greens also doubles very nicely as a serving bowl , which is a feature I really like . In the past , there have been some complaints about a faulty spin mechanism , but during my testing , I found no evidence of this . All appears to have been sorted out in the OXO design rooms .

You can also easily control the nutritional value of the food without having to take someone else 's word for it . With todays baby food sharing the same problems that affect our own " namely the liberal use of additives , preservatives , and the dreaded high-fructose corn syrup " it 's nice to have the option of taking back control . <p> The downside , of course , is that modern parents have serious demands on their time . Work , looking after children , paying bills , and countless other tasks fill up your day , leaving little time left over for cooking .

You can also use an ice cube tray for this purpose . <p> Besides the obvious time savings , there are other advantages to freezing baby food in an ice cube tray . Most cube molds are just over an ounce , so measuring out the food when it 's time to defrost could hardly be easier . The fact that each cube can be used individually also means less waste than typically encountered when using commercial foods . <p> Ice cube trays are also versatile in that the trays can be emptied into freezer bags .

Just be sure to date and describe the cubes once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion ( and probably waste ) later . <h> How long can I keep baby food in the freezer ? <p> Like any other frozen food , baby food stored in the freezer will not keep forever . Six months is about the maximum . Ideally , you should aim to use it within one month . This will help keep the nutritional level high , because food gradually loses quality and freshness the longer it is in the freezer . This is particularly true of purees with a high water content . The water will crystallize during freezing and some vitamins and minerals will leach out upon thawing . <p> Many people ask about the quality of pre-frozen fruits and vegetables , and whether or not they are suitable to use in homemade baby food . While fresh is always best , the fruits and vegetables you find in your local supermarket are frozen in a very different way than you freeze food at home . Supermarket suppliers use liquid nitrogen to freeze produce almost instantly .
