@@20815826 @815826/ <p> History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear . The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds , from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany , with every player controlling a new rising empire from history . Some empires are stronger than others ( like the Romans ) , but the game 's clever mechanisms can help balance that out . At the end of each epoch , players score points for all units of their color ( from both the current and any previous empires ) remaining on the board . <p> This is the Avalon Hill version from 1993 and is complete and in very good condition .

My dad was in the movie business and passed away several years ago and had this set in storage for many years . Size range 's from 40mm-90mm . Serious Buyers only ! <p> Reasonable offers accepted ! ! ! <p> Here is what a chess collector/expert has to say about this very rare set : " ....... it is a good and early example of the casting art of the Early 70 's . There would be very few , apart from my work , of this quality . Also I feel that it may be of a very limited number and fairly unique . The characters I recognize are Gandalf , Saruman , Bilbo or Sam or Frodo or just a hobbit , Gollum , the dark Lord Sauron , orcs and trolls , etc . Suggest starting price , aimed at chess set collectors and advertised within that area in say on " e " or one of the chess chat sites , of around $1500usd plus ..... " Cheers Graeme Anthony
