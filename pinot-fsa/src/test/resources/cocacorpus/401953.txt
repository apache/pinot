Ways must be found because of the violent , acquisitive , alienated , industrial society which now poses a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality and the right and ability to determine their own development . Individuals must accept responsibility for themselves . Personal happiness and equality , as much as a good society , depend upon self realisation . The most vital factor today is a sense of true identity . This is lost because our identities are created by others - not by ourselves . The all-powerful externally created hegemony in this assumed-to-be-free society , and its internalised personal alienation , must be understood if self realisation can be achieved . <p> The starting point must be the " will to be the self which one truly is " . <p> There must be equality and effective individual participation in government and in every other group activity if self realisation is to be achieved . <p> The festival will be concerned with the search for the true nature of man and woman . <p> For many centuries the belief that man is inherently bad has exercised tremendous influence . Because of this belief , individual needs are suppressed and the result is that personal helplessness , lack of independence and the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trained to be self-denying , falsely modest , self-effacing and mechanically obedient . They are taught to suppress or hide their natural feelings and energy . <p> Social ideology is governed by contradictory altruism , by guilt and by the inability to experience work and action as a pleasure . This results in tendencies towards violence . But it is not the basic natural need of people that has a destructive and hedonistic outcome - it is the result of the repression of basic natural need that is violent and destructive . <p> The internal social crisis of today that results from these contradictions means that we must SHAPE THE ALTERNATIVES NOW . There is not just one alternative . The new society will be made up of the choices of multitudes of people - individuals and groups - who are determined to find a way out . No one can be excluded .

Email moderation is where one or more people can be assigned the responsibility to vet emails before they are distributed to list members .

@@104633001 @33001/ <h> Stickers for volunteers ? <p> One of the challenges of ConFest is getting more people to put in the two hours volunteering we all agree to do . I 've heard figures of around 7% of people actually doing this . <p> There have been ideas around , perhaps a refund of $10 from the ticket price , or a voucher for a cup of chai . These ideas were not well supported , because it undervalues the volunteers efforts and in fact legitimises non-volunteering - " Oh , I 'll just pay for my own chai , thanks " . <p> So I had an idea , and mentioned it on facebook , and so far eight people like the idea , so I 'm bringing it here . <p> When charities like the salvos have a street collection drive , they give out little stickers for people to wear on their lapel or whatever , showing that they have donated . This both let 's other charity collectors know to not bother those people , and also reminds others that the charity drive is on . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition for volunteering , which continues after the volunteer shift is finished . 2 . Allow repeat volunteers to wear several stickers for extra kudos. 3 . Gently remind people who have n't volunteered about it ( and maybe even get the message across to a few who are still oblivious ) . <p> It might also become a status symbol and thus make volunteering even more sexy than it is now . I might even wander through the market giving out random small presents like chocolates to people with stickers on . <p> What would it take ? We 'd need a fair few rolls of stickers - front gate , first aid , poo van , info desk , CIT , probably a few others I have n't thought of . We 'd need to design the stickers and get them printed . I could take care of that . It should n't be too hard , right ? I should be able to pay for them out of my own pocket , assuming they are n't too expensive . <p> Then I bring them along to ConFest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is senior in each area can be in charge of handing them out . Since they have no cash value , we should n't need to keep them locked up or anything . <p> The main issue I can see is where the naturists will put their stickers ... and will they stay on over mud ? <p> So , peeps , what do you all think ? Might it work ? Is it at least worth a try ? Feedback please ! <p> The main issue I can see is where the naturists will put their stickers ... and will they stay on over mud ? <p> So , peeps , what do you all think ? Might it work ? Is it at least worth a try ? Feedback please ! <p> A noble idea indeed . But it seems to me very few people actually volunteer at ConFest ; a figure of 7% quoted is terribly low ; abysmal perhaps . I read on the ticket it is $80 and 2 hours of my time ; I read that further as being 2 hours each day " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like being idle in a place like ConFest " certainly not sitting around all day in the Holy Cow ... <p> I do n't have a problem as a naturist where I would put a sticker or stickers , plural . Probably one on each asterisk for a start . Anywhere else ? <p> Great idea . We do need to promote the 2 hours per person . And raising awareness is an important part of this . <p> My solution to the naturalists is provide a choice of stickers or temp tattoos . This could also be combined with giving those on workers tickets wristbands so ppl know they are working their asses off to make it happen . <p> Villages should also take responsibility for organizing their members . If each village adopted a project and got all their members together not only would those member contribute it could be a social event with an environmental outcome .
