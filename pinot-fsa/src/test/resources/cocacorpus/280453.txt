In the context of intensive grassland production , sub-surface field drains can alter natural hydrological processes and may enhance the magnitude of peak flows , due to a faster rate of delivery from land to river . <p> A similar effect has also been noted for moorland drainage , which has been linked to increases in flood frequency . However , this influence is less certain as there is some disagreement in results between different studies , which are likely to be due to differences in soil type between locations and initial soil moisture levels . <p> In general , woodland resources ( a term which when used here , also includes small scale tree planting such as shelterbelts ) across the UK have increased since the early 1900s . <p> From a low of about 5% coverage , tree cover is now estimated to be in the region of 14% and 13% for Wales and the UK as a whole respectively . Even though woodland and tree cover has increased in the last century , Wales and the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average tree cover is 37% . <p> In addition to the losses of woodlands and hedgerows , numbers of in-field large or veteran trees have also declined as there has been little or no replacement after loss and limited potential for natural recruitment . <p> The loss of large vegetation across agricultural systems , and the influence this can have on hydrology , is perhaps the principal agent influencing the potential for flooding . <p> Planting trees and hedgerows can significantly increase water infiltration rate into soil and storage thereafter ... <p> How do hedgerows and woodland resources reduce the effects of flooding ? <p> The presence of woodlands and hedgerows can significantly reduce peak water flows through several mechanisms including increased evaporation loses ( particularly after canopy interception ) , increased water storage capacity of soils under tree cover , increased water infiltration potential , and decreased soil bulk density from the influence of root growth . <p> This has been comprehensively demonstrated by research undertaken at the Pontbren catchment in Wales , in a comparison study which has focussed on a landscape traditionally managed by sheep grazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planting of a shelterbelt of trees was shown to reduce flood peak magnitude by 40% , by increasing the rate of water infiltration which was shown to be sixty times greater where the shelterbelt was planted , thus decreasing overland flow rate which is considered to be key in lowering flood peaks . <p> Hedgerow planting also offers similar benefits for potential flood mitigation . Hedgerows are known to be efficient in the storage and slow release of water during heavy rainfall events , with 50 metres of hedge in a 1 ha field able to store between 150 and 375 cubic metres of water . <p> Hedgerows and trees can reduce soil water content from across a field system regardless of slope , by virtue of reducing the ground water content in the immediate vicinity of a hedge or shelter belt . <p> This leads to water being drawn in from the surrounding soil , initiating a gradient of flow towards the hedgerow or tree plantation . <p> Management and design are highly important for effective tree planting projects . Tree planting configuration can have a significant effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canopy interception rate . Research has shown that clumping trees together in a thicket of 5-10 trees may positively influence infiltration rate when compared to evenly spaced single trees . <p> The presence of livestock can also influence the size of effect in terms of flood mitigation , due to the compaction effects caused when animals gather around the base of trees for shelter and shade . <p> This behaviour may reduce or even eliminate any beneficial effect of the increased tree presence , as where sheep were present , infiltration rates and soil bulk density were shown to be similar to areas without tree cover . <p> This therefore indicates the need to fence around trees , either when planted in clumps or individually , to exclude livestock . Omitting this as part of any tree planting project for the purposes of flood management may significantly limit the benefits which would otherwise be expected . <p> This of course may limit the benefit to livestock of shelter from sun and rain , but may continue to provide shelter from the effects of wind chill . <p> ... This reduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is key factor in reducing flood peaks <p> Future management <p> The planting of shelterbelts and hedgerows has real potential to offer a land management approach which can reduce the impact of flooding whilst offering limited impact to agricultural production , as the planting scale required to achieve the results highlighted above is relatively small . <p> In addition , planting shelterbelts and hedgerows can also offer several associated benefits in both production and environmental terms , which could also be considered advantageous . <p> These results are also likely to be realised quickly as changes in the rate of infiltration have been observed to act in the short term ( 2-6 years of vegetation growth ) , thus rapidly buffering catchments against future high volume rain events . <p> In addition to this approach , strategies which incorporate the planting of trees with complementary planting of grass species such as Festulolium ( a hybrid grass with a large root system developed by IBERS and Rothamsted Research , effective at reducing runoff by improving water infiltration rate ) , may have even greater potential to limit the effects of predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date has provided positive indications of the influence of tree and hedgerow planting on factors such as water infiltration rate and overland flow potential , which are considered key factors in flood events . <p> This could form an effective part of a wider approach to flood risk management which utilises alternative approaches to land management and natural ecosystem characteristics to reduce the potential for flooding . <p> Whilst this presents one very promising approach for future flood risk management , further work is necessary to completely determine the broader influence on hydrology at the landscape or catchment scale . <p> This will require much cooperation with farmers and landowners working together with public and private sector stakeholders on catchment scale projects , to trial large-scale management approaches designed to reduce flood risk over the wider river catchment . <p> Dr William Stiles is a Knowledge Exchange Fellow from the Institute of Biological , Environmental and Rural Sciences ( IBERS ) at Aberystwyth University

" <p> Graph 1 <p> " When the cost benefits of the reduced black-grass are calculated , using data based upon work from Rothamsted Research , it 's clear that the real ' margin from spring barley far outweighs that of spring wheat , and is substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Ward points out that whilst delayed drilling can reduce black-grass by as much as 31% on average , he is keen to highlight that there is a big variation around the average . <p> " If for example , you have delayed drilling until the end of October and it 's a dry year , the black-grass may not have germinated yet . <p> " In a wet autumn , the black-grass will have come up earlier but then you are likely to be drilling into poor quality , heavy and wet seedbeds . " <p> " When you compare this against the 78-94% reduction you can get from spring cropping , it 's clear to see spring cropping has the most impact on reducing the black-grass numbers . " <p> Leaving a field fallow for one season is not going to have a significant effect on black-grass numbers , he continues . <p> " The data is compelling ; it shows that at least 18 months is needed to reduce black-grass numbers significantly , or that you should follow a fallow break with a spring crop .

" <p> " A competitive crop allows for better herbicide activity , without the crop it 's a numbers game , you get the same number of plants but with 2 or 3 times the tillers with bigger heads .

@@24549463 @4549463/ 39939 @qwx239939 <h> Alpacas guard the flock and keep the foxes away ! <p> On first appearances Alpacas seem unlikely candidates for taking on the responsibly of guarding chickens and sheep . However , as one commercial chicken farmer in North Wales has discovered , his two alpaca wethers ( castrated males ) have taken up the challenge and have made excellent chicken guards . <p> The Parry family live near Ruthin in North Wales and farm over 18,000 chickens producing free range eggs . It was common place for a fox to come near the chicken houses and as a result egg production would usually fall by more than 13% . That 's just by putting in an appearance let alone entering the chicken houses themselves . Foxes upset chickens , that 's a fact . <p> Brynn Parry saw some alpacas at a local farm and decided to investigate the potential of these wonderful animals . The simple fact is that foxes do not like alpacas and alpacas do not like foxes . The mere smell of alpacas is enough to keep foxes away . <p> Alpacas are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Parry family contacted Tim Hey at Inca Alpaca and decided to buy two wethers , Chico and Maximus . <p> Chico and Maximus were quickly delivered to the farm and were introduced to their 18,000 new friends . Within 5 minutes both wethers took charge and began to inspect their surroundings and look for intruders . The chickens took a couple of days to get used to their new protectors but now they go about their business as normal and Chico and Maximus have been accepted wholeheartedly as big brothers . <p> So much so that it is not uncommon to see hens sitting on the alpacas backs as they graze . <p> Maximus keeps guard <p> Brynn Parry says Since Chico and Maximus have been introduced to the business we have not seen a single fox around the chicken house and high level egg production has been maintained and therefore our profits have increased . <p> So where are alpacas from and why do they dislike our native foxes ? <p> Alpacas are from the South American countries of Chile , Peru and Bolivia , but are appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the outstanding properties of their luxurious fleece . <p> In South America , where alpacas have lived for thousands of years , they have several predators , one of them being the fox . The fox will take a weak or unwell baby alpaca ( known as a cria ) if it is unguarded . <p> As a result alpacas have developed an instinctive reaction to foxes . They have very keen eyesight and their ears can pick up the sounds of trouble from a long way off . <p> If a fox is careless enough to go near a herd of alpacas the adult alpacas will chase it away and if the fox is unlucky enough to get cornered they will trample it to death . <p> Alpacas have been used as chicken and sheep guards for over 17 years in Australia where there are over 150,000 alpacas producing a very fine , soft and elite fibre which is used in the luxury clothing market worldwide . <p> Their guarding potential was first realised when Australian sheep farmers , used to losing many lambs to foxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates . The foxes were simply being chased away and as a result more lambs reached the market . <p> The word began to spread throughout the rural community and soon alpaca wethers were being tested on small and then large scale free range chicken farms . The results were astonishing and it was not long before alpaca wethers were in high demand . <p> Here in the UK the alpaca has been used not only on commercial size chicken and sheep farms but also by hobby and small scale farmers . These otherwise gentle , inquisitive and bewitching animals are easy to look after and mix happily with their new families . Many farmers have alpacas as integral parts of their operations and are reaping the rewards as a result . <p> Alpaca wethers live for approximately 20 years and are very easy to keep and care for . Alpacas are very efficient grazers as they are classed as semi ruminants . This means that they do well on poor pasture and require no supplementary feeding other than access to hay all year round . <p> They require shearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and twice yearly deworming and vaccinating . <p> Alpacas , being non aggressive animals , can easily be halter trained and will not challenge or jump over standard sheep fencing . <p> In short the alpaca is a real solution to profit loss due to foxes and there are many livestock owners who will testify to that fact . <p> Organic egg producer Gerald Osbourne says alpacas have proven to be a highly effective way of protecting his hens against foxes . <p> Alpacas were introduced to his farm at Pewsey in Wiltshire in 2005 at the same time as he first moved into egg production " and the alpacas have succeeded in deterring foxes even when the farms other defences have failed . On one notable occasion a fox was seen inside the electric fencing erected to protect the hens , but it was driven off by the alpacas , said the Rev Osborne , who is an Anglican Minister as well as a farmer . <p> " Anything four-legged , dogs as well , they pursue and keep away , " he said . " They rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of the alpacas helps to keep the foxes away as well . We have still lost the odd hen to a fox but we have never had the mass slaughter you can get when a fox gets in and just causes mayhem . " <p> Mr Osbourne has 4,000 organic layers " all Columbian Black Tail birds producing eggs for Waitrose . They are housed in two sheds each containing 2,000 birds , and the accommodation was converted from the original Challow cow kennels that previously housed the dairy herd Mr Osbourne used to have on the farm . " They make ideal housing , " said Mr Osbourne . The farm also rears its own pullets . <p> Lawn Farm was an organic operation long before the introduction of the laying birds . The 1,100 acres comprises arable land , a beef unit and used to house a dairy unit , too . In 2005 Mr Osbourne decided to get out of milk and the cows were replaced by the laying birds . " It was n't really working trying to milk 8,000-litre Holsteins organically , so I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for a bit of manure and to replace the milk cheque . That 's when I contacted Stonegate and managed to get the CBT contract . " <p> The idea of using alpacas to protect the hens was suggested by someone at a local show . " I was n't sure how we would cope with them We have got nine strands of 9,000 volts like everyone tends to have but we got the alpacas at the same time , " he said . There are four alpacas protecting the layers . Another four have just been bought to look after the rearers . Mr Osbourne has clearly been pleased with the results . <p> He says that the alpacas have been very easy to keep . Apart from having the animals shorn " a gang of New Zealand shearers specialising in alpacas tours the country providing their services , care involves clipping their toes and filing their teeth . They are hardy animals used to the cold of the Andes so British winters are not a problem for them . During winter they will eat hay and alpaca meal ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the farm . " We have trees around . We were told that was all they would need for shelter . " <p> Mr Osbourne said the animals were placid ; very easy to handle . " They can be a little timid but if you need to handle them you just have two people at either end of a rope . From there they are easy to handle . " The alpacas on Lawn Farm are neutered males and cost about -400 each . Breeding animals can cost thousands of pounds and the better wool is to be found on breeding females , but the role of the alpacas at Lawn Farm is purely protection for the hens and Mr Osbourne says they have been very effective . <p> The four recent alpacas he acquired were obtained from Ivan Hayward , who farms on the border of Dorset and Wiltshire and who now breeds the animals . Ivan produces free range chicken meat on his farm - he has 30,000 birds producing regional chicken for Waitrose " and originally bought alpacas to try them out protecting his birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivan also got interested in breeding the animals and he has since enjoyed a fair bit of success in the show ring . <p> It was five years ago that Ivan , who has been involved in the chicken business all his life and is now 66 , first introduced alpacas to his farm . " We have got electric fences and all the rest of these things , but from time to time they fail and we thought that alpacas would be a good back-up . I had heard about them and talked to people about them and that 's how it came about . " He now has more than 50 alpacas . <p> " I got more interested in them and in the breeding side of them . I had looked at it myself and thought , What 's the sense of having neutered males when I could have some breeding stock for the same cost of looking after them and have a bit of a hobby out of it as well.
