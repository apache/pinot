@@80911300 @2411300/ <h> Celtic DragonsCeltic Dragons <p> The dragon has been a creature of myth and legend for centuries throughout the world . In his book , View Over Atlantis ( 1969 ) , John Michell says , " In every continent of the world , the dragon chiefly represents the principle of fertility . The creation of the earth and the appearance of life came about as a result of a combination of the elements . The first living cell was born out of the earth , fertilized from the sky by wind and water . From this union of yin and yang sprang the seed which produced the dragon . Every year the same process takes place " . <p> It may seem strange to speak of yin and yang , so obviously Oriental terminology , when speaking about Celtic life and legend . While the terms may be from the Orient , the concepts are not uniquely so . Michell observed how the ancient practice of Feng Shui in China contributed to the harmony of the landscape and the people . He also observed that geomancy had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially Druids , would survey the land for any activity ( i. e. building , festival celebrations , etc. ) they would speak of the ley of the land . Today we use that same term , although it has a related , but different meaning . Today when we speak of the " ley of the land " we often picture exactly how the hills roll or the shape of the river as it flows ; more of the concrete concept of how the land lays or actually and physically appears . <p> But to the ancient Celt , the ley of the land meant how the magic or cosmic forces flowed through and affected the area , or how the area affected those forces . The Celts believed that dragons were creatures of the parallel world and their power and presence would affect the ley of the land . " The places associated with the dragon legend , the nerve centers of seasonal fertility , appear always to coincide with sites of ancient sanctity " , Michell adds . <p> The path of the dragons , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ley of the land . IF there was a spot that the dragon crossed often , a spot where the veins crossed or a spot where the dragon would stop to rest , that became a spot of heightened power . Stonehenge is thought to be one of those places . In addition , some believe that the Celtic Cross surrounded by a circle is a symbol of the crossing ley lines and how the circle of life should be centered on that power . <p> King Arthur himself was burdened by dreams of dragons ; although it is unclear which color he saw . He saw them specifically at the time of Sir Mordred 's conception and before his death . He is eaten by dragons in his final dream and it is at his next battle that Sir Mordred kills him . It is said that when a king sees dragons there will be much ruin come to his kingdom and himself . <p> With the introduction of Christianity to the Celts came a change in the role of dragons . Some people even believe that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mainly because there is no record of them in the Celtic world until then . However , it is more probable that there was simply no written record of their existencethe Celts stories surviving by oral tradition . The " sudden " appearance of dragons when the Christians invaded can be easily explained by the meticulous effort Christians gave to written records . <p> The Apostalic Church was very good at taking local beliefs and using that belief for its own benefit . Take , for example , the story of St. George . Here the great power of the Dragon is turned into the power of the Devil . Traditional symbolism holds that St. George slayed the Dragon ( Satan ) to save the maid ( Christianity ) . It is also very convenient that the Celtic symbol was the Dragon . <p> Today the dragon is continuously popular amongst the Celtic revivalist , especially story tellers and craftsmen ; and we must not forget that dragons have never gone out of style for the Welsh , for it is their flag which proudly displays the Red Dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cychwyn , The Red Dragon Leads the Way .

Modern , tailored kilts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The little kilt , or phillabeg , or feilidh-beag , is actually an earlier predecessor of today 's modern kilt . Unlike a modern kilt , it is not a tailored garment . It is simply a length of tartan about 25 " wide and 4-6 yds long , loosely bunched or pleated , and held at the waist with a belt . It is worn to about the middle of the knee , just like any other kilt . One of the things that makes a phillabeg distinctive , is that it has a few inches of tartan flapping over the belt . This flap-over helps keep the belt in place " without it , the kilt might slip loose from the belt , leaving you standing in your skivvies ( or worse ! ) . <p> Phillabeg HistoryThe phillabeg can be traced historically back to at least the late 1600 's . The first evidence of any pleats being stitched down in the modern fashion does n't appear until 1792 ( actual kilt in the possession of the Scottish Tartan Society ) . You have probably all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who opened a factory in the highlands early in the 1700 's . It was very quickly discovered that wearing a Great Kilt in a factory was a bad idea , as they tended to get caught in the machinery and drag their unfortunate wearer in with them . Even still , the proud Scotsmen would not consider the thought of discarding their kilts , even to save their lives . Then someone came up with a great idea " they would just cut off the portion of their greatkilt above the belt , freeing them of their greatest hazard , while still allowing them to wear the whole kilt outside of work . This eventually evolved into today 's kilt and fly-plaid . This is a great story , and probably has plenty of truth to it , but the fact is the phillabeg was being worn prior to the events of this story . <p> More likely it was a simple convenience or economic consideration . The Great Kilt was actually constructed of two separate pieces of tartan stitched together lengthwise . Looms of the day were only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to 25 " probably being more common . So for a greatkilt , you wove 8 or 9 yards of tartan , cut it into a couple of 4- 4 1/2 yd lengths , then stitched them together into a single piece about 50 " wide and 4- 4 1/2 yds long . This became a very versatile piece of clothing - it could also be your blanket or tent when needed . But picture for a moment your stereotypical bachelor - is he really going to go through all that trouble when he could just grab a chunk of single-width tartan off the loom and just wear it ? For the lone bachelor , the widower , or the dirt-poor highlander , it just makes sense that the phillabeg would be a common choice . Being the least expensive kilt we sell , it 's a good choice for you too . <p> - <p> SizingA 4 yard kilt will fit up to about a 34 inch waist , a 5 yard kilt will fit up to about a 44 inch waist , and a 6 yard kilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are larger than this please contact us for pricing on larger kilts . Also , If your waist size is close to one of these limits , consider the next size larger if you want deeper pleats or pleats closer together . For example:If you have a 34 inch waist , a 4yd greatkilt will have pleats 1.5 - 2 inches wide and 3-4 inches deep . A 5yd greatkilt will have pleats approximately 1 inch wide and 3-4 inches deep or 1.5 - 2 inches wide and 6-8 inches deep .

Homespun tartan is woven 52 " -54 " wide. - It is woven by hand on old-world looms , and looks very authentic to what would have been woven historically . The yarn is worsted , but not spun as tightly as modern machine-made tartan . The cloth is also not as tightly woven . Homespun tartan will pleat by hand easily , but will not develop a sharp edge . Small snags , pulls , holes and other assorted blemishes are common . Because it is hand woven , these flaws are a natural part of it 's character . Homespun is approximately a 9/10oz. fabric , but feels thicker due to it 's looser weave . <p> Pleating instructions are included with each kilt .

Our- Ancient Kilts are perfect for Renaissance festivals , weddings , reenactment events , or a distinctivelook at your next Highland games . Depending on who you talk to , they may be historically- accurate or not , but our Ancient Kilt is much cooler and more practical than a Great Kilt for- hot weather wear . We recommend them to anyone looking for the Renaissance Highland look . <h> How is it different ? <p> The Ancient Kilt is basically a Phillabeg with an- extra 2-3 yards of tartan attached . This extra tartan serves as a sash- or fly plaid , worn over your shoulder once the kilt is pleated . An- Ancient Kilt is different from a Great Kilt because it is made from- a longer piece of single-width fabric ( 25-30 inches wide ) . This- means you do n't have the bulk of fabric above the belt that you- do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-width- fabric , 54-60 inches wide ) . <h> Delivery Time <p> Our Homespun Ancient Kilts are made-to-order from fabric that is supposed to be in stock . This makes it essentially a stock item , and we can usually get them made and shipped in a day or two . We try hard to keep homespun in stock . However , if the tartan you 've selected is temporarily out of stock , you may need to wait up to 8 weeks for delivery. - <h> About Homespun Tartan <p> This kilt is made-to-order in the USA from our Homespun wool blend tartan . Our Homespun tartan is made from a 55/45 blend of polyester and wool . It is woven by hand on old-world looms , and looks very authentic to what would have been woven historically . The yarn is worsted , but not spun as tightly as modern machine-made tartan . The cloth is also not as tightly woven . Homespun tartan will pleat by hand easily , but will not develop a sharp edge . Small snags , pulls , holes and other assorted blemishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaws are a natural part of it 's character . Homespun is approximately a 10/11 oz. fabric , but feels thicker due to it 's looser weave . <h> Cheater PleatsG <p> Pleating instructions are included with each kilt . Traditionally these kilts are pleated each time you wear them . We ask for size information to be sure that your kilt will fit you correctly , but we do not pleat the kilt for you unless you also select Cheater PleatsG- as an additional option . <p> Note " - Modern kilts are generally pleated so that the front apron of the kilt closes from left to right . For years this is how we 've Cheater PleatedG our Ancient Kilts . However , many customers brought it to our attention that this makes it difficult to wear the plaid over the left shoulder , which is also customary.So , we 've decided to make all Ancient Kilts the other way " front apron closing from right to left . This makes the aprons " backwards " compared to a modern kilt , but it allows the plaid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the way Mel wears it in the Braveheart movie . ) Incidentally , plaid over left shoulder is not a hard and fast rule . It most likely originated as a practical way to keep the plaid off your sword arm . If you are left-handed , you will probably want to wear the plaid over your right shoulder . Just let us know " we can Cheater PleatG your kilt either way you want ! <p> Depending on waist size , pleats will vary between one and two inches wide ( pleats will get wider as waist size increases ) . If your waist size is close to one of the limits above , consider the next size larger if you want deeper pleats or pleats closer together . <h> How to measure for your Ancient Kilt <p> Have someone help you .

It really looked like I had enough material for two or three kilts . After watching a couple videos on putting it on and searching around a little I realized I could have got the 5 yard instead of the 6 . So it is a bit more work folding pleats but I think it makes a truly awesome and always original kilt every time . It is too bad customs dinged me for another 40 bucks . Since mine has no cheats or buckles I should be able to avoid it since it is like a table cloth or just unfinished fabric . ( homespun ) .
