Threats to great apes in the country include common but dangerous practices like hunting for the illegal commercial bushmeat trade , mining , deforestation and civil conflict . In response to these threats , the Jane Goodall Institute ( JGI ) is leading a conservation action plan ( CAP ) in the eastern DRC , targeting 66 million acres , roughly the size of Colorado , where 35,000 chimpanzees and 2,500 to 3,000 gorillas live , along with elephants , okapis , bongo , leopards and nearly a dozen other primate species . <p> JGI works with communities , local government officials and NGOs alike to protect this critical habitat .

The unique subgroup of chimpanzees in Mali have adapted to very arid conditions , sheltering in caves to avoid the heat of the day and foraging at night . Little is understood about them . <p> While it is clear that this population needs to be protected , JGI also seeks to document and understand this unique population . JGI is working to establish baseline data about the population 's viability and conservation status , study their cultural and behavioral characteristics and to develop a plan of action with local partners to protect these chimps . <p> Senegal is home to a very special population of chimpanzees the last chimpanzees in northernmost Africa ( 200-500 individuals of the subspecies Pan troglodytes verus ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closest to the behavior of early humans , and is of exceptional importance to the international scientific community and global heritage .

This has caused devastating loss of habitat for great apes and other biodiversity .

JGI uses a variety of remote sensing data from very high 60-cm resolution satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe to 30-meter Landsat imagery from NASA/USGS/GLAD and recently UAVs ( Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ) to gain a bird's-eye view of the changes in forests , woodlands and human land uses from the village scale to entire ape ranges in Africa .
