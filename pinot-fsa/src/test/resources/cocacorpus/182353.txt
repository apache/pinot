For simple expressions you can then type in the expression and press the Enter key on your keyboard when done . More complex expressions may require that you use the buttons that appear just below the cursor after clicking on the dotted box . <p> NOTE : The worksheet will help you to avoid basic errors like entering an expression that is not syntactically correct . You must correct these popup errors before your answer will be accepted into the worksheet . The third video below show some examples of syntax errors and how to correct them . <h> Symbols and Functions <p> Aside from the basic operation symbols ( add , subtract , multiply , divide ) , the following are some other operations available in the worksheet : <p> Brackets and parentheses : ( ) . Round parentheses are always allowed , but brackets and braces may only be available for certain answers like intervals and sets . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use notation . If using the symbol , you may need brackets around the base or exponent to correctly represent the answer . <p> Absolute Value : Use the vertical bar on your keyboard , such as x . <p> Trigonometry and Logarithms : cos , sin , tan , log , ln ... These should be entered as you would normally write them , such as " sin(x) " . Be careful with inverses as to where you place the -1 exponent . <p> Constants and Greek letters : pi , theta ... These are available as buttons that appear when you are editing the expression . <p> IMPORTANT NOTE : All worksheets will let you perform basic operations like add , subtract , multiply , divide , and exponents . However , in general only the variables , functions , and symbols that are actually needed to answer the question will be available . For example , if you try to enter " y " as a variable and it is not accepted by the editor then you do n't need to use y in the correct answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " log " and for symbols like PI . If you think that you need a function or symbol and it is not accepted , then you should reconsider your answer .
