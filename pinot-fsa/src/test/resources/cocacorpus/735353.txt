The college is governed by a locally elected Board of Trustees and is responsible to the community it serves and to the State of Kansas . Dodge City Community College recognizes the existence of individual learning styles and is committed to providing quality instructional programs , student support services , and affordable lifelong learning opportunities . The college challenges students to initiate and maintain academic , technical , physical , spiritual , social , and personal growth . <p> The provision of higher education is a public responsibility . Therefore , Dodge City Community College recognizes the need to maintain a viable relationship with the community it serves . Furthermore , Dodge City Community College recognizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through responsible participation in the learning environment . <h> Strategic Plan <h> History of DCCC <p> Founded in 1935 , Dodge City Community College is the eleventh oldest institution among the nineteen community colleges in Kansas . It developed partly because of the Great Depression of the 1930s to give students a chance to extend their high school education or learn vocational skills at an affordable cost in a convenient location . It also developed because community leaders could foresee the long-range value of a two-year college as an educational , vocational , and cultural resource . <p> Originally , the college was a public junior college . In its first statement of " Purpose , " the college declared that its basic functions were " To serve the interests of students destined for specialization in the institutions of higher educationand to meet the needs of students interested in the terminal type of work or the semi-professional fields . " From the first , the college identified strongly with its community , describing itself as " the peoples college ... and available to all . " <p> Initially , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the University of Kansas . It was also a member of the American Association of Junior Colleges . The curriculum was restricted by todays standards but inclusive for the times . The college offered a range of general education courses and more specialized training in " Vocations and Professions . " In 1936 , the college graduated its first class , thirteen students . <p> The college maintained its identity as a junior college for many years , adding courses , programs , services , and certificates as local needs demanded . By 1957 , however , the college had outgrown its location on the third floor of the high school . As a result , the college moved to Dodge Citys old junior high building , currently the main offices of Unified School District #443 at 1000 Second Avenue . <p> In 1965 , the State of Kansas passed enabling legislation to make its junior colleges true community colleges . This meant that the college could have its own governing board , responsible for hiring a chief executive officer , approving a budget , and establishing college policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and services in even more direct response to local needs . Ford County voted overwhelmingly to accept fiscal responsibility for the college and elected a Board of Trustees in 1965 . A year later , in 1966 , the college was fully accredited by the North Central Association . <p> The first Board of Trustees began planning for a new campus almost immediately . Enrollment had increased again , this time enough to require an entirely new facility . Ford County endorsed a $2.5-million bond issue in 1966 , and in March 1970 the college moved to its current location . This change allowed the college to become more effective in its operations and gave the community a focal site for activities . <p> Since this move , the college has experienced relatively steady growth in nearly all aspects of its operations . In 1988 , several post-secondary education components of the Area Vocational Technical School transferred to the college , and in 1994 the college assumed responsibility as the Area Technical Center . This shift and increased enrollment have required expansion of facilities and programs overall . The college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The college has expanded its programs and services as well . It has created a system of outreach sites and centers , and it supplements the local outreach efforts of area four-year institutions .

It has greatly enlarged its adult education services and programs for non-English speaking students . It is also expanding to include current electronic technologies through the creation of a campus computer network and a fiber optic classroom to augment distance learning . <p> The history of Dodge City Community College demonstrates a real ability to change and grow . Whatever new challenges the college will face , it looks forward to the future role it will inevitably play in the lives of all of its constituents .

@@30319733 @4019733/ <h> About Us <h> History of DCCC <p> Founded in 1935 , Dodge City Community College is the eleventh oldest institution among the nineteen community colleges in Kansas . It developed partly because of the Great Depression of the 1930s to give students a chance to extend their high school education or learn vocational skills at an affordable cost in a convenient location . It also developed because community leaders could foresee the long-range value of a two-year college as an educational , vocational , and cultural resource . <p> Originally , the college was a public junior college . In its first statement of " Purpose , " the college declared that its basic functions were " To serve the interests of students destined for specialization in the institutions of higher educationand to meet the needs of students interested in the terminal type of work or the semi-professional fields . " From the first , the college identified strongly with its community , describing itself as " the peoples college ... and available to all . " <p> Initially , the college was accredited by the Kansas State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also a member of the American Association of Junior Colleges . The curriculum was restricted by todays standards but inclusive for the times . The college offered a range of general education courses and more specialized training in " Vocations and Professions . " In 1936 , the college graduated its first class , thirteen students . <p> The college maintained its identity as a junior college for many years , adding courses , programs , services , and certificates as local needs demanded . By 1957 , however , the college had outgrown its location on the third floor of the high school . As a result , the college moved to Dodge Citys old junior high building , currently the main offices of Unified School District #443 at 1000 Second Avenue . <p> In 1965 , the State of Kansas passed enabling legislation to make its junior colleges true community colleges . This meant that the college could have its own governing board , responsible for hiring a chief executive officer , approving a budget , and establishing college policies . It also meant that the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to local needs . Ford County voted overwhelmingly to accept fiscal responsibility for the college and elected a Board of Trustees in 1965 . A year later , in 1966 , the college was fully accredited by the North Central Association . <p> The first Board of Trustees began planning for a new campus almost immediately . Enrollment had increased again , this time enough to require an entirely new facility . Ford County endorsed a $2.5-million bond issue in 1966 , and in March 1970 the college moved to its current location . This change allowed the college to become more effective in its operations and gave the community a focal site for activities . <p> Since this move , the college has experienced relatively steady growth in nearly all aspects of its operations . In 1988 , several post-secondary education components of the Area Vocational Technical School transferred to the college , and in 1994 the college assumed responsibility as the Area Technical Center . This shift and increased enrollment have required expansion of facilities and programs overall . The college has recently remodeled or built structures across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services as well . It has created a system of outreach sites and centers , and it supplements the local outreach efforts of area four-year institutions . It has extended its offerings directly into local industry , making available work-related training and life skill courses . It has greatly enlarged its adult education services and programs for non-English speaking students . It is also expanding to include current electronic technologies through the creation of a campus computer network and a fiber optic classroom to augment distance learning . <p> The history of Dodge City Community College demonstrates a real ability to change and grow . Whatever new challenges the college will face , it looks forward to the future role it will inevitably play in the lives of all of its constituents .

@@30319755 @4019755/ <h> Will you need a loan to attend college ? <h> What is a federal student loan ? <p> Federal loans are borrowed funds that you must repay with interest . A federal student loan allows students and their parents to borrow money to help pay for college through loan programs supported by the federal government . They have low interest rates and offer flexible repayment terms , benefits , and options . Beginning July 1 , 2010 , all new Stafford and PLUS loans will be made under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program ( Direct Loan Program ) . In the Direct Loan Program , the U.S. government is the lender , and loan funds are provided to students through their school . <h> What is a private student loan ? <p> A private student loan is a nonfederal loan issued by a lender such as a bank or credit union . Private student loans often have higher interest rates and loan fees than federal loans , usually require a credit check , and do not provide the benefits of federal student loans . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a federal loan , look at the name of the loan : does it include the word " federal " ? If not , just ask the financial aid office at your school . <h> Why are federal student loans a better option for paying for college ? <p> Federal student loans offer borrowers many benefits not typically found in private loans . These include low fixed interest rates , income-based repayment plans , cancellations for certain employment , and deferment ( postponement ) options , including deferment of loan payments when a student returns to school . For these reasons , students and parents should always exhaust federal student loan options before considering a private loan .
