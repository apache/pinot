Speed limits provide notice to drivers of the maximum speed limit on a roadway and are an enforcement tool to assist police in separating violators from the reasonable majority . Roads are typically split into sections that have similar physical attributes . Please note that not all roadways are required to have speed surveys done to determine the speed limit . <p> This explanation discusses items in the order they appear in on the newer type of speed survey form we use , but the majority of the terms and elements are present on all speed surveys we have used in the past . <p> Description of Roadway <p> Surveys include a description of the physical attributes of the roadway including what roadside development is present . The number of lanes , length , and road curvature is also discussed in this section . ( Our newer surveys also include a map of the particular road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important part of the survey and data from this section is the major factor in determining the posted speed limit . <p> The most important number is the called either the critical speed or the 85th percentile speed . This speed ( we refer to it as the critical speed ) is the speed at which 85 percent of the vehicles sampled travel at or below . For example if we sampled 100 vehicles and the critical speed was 37 mph than 85 vehicles were traveling at or below 37 mph . <p> Other numbers given include the 50th percentile speed or median speed . This is the speed at which 50 percent of the vehicles sampled are traveling at or below . <p> The 10 mph pace speed is also listed . This is the 10 mph range in which the highest percent of the vehicles are going . For example if 100 cars are sampled and the slowest car was traveling 20 mph and the fastest 50 mph but 80 cars were traveling between 31 mph and 40 mph the pace would be 31 mph to 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Traffic Volume <p> Data is given for the average daily traffic ( ADT ) for this particular segment on an average day . <p> Collision Records <p> Collision records are gone through for a two year period to determine a collision rate . The collision rate is calculated in million vehicle miles as typically collision rates are low enough that measuring them in this scale is more manageable . A segments collision rate is then compared to an average of similar roads in Pleasanton . <p> This section discusses elements a driver may not realize about the segment being traveled . These elements include horizontal and vertical curves , higher than average collision rates , pedestrian patterns and facilities available , nearby pedestrian generators including schools or parks , nearby senior housing or facilities , any hidden driveways , etc . <p> Recommended Speed Limit <p> The recommended speed limit ( this is the posted speed limit ) is given near the end of the newer speed surveys and in the middle of the older type . This limit is obtained through the examination of the critical speed ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the speed limit is set at the 5 mph increment closest to the critical speed . <p> A 5 mph speed limit reduction is only allowed at locations with conditions not readily apparent to the driver . <p> Here are two examples of this process : <p> If a critical speed is 32 mph the law requires that the speed limit is set at 30 mph . If there were unusual conditions not readily apparent to the driver that warranted a 5 mph reduction in the speed limit , the speed limit may be legally reduced to 25 mph . <p> If a critical speed was 33 mph the law requires that the speed limit is set at 35 mph . If there were unusual conditions not readily apparent to the driver that warranted a 5 mph reduction in the speed limit , the speed limit may be legally reduced to 30 mph . <p> Speed limits in most areas of town are determined by an engineering and traffic study that establishes speed limits based on the speed of the vehicles on the roadway . Most drivers drive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted speed limit . Historically " before and after " studies have shown that there are no significant changes in average vehicle speeds following the posting of new or revised speed limits . Furthermore , research has found no direct relationship between posted speed limits and collision frequency . <p> If posted speed limits are set artificially low , disrespect is created for the limits , and since they are not set in accordance with the law , they are not enforceable by law . The state maximum speed limit would then apply . The occasional driver attempting to obey the posted speed limit may decrease safety by causing additional lane changes , passing and tailgating . <p> Setting speed limits near the prevailing speed of traffic results in a greater percentage of traffic flowing at uniform speeds . Correctly set speed limits can increase safety and lead to fewer collisions . <p> If you have further questions about a speed survey please call us at ( 925 ) 931-5677.

Those whom we serve are an important source of information and feedback about the quality of our service . Also , and unfortunately in the course of police operations , conflicts or misunderstandings may arise between Police Department Employees and community members . Recognizing this fact we have an established procedure that permits members of the community to report Police Department employee conduct that they feel is exemplary or unprofessional . <h> Compliments &amp; Commendations <p> Everyone enjoys receiving recognition for their efforts and there is no question that most of the 120 employees of the Pleasanton Police Department are committed to doing an outstanding job for the community of Pleasanton . <p> We realize that many of our residents and visitors to Pleasanton would like to know how to compliment our employees for a job well done . Compliments and commendations , either verbal or written are one of the best ways to let our employees know that you appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commendations for an employee of the Pleasanton Police Department can be sent directly to the Office of the Police Chief , the on-duty Watch Commander , or the employees supervisor . The compliment or commendation will be communicated to the employee by his or her supervisor and a copy will be placed in the employees personnel file . <p> A compliment or commendation may address any event that you feel demonstrates any effort on the part of the employee that deserves special recognition . This may include such acts as : unusual courtesy or compassion , significant life saving measures , or other extraordinary acts that you believe exhibited exemplary performance . <p> Compliments and commendations may be made in person , by phone , by email or fax , or through a letter or informal note to the Pleasanton Police Department or City of Pleasanton Human Resources Department . <h> Concerns , Complaints &amp; Criticisms <p> The City of Pleasanton and your Police Department take great pride in being responsive to the needs and concerns of all citizens and guests of our community . Concerns , Complaints and Criticisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job we are doing and provide us with an opportunity to enhance our understanding of how we can better serve our community . <p> While we strive to provide the highest quality of service , we realize that with our high volume of public contact , coupled with the nature of our job , not everyone will be completely satisfied . Alternatively , it is also common for people to not clearly understand the reasons for actions taken by police employees which may be a cause for concern or clarification regarding police procedures . <p> We encourage residents and guests of our community to immediately contact the on-duty Watch Commander whenever they have a concern about an employees behavior or a police related action . <p> You may have had contact with a Police Department employee where their conduct or actions , in your opinion , did not rise to the level of a formal complaint . You may feel a need to discuss the employee 's behavior or actions with a supervisor and may not require any further involvement with the matter . <p> There are times when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inappropriate , but are procedurally and legally correct . This happens sometimes with issues of search and seizure , or self-incrimination warnings ( Miranda admonitions ) . We invite you to ask these types of questions of our supervisory staff or the on-duty Watch Commander . <p> Any person who was involved or witnessed an incident , who feels the Police Department treated the individual or another person in an adverse manner , or has direct or well founded knowledge of inappropriate actions by any police employee , may make a complaint . <p> Concerns , Criticisms , and/or Complaints may be made verbally or in writing at any time of day or night to any police supervisory personnel . Usually , a detailed explanation of the situation in person , by telephone , or by mail is all that is needed to initiate a review or investigation of the matter . If you call or come to the Police Department , you will be referred to the on-duty Watch Commander or the on-duty supervisor . <p> Alternatively , you can obtain and/or drop off complaint forms with the City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pleasanton , CA 94566 .

( Compliments and complaints received by Human Resources will be placed in a sealed envelope and will be forwarded directly to the Police Chief ) . <p> A complainant generally does not have to testify during formal hearings . <p> An exception to this is if you inform us of actions taken by employees that are criminal in nature , and the complaint is sustained . There is a chance that your testimony would be used in a court proceeding against the employee , if the District Attorney chooses to file a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an administrative appeal to any imposed disciplinary action . If your complaint is sustained and the employee is disciplined and then appeals the discipline , you may be contacted and requested to testify in an administrative hearing before an arbitrator . <p> Per California Penal Code Section 832.5 ( a ) : " Each department or agency in this State which employs peace officers shall establish a procedure to investigate citizens ' complaints against the personnel of such departments or agencies , and shall make a written description of the procedure available to the public . " <p> Our supervisory and management personnel are committed to ensuring complete , fair and impartial investigations of all citizens ' complaints . The investigation of all citizen complaints is strictly regulated by the California Government Code and police department policy . Additionally , all administrative investigations are reviewed by the appropriate Division Commander and by the Police Chief to ensure a thorough and unbiased investigation was completed . <p> The person assigned to investigate your complaint will ask you to provide as much information as possible regarding the incident . If you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to the investigation that a statement be obtained from you . From your statement , a Citizen Complaint Contact form may be completed . <p> Depending upon the circumstances of your complaint , it may be investigated in one of two ways . It will either be assigned to the employee 's supervisor for inquiry or to the appropriate manager , with oversight of the employee and his supervisor , for investigation . Each allegation is examined on its own merits . <p> Administrative and criminal investigations resulting from a complaint will require investigators to make an effort to contact all available witnesses ( including police officers ) , examine any relevant physical evidence and gather all information pertinent to each allegation made in the complaint . <p> Despite our best efforts to make Administrative Investigations our top priority , it can take up to a year to complete an investigation based upon the complexity of issues being investigated . Though , typically the majority of our administrative investigations are completed within a two month period . <p> Upon completion of the Administrative Investigation a finding will be rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> EXONERATED : The act which provided the basis for the complaint did occur ; however . the investigation revealed the act was justified , lawful and proper . <p> UNFOUNDED : The investigation has produced sufficient evidence to prove that the acts alleged did not occur . This finding shall also apply when individual personnel names in the complaint were not involved in an act that did occur . <p> You will be notified of the findings for each allegation in writing at the conclusion of the investigation . <p> When a finding of SUSTAINED is determined , corrective action will be taken by the department . Discipline may include counseling , training , and action up to and including termination . If your complaint is sustained and punitive discipline is imposed , the employee has appeal rights . Therefore , you may be required to testify at one or more administrative proceedings .

The soap , together with the dirt and oil , brake dust washed fromcars , flows into nearby storm drains which run directly into lakes , riversor marine waters . The phosphates from the soap cause excess algae togrow and harm water quality .
