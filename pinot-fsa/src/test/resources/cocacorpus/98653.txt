Frozen shoulder occurs when the strong connective tissue ( capsule ) surrounding the shoulder joint thickens and becomes too tight . These thick , stiff bands of tissue are called adhesions .

When these burst , whether from trauma or overuse , the knee loses mobility and becomes painful to use when walking. - <h> Anatomy of the knee <p> The knee is the joint where the thighbone and shinbone meet . It consists of the following : <p> The femur ( thighbone ) <p> The tibia ( shinbone <p> The patella ( kneecap ) <p> The bursae ( small packets of fluid that protect the kneecap from trauma ) <p> Articular cartilage <p> Collateral ligaments <p> Cruciate ligaments <p> The knee acts as a stabilizer for the body . Connecting the top part of the leg with the bottom , the knee has four ligaments that work together to provide stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joint so individuals can walk , jump and do other necessary tasks . <h> Causes <p> There are a few causes of bursitis of the kneecap : <p> Overuse " The most common cause of this injury is overuse , which is how it got the nickname housemaid 's knee or clergyman 's knee . When a person puts excessive pressure on this already very thin and delicate area , it can cause the bursae to become inflamed . This in turn can lead to an infection . <p> Acute trauma " When a person receives acute trauma to his or her knee , bursitis can easily develop . The fluids released after a trauma can easily cause infection in this delicate region . When this occurs , the knee becomes inflamed , which can in turn trigger bursitis of the knee . First , blood will flow from the injured area to the spot of inflammation . Then , a cellular reaction will begin and leukocytes will flow to the area , causing an infection . <h> Symptoms <p> Bursitis is typically accompanied by pain in the affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by kneeling or from injury . <p> The following are common symptoms of bursitis of the knee . Depending on the cause of the condition , symptoms may be different for each person : <p> Swelling over the kneecap <p> Pain in the knee and up the back of the thigh <p> Limited mobility of the knee <p> Red and warm to touch <p> Bursitis of the kneecap symptoms occur because of bursae that break open and release fluid . This fluid is often considered to be just water in the knee , however it is important to understand the difference between that and other fluids in the affected area . For this reason , any person experiencing these symptoms should see a medical professional for help . <h> Types <p> Bursitis of the kneecap can be divided into two main types of injury : <p> Prepatellar ( kneecap ) " Prepatellar bursitis is the type that occurs most commonly in athletes and people whose professions require them to spend time on their hands and knees . This is the most common form of this injury and is usually called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from their many hours spent on hands and knees while cleaning . The prepatellar area is located beneath the skin in front of the kneecap and usually becomes inflamed or irritated from infections , injury or continuous kneeling . Regularly applying additional pressure to this fragile part of the body increases the risk of the bursa rupturing . <p> Pes anserinus " This occurs on the inner portion of the knee . The bursa in this area can become irritated when people run , have a condition where they knock knees , or if they are overweight . This type of bursitis of the knee typically comes with pain while sleeping or climbing stairs . <h> Treatment <p> Treatment is fairly easy and requires simply rest , ice and compresses to help the bursa recover . However , in some cases , medicine and antibiotics may be required if there is an infection in the area .

Stress fractures , unlike displaced or compound fractures , do not run through the entire bone . - According to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons ( AAOS ) , stress fractures occur when muscles become fatigued and are unable to absorb added shock .

@@41542928 @1542928/ <h> Shinbone ( tibia ) fracture <p> A shinbone fracture frequently occurs on the proximal part of the tibia . The tibia is the stronger and larger of a set of bones found below the knee , connecting this vital joint with the bones of the ankle . Tibia fractures cause a disruption in the stability of this bone , which typically carries more weight than any other bone . <p> Shinbone fractures are more common than other long-bone fractures such as to the femur , fibula and humerus . Any major injury occurring above the ankle and below the knee may result in a shinbone fracture . A tibia fracture can dramatically affect the motion and stability attributed to the knee bone , and due to the force required for this type of fracture , the injuries often also spread past the knee and shinbones . Because it typically takes a major force to break a long bone such as the shinbone , other injuries often occur along with these fractures . Resulting lesions may lead to injury in surrounding soft tissue that helps connect , support and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meniscus ( a fibrocartilaginous structure that divides joint cavities ) may also occur as a result of the fracture. - - <h> Anatomy of the shinbone <p> The tibia , or shinbone , is the larger of two major bones making up the lower leg , the other being the fibula . This large bone connecting the knee joint and the ankle joint is responsible for supporting the bulk of our weight as we engage in any upright activities . The tibial plateau , along the upper edge of the tibia , carries most of this weight . This area is made up of two concave condyles , which are the most prominent areas at the end of a bone , typically found where a joint forms . These are separated by a structure known as an intercondylar eminence and the sloped areas on the back and front , which help form three divided areas in the tibia : <p> Medial tibial plateau ( closest to the body 's center ) <p> Lateral tibial plateau ( farthest from the body 's center ) <p> Central tibial plateau ( between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many different possible shinbone fracture symptoms , depending on the type and severity of the injury .

The examining physician will need as much accurate information as possible to accurately assess the injury , including personal medical history , family history , previous injuries and any medications being taken . He or she will also look for broken skin , bruises , instability , obvious deformities , swelling or other abnormalities involving the bone between the knee and ankle to diagnose for shinbone fractures .

These are typically causes of the most severe fractures , in which several parts of the bone are broken . Other common tibia fracture causes include sports injuries and falls from great heights . Fractures caused by skiing , snowboarding and contact sports are among the most frequent due to the twisting force of the body and likelihood of falling or making contact with other athletes. - - <h> Types <p> There are many different types of shinbone fractures , depending on the force of the injury and how the bone breaks . In many cases the fibula ( the other , smaller bone between the ankle and knee ) is also broken .

@@41542936 @1542936/ <h> Specialty Programs <h> Endocrinology <p> Your endocrine system is a complex group of glands located throughout your body that produce different hormones . For example , there 's the pituitary gland in your brain , the thyroid gland at the base of your neck , the pancreas in your abdomen and your ovaries . The hormones that these and other glands secrete regulate a variety of bodily functions such as your metabolism and your reproductive system . Certain endocrine disorders , such as thyroid problems , are much more common in women , while other conditions are related to the female hormone estrogen and happen exclusively in women . <h> Menopause and Perimenopause <p> Menopause is a normal and natural life event that signals the end of a woman 's childbearing years . Doctors consider a woman to be in menopause when she has n't had a menstrual period for 12 consecutive months . The age at which women reach menopause can vary from anywhere between the early forties and late fifties , but the average age in the U.S. is around 51 . In many cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her mother and sisters did . Studies show that smokers often reach menopause an average of two years earlier than nonsmokers .

Some women do n't have any symptoms during perimenopause , but in many cases , the first sign is a change in your menstrual periods . When you 're in perimenopause , your periods may be shorter and heavier , and the time between your periods may lengthen . Keep in mind that even though your periods are becoming more irregular , there is still a chance you can become pregnant , which is why birth control is still important in the perimenopausal years .

Thyroid disorders are five to ten times more common in women than in men . While there are several different thyroid disorders , the two most common conditions , especially in women , are an underactive thyroid ( hypothyroidism ) and an overactive thyroid ( hyperthyroidism ) . An estimated 15 million people in the U.S. have an undiagnosed thyroid problem . When thyroid disease goes untreated , you 're at an increased risk of developing high cholesterol , heart disease , osteoporosis and infertility . <h> Hypothyroidism <p> The most common type of thyroid disorder is an underactive thyroid , also known as hypothyroidism . When your thyroid is n't producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of your bodily functions can slow down . You may feel tired and cold all of the time or gain weight even though your eating habits have n't changed . Hypothyroidism can also cause depression . One of the most common causes of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disease known as Hashimoto 's thyroiditis , which is when your immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys your own thyroid gland . There is also a genetic component to hypothyroidism , and having a first degree relative with the disorder increases your risk . Certain medications , including lithium and amiodarone " a medication used to treat cardiac arrhythmias " can cause hypothyroidism . Iodine is necessary for your thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormone , and in the past , many people developed hypothyroidism because they were n't getting enough iodine in their diets . Today , many foods are fortified with iodine , so this deficiency rarely occurs anymore . Some women develop an underactive thyroid after giving birth , and while in many cases their thyroid functioning eventually returns to normal , it can also become permanent . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underactive thyroid include extreme fatigue , drowsiness , memory problems , dry and brittle hair and nails , dry , itchy skin , unexplained weight gain and heavy menstrual periods . Doctors make the diagnosis by ordering a blood test to measure levels of thyroid stimulating hormone , or TSH . <h> Treatment Options <p> The standard therapy for an underactive thyroid is a single daily dose of a synthetic thyroid hormone known as levothyroxine . It can often take several months of adjusting the dose to hit on the right amount of thyroid hormone , which is enough to alleviate symptoms but not so much that you develop signs of an overactive thyroid . <h> Hyperthyroidism <p> When your thyroid gland produces more hormone than necessary , the result is an overactive thyroid , otherwise known as hyperthyroidism . In this case , it 's as if many of your body systems are working on overdrive . You may have a racing pulse , feel overheated and irritable , have trouble sleeping , and lose weight even though you 're hungrier than ever and eating all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autoimmune disorder known as Graves ' Disease , which results in an enlarged thyroid gland . Like all types of thyroid problems , it is much more common in women than in men , and tends to occur at younger ages . Graves ' Disease patients often develop bulging eyes and double vision , too . <h> Signs and Symptoms <p> Some of the most common symptoms of an overactive thyroid include anxiety , irritability , difficulty sleeping , fatigue , a rapid heartbeat , trembling hands , hair loss , muscle weakness , unexplained weight loss , increased hunger and diarrhea . As with an underactive thyroid , doctors make the diagnosis primarily with a blood test to check thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) levels . <h> Treatment Options <p> If your thyroid is overactive , there are two main treatment options available to you . One option is to take a medication that slows down your thyroid 's production of thyroid hormone . The other option is to have a treatment with radioactive iodine , which will destroy your thyroid . This makes your thyroid become underactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hormone daily . <h> Diabetes <p> Diabetes is a disease involving the way your body processes glucose , which is commonly known as blood sugar . Glucose is your main source of fuel , and provides energy for all the cells in your body . In order for the cells to process glucose they need insulin , which is a hormone that 's produced by your pancreas . If you have diabetes , either your body is making little or no insulin ( as with type 1 diabetes ) or it makes insulin but your cells are n't able to use it ( as with type 2 diabetes ) . In both conditions , glucose builds up in your bloodstream , and over time it can damage your heart , nerves , eyes and kidneys . Among adults , diabetes in the leading cause of blindness , limb amputation and kidney failure in the U.S. There are an estimated 24 million Americans living with diabetes today . Roughly 90 percent of them have the type 2 form , which is the type that 's related to obesity , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Type 1 Diabetes <p> Type 1 diabetes is also known as juvenile diabetes because the disease most often develops in childhood . An autoimmune disease , it occurs when your body 's immune system attacks the cells in your pancreas that produce insulin . Roughly five to ten percent of people with diabetes have type 1 , and it occurs equally in men and women . Having a parent of sibling with type 1 diabetes slightly increases your risk for the disease , and researchers also believe that exposure to certain viruses ( such as the Epstein-Barr virus ) may trigger the autoimmune response that destroys your pancreatic cells . Type 1 diabetes is more common among Caucasians than among African-Americans , Hispanics or Asians . <h> Signs and Symptoms <p> The symptoms of type 1 diabetes can come on very quickly and include excessive thirst and hunger , frequent urination , increased fatigue , blurred vision , unexplained weight loss and loss of feeling or tingling in the feet . If your blood glucose levels are extremely high , you may also have abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspects diabetes , he or she will order a blood glucose test . If the results are abnormal , you 'll need to have a second blood test to confirm the diagnosis , in which you have to fast for at least 8 hours before having your blood drawn . <h> Treatment Options <p> If you have type 1 diabetes , you will need to take insulin every day , usually in the form of injections . A newer option is a wearable insulin pump which monitors your blood sugar levels over the course of the day and gives you small amounts of insulin when you need it . Keeping your blood glucose levels well controlled by closely monitoring your carbohydrate intake and checking your glucose levels frequently is also necessary to avoid developing complications from type 1 diabetes . <h> Type 2 Diabetes <p> Type 2 diabetes occurs when the cells in your body become resistant to insulin . It 's often called adult-onset diabetes , but that has become a misnomer now that rising numbers of children and teens are being diagnosed with the disease . Having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doctors believe that there is a genetic predisposition towards developing the disease . Being overweight and getting little or no daily exercise are also significant risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes . People who carry excess weight around their waist ( apple-shaped ) rather than their hips and thighs ( pear-shaped ) are also at an increased risk . African-Americans , Hispanics , Asians , Native Americans and Pacific Islanders are all more prone to developing type 2 . Another risk factor for women is developing gestational diabetes , or diabetes during pregnancy . Roughly half of all women who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes will continue to have it post-pregnancy or develop type 2 diabetes later in life . <h> Signs and Symptoms <p> The warning signs of type 2 diabetes are similar to those of type 1 diabetes " excessive thirst and hunger , frequent urination , increased fatigue , blurred vision , unexplained weight loss and loss of feeling or tingling in the feet . However , the symptoms can develop more slowly and some people may have no symptoms at all for several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type 2 diabetes after a routine blood glucose test . But if your doctor suspects type 2 diabetes , you 'll be given a fasting blood glucose test . Another diabetes screening is called an oral glucose tolerance test , which is generally given during pregnancy to check for gestational diabetes . <h> Steps to lower your risk <p> Unlike type 1 diabetes , type 2 diabetes is often preventable , even if you have a family history or other non-controllable risk factors . Taking steps to prevent diabetes is especially important if you 've been diagnosed with pre-diabetes , which means your blood glucose levels are elevated but not high enough to meet the criteria for diabetes . An estimated 79 million Americans over the age of 20 have pre-diabetes . These healthy lifestyle habits are key : <p> Exercise regularly .

In fact , some patients are able to avoid taking medication altogether by following these steps . If medication is required , there are several drugs available , and they each work differently . For example , some drugs increase insulin production , others make the body more sensitive to insulin , and others decrease blood sugar production .

@@41542957 @1542957/ <h> Dislocated shoulder <p> A dislocated shoulder is the most frequently occurring dislocation to any joint in the body . It is a painful injury that happens when a fall or accident causes the top of your upper arm bone ( humerus ) to pop out of your shoulder joint 's cup-shaped socket ( glenoid " part of your shoulder blade ) , also known as a glenohumeral dislocation . A direct fall onto the shoulder also may cause a dislocation of the collar bone ( clavicle ) away from the shoulder blade ( acromion ) that causes discomfort at the acromioclavicular ( AC ) joint . The injury that causes dislocation of the shoulder may also stretch or tear the tendons and ligaments ( fibrous tissues ) that normally hold your shoulder in place . Nerves or blood vessels around the joint also may be affected .

Arthritis is one of more than 100 types of rheumatic diseases ( diseases that affect joints and connective tissues ) . Depending on the type of knee arthritis , symptoms can range from pain and swelling in the joints to difficulty using or moving the joint in a normal way . <h> Causes <p> Although the cause of arthritis is unknown , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that certain factors are associated with a greater risk of arthritis of the knee . Some risk factors ca n't be avoided , while others can be reduced or eliminated . <h> Symptoms <p> Knee arthritis usually affects men and women over 50 years of age , and occurs most frequently in people who are overweight .

Knee replacement surgery often is performed on patients who have severe symptoms . <p> The symptoms of arthritis of the knee may resemble other medical conditions or problems . Always consult your physician for a diagnosis . <h> Types <p> These types of rheumatic diseases can affect the knee joint and connective tissues : <p> Osteoarthritis " The most common form of arthritis , osteoarthritis is also known as " wear and tear " arthritis . It often occurs in your knees , because your knee joints " like your hips and spine " are weight-bearing joints . This chronic rheumatic disease damages and thins the knee joint 's articular cartilage , the smooth and glistening covering on the ends of your bones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrows the space in which the knee joint moves . Osteoarthritis predominantly affects older people , but it also can occur in young people as a result of a knee injury or overuse . <p> Rheumatoid arthritis " This inflammatory disease attacks the lining of your knee joint ( synovium ) and is one of a group of arthritis diseases known as inflammatory arthritides . Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease that can attack any joint . A chronic disease , it is characterized by periods of flare-ups and remissions and can affect people of all ages . Rheumatoid arthritis of the knee can cause permanent destruction and deformity of the knee joint even before symptoms are severe . The cause of rheumatoid arthritis of the knee is unknown . <p> Post-traumatic arthritis " Despite proper treatment and full recovery from an injury , post-traumatic arthritis may develop years after a fracture , ligament injury or meniscus tear ( a tear in the connective tissue of the knee ) . <p> Fibromyalgia " This chronic condition causes pain , stiffness and tenderness of the muscles , tendons and joints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases that affect the joints . <h> Risk factors <p> Risk factors that ca n't be modified include : <p> Age " The risk of developing most types of arthritis increases with age . <p> Gender " Most types of arthritis are more common in women ; 60 percent of all people with arthritis are women . Gout is more common in men . <h> Treatment <p> Nonsurgical treatments such as anti-inflammatory medicines , corticosteroids , physical therapy and an assistive device such as a cane or walker can help reduce the pain and discomfort of arthritis of the knee . If nonsurgical treatments fail to provide relief , you may need surgery . Depending on the type of arthritis , your orthopaedist may recommend : <p> Arthroscopic surgery " A minimally invasive procedure that uses very small incisions and fiber optic technology to see inside the knee joint and remove debris or repair torn cartilage . An arthroscope is inserted in one incision , and very thin surgical instruments are inserted in one or more of the other incisions . The arthroscope is a small tube , thinner than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and a small video camera . The camera sends large real-time images to a video monitor next to the operating table , thus allowing the surgeon to make precise movements with the special surgical instruments . Thanks to the miniaturized camera , the surgeon can see more detail than could be seen with a larger incision ( open surgery ) and the naked eye . <p> Osteotomy " Osteotomy of the knee is surgery that involves removing a wedge of bone from one of the leg bones right below or above your knee to improve alignment of the knee joint . This may be done to relieve symptoms of arthritis of the knee or trauma. - <p> A tibial osteotomy makes a cut in the shin bone ( lower leg ) , while a femoral osteotomy makes a cut in the thigh bone . According to the National Institutes of Health , arthritis most often affects the inside part of your knee , not the outside part . That 's because the inside of the knee holds more of your weight than the outside of the knee when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight away from the damaged part of your knee to the other side of the knee . When your surgeon removes a wedge of your shinbone from underneath the healthy side of your knee , the shinbone and thighbone can bend away from the damaged cartilage .

Additionally , when you have an osteotomy , you may be able to delay a total knee replacement surgery for up to 10 years . <p> Total knee replacement surgery " During total knee replacement your surgeon resurfaces your knee joint by removing the diseased bone and cartilage .

During the procedure , your orthopaedic surgeon replaces the damaged knee compartment with a metal and plastic implant , while the healthy cartilage and bone in the rest of your knee are left alone . <p> Cartilage grafting " This surgical procedure is an option for some knees that have limited or contained articular cartilage loss from arthritis or trauma . Articular cartilage is the smooth , white tissue that covers the ends of bones where they come together to form joints .

For extreme cases , or cases in which the condition is not responding to nonsurgical treatment , surgery might be recommended . The types of surgery include : <p> Bone removal- " The surgeon removes all or part of the affected sesamoid bone . Surgeons try to avoid removing both sesamoid bones , because this can cause the toes to deform and either bend up like a claw or slant severely to the side over the adjacent toe . <p> Scraping- " During this procedure , the surgeon will either scrape off the affected part of the sesamoid bone or cut off the bottom of the bone .

The surgeon will remove bits of bone from a nearby toe and pack them around the injured part of the sesamoid bone . This can help the bone fuse together and heal properly . <p> After bone removal or scraping surgery , your doctor will put your foot into a cast or an orthopaedic shoe for two to three weeks . This will restrict movement and pressure so your sesamoid bones can heal properly . If you have bone graft surgery , you will wear a cast for at least four weeks . After the cast is removed , the doctor will prescribe a walking boot to minimize pressure and movement in the foot . Approximately twelve weeks after surgery , your doctor will begin a regular series of CT scans to monitor the bone and track the healing progress . <p> The multidisciplinary team of foot experts at Northwell Health Orthopaedic Institute performs sesamoiditis repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsurgical and surgical treatments for conditions that affect the foot and ankle . <h> Northwell Health Rehabilitation Network 82044 @qwx492044

While metastatic disease may result from any type of carcinoma , bone is among the most common sites for metastasis from carcinoma of the breast , prostate , lung , thyroid and kidney .

@@41543067 @1543067/ <h> Specialty Programs <h> Endometrial Cancer <p> Cancer cells that form in the inner layers of tissue lining the uterus ( known as the endometrium ) is called endometrial cancer . It 's also sometimes referred to as uterine cancer or endometrial cancer . An estimated 49,560 new cases of endometrial cancers are expected to be diagnosed this year , primarily in women over the age of 55. <h> 5 steps to protect your uterus <p> Know your risk factors . Women who have a history of an abnormal overgrowth of the endometrium ( called endometrial hyperplasia ) have an increased risk of developing uterine cancer . Common symptoms of hyperplasia include heavy menstrual periods , bleeding between periods and bleeding after menopause . This condition is most common after age 40 . Women may also have a higher risk of developing uterine cancer if they 've never had children , had their first menstrual period before age 12 or went through menopause after age 55 . Other risk factors include a history of taking estrogen alone ( not with progesterone ) , a history of taking tamoxifen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pelvis . Family history may also be important : Women with a mother , sister or daughter with uterine cancer have a greater risk of developing the disease themselves . Of course , having these risk factors does n't mean you 'll develop uterine cancer , and many women who get the disease do n't have any of these factors . <p> Maintain a healthy weight . Research shows there is a link between body mass index ( BMI ) and endometrial cancer . Women with a BMI of 25 or higher are six times more likely to develop endometrial cancer than women at a healthier body weight . Women with a BMI of 35 or greater have an even greater risk . Scientists believe that increased fat tissue can mean more hormones are converted into estrogen , boosting an endometrial cancer risk . On the flip side , studies show that weight loss is associated with a significant reduction in overall cancer risk . <p> Follow a well-rounded diet . Eating lots of high-fat foods ( especially fat that comes from animals ) has been shown to increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . High-fat foods are also typically higher in calories , which can cause weight gain and further increased your cancer risk . There 's also some research suggesting that regularly having soy products ( such as tofu or soy milk ) can protect against endometrial cancer . <p> Be physically active . Exercising on a regular basis is good for preventing lots of chronic diseases , and cancer is no exception . There appears to be a special link between physical activity and uterine cancer : Research shows that regular exercise can help slash the risk of uterine cancer by up to 46 percent among postmenopausal women who are active 90 minutes or more a day , compared to those who move less than 30 minutes a day . Other research has shown that regular exercise is associated with a 38 percent decrease in risk , regardless of duration or intensity . <p> Consider oral contraception . If you 're interested in using birth control , oral contraceptives may provide an edge when it comes to reducing uterine cancer risk . Research shows that taking birth control pills that contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease endometrial cancer risk " and the benefits continue to last for at least 15 years after you 've stopped taking the pill . Remember oral contraceptives do carry their own risks , including increased risk of blood clots , stroke and heart attack , especially among women who smoke and are over age 35 . <h> Ask Your Doctor <p> About 9 out of 10 women with endometrial cancer experience abnormal vaginal bleeding " sometimes starting as a watery , blood-streaked flow that gradually contains more blood as it continues . Other symptoms may include pain when emptying the bladder , during sex or in the pelvic area . See your doctor if you develop any of these symptoms . You 'll likely have a physical exam , including a pelvic exam to check your uterus , vagina and other nearby tissues for any lumps or changes in shape or size . Blood tests can also look for markers like CA125 , a substance that many endometrial ( and ovarian ) cancers release into the bloodstream . You may also get an ultrasound test to get a better look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a probe inserted into the vagina . If something looks suspicious your doctor will likely take a biopsy , removing a small amount of tissue to check for cancer cells . <p> Endometrial cancers range from stage 1a ( cancer is found in the uterus only , and just in the endometrium or less than halfway through the muscle layer of the uterus , called the myometrium ) or stage 1b ( cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium ) to stage 4 ( cancer has spread beyond the pelvis , either to the bladder and bowel or into the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin . ) <h> Treatment Options <p> Standard treatment options include surgery to remove the cancer ( typically a totally hysterectomy to remove the uterus ) , as well as radiation therapy and chemotherapy to kill the cancer cells or stop them from growing .

A giant cell tumor is generally considered to be benign ( noncancerous ) and usually begins near the ends of the bone . These are commonly seen in the femur ( thighbone ) and tibia ( shinbone ) , but can also be found in the wrist , arm or pelvis . Only one out of every million people is struck with this disease , making it quite rare . <p> The tumor is named for the characteristic giant cells which comprise one of the cell populations that appears under the microscope . While these cells typically are not malignant ( cancerous ) in nature , on rare occasions they do have the possibility of spreading to the lungs .

Conductive hearing loss occurs when there is a disruption of the anatomy of any part of the external or middle ear that conducts sound waves from the environment to the fluids in the inner ear . Sensorineural hearing loss may be due to the incomplete development of the inner ear or the specialized nerve cells that conduct nerve impulses representing the vibrations of sound waves to the brain .

@@41543323 @1543323/ <h> Specialty Programs <h> Ovarian Cancer <p> Ovarian cancer occurs when cancer cells form in the tissues of the ovary . There are two main types of ovarian cancer : Ovarian epithelial carcinomas , where the cancer cells begin on the surface of the ovary , and malignant germ cell tumors , where cancer begins in the egg cells . Though not as common as some cancers , ovarian can be one of the mostly deadly , because it often spreads before it is diagnosed . In the U.S. , ovarian cancer ranks as the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women , although the number of deaths from the disease has decreased slightly since 2002. <h> 5 steps to protect your ovaries <p> Maintain a healthy weight . Being obese ( having a body mass index of 30 or more ) raises your risk of almost all forms of cancer , but there seems to be a specific danger with ovarian cancer . One study from the National Cancer Institute of more than 94,500 women found that obesity was associated with an almost 80 percent higher risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after menopause . Other studies have also supported a link between obesity and ovarian cancer . Keeping your weight at a healthy level ( a BMI between 18.5-24.9 ) not only lowers your cancer risk , it also slashes your chance of developing many other chronic ailments , from heart disease to diabetes . <p> Know your family history . According to the National Cancer Institute , the single greatest ovarian cancer risk factor is a family history of the disease . A large meta-analysis of 15 published studies estimates a woman with at least one first-degree relative ( mother , sister or daughter ) who has had ovarian cancer has about three times more odds of developing the disease . Of course , other lifestyle factors also come into play , and having a relative with a history of the disease does not mean you are guaranteed to get it . <p> Consider the risks of certain medications . Research has shown that women who have taken estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy after menopause have an increased risk of ovarian cancer ; the longer the medication is used , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks associated with hormone replacement therapy that contains both estrogen and progestin . If you 're trying to conceive and are considering taking fertility drugs , talk to your doctor about the risks involved : Studies show some of these drugs may also be linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer . <p> Think about oral contraceptives . If family planning is not in your immediate future , you may want to consider taking oral contraceptives as your form of birth control . Taking birth control pills for five years has been shown to reduce ovarian cancer risk by 50 percent . This protective effect seems to last for years after you 've stopped taking the drugs " in some cases up to 25 years later . However , oral contraceptives do carry their own side effects , including an increased risk of blood clots ( higher in women who smoke ) . There 's also some evidence linking oral contraceptives to a slight increase in breast cancer risk , although this diminishes over time . <p> Breastfeed your babies . There are loads of good reasons to breastfeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction to the list . Research shows the longer a mother breastfeeds , the less likely she is to develop the disease . Breastfeeding typically delays ovulation , and the more times you ovulate , the higher risk of developing some sort of cell mutation . One recent Chinese study found women who breastfed for 20 months decreased their risk of ovarian cancer by 50 percent , although benefits can be seen with as little of 12 months of breastfeeding . <h> Ask Your Doctor <p> Ovarian cancer is often deadly because , unlike mammograms for breast cancer or colonoscopies for colorectal cancer , there 's really no good screening test to clearly detect the disease in its early stages . Currently , doctors use a combination of procedures or tests to help increase the odds of catching the cancer before it spreads : <p> A transvaginal ultrasound , a procedure used to examine the vagina , uterus , fallopian tubes and bladder by placing an ultrasound probe into the vagina . High-energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) then bounce off internal organs and tissues ; the echoes form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A CA-125 assay , a blood test that measures levels of CA125 . This is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream ; increasing levels of CA-125 can sometimes signal the presence of cancer cells . This test is used to follow the course of this disease . <p> If you have a family history of ovarian cancer , you may want to talk to your doctor about getting a genetic test . A woman who has the genetic mutation known as BRCA1 has an average lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer of 39 percent ; a woman with a BRCA2 mutation has an average of 11 percent lifetime risk of the disease . Both men and women with these altered genes also have higher risk of breast , prostate , pancreatic , laryngeal and stomach cancers , as well as melanoma . Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation may wish to have their breasts and/or ovaries removed to reduce their cancer risk . <p> Although early ovarian cancer may not cause any symptoms , later stages of the disease can sometimes include pain or swelling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( such as gas , bloating or constipation ) . <p> If your doctor does suspect cancer , additional tests such as a CT scan or biopsy may be ordered to provide a clearer diagnosis . Once cancer is diagnosed , tests are usually done to find out if the cancer cells have spread within the ovaries or to other parts of the body . Ovarian cancer ranges from stage 1 ( cancer found inside one or both ovaries ) to stage 4 ( cancer is found in one of both ovaries and has spread beyond the abdomen to other parts of the body ) . <h> Treatment Options <p> Treatment for ovarian cancer varies depending on the stage and type , but generally most patients have surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible . This may include removing one or both ovaries , one or both fallopian tools , the uterus and sometimes the cervix . Following surgery treatment may include radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing .
