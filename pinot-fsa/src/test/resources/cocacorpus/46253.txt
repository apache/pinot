@@1028442 <h> Writing for impact : how to craft papers that will be cited <p> For the past few years I 've co-taught a professional development course for doctoral students on completing a thesis , getting a job , and publishing. - The course draws liberally on a book I co-wrote with the late Duncan Fuller entitled , The Academics ' Guide to Publishing. - One thing we did not really cover in the book was how to write and place pieces that have impact , rather providing more general advice about getting through the peer review process . <p> The general careers advice mantra of academia is now publish or perish. - Often what is published and its utility and value can be somewhat overlooked if a piece got published it is assumed it must have some inherent value. - And yet a common observation is that most journal articles seem to be barely read , let alone cited . <p> Both authors and editors want to publish material that is both read and cited , so what is required to produce work that editors are delighted to accept and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own work ? <p> A taxonomy of publishing impact <p> The way I try and explain impact to early career scholars is through a discussion of writing and publishing a paper on airport security ( see Figure 1 ) . - Written pieces of work , I argue , generally fall into one of four categories , with the impact of the piece rising as one traverses from Level 1 to Level 4 . <p> Figure 1 : Levels of research impact <p> Level 1 : the piece is basically empiricist in nature and makes little use of theory. - For example , I could write an article that provides a very detailed description of security in an airport and how it works in practice. - This might be interesting , but would add little to established knowledge about how airport security works or how to make sense of it. - Generally , such papers appear in trade magazines or national level journals and are rarely cited . <p> Level 2 : the paper uses established theory to make sense of a phenomena . For example , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain how airport security works to create docile bodies that passively submit to enhanced screening measures. - Here , I am applying a theoretical frame that might provide a fresh perspective on a phenomena if it has not been previously applied. - I am not , however , providing new theoretical or methodological tools but drawing on established ones. - As a consequence , the piece has limited utility , essentially constrained to those interested in airport security , and might be accepted in a low-ranking international journal . <p> Level 3 : the paper extends/reworks established theory to make sense of phenomena. - For example , I might argue that since the 1970s when Foucault was formulating his ideas there has been a radical shift in the technologies of surveillance from disciplining systems to capture systems that actively reshape behaviour. - As such , Foucault 's ideas of governance need to be reworked or extended to adequately account for new algorithmic forms of regulating passengers and workers. - My article could provide such a reworking , building on Foucault 's initial ideas to provide new theoretical tools that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece will get accepted into high-ranking international journals due to its wider utility . <p> Level 4 : uses the study of a phenomena to rethink a meta-concept or proposes a radically reworked or new theory. - Here , the focus of attention shifts from how best to make sense of airport security to the meta-concept of governance , using the empirical case material to argue that it is not simply enough to extend Foucault 's thinking , rather a new way of thinking is required to adequately conceptualize how governance is being operationalised. - Such new thinking tends to be well cited because it can generally be applied to making sense of lots of phenomena , such as the governance of schools , hospitals , workplaces , etc. - Of course , Foucault consistently operated at this level , which is why he is so often reworked at Levels 2 and 3 , and is one of the most impactful academics of his generation ( cited nearly 42,000 time in 2013 alone ) . - Writing a Level 4 piece requires a huge amount of skill , knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and publish at this level. - Such pieces will be accepted into the very top ranked journals . <p> One way to think about this taxonomy is this : generally , those people who are the biggest names in their discipline , or across disciplines , have a solid body of published Level 3 and Level 4 material this is why they are so well known ; they produce material and ideas that have high transfer utility. - Those people who well known within a sub-discipline generally have a body of Level 2 and Level 3 material. - Those who are barely known outside of their national context generally have Level 1/2 profiles ( and also have relatively small bodies of published work ) . <p> In my opinion , the majority of papers being published in international journals are Level 2/borderline 3 with some minor extension/reworking that has limited utility beyond making sense of a specific phenomena , or Level 3/borderline 2 with narrow , timid or uninspiring extension/reworking that constrains the paper 's broader appeal . Strong , bold Level 3 papers that have wider utility beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers that really push the boundaries of thought and praxis are relatively rare. - The majority of articles in national level journals tend to be Level 2 ; and the majority of book chapters in edited collections are Level 1 or 2. - It is not uncommon , in my experience , for authors to think the paper that they have written is category above its real level ( which is why they are often so disappointed with editor and referee reviews ) . <p> Does this basic taxonomy of impact work in practice ? - <p> I 've not done a detailed empirical study , but can draw on two sources of observations. - First , my experience as an editor two international journals ( Progress in Human Geography , Dialogues in Human Geography ) , and for ten years an editor of another ( Social and Cultural Geography ) , and viewing download rates and citational analysis for papers published in those journals. - It is clear from such data that the relationship between level and citation generally holds those papers that push boundaries and provide new thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , some exceptions and there are no doubt some Level 4 papers that are quite lowly cited for various reasons ( e.g , , their arguments are ahead of their time ) , but generally the cream rises. - Most academics intuitively know this , which is why the most consistent response of referees and editors to submitted papers is to provide feedback that might help shift Level 2/borderline Level 3 papers ( which are the most common kind of submission ) up to solid Level 3 papers pieces that provide new ways of thinking and doing and provide fresh perspectives and insights . <p> Second , by examining my own body of published work. - Figure 2 displays the citation rates of all of my published material ( books , papers , book chapters ) divided into the four levels. - There are some temporal effects ( such as more recently published work not having had time to be cited ) and some outliers ( in this case , a textbook and a coffee table book ) but the relationship is quite clear , especially when just articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases across levels. - ( I 've been fairly brutally honest in categorising my pieces and what 's striking to me personally is proportionally how few Level 3 and 4 pieces I 've published , which is something for me to work on ) . <p> So what does this all mean ? - <p> Basically , if you want your work to have impact you should try to write articles that meet Level 3 and 4 criteria that is , produce novel material that provides new ideas , tools , methods that others can apply in their own studies. - Creating such pieces is not easy or straightforward and demands a lot of reading , reflection and thinking , which is why it can be so difficult to get papers accepted into the top journals and the citation distribution curve is so heavily skewed , with a relatively small number of pieces having nearly all the citations ( Figure 4 shows the skewing for my papers ; my top cited piece has the same number of cites as the 119 pieces with the least number ) . <p> Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , papers with zero citations are nearly all Level 1 and 2 pieces. - That 's not the only kind of papers you should be striving to publish if you want some impact from your work . <h> 8 thoughts on " Writing for impact : how to craft papers that will be cited " <p> this is a very strong article that all grad students ( perhaps even professors ) should read . But it does strike me as somewhat naive about how knowledge is accepted . It could use a little Thomas Kuhn to remind people that often great new ideas are rejected because they do n't  fit the dominant paradigm . I do n't  accept that " generally the cream rises . " I agree with Kuhn ( and many others ) that often this is not until the old paradigm dies . And in the real world of academia , ideas are often rejected because they do n't  follow the genre rules of the disciplines being addressed . Or they are written by outsiders , people of color , women , and those from less elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every problem needs new theory . Yes , when the old theories do n't  work make new theories , but maybe we can understand the mania for airport security without inventing any new theories of governance , for example . Chris Hables Gray <p> Chris , where we differ is that I do n't  believe the paradigm theory works fully practice , especially outside of the sciences . In many disciplines , notably in the social sciences and humanities , there is little evidence of paradigms presently operating , with a diverse set of philosophical approaches employed , and a plurality of minor theories and **30;252;TOOLONG approaches . Further , I think that paradigmatic accounts of scientific progress produce overly sanitised and linear stories of how disciplines evolve , smoothing over the messy , contested and multiple ways in which academic knowledge production unfolds in reality . That 's not to say that different academics or groups do not try to police theoretical developments , but that it in a globalised and plural scientific landscape with dozens of disciplinary journals , competing interests and social media it is almost impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea is well conceived , well argued , well written and compelling it will get published and over time engaged with . The days of narrow disciplines , with strong paradigmatic gatekeepers is over in my view . <p> I agree that the situation is not linear and straightforward that I am presenting some magic rule that works in all cases . What gets picked up and cited are subject sometimes to luck and to fad and fashions , and citation can also be self-reinforcing ( as an author gets cited it pushes people to their other work ) , and sometimes very worthy and useful pieces get overlooked . Nor am I denying that exclusionary pressures are at work the most obvious being the dominance of the English language ( which Ive written about if you 're interested Kitchin , R. ( 2003 ) Disrupting and destabilising Anglo-American and English-language hegemony in Geography . Documents dAn+ lisi Geogr+ fica 42 : 17-36 . Reprinted in Social and Cultural Geography 6(1) : 1-16 ) . However , I do think the general rule I am setting out here works if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to be cited very much . That 's not to say that these pieces are not useful , just that they will not have very much wider impact . <p> Personally , I think it is self-evident that we continue to need new ideas , theory , ways of making sense of the world as we patently have not created a body of knowledge/theory that adequately explains how the world works . If we did all academics could give up on that front and swap to policy and application . Also , in my view , there is certainly a lot of useful theoretical work to be done in understanding airport security and how it fits into a wider shift in the nature of governance in Western democracies post 9/11 . <p> While I understand that researchers need citations to get ahead , I found the underlying assumptions of this article to be a bit cynical . Should we craft our papers for citations ? Or should we craft them to add knowledge to and advance our field of study ? <p> Stacy , there is no intentional cynical undertones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career researchers is how difficult they find it to get their papers accepted into international journals . And for established academics it is that their work is little read or referenced . I am trying to explain what editors are looking for and why some papers struggle to get published and why many papers are rarely read and cited by the authors peers . This advice is given because most academics hope that their work will have some kind of impact and make a difference to the thinking and practice of others . Whilst the advice might be read as being cynically careerist , what I 'm trying to do is help colleagues realise that hope ( which little doubt has the supplemental value of aiding ones career ) . If you are adding new knowledge and seeking to advance your field you are on the right path . The kind of addition though is important . Those papers that are most read and referenced are those that do not simply recycle an idea or apply it to a new empirical case or nudge it along , but ones that provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am trying to get across . <p> Objective : Bibliometrics is a method of examining scholarly communications . Concerns regarding the use of bibliometrics in general , and the impact factor score ( IFS ) in particular , have been discussed across disciplines including social work . Although there are frequent mentions in the literature of the IFS as an indicator of the impact or quality of scholars ' work , little empirical work has been published regarding the validity of such use . Method : A proportionate , stratified , random sample , of n = 323 articles was selected from 17 Web of Science listed social work journals published during the 1992 to 1994 period . Results : The relationship between journals ' IFSs and the actual impact of articles published in those journals ( predictive validity ) was r = .41 ( short term ) and r = .42 ( long term ) . Conclusion : The practice of using the IFS as a proxy indicator of article impact merits significant concern as well as further empirical investigation . <p> This study was done to draw attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenure candidates work , on the basis of the IFS of the journals in which they they had published . <p> While I agree we should all be striving to move towards your Level 4 ( though with the caveat that social science needs contributions at all four levels ) , I 'm a bit dubious that this translates to increased citation rates in a straightforward fashion . I do n't  think the relationships in your Figures 2 and 3 ( which look to me surprisingly weak ) would stand up very well to a multivariate analysis across the population of scholars .

@@1028545 <h> How to ask for a Reference in Academia <h> How to ask for a Reference in Academia <p> Nearly every university student at some point needs to ask for a letter of reference for some purpose . You might be applying for a job inside or outside of academia , or for postgraduate study , or for funding to support study or research . Lecturers consider it their duty to provide support to students in the form of letters of reference , so you should not be shy about asking for one . However , there is an established etiquette around this that you should learn and follow . <p> Not all references are alike . When you need a letter of reference , you should investigate carefully and make sure you understand the nature of the reference that is needed , and that you communicate this clearly to the person whom you are asking for a reference . References can be of very different types ; many non-academic job applications require the person to merely fill out a form , whereas the standard academic reference involves writing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship to the applicant and the applicant 's qualifications . In some cases you are asked to merely provide names and contact information so that your reference-writer can be contacted on your behalf , while sometimes you are expected to personally arrange for letters to be sent . Sometimes a reference can be uploaded to an online form or sent via email , while sometimes it must be provided to the applicant as a hard copy and passed along with the application . It is YOUR responsibility to find out all the details and to provide as much information as possible to the person whom you are asking to be a reference for you : whether a form or a full letter is needed ; how the reference is to be delivered ; to whom the reference should be addressed ( provide a name with title and a full address ) ; when is the deadline for the reference . Never put your reference-writer in the position of having to go digging for these kinds of details . <p> Short notice is bad form . You should always give plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a reference . If you need a university lecturer or tutor to compose a letter on your behalf , and if it is the first time you have ever asked this person for such a letter , you should give that person no less than three weeks advance notice . Writing a letter takes time , not just for composing it , but for doing a little background research to recall your past work and qualifications - remember that university lecturers work with dozens and even hundreds of students . Also , university lecturers have very busy schedules with multiple deadlines to meet , and they have to incorporate your request into their workflow . Once a lecturer has written one letter for you , subsequent letters that you might need can be produced with less advance notice - but you should always allow at least one week . Never ask for a reference with only one day 's notice - it is bad form to put your lecturer in the position of having to meet so short a deadline , and such a request reflects very badly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you are asking a university lecturer or tutor for a reference for the first time , it is not sufficient to merely send an email with your request . You should arrange an appointment to meet personally with the person in order to explain what your goals are and to establish the fact that you would like to ask for continued support from the person as a reference-writer . That meeting provides an opportunity for your potential reference-writer to collect information from you that can be used in composing a letter . Once this relationship is established , future letters of reference can be requested with just an email or telephone call .

@@1028567 <h> Further Information <h> Dr Conor Murphy working with Irish Water on adapting to climate change <p> Source:creative commons <p> Friday , March 24 , 2017 - 12:45 <p> Water is a fragile resource that needs to be protected for the well-being of the citizens of the state . As the climate changes in response to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases , drought frequencies and characteristics are also expected to change globally and in Europe . However , the picture at the catchment scale is much less clear , partly because of Global Climate Model ( GCM ) uncertainties ( see Figure 1 ) and also because of the difficulty of downscaling GCM results to a scale relevant to water management decisions . To help ensure resilient water resources in an uncertain future Dr. Murphy and his research team , together with Irish Water , will be working to identify the types of catchments most sensitive to climate change from a water resources/drought perspective . Rather than conventional top-down analysis which can result in wide ranges of uncertainty and paralysis in policy making , the project will be developing robust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information required to inform climate smart planning and policy .

@@1028568 <p> As Ireland emerges tentatively from recession , how well will families affected by the crisis bounce back ? Poverty is an unwanted gift that is too often passed from one generation to another . But the global economic crisis that swept over Ireland introduced crisis , adversity and hardship to a whole new cohort of people . <p> They never expected it , says Dr Jane Gray , a sociologist at Maynooth University . And evidence from across eight other European countries now suggests that the " new poor , " with little tradition of dire financial struggles and a limited knowledge of the social support systems available to them , might face additional challenges in coping and getting by . <p> Dr Gray is the lead Irish researcher on REScUE , a European Union funded project consisting of Ireland , Finland , Germany , Greece , Poland , Portugal , Spain , Turkey and the United Kingdom , which is comparing citizens ' experiences of the crisis . <p> The need for resilience For Dr Gray , this is about resilience . " We already have a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty , " she explains . " This project is not so much about those factors as about what allows some families to be resilient and come out with hope for improved future circumstances . " <p> Interviews were conducted with 12 families in an urban midlands town and 12 families in the surrounding rural hinterland . The town is not being named in order to protect the identity of the research participants , but it is one which became a commuter town during the boom years and also suffered one of the biggest employment downturns when the crash hit . Indeed , statistics show that this outer commuter belt appears to have suffered disproportionately , says Dr Gray . <p> But human beings , from policy makers to the general public , do n't always respond to raw statistics - no matter how shocking they may be . For this reason , says Dr Gray , individual stories gathered through qualitative research are hugely important . " We need stories to help us understand . It helps researchers know what they are looking at when they see charts detailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers do n't always give this information , so bringing the two elements together is important . " <p> Figuring out where to go for help When Dr Gray did look into the data , were there any surprises ? " The analysis is not finished , but what did stand out was the contrast between people whose economic hardship stretches back generations and those who never expected themselves to be in that situation . The latter group may have higher levels of education or sometimes savings , but on the other hand they may struggle to figure out where to go for help from various state agencies or charities . Those with more experience of poverty , conversely , may have more experience of coping within their families or communities . " <p> That 's not to say that their objective experience of hardship and deprivation is significantly different , says Dr Gray . " People spoke to us about being hungry , about not being able to feed their families or heat their houses ; many of these houses looked lovely on the outside . " <p> Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family types and individuals . Some were married couples with children . Others were single parents . Another group included young adults , a group who have been shown to be particularly adversely affected . Some of the participants were not originally from Ireland or had not grown up here , and there was a mix of men and women . <p> They had worked in construction ; they had been small business people ; or they had lost seemingly secure jobs when the downturn hit . In some families , there was one person still working , but often only on a part-time basis , and they were still being hammered by mortgage payments and high levels of debt . <p> The research team did try to include older people , but found that they had not generally suffered as much . " But they also tend to be the most fearful for their standard of living , " says Dr Gray . " The young have had harsher experiences , yet they were relatively optimistic and they generally believed that life will get better . " <p> Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle to adapt , whereas women seem to be better at picking up the pieces , planning , budgeting and generally coping . <p> Sense of shame Dr Gray was consistently struck by how many of the people she met had a sense of shame . " They did n't want us coming into their homes because they had n't been able to afford renovations and repairs , and they were embarrassed . People who never thought that they would have to stand in line to receive unemployment benefit told us of feeling depressed and hopeless . They said that they could n't plan for the future or do things for their kids . Even the fact of their children going back to school and being the only one who had n't been away anywhere on holidays added up in a growing stack of small humiliations . " <p> In some instances , people experiencing deprivation for the first time only have their family to lean on , but they ca n't do this if the family does n't live nearby . Even where family support is available , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost their independence . Families also seem to cope better if they are embedded in their local community - a factor that clearly puts those who are newer to an area at a disadvantage . <p> People are survivors While most people seemed to have an almost tacit knowledge of how to cope and manage in certain difficult situations , their resilience was tested by factors that are largely outside their control . " It can come down to the intervention of one person . It could be a family member . It could be a public health nurse who notices that all is n't right . In one instance , a college lecturer encouraged a student to keep going when she thought she could n't ; this kept her in college . " <p> Ireland is very different in some respects from other countries that are participating in the project , such as Finland , Greece and Turkey . Nonetheless , the results will paint a broad picture of resilience in the face of adversity . The silver lining is that , put together , the results may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , find themselves struggling . <p> " People are survivors , " says Dr Gray . " Some rely on charitable organisations like the St. Vincent de Paul as essential lifelines . Others , unfortunately , are turning to money lenders , while some are bartering or exchanging goods and services . Ultimately , what we want is for people to be in position to take advantage of recovery . We hope they have n't been set back in the long-term . "

The main purpose of the MA thesis is for the student to demonstrate mastery of anthropological theory and ethnography - this will require reading of anthropological theory and ethnography beyond what is required on reading lists from the modules . The experience of the thesis should be adaptable to the particular goals of each student ; if the student plans to go on for the PhD , the thesis research can lay the groundwork for more advanced PhD research on the topic ; if the student wants to take the MA and go into the job market , the thesis research can allow her/him to develop some expertise in a topical area as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critically open up a topic/issue . <p> How do I choose a topic ? <p> In the MA thesis , the student must apply anthropological theory to a topic of the student 's choice , i.e. the student should explore a topic in the light of the theory , and be able to use anthropological theory to comment critically on the topic . As long as there is relevant expertise in the department , students can chose a research topic from any area within anthropology , in consultation with a willing advisor . Students might choose the topic of one of the optional modules and further explore an aspect of it in the thesis ; students may also choose a topic of their own interest that is not addressed in any of the modules . <p> What sort of research should my thesis be based on ? <p> All research methods should be decided in consultation with advisor , but the following are some possible scenarios : <p> " Desk-based " or " Library " Thesis .

A student might use an internship experience ( for instance , with an NGO ) as the basis for a thesis . The student would have to develop an anthropological problem that could be addressed through the practical experience . <p> Fieldwork-based thesis . Students are advised that the one-year MA programme does not allow sufficient time for a fully developed field-based anthropological project . Students wishing to engage in some ethnographic fieldwork should design their project carefully in consultation with the advisor , so that it is not solely dependent upon data gathered through fieldwork . <p> N.B.

The module AN861 Designing Research in Anthropology facilitates the development of the research proposal . <p> During Semester 2 , students should be making progress on their research for the thesis . <p> During Summer , students should be finishing up their research and turning to analysis and writing . <p> The deadline for turning in completed theses is Friday in the first week of September ( see section in the Postgraduate Handbook on Thesis Deadlines for exact date each year ) . <p> What is the word count for one-year MA theses ? <p> Theses written in the one-year MA programme should be 15,000 -20,000 words .

@@1028789 <h> Abstract <p> The ESReT ( European Safety Review Tool ) project has developed a tool to support the review of road sections that have been identified as high risk ' according to network screening processes . The tool provides a methodology to practitioners for the collection and analysis of road attribute data using low cost , non-specialist equipment . The overall result is a consistent and repeatable approach to the investigation and assessment of high risk road sections . There are two main parts of the assessment performed by the tool . The first part is a comparison of road attributes against design standards ; the optional second part is a comparison of road attributes against safety rules ' . The road design standard check allows road authorities to compare the attributes of existing heritage roads with current design standards . This allows road authorities to identify where , and in what way , modern design rules are not met . Various design standard attributes are included in the tool including : median width , lane width , shoulder type and width , verge width , curve radius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The optional safety ' check allows the road authority to see where key safety rules are violated . This means aspects of the road that may contribute to high severity crashes are identified along with aspects of the road that may lack credibility to the road user . Attributes relating to safety include median type , clear zones ( median and roadside ) , intersection type and frequency , stopping sight distance , adjacent land use , presence of pedestrian and cycle facilities etc . The ESReT system allows road attribute information to be visualised and reviewed by the road authority , and presents the results of the road design standard and safety checks by showing deficits both in tabular form and on interactive maps . The ESReT system does not aim to provide a definite design solution to the road authority , rather it provides experienced practitioners with standardised information about the road along with suggestions so that they can develop the best solutions based on their experience and local knowledge . 
@@1028799 <h> How vulnerable are smart cities to cyberattack ? <p> Smart city solutions utilise complex , networked assemblages of digital technologies and ICT infrastructure to manage various city systems and services. - Any device that relies on software to function is vulnerable to being hacked. - If a device is networked , then the number of potential attack points multiples across the network , and the hack can be performed remotely ( 1 ) . Once a single device is compromised , then the whole assemblage becomes vulnerable to cyberattacks that seek to alter , disrupt , deceive , degrade or destroy computer systems and networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks ' ( 2 ) . <p> There are three forms of cyberattack : availability attacks that seek to close a system down or deny service use ; confidentiality attacks that seek to extract information and monitor activity ; and integrity attacks that seek to enter a system to alter information and settings ( such as changing settings so that components exceed normal performance , erasing critical software , or planting malware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smart city systems is exacerbated by a number of issues including weak security and encryption ; the use of insecure legacy systems and poor maintenance ; large and complex attack surfaces and interdependencies ; cascade effects ; and human error and disgruntled ( ex ) employees ( 19 ) . - The result is that the process of making city systems and infrastructures smart ' has also made them vulnerable to a suite of cyber-threats ( 4,5,6 ) . <p> Cyberattacks can target every type of smart city solution and particular system components . There are a number of weak points " including SCADA systems , the sensors and microcontrollers of the Internet of Things , and communication networks and telecommunication switches . <p> SCADA systems Various forms of urban infrastructure , including the electricity grid , water supply , and traffic control , rely on SCADA ( supervisory control and data acquisition ) systems that are used to control functions and flow ( 4 ) . -

As a consequence , many deployments are quite dated. - Many have been found to operate with their original security codes ( 13 ) . - In some cases , while the infrastructure is relatively secure , the communications network is vulnerable ( 4 ) . - A number of SCADA systems have been compromised , with hackers altering how the infrastructure performs , or causing a denial-of-service , or have stolen data. - Probably the most infamous SCADA hack was the 2009 Stuxnet attack on Iran 's uranium enrichment plant in which the system was infected by malware that destroyed a number of centrifuges by running them beyond their design specifications ( 12 ) . - By 2010 over 90,000 Stuxnet infections were reported in 115 countries ( 5 ) . <p> Internet of Things The Internet of Things refers to the connecting together of machine-readable , uniquely identifiable objects across the Internet. -

Moreover , sensors can be embedded into the urban fabric and throughout critical infrastructures to produce data concerning location , proximity , velocity , temperature , flow , acceleration , sound , vision , force , load , torque , pressure , and interactions ' ( 13 ) . - Sensors and microcontrollers are hackable as they often have little effective security , encryption , or privacy protocols in place. - RFID chips , for example , can be hacked , jammed and spoofed ( 13 ) . <p> Communication networks and telecommunication switches The Internet of Things are linked together via a number of communications technologies and protocols such as 4G LTE ( Long Term Evolution ) , GSM ( Global System for Mobile communication ) , CDMA ( Code Division Multiple Access ) , WiFi , bluetooth , RFID ( Radio-Frequency Identification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open wireless standard ) , and Z-Wave ( wireless communication ) . -

For example , a cyberattack on a key toll road in Haifa , Israel , closed it for eight hours causing major traffic disruption ( 9 ) . - A research team from the University of Michigan managed to hack and manipulate more than a thousand traffic lights in one city using a laptop and wireless radio ( 15 ) . -

A recent Wired article details how two hackers were able to remotely hack a car through its Internet computer that controls entertainment and navigation systems , facilitates phone calls and can provide a wifi hotspot , using it as a route to replace firmware that enabled them to take control of the car 's internal computer network. -

Given the potential cascade effects of shutting down the electricity grid , it has been a key point of cyberattack . Electricity grid utilities in the US report being under near constant cyberattack , with one utility recording that it was the target of approximately 10,000 cyberattacks each month ( all five commissioners of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission agree that the threat of a cyber-attack on the electric grid is the top threat to electricity reliability in the United States ) ( 8 ) . - The Israel Electric Corp . reports that its servers register about 6,000 unique computer attacks every second , with other critical infrastructure also under continuous cyberattack ( 9 ) . - As smart grids and smart meters are installed , the number of potential access points to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters themselves can be hacked with low-cost tools and readily available software to alter proof of consumption or to steal energy from other users ( 1 , 14 ) . <p> Building management systems Building management systems are often considered an aspect of property services rather than IT services and cybersecurity is not a key issue in purchase or operation ( 18 ) . - The consequence is weakly protected systems , often still configured with manufacturer codes. - Moreover manufacturers often do not have processes in place for responding to vulnerabilities or a notification process to inform customers about security threats ( 18 ) . - The vulnerabilities of building management systems pose two main threats. - The first is that if they are hacked building operations could be disrupted and safety risks created. - The second is that they provide a potential route for breaking into enterprise business systems and critical company data if they share the same network. - In the case of the Target data breach in which over 100 million customer details were stolen it appears that the retailer did not properly segment its data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained its heating , ventilation and air conditioning ( HVAC ) system ( 18 ) . <p> Cameras Cities are full of a plethora of CCTV cameras ; some owned and controlled privately , others by public authorities and police services. - The security of these cameras is highly variable , with some lacking encryption or usernames and passwords , and others open to infection by malware and firmware modification ( 20 ) . - Accessing a camera provides a means to spy on individuals , such as viewing home presence or using a bank ATM camera to monitor the digits being pressed. - Demonstrating the scale of the issue , one website provides access to the feeds of thousands of unsecured or poorly secured cameras ( uses admin passwords ) from 152 countries ( 21 ) . - Cameras can also be turned off , with some lacking the function to be restarted remotely ( 19 ) . <p> Many cyberattacks are relatively inconsequential , such as probes and address scans , and are unsuccessful , while a small number are much more significant and involve a security breach. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gas , energy and manufacturing companies nearly 70 percent reported at least one security breach that led to the loss of confidential information or disruption of operations in the previous 12 months ; 78 percent expected a successful attack on their ICS ( industrial control systems ) or SCADA systems in the next two years ( 10 ) . - In 2012 , 23 gas pipeline companies were hacked and source code and blueprints to facilities stolen ( 7 ) . - Between 2010 and 2014 , the US Department of Energy ( that oversees the US power grid , nuclear arsenal , and national labs ) documented 1,131 cyberattacks , of which 159 were successful ( 11 ) . - In 53 cases these attacks were root compromises ' , meaning that the attackers gained administrative privileges to computer systems , stealing various kinds of personnel and operational information ( 11 ) . <p> Cyberattacks can be performed by hostile nations , terrorist groups , cyber-criminals , hacker collectives , and individual hackers. - Former FBI director , Robert Mueller , details that 108 nations have cyberattack units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - The majority of attacks are presently being repulsed using cybersecurity tools , or their effects have been disruptive or damaging but not critical for the long term delivery of services ( 3 ) . - Indeed , it needs to be recognised that to date , successful cyberattacks on cities are still relatively rare and when they have occurred their effects generally last no more than a few hours or involve the theft of data rather than creating life threatening situations. - That said , it is clear that there is a cybersecurity arms race underway between attackers and defenders , and that more severe disruption of critical infrastructure has been avoided through the threat of mutually assured destruction between nations ( 22 ) . - This is not to suggest that smart city initiatives should be avoided , but rather that the cybersecurity challenges of creating secure smart cities should be taken seriously. - It is likely that cyberattacks will increase over time , they will become more sophisticated , and that they have the potential to cause significant disruption to city services and the wider economy and society ( 5 ) .

Take your time reading it and do n't be put off if you encounter words and terms that are unfamiliar to you . These terms will become clearer as you read on . The chapter outlines the background and assumptions for many of the techniques and suggestions put forward in later chapters . Without some knowledge of philosophy or context , technique can become an empty process . Philosophy provides principles that can act as a guide when procedural advice does not address a particular issue . You might like to read this chapter at the start of your thesis process , But it is likely that you will dip into it from time to time , as certain questions arise out of the process of researching and writing the thesis .

@@1028814 <h> Summary <p> This is a copy of the last letter from Roger Casement ( 1864-1916 ) to his sister Nina ( 1856-1954 ) . In the letter he expresses deep regret for the way he treated his sister and neglected her in recent years . He talks about his time in Germany and the justification for his actions , describes his joy at landing on Banna Strand , asks to be remembered to friends and mentions his cousins , Elizabeth and Gertrude Bannister ( d.1950 ) , with affection and gratitude for their support . He also expresses thanks to his friend , Alice Stopford Green ( 1847-1929 ) . He signs off as Roddie , ' or as you always called me Scodgie ' . <p> Sir Roger Casement was a humanitarian and Irish Nationalist . Casement believed that an Irish insurrection would be crushed unless it received substantial assistance from Germany . He spent eighteen months in Germany , arriving first as an envoy of Irish-American leaders , attempting to encourage Germany to support Irish separatist aspirations by providing arms . Casement succeeded in securing limited German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers in German prisoner of war camps to fight against Britain was largely unsuccessful .

He was tried in the Old Bailey for treason and subsequently executed by hanging at Pentonville Prison on 3 August 1916 . <h> Share &amp; Feedback <p> This may be , probably it will be the last letter I shall write you . I have put off writing , because the things I wish to say to you are so hard to say for others to read . I had hoped that a chance might yet come before I died to tell you with my lips what now I can say only in this way . It wrings my heart to leave you , beyond all else on earth , and to leave you thus , without being able to show you all I feel for you , and all the keen and bitter sorrow I feel at having left you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . Oh ! had I known I should never see you again how differently I might have acted ! For I always meant to tell you that I was very very sorry I had not been gentler to you and kinder to you in these last years . Now the memory of my neglect of you , dearest , loving , faithful one as you always have been to me , cuts my heart in two and sends me from this Oh ! that I could tell you all I think of you , and how in my heart I have always cared for you more than for anyone else . Every time I was rude to you , or spoke roughly to you , I was sorry for it afterwards , and often I came back to tell you so , but some little word turned me inwards on myself , and I kept silent , and so that time passed and the next - and the next , and you never knew that all the time I was calling myself a brute and a coward . Especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day in Berkshire when I said such unkind things to you in your cottage . Oh ! dearest of my heart , forgive me forgive me and believe that I have bitterly repented - not once - not to-day only but a hundred times . Often and often in Germany the memory of that day came upon me , and my heart nearly suffocates me with pain . You said once I was all that you had to love , and I left you without a word and now you are alone and I can never see you again to tell you how much I loved you even when I scolded you . It was my pride , my sinful cowardly pride , that kept me from you or from confessing , each time my conscience reproached me , and now the eternal separation has come , and I must face the agony of death with this bitter agony at my heart that I was unkind and forgetful and rough to you , not once but many times . From the deep of my heart I yearn to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the years roll away from me and I stand beside you just as I did a little boy when you comforted me and took me by the hand - and so I would have you think of me now at the last , for you always are the same . No words I can write can tell you what I feel for you and what anguish fills me to think I shall never see you again or be able to tell you , and to show you my sorrow . For your sake now I would undo all I have done - unsay all I have said - humiliate myself beyond belief and be a gibe and a jeer to all men , anything if I could make you happy in your old days and let you know that always , always deep in my heart and soul , I sorrowed when I hurt you by look or word , and that now there is no reproach I do not lay upon myself and feel for having left you alone and been the cause of your flight and exile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall die thinking of you , praying for you , longing to God and His infinite mercy to comfort you and sustain you , and if he will it to bring us together where we shall indeed be both little children once more . Now dearest do you know what I feel for you ? My eyes are blinded with tears and I can scarcely write . All my selfishness has passed away , and I see you plain and clear - your face - your eyes - your heart , and I can only sob and say that you are more to me than all else on earth , and to undo , and to aid you and to comfort you there is nothing I would not do , but alas ! alas ! it is all too late and I must go from you without a word . The bitterness of death has been upon me now these many days , but nothing like to-day and the bitterness is in this vain remorse at all my neglect of you and leaving you alone in the world when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God may forgive me my sins - I can never never forgive myself this sin of neglect and coldness - and I love you all the time - there is the mystery of transgression - we wound what we love and shun what we long for and go on our cold and lonely path , thinking there is plenty of time to go back to the loved ones - and Death comes and cuts us down . <p> Now that I have only these few days to live - that a cruel fate has brought me to the grave so far from you I bow my head in your lap , as I did when a little boy , and say Kiss me and say Goodnight . Were life spared me , I should live for you , but God wills my death . I prayed for death often and often in Germany , I was so unhappy and months before I started to return to Ireland , coming as I knew straight to death , I was fixed on it and begging for death . For I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I walked about as if in a dream and every day the future whispered here 's but death . I was so lonely , and I could do nothing and go nowhere . Often I tried to get away . All last year I was trying again and again . Twice I tried in the spring and winter . In January I set out for Norway at the end but had to turn back . In March and April I planned another route , but could not carry it through , ( and this was the time I was said to be be at Limburg ! ) And then in July I actually again set out and got a passport to go but had to return to stand by those poor chaps and help them altho ' it was not I recruited them or " tempted " them at all . I never saw one of them ( or only one of them ) in my life until I found them enrolled by others , and I could not help it or do anything but take all responsibility on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a certain quarter ( a high one ) to help me get away - but it failed and so on twice more to December last . I sought to go if possible , and then gave up the hope , until in February of this year it was revived , when I was i 'll in Munich , and perhaps you know about that , because a friend , a woman , went over then with a message to you . I hope you saw her - Mary was her name , a good friend and true . <p> And then when I was waiting for the result of that attempt to go to you , came the call to Ireland and I went , intending to go alone . The friend who came with me , came by his own insistence , because he would not let me come alone , and I could not stop him , and he brought Bailey at the latter 's wish too . When I landed in Ireland that morning ( about 3 a.m. ) swamped and swimming ashore on an unknown strand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Although I knew that this fate waited on me , I was for one brief spell happy and smiling once more . I can not tell you what I felt . The sandhills were full of skylarks , rising in the dawn , the first I had heard for years - the first sound I heard through the surf was their song as I waded in through the breakers , and they kept rising all the time up to the old rath at Currahone where I stayed and sent the others on , and all round were primroses and wild violets and the singing of the skylarks in the air , and I was back in Ireland again ; as the day grew brighter I was quite happy for all I felt all the time it was God 's will that I was there . The only person alive - if he be alive , who knows the whole story of my coming , and why I came , with what aims and hope , is Monteith . I hope he is alive and that you may see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will know that the very thing I am blamed for , and am dying for , was quite what you would have wished me to do . It is a cruel thing to die with all men misunderstanding - mispprehendingand to be silent for ever . I left a letter with a friend that will tell you a great deal of the truth - not all - but part of it some day and perhaps some of it you know already . There was a young German came to see me off - a friend whom I am grateful to - and I hope his name too has reached you . He was the only one . If I could only tell you the whole story , but , that too , is part of my punishment - of the strange inscrutable fate that has come to me - that I am not only being put to death in the body but that I am dead before I die - and have to be silent and silent just as if I were already dead - when a few words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's view of my actions . Long ago , years ago , I wrote these lines of another - but they are my own - my epitaph on my own fate perhaps more than on that of the man I penned them of : " In the mystery of transgression is a cloud that shadows Day , For the night to turn to Fire - showing Death 's redeeming way " . <p> Will Death bring for me the reedeeming way ? I sought it thus - and now I stand on the shore , wondering , with clasped hands and blinded eyes , and no path opens in the waters any my heart is cold with sorrow and pain and numb with longing for a peace that will not come . If only I could have kissed you again and asked your pardon and told you with my lips and tongue how dear you always were to me . But I tell you now and I pray that God Almighty may soften the hearts of all around you and give you friends and friendship and loving care and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very near to you and thinking of you stedfastly , as my truest and loving companion of years ago . Had I years of life I would give them all for you now dearest . Tell all my friends around youyou know the principal ones - that I grieve much that I was such a nuisance to them . They were far too good to me . For the old friend , my affection and gratitude for all he tried to do for me - and for all he did ; and for the one with the two children and the doggie - my sincerest greeting . Old Father Gerald too - all of them and Father John and so many more . They were true and staunch friends - I would I were worthy of their friendship . Ask the friend with the two children and the doggie to never forget me and let the children go on and pray for me just as they did of old .

And now , I must tear myself away - it is God 's will , dearest Nina - I am going to lie down , it is late and my last thought to-night will be of you .

@@1028898 <p> Maybe it should , maybe it should n't . But the arguments Mr. Liebmann puts forward make a very poor defense for his position . <p> First , Mr. Liebmann tells us that Taney " died a poor man . " Taney was Chief Justice of the United States for over 25 years . During that time , he was paid a princely and regular salary of $5,000 per year , and $6,500 per year after 1855 . <p> At the time of Taney 's death , his savings , property and other investments amounted to so little that the Maryland bar took a up a collection for his surviving daughters . Dying poor and leaving your children without means when you had had so many opportunities to do them well is not a sign of virtue . It is a sign of neglect and irresponsibility . <p> Second , Mr. Liebmann says that Taney manumitted his slaves , and that after doing so , he stated : " I am glad to say that none of those who I manumitted disappointed my expectations , but have shown by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to use it . " <p> Exactly why should we care about Taney 's personal expectations in regard to his former slaves ? The measure of a decent post-slave society is not what the former master thinks of what the former slave made of his subsequent life , but what the former slave thinks of the former master and what , if anything , the former master did to help the slave adjust to his new circumstances . <p> If one of Taney 's former slaves thought Taney deserved a statue , that would be telling . But Mr. Liebmann makes no such claim . <p> Finally , Mr. Liebmann tells us that Dred Scott was not the sum total of Taney 's judicial achievement . Instead , he asks us to focus on Taney 's opinion in Ex parte Merryman ( 1861 ) . But Merryman does not help Mr. Liebmann 's or Taney 's cause , and this is not surprising because very few commentators understand the case including Mr. Liebmann . <p> In 1861 , after Fort Sumter fell , the U.S. Army seized John Merryman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detained him at Fort McHenry in Baltimore . Merryman 's lawyers sought a writ of habeas corpus . <p> After a hearing , Taney determined that the Army had violated the Constitution by seizing and detaining Merryman absent due process . Taney offered much flowing language the sort that endears him to do-gooders and starry-eyed civil libertarians . <p> But that is all Taney did : He offered pieties in a judicial opinion . The reality is that Taney did not grant Merryman habeas corpus . In other words , Taney did not order the Army , or the commander at Fort McHenry , or the president or anyone else to release Merryman . <p> It 's possible the Army would not have obeyed such an order from the court in any case . But we will never know because Taney never issued one . <p> This reading of Merryman is not my idiosyncratic reading ; rather , it is the position of several prominent modern commentators , including : Brian McGinty ( 2011 ) ; Bruce A. Ragsdale ( 2007 ) ; and Jack Stark ( 2002 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts refused to order the Army to release civilians detained by federal troops absent traditional due process . <p> For example , Judge Betts , for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ( 1861 ) , and Chief Justice Dixon , for the Supreme Court of Wisconsin ( 1863 ) , offered detained Americans only civil-libertarian pieties in gracefully written opinions , but these judges granted detainees no actual concrete relief . None . Moreover , in order to justify their inaction , Betts and Dixon relied upon Taney 's Merryman opinion ! In short , Merryman was a precedent for leaving those detained by the Army in jail ; it was not grounds for any relief . <p> The bottom line is that those who value civil liberties during wartime will find nothing of substance in Ex parte Merryman .

This article tries to capture some of those new meanings and to raise some issues for exploration . It can not do justice to the entire scope of the field but it will consider three broad areas in relation to these trends . Firstly , it takes a brief look at the growth and development of community education in Ireland . Secondly , it explores the impact of community education on learning in a post-modern knowledge based society . Finally , it traces the role it has played in the emergence of communitarianism as a social movement in Ireland .

@@1028951 <h> Abstract <p> This study analyses the evolution of the contemporary women 's movement in the Republic of Ireland , from the foundation of the State to the present day . Drawing on a social movement 's perspective , the emergence , consolidation and transformation of the Women 's Movement in that period is explored . To date , there has been no systematic attempt at understanding the central processes and dynamics underlying the Irish Women 's Movement . This study seeks to address that deficit by illuminating the processes through which the Women 's Movement , and , in particular its constituent organisations , came to fruition as agencies of social change . The central argument advanced is that fundamentally the women 's movement in Ireland is characterised by its interconnectedness : the central tensions , themes and organising strategies of the movement interpenetrate not only across different social movement organisations , but across time and space . The movement 's development is conceptualised in terms of four stages : A period of A b eyance which lasted from the Civil War until the end of the 1960s ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Re-appraisal of the women 's movement from within , which occurred during the 1980s ; and the New Directions which manifested themselves particularly in the community sector in the late 1980s and 1990s . The study demonstrates the continuities which link the movement and its constituent organisations across these four stages of development . A key theme is the continual process of formalisation , which has had the effect of incorporating radical organisations on the margins of the Women 's Movement into the mainstream . Parallels can be drawn between the period of advancement in the 1970s , and the new kinds of consolidation and formalisation occurring in the 1990s . While the key analytical framework drawn on is resource mobilisation , considerable modifications are made to the model in its application to the Irish Women 's Movement . The movement 's trajectory can not adequately be documented without paying attention to the political opportunity structure , the potential for the development of external alliances , the existence of sympathetic elites and the role of ideology both as a source of conflict and as a valuable resource . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish social movements . There has been no previous attempt to explain the evolution , form and processes of the women 's movement from a sociological perspective . The method of analysis allows for tracing the continuities underlying the movement from the inception of the State to the present day , and challenges the received view that the women 's movement ' happened ' in Ireland as part of a generalised modernisation trend in the post-1960 era . This work provides a blueprint for the analysis of other historical and contemporary social movements in an Irish context .
