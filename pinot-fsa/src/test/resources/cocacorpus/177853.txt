But acne inflammation is not necessarily caused by acne bacteria , and blemishes that are not red , itchy , tender , or painful can still be inflamed . <h> Summary : <p> Acne bacteria do not cause acne inflammation . The immune systems response to them does . <p> You can fight inflammation before it ever starts by keeping pores open . <p> Different skin types need different treatments . <p> The darker your skin , the more important it is both ( 1 ) to fight acne infection as soon as you see it but also ( 2 ) to avoid irritating the skin in the process . " Calming " the skin helps reduce inflammation on fair , dry , tight skin . <p> Hydrating the skin is useful for Asian skin . <p> African-American and Hispanic skin types require immediate treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gentle disinfectants . <h> Acne Bacteria and Acne Inflammation <p> Acne bacteria usually get the blame for acne inflammation , but they do not really injure the skin . Instead , they secrete chemicals that make surrounding skin cells sensitive to inflammation generated by the immune system itself . Destruction of the skin gives them an escape route to travel to new home . <p> In fact , small numbers of acne bacteria are actually beneficial to the skin . The skin makes sebum to keep itself flexible and to keep itself from drying out . Many of the things people to do " dry out " their acne actually increase the production of sebum , swabbing the skin with rubbing alcohol , for instance . When the skin is stressed or stretched or inflamed , sebaceous glands near pores produce more sebum to protect the skin . When the body as a whole is stressed , the brain releases corticotrophin stimulating hormone , which also triggers production of excessive sebum . <p> Acne bacteria feed on sebum to keep it from accumulating faster than pores can transport it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As long as the pore is filled with fresh , liquid sebum , the bacteria can feed and multiply . As sebum ages , however , it releases essential fatty acids . These are beneficial to the skin , but toxic to bacteria . The skin regulates the number of bacteria in pores , keeping the population of bacteria the right size to be helpful " until pores get clogged . <p> It is a common misconception that bacteria in clogged pores irritate the skin . Actually , they do n't  . The immune systems efforts to kill the bacteria that ca n't be killed by the breaking down of sebum is what inflames pores and causes acne . The bacteria secrete chemicals that make the skin more sensitive to a substance called interleukin-8 . Then when corticotrophin stimulating hormone causes the release of histamine from mast cells in the skin , the interleukin-8 attracts it to the lining of the pores . The inflammation of the pore creates an escape route for acne bacteria to get to the surface and travel to a friendlier pore . <h> Fighting Acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually involved in acne inflammation tells some very important things about why traditional methods of fighting acne often backfire : <p> Acne inflammation can occur with or without acne bacteria . Stress hormones can also trigger the release of histamine , which reddens and irritates the skin . <p> Any acne treatment that also kills healthy skin cells triggers release of more sebum " which leads to more acne . <p> Worrying about acne bacteria also increases inflammation of the skin . And many children , teens , and adults who have persistent acne understandably worry about their appearance ! <p> Moreover , a product that fights acne bacteria on one skin type can cause acne inflammation on another . <p> Asian and African skin types are especially sensitive to detergent cleaners . Anything that generates lots of suds containing big bubbles does remove oil and bacteria , but also injures the skin so it produces more oil that becomes food for more bacteria . People of European descent tend to be especially sensitive to essential oils . White skin responds to stress hormones . Essential oils activate the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , but if you have fair skin , an essential oil or aromatherapy product that relaxes your brain often excites your skin . If it smells good , do n't  put it on your skin ! <p> People of Hispanic descent tend to have an all-or-nothing experience with acne . They tend either to have no acne at all , or to develop cystic acne in early adulthood . Products that stimulate the production of collagen in the skin can actually make cystic acne much worse . <p> Acne inflammation leads to discoloration of darker skin . The skin fights inflammation with the pigment melanin . Darker skins have more cells that produce melanin , and tend to overproduce melanin in their efforts to control inflammation . Acne and harsh acne treatments , as well as cuts , scrapes , bruises , and other skin infections , can cause lasting discoloration of brown or black skin . <h> So How Can You Fight Acne Inflammation ? <p> The most important thing to remember about fighting inflammation caused by acne is to treat inflammation , not oiliness or what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have clear skin that feels good , not skin that is free of bacteria or free of oil . Accomplishing this objective requires choosing treatments that are right for your skin type . <p> " Calming " the skin is especially important if you have fair , tight , or allergy-prone skin . Any easy way to do this is with water . A splash of any kind of bottled mineral water ( Perrier , Pelegrino , or even Topo Chico ) on to the face after you have cleansed it but before you put on moisturizer and make up provides magnesium that slows down the release of stress chemicals in the skin . Certain facial waters also provide sulfur to kill bacteria and selenium to help the skin make antioxidant enzymes , but you want to be sure the facial water contains just water , not any herbs , plant essences , essential oils , or perfumes . <p> Hydrating the skin is especially important " and often overlooked " if you have Asian skin . It is important to avoid alcohol or detergents of any kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to lock in moisture with light applications of water-based or even oil-based moisturizers . <p> Fighting acne infection early is important for people who have Hispanic or Mediterranean skin types , and for Black men who shave their heads or shave their beards too close . These skin types repair injuries quickly , often trapping bacteria inside cysts . Using a gentle antiseptic such as a 2.5% ( or milder ) concentration of benzoyl peroxide at the very first sign of a pimple is important in these skin types . But it is also important to avoid treatments that sting or burn the skin , since they can cause discoloration . Some skin types cant stand peels , but they respond well to lemon juice , fresh-squeezed rather than from a bottle . The lemon juice breaks down oils on the skin , letting acne bacteria escape , reducing the need for inflammation to fight infection . <p> Does all this get a little too complicated ? The easiest way to treat acne inflammation is to use a complete skin care system like Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923

The fragrance can cause irritation that cancels out the benefits of the sulfur . <h> Sulfur for Treating Infections <p> From ancient times through the eighteenth century , sulfur was used as a fumigant to fight " vapors " that were thought to cause disease . Tossed on a open flame , yellow sulfur released noxious fumes that can kill bacteria , parasites , and people . As early as 5,000 years ago , the ancient Egyptians used a salve made with sulfur to treat both acne and eczema , and Traditional Chinese Medicine was using sulfur in skin care before the reign of the Yellow Emperor , some 2,200 years ago . <p> Sulfur is still used to treat acne . Since the 1950s , sulfur has been available in the form of a 5% sulfur foam that is applied directly to broken skin . The foam also contains 10% sodium sulfacetamide to make the product emollient without clogging pores and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast while it softens the skin . <p> The drawback to sulfur foams is that they smell bad . And when they are mixed with fragrance to make the product smell good , the result is reddening and irritation of both healthy skin and acne-affected skin . <h> Who Benefits Most from Sulfur for Acne ? <p> The best application of sulfur foams is for treating acne on Asian skin . Here are some real case histories of the the use of sulfur for treating acne on Asian skin . <p> A thirty-five year-old Asian woman came to see her doctor about acne that had been breaking out " on and off " ever since she was a teenager . Another doctor had tried to treat the acne by adjusting her oral birth control medication , but there was no change in the frequency of her outbreaks . Then she had tried to treat her acne with 5% benzoyl peroxide , but with no benefits to her skin . <p> When this woman went to see her second dermatologist , she had 27 pimples and 14 blackheads on- her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> 5% sulfur-10% sodium sulfacetamide form every morning with <p> 0.04% topical tretinoin at night . <p> In the United States , both products are available over-the-counter , although it is easier to find topical tretinoin in the 0.05% strength . <p> The first few days , this patient experienced mild itchiness , especially around her eyes . The itchiness stopped in the first week and she was able to continue both medications without interruption . At the end of eight weeks her complexion was not completely clear , but she had only three pimples and three whiteheads , all other blemishes having resolved . <p> A thirteen year-old Asian boy had had acne for a year that was not responding well to the combination of benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin . The doctor took him off these treatments , and prescribed sulfur foam in the morning plus 0.04% topical tretinoin in the evening . At the end of eight weeks , his 23 pimples had been reduced to 16 , and his 31 whiteheads and blackheads had been reduced to 13 . <p> A 29-year-old Asian woman had intermittent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported that she had been frustrated by the failure of 0.025% topical tretinoin plus 4% benzoyl peroxide to make any difference in her skin . Like the other two patients , this woman was told to use 0.04% topical tretinoin in the morning and sulfur foam at night . <p> At the end of two months , her acne was gone . She also reported that sulfur foam seemed to be a good match to skin tones in her face , and that previously existing acne spots were far less noticeable than they had been before . <h> Will Sulfur Foam Work If You Do n't  Have Asian Skin ? <p> Asian skin makes just one kind of melanin pigment , while other skin types make two or three . On other skin types , sulfur usually makes the skin look red , but on Asian skin , sulfur brings out natural skin tones . There is every reason to believe that sulfur foam and facials that include sulfur as an ingredient will kill acne bacteria on any kind of skin , but they are best at improving the appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be useful in treating back acne ( also known as bacne ) on other skin types . For treating back acne , it is usually not necessary to use topical tretinoin . A combination of sulfur-sulfur acetamide foam in the morning and benzoyl peroxide treatment in the evening peels dead skin around pores in the back , and kills acne bacteria so that the skin of the back can heal itself . Because sulfur foam is a moisturizer , it will work equally well on both pimples and blackheads on the back . This also helps it work well when it is used with topical tretinoin , which may dry out the skin . <h> Where Do You Find Sulfur for Fighting Acne ? <p> Foaming sulfur is usually labeled as Pomada de Azufre . It is extremely cheap , less than US $4 for a months supply . Even though the product is a " pomade , " it is intended for the skin , not the hair . A product called Bye Bye Blemish also provides 10% sulfur , and costs only US $6 for a one-month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea when using any product that contains sulfur . A few people are allergic to it . Test a dot of the product on the skin of your forearm , leaving it there for several hours , before putting it on your face . Do n't  use the product on your face if it causes irritation on your arm . <p> Also , do n't  get any kind of sulfur product on jewelry . It can blacken both silver and gold . <p> Some users report that sulfur foams and scrubs shrink pimples quickly , and others report that they seem to " bring them to a head " so that they pop open . Probably , the tighter your skin , the more likely you are to have a one-day increase in the size of pimples followed by rapid healing . Stop using the product , of course , if it makes your skin tingle , sting , or burn , or if redness is noticeably worse . <p> I 'm not Asian ( I 'm Caucasian ) and had the same issue as the example of the first woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor prescribing worked .

There is no right way to squeeze pimples ! But there are ways to get rid of pimples and other acne blemishes on the skin . <h> Summary : <p> A pimple is a pore that has been inflamed . <p> Its not just acne bacteria that cause pimples . The inflammation actually comes from the immune system , not from the bacteria . <p> Squeezing pimples can force acne bacteria deeper into the skin . <p> Acne bacteria can be covered by healthy pink skin that wont let them escape , trapping them under the skin . <p> Trapping acne bacteria transforms pimples into cysts . <p> Squeezing pimples always makes them worse . <p> The redness , itchiness , and inflammation of a pimple is caused by the immune system , not by acne bacteria . The bacteria just sensitize the skin to the immune system so it will give them an exit to the surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly used over-the-counter products complement each other , each one picking up where the other leaves off . <h> Why Squeezing Pimples Is a Bad Idea <p> Squeezing pimples is always a bad idea . Part of the problem is that pimples are not inflamed by bacteria . Pimples are inflamed by the immune system . <p> A pimple differs from a whitehead or blackhead by the presence of inflammation . Pimples , whiteheads , and blackheads all trap acne bacteria inside pores . When the immune system detects acne trapped in the skin , it attempts to destroy them by secreting chemicals called cytokines , especially two cytokines known as IL-6 and IL-8 ( the latter chemical also known as CXCL8 ) . <p> These cytokines destroy not just bacteria , but also the skin cells around them . That is the reason you feel itching and sometimes pain in a pimple , and they look red . If the immune system does not attack the bacteria , there is no pimple . <p> Squeezing a pimple does not get all the bacteria out of the skin . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not be reached by the kinds of antibacterial products you put on your skin , but the immune system continues to try to get rid of them by secreting inflammatory chemicals . The bacteria fight back by secreting chemicals that make the skin cells surrounding them more sensitive to inflammation than the bacteria themselves , so the area of inflammation can grow and grow and grow . <p> Squeezing a pimple also destroys the pores first line of defense against bacteria , which is the very same sebum that causes clogs . The sebum-making cells in the skin release fat in the form of triglycerides . These are creamy compounds that are also used as a skin-identical ingredient . <p> The triglycerides released by the skin quickly break down into free fatty acids . The free fatty acids can dissolve acne bacteria . If you squeeze a pimple , however , you kill the cells that make the triglycerides that turn into the free fatty acids that keep a whitehead or a blackhead from turning into a pimple . <h> A Better Way to Treat Pimples <p> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to treat pimples . <p> The first thing you need to do is to encourage your skins production of the chemicals that protect it . These chemicals can work even when the pore is red and inflamed . In fact , the skins own chemicals usually do most of the real work of healing a pimple from the inside out . <p> What are these healing chemicals made by the skin ? As hard as it is to imagine in this era when fat is always supposed to be bad , the chemicals the skin uses to heal itself are fatty acids " but not just any fatty acids . <p> Lauric acid can kill 99% of acne bacteria in a pore . Palmitic acid can kill 99.99% of acne bacteria in a pore . Oleic acid can kill 99.999% of acne bacteria in a pore . <p> These fatty acids are neither the " good " n-3 essential fatty acids nor the " bad " n-6 essential fatty acids . They actually are not " essential " at all . Oleic acid is the fatty acid found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olive oil , most of the fat under your skin around your belly is oleic acid made by the body as it stores extra calories . <p> Palmitic acid is not as abundant in the human body as oleic acid , because it is just an intermediate step in making oleic acid . Palmitic acid , as you might imagine , is also found in palm kernel oil . <p> Lauric acid is found in coconut oil and palm kernel oil and people . Human breast milk is rich in lauric acid , although both males and females make lauric acid in breast tissue . <p> Lauric acid and palmitic acid fight acne bacteria . Oleic acid , the most abundant fatty acid in the human body , fights both acne and staph bacteria . Your body can fight acne with these fats . You do n't  put them on your skin . Your body sends them to your skin from the excess calories you eat every day in the form of triglycerides . <h> Does This Mean I Need to Eat More to Zap My Zits ? <p> Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crash diet makes acne worse ? With one important exception , this is really the case . Your body uses fat from food to make chemicals that kill infections . Eating enough calories " and not trying to lose weight by calorie restriction " helps your skin make the chemicals that it can use to heal itself . <p> There is one exception to this rule . That is acne that is caused by polycystic ovarian disease ( PCOS ) , a condition in women caused by overproduction of testosterone in the ovaries . Eating fewer calories improves insulin sensitivity in the rest of the body . ( The ovaries do n't  have an " off switch " to keep them from absorbing sugar from the bloodstream , but if the rest of the body absorbs sugar more efficiently , the ovaries absorb less . ) When the rest of the body uses sugar more efficiently because of lower insulin resistance , the ovaries make less testosterone , and acne clears up , along with other symptoms of the condition . <p> So do n't  squeeze your pimples . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your body has to have a small number of additional calories to fight acne infection . And that 's not all you can do : <p> 2 . Reduce redness with a dab of tea tree oil applied to the pimple with a clean cotton swab twice a day . Many products that smell good because they contain a little tea tree oil do n't  contain enough tea tree oil really to do any good . Its better to use pure tea tree oil on your skin . Do n't  take it by mouth , and keep the bottle out of reach of children . <p> 3 . Give you skin a second line of defense against infection with benzoyl peroxide . The combination of benzoyl peroxide and tea tree oil works better than either one alone . Start with just 2% benzoyl peroxide to make sure it does not cause peeling . <p> 4 . Do n't  try to dry out your skin . The problem in acne is never that your skin is too moist . Its always a problem of oil in pores . Even if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisturizer , especially across the cheeks and on the nose , in dry weather . Moisturizers help the skin maintain a natural color , and keep it soft so oil can flow out of pores . <p> 5 . Consider a gentle face peel . If you have dry skin , a fruit acid peel , also known as an alpha-hydroxy acid peel , is best . If you have oily skin , you will probably get better results from a beta-hydroxy acid peel . There is only one beta-hydroxy acid used in acne care . That is salicylic acid . <p> A word of caution for acne sufferers who have brown or black skin : Brown and black skin repairs itself by making pigment . Anything that irritates the skin can cause long-lasting or even permanent pigmentation . It is always important to be gentle with brown or black skin . <p> A pimple is a pore that has been inflamed .

And about 80% of pimples are caused by acne . <p> About 25% of adults have acne , too . <p> Pimples pop up when the immune system attacks bacteria in a pore . <p> It is n't just bacteria that cause pimples .

Popping red outcrops on your skin that look like pimples but are n't  can have disastrous consequences . <p> The best way to treat and beat pimples for good is to use a complete acne control system like Exposed Skin Care . <h> What Is Acne ? <p> Acne is a very common condition of the skin that makes it break out with various kinds of bumps . Sometimes acne just causes a pore to get clogged with a mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waxy skin secretion called sebum . This kind of acne is known as a whitehead . <p> When the plug of sebum is especially hard , its outermost edge can oxidize with exposure to the oxygen of the air . Oxidation of sebum turns it gray and then black , forming a blackhead . Both whiteheads and b blackheads can become inflamed and transform into pimples . <p> The inflammation that makes the pore pop out in a big red bump is triggered by acne bacteria , but not accomplished by acne bacteria . Acne bacteria actually belong on the skin . Most of the time they eat excess sebum so it flows out of pores without getting clogged . They break down the waxes made by the skin into essential fatty acids that in turn can nourish the skin . <p> Most of the time acne bacteria are actually beneficial for the skin , unless they get trapped in a pore under flakes of dead skin peeling off the lining of the pore . They can accumulate in the body of the pore and get the attention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by releasing inflammatory chemicals , but the bacteria release " chemotactic " chemicals of their own that cause the inflammation to destroys skin cells instead . This gives them a pathway for escape , and gives you an ugly pimple . <h> What Isnt Acne <p> Acne is not the only skin condition that can cause pimples on your face . The second most common skin condition that causes pimples is a bacterial infection known as impetigo . This is usually a disease of little kids , but anyone can get it at any age . <p> There are two kinds of impetigo . One kind of impetigo causes blisters that pop and leak dark yellow fluid after two or three days , leaving a hard brown crust that feels something like dry nail polish . This- kind of impetigo is known as bullous impetigo . <p> The other kind of impetigo causes blisters that grow together . They may be itchy for about a day , and then they pop , releasing a brown liquid . There can also be swollen lymph nodes . This kind of impetigo is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its usually a lot uglier than acne . Other ways you can tell the difference between impetigo and acne are : <p> You have to catch impetigo from someone else , but you do n't  catch acne . <p> Impetigo usually just lasts a few days , but acne lasts weeks , months , or years . <p> Impetigo is worst on the buttocks , but acne is worst on the face . <p> Impetigo breaks out where the skin has been broken . ( Dermabrasion treatments for acne sometimes lead to impetigo infections . ) Acne always starts in pores . <p> To treat impetigo , you have to kill the staph or strep bacteria that are causing the infection . Once you do this , impetigo is gone . To treat acne , killing acne bacteria may help a little , a lot , or nothing at all . <h> Treating Pimples with Antibiotics <p> If you go to the doctor for pimples treatment , probably the first medication you get will be some kind of antibiotic . Doctors like antibiotics because they work " at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing antibiotics can do for your skin is to kill most of the acne bacteria living in your pores and to stop the inflammation they trigger . Since whiteheads and blackheads are not caused by inflammation , killing bacteria will not do anything to resolve these kinds of blemishes . And even when bacteria are killed , redness and inflammation may stay behind . <p> Minocycline , which is most commonly sold under the trade names Dynacin and Minacin , is the antibiotic most often prescribed in the United States . It causes vertigo ( dizziness due to changes in fluid flow in the inner ear ) in about 30% of children , teens , and adults who use it . When it is taken as a systemic treatment , in the form of a pill , it can kill healthy bacteria in the colon and cause diarrhea . It can also stain teeth black or blue if they are still growing ( in users as old as 22 ) . However , the staining of the teeth slowly fades , usually over a period of about two years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 90 days . <p> Doxycycline , which is most commonly sold under the trade names Doryx or Vibramycin , is the antibiotic most often prescribed for treating acne in India and much of the Middle East . Like minocycline , it can cause staining of the teeth , and it is not to be used by people who have yeast infections , anemia , or liver disease . People who use doxycycline typically have about 62% fewer pimples in just 10 days . <p> Azithromycin , which is most commonly sold under the trade names Zithromax or Zmax , is offered after other antibiotics fail , although it is sometimes prescribed as the first line of treatment in India . Over half of people who use it develop diarrhea . It can also cause flatulence , nausea , burping , heartburn , vomiting , and abdominal cramps . People who use azithromycin , however , typically have about 74% fewer pimples in just 10 days . <p> Clindamycin is sold as clindamycin lotion or in pill form as Cleocin or Clindesse . It is often offered the first antibiotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used when there is concern about staining teeth . About 10% of people who use it get diarrhea . People who use clindamycin typically have about 60% fewer pimples after 12 weeks . <p> Erythromycin used to be the antibiotic most commonly prescribed for acne but acne bacteria have developed resistance to it . It is available in both pill form and as a cream , but it is most commonly prescribed as a cream ( so it does not cause stomach upset ) . The cream may get rid of up to 80% of pimples in two weeks , but the most resistant bacteria start growing back so that new pimples begin to develop in the third and fourth week and by the end of 90 days acne is as bad as when treatment is started . <p> Popping a pill to get rid of acne never gets rid of all your pimples , and having gas is at least as big a social problem as having acne . But antibiotics are not the only way to fight pimples . <h> Treating Pimples with Benzoyl Peroxide <p> The worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called benzoyl peroxide . It is not an antibiotic ; that is , it does not interfere with the metabolism of acne bacteria . Instead , it breaks down into hydrogen peroxide inside pores , which releases oxygen that burns the outer membrane around bacterial cells . <p> However , it can also burn the outer membrane around skin cells . Nonetheless , using a benzoyl peroxide usually gets rid of about 30% of pimples during the first week , another 20% of pimples the second week , and another 10% of pimples the third week . That 's about 60% of pimples with a product you can buy without seeing a doctor for about US $10 . <p> So why does n't  it get rid of the rest of your pimples ? The problem with benzoyl peroxide is that it tends to dry out the skin . Tiny flakes of dry skin block pores , and pimples form all over again . You get rid of pimples in one part of your face and get new pimples in another . You do n't  have as many pimples as when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because benzoyl peroxide is so inexpensive , it is usually worth a try . If you can , start with the weakest concentration of benzoyl peroxide you can find , preferably 2.5% or less . Save 5% to 10% benzoyl peroxide for spot treatments of stubborn pimples , and be sure not to get the gel on your hair or clothes , because the hydrogen peroxide it releases is a bleach . Or use both benzoyl peroxide and an antibiotic to treat pimples . But there is also a good herbal treatment for pimples . <h> Treating Pimples with Tea Tree Oil <p> Tea tree oil is , as you may have guessed , the essential oil extracted from the leaves and branches of the tea tree plant . Like benzoyl peroxide , tea tree oil kills acne bacteria . Unlike benzoyl peroxide , tea tree oil also gets rid of other kinds of skin infections , notably impetigo ( which is usually a staph infection of the skin ) , and it also removes redness and inflammation . <p> A 10% solution of tea tree oil will kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 72 hours . This allows the pore to begin to heal . Tea tree oil will take the redness out of a pimple overnight , and the swelling will go down after a week or two . This is a better result than you can get with any antibiotic or benzoyl peroxide . <p> However , most of the time , tea tree oil products contain 5% tea tree oil or less . That may be enough if you are using other acne products , too , but if 5% tea tree oil is all you are using to control acne , only about 45% of them will heal over six weeks . That 's why its important to use tea tree oil only as part of a complete acne treatment system , or to make sure you are getting at least 10% tea tree oil in the products you buy . The article on tea tree oil on this site tells you which products contain at least 10% tea tree oil . <h> Treating Pimples with Red and Blue Light <p> Pills , creams , gels , and lotions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also treat them with blue and red light , although light treatment is better for prevention than for cure . <p> The purpose of light treatment for acne is not to dry out your skin . The skin covering a pimple is too tough to let a pore dry out , and efforts to dry out healthy skin just leave it leathery and even more acne-prone that it was before treatment started . <p> The purpose of light treatment for acne is to kill acne bacteria and to reduce oil production . Visible blue light resonates with certain pigments in the outer cell membrane of the acne bacterium . It literally burns the protective layer off the bacteria , which either exhausts itself trying to repair its outer layer or goes into dormancy . <p> Red light reaches deeper into the skin , to the level of the sebaceous gland that makes the oily sebum that lubricates the skin but can clog pores . It has trouble penetrating a pimple , but even though it does not stop sebum production , it can kill more bacteria , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have fair skin , light therapy may be enough to clear up pimples " over about 8 to 12 weeks . If you have brown , Asian , or black skin , the benefits of light therapy will be less for existing pimples , although it will help prevent new pimples . The important thing to know when using light therapy is that many acne medications make the skin more sensitive to light , so you must not hold your face to close to the lamp that your skin dries out of burns . <h> What About Popping Pimples ? <p> Most teens and tweens who get acne really do n't  have the patience to wait three months or more just to get rid of half of their pimples . Its tempting to try to pop them . But do n't  . here 's why . <p> When you try to pop a pimple , or you lance it with a needle , you both press sebum out of the pore and force bacteria deeper into the pore . The bacteria that are forced down into your skin continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflammation , and continues to miss , damaging your skin . <p> Meanwhile , skin grows over the damaged pore and traps the bacteria inside . They keep growing even though your immune system is attacking them from all directions . A tiny knot called a nodule grows into a cyst that you can not rub or scrub or remove from your skin in any other way without risking still more infection and a scar . <p> Bizarre and bad things have happened to people while trying to pop pimples . One man in Germany tried to pop a pimple and suffered a stroke , when he broke a cholesterol plaque in his carotid artery . A soldier in Iraq tried to pop what he thought was a pimple and developed fever , chills , and night sweats . It turned out that he had leishmaniasis , a disease caused by sand flea bites , that can spread into the lymph glands and the spleen , and trying to pop a pimple forced the infection into his bloodstream . And both catpox and cowpox , viral infections related to smallpox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even farther through the body when popped . <p> There is also a kind of acne that is always made immediately worse by popping pimples , rosacea . The tiny red bumps of rosacea are n't  caused by oil and bacteria inside pores . They are caused by leakages of blood from weak blood vessels just under the skin . Smashing a blood vessel that is already weak will only make it bleed more . <p> If you have a pimple , chances are the worst that can happen if you popped it is creating a cyst or a scar . That 's bad enough . But if you are too impatient to wait for acne drugs to work , you can always hide your pimples until they heal . <h> Concealing Pimples <p> There are three main ways to conceal pimples . One way is extremely expensive and has potential side effects . Your dermatologist can give you an injection of cortisone , prednisone , prednisolone , or some other steroid medication directly into the pimple . It will start to shrink in just hours . The redness will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor injects the same site twice your skin may thin and turn permanently pale , creating a blemish that can be even more noticeable than a pimple . Each injection will cost you about US $100 , cash , since the procedure is not covered by insurance . <p> At the opposite extreme , you could just dab your pimples with a dot of milk of magnesia , the liquid used to treat constipation . The white of the milk of magnesia conceals the redness of the pimple , and the procedure costs less than US $0.10 , one thousand times less than a steroid injection . But it really only gets a good cosmetic result if your skin is the same color as milk of magnesia . <p> The most practical way to conceal pimples is with makeup . For US $20 or less , you can buy all the makeup you need to make pimples disappear until the makeup wears off . And you have your choice of a difficult concealer technique or an easy concealer technique . <p> The difficult concealer technique involves covering a red pimple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with foundation makeup in your skin tones . This method hides pimples more completely , but also interferes with their healing . And if you have oily skin , the layers of- makeup can sometimes separate so that you have a green pimple instead of a red pimple . The easier concealer technique involves covering the pimple with gold concealer if you have white skin or brown concealer if you have Asian , brown , or black skin tones . The concealer alone will help make the pimple less noticeable . For better results , conceal the concealer with a second layer of foundation makeup in your skin tones for an even finish to your skin . Use cream makeup if you have dry skin , or powder makeup if you have oily skin . <p> Makeup can make any kind of acne blemish less visible , but slower to heal . It is essential to cleanse your skin at night and to use your other treatments so that eventually they go away . But there is a way to reverse all your acne issues and keep skin clear for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skin Care <p> The best way to deal with pimples is to remove existing blemishes with a combination of cleansing your skin , peeling or exfoliating away dead skin that holds pores tight and traps sebum inside , reducing the inflammation that makes pimples red and enlarged , and smoothing away fine lines and small acne scars . You can accomplish this with half a dozen individual acne products that you try one by one , or your can treat acne-prone skin with a skin care system like Exposed Skin Care . <p> Exposed Skin Care is neither the least expensive nor the most expensive system for treating acne-prone skin but it may be the best . The makers of Exposed Skin Care claim that 98% of users have essentially clear skin in 30 days or less , because of the combination of skin treatments that both heals and protects the skin at the same time .

@@98778505 @2978505/ <h> Could Moisturizer Be the Answer to Your Acne Issue ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Common sense tells us that curing acne is matter of drying up the skin . Countless skin care experts tell us that everyone who has acne needs a moisturizer . And both pieces of advice are correct in their own way . <p> If you have acne , especially if you have the kind of acne that causes tiny red pimples on your forehead cheeks , and nose , you may see great improvement in your skin when you begin to use moisturizer . If you have naturally oily skin that gives you lots of whiteheads and great big blackheads , you also may occasionally need moisturizer . But not everybody who has acne needs the same moisturizer in the same amounts all the time . <h> Summary : <p> It used to be considered common sense that curing acne required " drying up " the skin . Now it is known that blue and red rays in sunlight did the healing , not desiccation of the skin . <p> Alcohol dries the skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin helps keeps pores open so blemishes do not form . <p> Over-use of alcohol-based " moisturizers " can make acne worse , especially if you have lots of small red pimples on your cheeks and forehead . <p> The best moisturizers are made from oil in water or water in oil . <p> You only need one moisturizer for all the skin in your face . Some parts of your face may need more moisturizer than others . <p> The easiest way to get the moisturizer you need for acne skin care is with a complete acne treatment system such as Exposed Skin Care . <h> Is Healing Acne Really All About Drying Up Your Skin ? <p> For centuries , people with acne were told that they needed to dry up the skin . It seemed just to make sense . Whiteheads and blackheads , after all , start as oily buildup in pores . Pimples ooze when you pick at them . Dry up your skin , and the acne should stop . <p> In the era before acne skin care products , the way to dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really can dry up acne , but it is specifically the visible blue and red rays of sunlight that make the difference . Blue light can kill acne bacteria . It can not penetrate deep into pores , but it does not need to kill all the bacteria in a pore to make a difference . And red light can reach deeper into the skin and shrink the sebaceous glands that make the excess oil that forms part of the clog in pores . <p> The problem with the sunshine cure for acne is that too much sunshine can also cause sunburn . And if you have brown or black skin , sunlight causes both age spots and brown spots where acne has healed . That too much sun can cause age spots was obvious , so clever cosmetics makers of another era came up with another way to " dry up " the skin , with alcohol . <h> Alcohol for Drying the Skin <p> There is no doubt that alcohol dries the skin . Typically the kind of alcohol applied to the skin is isopropyl alcohol , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alcohol you drink , would have a similar effect . In the middle of the twentieth century , alcohol rubs and scrubs became a very popular way of treating acne . They definitely dried up the skin . <p> Unfortunately , that is n't all they did . Alcohol-based products also increase oil production . There are some skin care experts , notably the venerable " cosmetics cop " Paula Begoun , who insist that the idea that alcohol increases oil production is ridiculous . Alcohol does not stimulate excess oil production , Begoun and other experts say , hormones stimulate excess oil production . <p> These experts are right . However , the irritation of the skin as it dries out the skin causes the skin to release a hormone known as corticotrophin stimulating hormone . This stress hormone triggers the release of histamine that irritates the skin and increases the activity of sebaceous glands . The sebaceous glands release oil to repair the irritation caused by alcohol . <p> Its really ironic that there are many alcohol-based " moisturizers " for the skin . If you have very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional skin damage . But there are no skin types for which alcohol moisturizes and improves the skin . <h> But If We Do n't  Need to Dry the Skin to Fight Acne , Why Moisturize ? <p> If drying the skin does n't  fight acne , why would moisturizing the skin help ? The answer is that moisture in the skin helps get rid of oil on the skin , and it the oil on the skin that clogs pores trying to bring it ( and dead skin cells and acne bacteria ) to the surface . <p> The skin provides a protective barrier that is organized in a way that is reminiscent of a brick wall . Tough skin cells known as corneocytes are the bricks . Fats and fat-like substances such as ceramides and triglycerides form the mortar . Most of the contents of the human body are " watery , " so the combination of tough proteins and fatty lubricants protects the interior of the body from dilution or leakage . <p> Tiny amounts of water are found in the skin . The skin has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out very slowly . It uses carrier molecules known as aquaporins to transport water back and forth in the skin . <p> Just a splash of water on the skin may be more than enough to fill the aquaporins and add all the extra water the skin can hold " for an hour or two . Skin-identical ceramides and fats do a lot more to keep the skin moist and supple . They dilute the " mortar " holding skin cells together just enough to let the skin move with muscles beneath it and keep pores open so they do n't  fill with sebum that becomes whiteheads , blackheads , and pimples . <p> The best moisturizers are some combination of oil in water or water in oil . Just because you have oily skin , which is really having too much oil on your skin , does not mean that your skin may not need additional moisture . It just means that your skin probably needs more water than oil . <h> Is Just One Moisturizer Enough ? <p> Countless cosmetics makers try to sell you additional products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your nose , or on your neck , needs special skin care ingredients . Do n't  buy only one moisturizer for your skin , these manufacturers will tell you . Buy at least two . But there is no scientific evidence that supports the idea that skin on different locations on your body requires different skin-moisturizing ingredients . <p> The difference between locations on your body is not what moisturizer they need , its how much moisturizer they need . Only people who have dry skin need moisturizer on their cheeks and forehead . Even people who have oily skin may need moisturizer on the sides of the faces from time to time . And even you need moisturizer all over your face , you may need more moisturizer or to use moisturizer more often on certain locations . <h> How to Use Moisturizer <p> Its easy to forget that the purpose of moisturizer is not just to add moisture to your skin , it is also to lock moisture in your skin . This means that you should not try to make your skin desert-dry before you add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisturizer just after you have cleansed your skin . You want to pat your face dry so you do n't  have any drips , but you want to apply moisturizer while your skin is still damp and soft to the touch . Use moisturizer before foundation and other makeup . <h> Water Is a Great Moisturizer <p> Do n't  forget that water is a great moisturizer . If you do n't  use makeup , a little clean water on your face a few times a day can keep your skin tones bright and prevent flaking and peeling . The moisture in your skin helps pores drain . <p> Also , a splash of facial waters can help calm sensitive skin . Collected from mineral springs that contain water rich in natural selenium , magnesium , and/or sulfur , facial waters add minerals to your face that you can secure with moisturizer . Rinse off cleanser , and then spray your face with facial waters to calm red skin . <p> You can spend countless trips to the cosmetics counters and thousands of dollars finding the perfect moisturizer to add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that work as a part of your comprehensive acne care system from Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923

Here are some reliable indicators : <p> You get bright red pimples on your face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunscreen sting or burn when you put them on your face . <p> Any kind of jewelry other than 14-karat gold makes you break out ( anywhere you place it on your body ) . <p> You get pimples instead of sunburn when you are out in the sun , or when your skin gets hot . <p> Anger and embarrassment make your face and neck red . <p> People ask you if you are sunburned , even if you are not . Or you really are sunburned all the time ( which is not a good thing ) . <p> If three or more of these characteristics apply to you , chances are that you have sensitive skin . And its also possible that you can have rosacea . <h> The Difference Between Rosacea and Common Acne <p> Rosacea is a condition of skin inflammation that begins in blood vessels , not in pores . People who have rosacea tend to have weak capillaries , especially in the skin of the face over the cheeks , on the nose , and around the eyes . When these tiny blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leak . This makes the skin red in tiny dots around the leak . If this happens enough times ( usually over a period of years ) the skin can develop lumpy scar tissue around repeated leaks , giving the skin , especially the skin of the nose , a bumpy , lumpy kind of disfigurement known as rhinophyma . <p> Trying to get oil out of your pores wont do you any good if you have rosacea . But trying to get oil out of your pores wont do you any good if you have common acne on sensitive skin , either . All you will accomplish by harsh chemical or detergent treatment of either rosacea or common acne on sensitive skin is stimulating even more redness and even more sebum production . Its possible to have both common acne and rosacea " which is the likely result of treating rosacea with the methods used to treat acne on resistant skin . Sensitive skin requires sensitive handling . <h> How to Take Care of Sensitive Skin <p> Many people who have sensitive skin have a problem with acne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left behind once acne heals . If you have sensitive skin , your skin overreacts to inflammation . The melanin pigment that darkens the skin also protects it against free radicals and inflammation . If you have sensitive skin , chances are you will have brown spots in your skin left over from its fight against inflammation long after the acne inflammation goes away . The darker your skin , the more prominent the spots . <p> Minimizing inflammation minimizes discoloration of the skin . Here is what you need to to prevent lasting reminders of acne flares long after they have healed : <p> If a product makes your skin tingle , itch , turn red , or burn , just do n't  use it . This means you may not be able to use any prescription strength benzoyl peroxide formulas at all , although you may be able to use up 2.5% benzoyl peroxide in an over the counter product . <p> Avoid frequent sun exposure . Tanning the skin builds up melanin , which concentrates into spots to fight inflammation that comes with either common acne or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often used to treat raised acne scars ) or diethylaminoethanol ( DMAE , often used to treat indented acne scars ) . Your skin wont tolerate them , and they will at best replace acne scars with brown spots . It is easier to conceal scars than spots . <p> Do n't  use skin lighteners that contain hydroquinone or vitamin C. These may cause unintended spotting of the skin . Use skin lighteners that contain arbutin and/or kojin acid . These will not cause unintended spotting of the skin . <p> And what about day-to-day skin care if you have active acne on the skin ? <p> A good product for keeping the skin clean is Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash , Redness Soothing Facial Cleanser . If ( and only if ) you do n't  experience any kind of redness , irritation , or peeling of the skin after using the product , you may use up to 10% benzoyl peroxide gels as a spot treatment for pimples , but you should not use more than 2.5% benzoyl peroxide over your entire face . Chances are you should not use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dot of 10% tea tree oil cream ( it has to be about 10% to do you any good , just smelling like tea tree oil is not enough ) will often take the red out of pimples while it kills acne bacteria . <p> Whatever you do , do n't  place hot steamy washcloths or ice cubes on a pimple . Heat and cold damage blood vessels and can make redness worse " and permanent . <p> You can cover up pimples with concealer you apply with a feather brush to the skin . Place a tiny bit of yellow concealer , less than the size of a pea , on the back of your recently washed hand . Add a tiny amount of : <p> Neutrogena On-the-Spot Acne Treatment , Vanishing Formula , or <p> ProActiv Advanced Blemish , or <p> Kinerase Clear Blemish Remover <p> and work them together . Apply the mixture of concealer and pimple treatment to the pimple with the brush , and then use your clean fingers to smooth out the edges of concealer on the skin around your pimple . Be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . <p> I have tried several different types of OTC products for acne , even those that say for sensitive skin. Nothing works . I 'm a woman , who 's had 2 kids , I 'm almost 30 , and I still break out like a 15 year old boy . I have narrowed down to a few shampoo/conditioner/body wash products that do n't  really cause it to get worse , but if does n't  help it to get better at all . Like fit instance , I can use some Pantene products and Caress body washes , but not all of products of those brands . Most of the and products , even the Neutrogena oil free acne wash does n't  work , they seem to make it worse . Scents , perfumes and dyes do n't  bother my skin though , I can use just about any laundry detergent , perfume , etc My face gets it worst , and if I 'm not careful about washing and conditioning my hair first before I wash my body , my back and shoulders and sometimes even my thighs break out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I 'm 21 and I still break out like crazy . I tried neautrogena oil free wash as well and it made my skin worse . I went to a dermatologist recently and they told me to use the least amount of products possible to cleanse my face and to use GENTLE cleanser on it . Neutrogena makes a face wash called ultra gentle daily cleanser and its the foaming formula . It works REALLY well so far . In the AM , I use that and Olay Complete for sensitive skin moisturizer with SPF 15 and that 's it . For night , I wash again with the same cleanser , a prescription topical antibiotic ( which I have n't picked up yet actually ) , and neutrogena on the spot vanishing cream . Its only been a day and my skin looks much better , even without the prescription . Try it ! <p> This does n't  really help me to be honest . I have sensitive skin prone to vicious hormonal cysts but only occasionally . The only way to prevent this as I can not tolerate ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  prescribe antibiotics long term for my type acne ) is some type of topical Ie retinoids , BP , salicylic acid , or azalea can acid all potentially irritating evn at low concentration . If I do n't  use these i get the odd deep cyst which scar badly so I 'm lost as to what we are supposed to do with sensitive skin and anything worse than " spots " . <p> I have SUPER sensitive skin and I sometimes end up with " Burns " on my face from too-strong acne treatments . My skin is pretty oily , too . My dermatologist recommended the Citrus Clear products OMG I love them ! They literally work overnight and it does n't  burn , sting or leave marks on my face like some in the past have . <p> I have always had really really sensitive skin and have found that I can use Clinique super gentel face wash every other day on it ( I think its clinique 2 ? ) . If I use it every day it dries my skin out though . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely is too harsh and makes my skin worse . If I feel that my skin is too dry after I wash it I use clinique moisture surge and sometimes a little aloe vera ( definitely make sure your skin responds well to aloe vera before putting it on your face ) . Tea tree oil does seem to help with some spot treatment , but I have to use the gentlest stuff I can find . I have a friend who swears by menuka honey , but I have n't tried it yet . <p> I have sensitive with acne skin . I knew this since my doctor suggested to use very mild treatment . Well , I recently noticed that I DO have high sensitivity toward stress . Everytime I stress out , I will break out . They are deep acnes with white head , itchy , disturbing and a lot . I really hate this since my skin never absen of their existance . I use physiogel cleanser to clean my face and acne feldin for couple hours a day . I have a little progress yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fiances family and coleagues . <p> Ive been using Duac prescribed by my GP to combat acne ; and it works ! I am unfortunately though left with red scarring not too bad , but not too good either . I have oily , Mediterranean type skin and I think this contributes a lot to my acne . I ensure to keep fit and only drink water every day . However I occasionally smoke which makes the acne appear again . Does anyone else experience this ? And does anyone have a solution for eridicating acne scarring/red skin ? Thank you G <p> Hey my dermatologist recommended me to use these products : acne soap , anti biotic astringent and a refining solution . All of these stings and makes my face appear very red especially when its hot . She told me to use those products twice a day and she told me that i ca n't be exposed to sunlight because it will make my face more redish . But the products is doing its job , my pimples is slowly getting removed but my only problem is the redness . 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778508 @2978508/ <h> Using Benzoyl Peroxide to Treat Acne 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Benzoyl peroxide is the worlds most frequently used treatment for acne infections . The key to success in treating acne with benzoyl peroxide products , however , usually is to use less , not more . <h> Summary : <p> Benzoyl peroxide is the worlds most frequently used treatment for acne . <p> The way benzoyl peroxide works is by irritating acne bacteria so they do not have the nutritional resources to reproduce . Since bacteria have a very short lifetime , in about 48 hours there are almost no bacteria left on the skin . <p> Traditional benzoyl peroxide gels only treat pimples . <p> Slow-release forms of benzoyl peroxide have an additional advantage . They also treat whiteheads and blackheads . <p> You probably will experience a slight burning sensation the first time you use benzoyl peroxide . Up to 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel or up to 5.5% slow-release benzoyl peroxide usually do not cause significant irritation after the first use . <p> Not everyone should use benzoyl peroxide . If you have dark skin tones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this product . <h> What Is Benzoyl Peroxide ? <p> Benzoyl peroxide is a synthetic chemical that happens to imitate two natural substances . The benzoyl peroxide you get in a tube of face gel begins as toluene distilled from petroleum that is sent through three chemical reactions . When you put the product on your face it breaks down into benzoic acid and oxygen. - Benzoyl peroxide works in three major ways . It kills germs , unblocks clogged pores and minimizes inflammation . <p> Benzoic acid has been used to treat skin infections since the 1890s , when it was popularized as Whitfields ointment . Oxygen is toxic to some kinds of bacteria " although it is not especially toxic to acne bacteria . Benzoyl peroxide , incidentally , is poisonous to cats , so do n't  let kitty lick your face if you have used benzoyl peroxide . <h> How Does Benzoyl Peroxide Fight Acne ? <p> Benzoyl peroxide does not deliver a knockout blow to acne bacteria , but about 99% of bacteria die without reproducing themselves over a 48-hour period . <p> In the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of acne , so the treatment for acne was focused on finding ways to kill the bacteria . However , 50 years ago , this point was refuted , with research evidence showing that - it was oxidative damage to the fatty cells that resulted in excess sebum being produced by the skin cells , and this was what caused acne . Nonetheless , this point of view was proved to be wrong and it was shown that bacteria does indeed affect acne . <p> Acne often happens when inflammation occurs in an area and stimulates the production of sebum and keratin producing cells , which then lead to blocked pores . Since oxygen is consumed from the blocked pores , it creates an ideal environment for the P. acnes bacteria to survive . Consequently , according to this theory , if you can prevent your skin from getting inflamed , you can prevent acne . <p> Benzoyl Peroxide gets rid of acne causing bacteria fast . <p> The oxygen released by benzoyl peroxide forms toxic free radicals of oxygen , - which kill the P. acnes bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is provided by benzoyl peroxide . Human skin has repair mechanisms that make it immune to these free radicals of oxygen . Acne bacteria have not quite as many repair mechanisms to help them maintain cellular integrity even when oxygen " burns " their cell membranes . One of the ways that benzoyl peroxide fights acne infection is by irritating acne bacteria and forcing them to spend energy in maintaining the integrity of their outer membranes . Since bacteria have a very short life span , any drain on their nutritional resources makes them more vulnerable to the human immune system , which is constantly releasing inflammatory hormones to dissolve them . <h> Recent Advances in Benzoyl Peroxide Products <p> Some pharmaceutical companies have started using microsphere technology to make smaller amounts of benzoyl peroxide equally effective for killing acne bacteria , with fewer side effects . Microspheres are made by mixing benzoyl peroxide , ethanol ( the kind of alcohol in alcoholic beverages ) , a chemical called triethyl citrate , and a polymer used that can also be used to make plastics . <p> The mixture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny sponges do not dissolve in water , but they can float in water . When the mixture of water and benzoyl peroxide microspheres is applied to the face , the microsponges release tiny amounts of benzoyl peroxide for several hours . Instead of using a large amount of benzoyl peroxide to kill a few acne bacteria all at once , microsphere technology makes it possible to use a small amount of benzoyl peroxide to kill a lot acne bacteria slowly . <p> There are two big advantages of " solubilized " and " microsphere technology " preparations of benzoyl peroxide . One advantage is that they do n't  cause as much itching , tingling , burning , and dryness . Even a 5.5% concentration of solubilized benzoyl peroxide left on the skin , in one study , caused no more skin irritation that than a common skin wash rinsed away 30 seconds after application to the skin . <p> The other advantage of these modern formulations of benzoyl peroxide is that they get rid of whiteheads and blackheads as well as pimples . Regular benzoyl peroxide does not stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solubilized and microsphere benzoyl peroxide not only kill bacteria in pimples , they also break up clumps of dead skin that hold non-inflammatory blemishes in place and help pores drain . <h> Which Form of Benzoyl Peroxide Should You Use ? <p> While the microsphere formulas are much better for fighting acne than the benzoyl peroxide gels that have been available for over 50 years , not everyone should use benzoyl peroxide . If you have rosacea , benzoyl peroxide may trigger formation of new small pimples due to irritation . Also , if you have Asian skin , failure to use sun protection when you use benzoyl peroxide may result in brown discoloration of the skin . Fortunately , there are many other products that also can clear up blemishes on rosacea-prone and Asian skin . <p> For everyone else , the most useful form of benzoyl peroxide will be either : <p> A controlled release product that contains microspheres or microsponges , available by prescription , up to 5% benzoyl peroxide , or <p> An over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide gel containing no more than 2.5% benzoyl peroxide . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peroxide as GRASE , or generally regarded as safe and effective . The concentrations used in medical studies , however , are usually stronger than the concentrations used in over the counter products , because medical researchers want to make sure they get a measurable effect from their products , whether or not they cause irritation . <p> You want to get rid of acne , but you do n't  want the side effects . That 's why you should start with either a 2.5% over-the-counter product or up to a 5.5% microsphere , controlled release , or time release benzoyl peroxide product for which you will most likely need a prescription . <p> It is possible to buy- up to 10% benzoyl peroxide over the counter , without a prescription in many forms ( cream , gel , cleanser , face or body wash , lotion , etc ) . This strength of benzoyl peroxide is OK if you are using it for spot treatment , or for treating back acne , but you do n't  want to put it all over your face . Use low concentrations of benzoyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest strength of benzoyl peroxide you can find until you are sure it is not causing skin irritation . <p> Benzoyl peroxide can also be combined with other products to make it more effective . It can be combined with clindamycin , otherwise known as Duac- , which is an antibiotic or adapline , otherwise known as Epiduo- . These medications should be prescribed by a doctor before use . Make sure to adhere to the instructions given by the doctor when using them . Other brand names for the product are Triaz and Brevoxyl . <h> Getting the Best Results <p> When you first start using benzoyl peroxide , expect your skin to get worse at first . Your skin may turn red and peel but , after 4 to 6 weeks , you will start observing some positive changes . Even after your skin has cleared , it is important to continue using this product to keep acne away . This is because relying too much on benzoyl peroxide does not really consist of good skin care but just focuses on getting rid of the problem . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so once you discontinue use of the product , your acne may come back worse than before . <p> Dab-a-does-it Use sparingly and only to affected areas until your skin adjusts to it . <p> To prevent this from happening , the best thing is to use benzoyl peroxide strategically . Use it in small quantities , which is just adequate enough to open up your skin pores and to control the bacteria , but not so- much- that could- cause your skin to get addicted to the peroxide . This way , when you stop using benzoyl peroxide , you wo n't end up messing your face . <p> Some studies have compared the effectiveness of benzoyl peroxide against the effectiveness of the topical application of a vitamin C derivative , sodium ascorbyl phosphate- ( SAP ) and vitamin B3 . The research findings have found vitamin BP and SAP to be more effective than benzoyl peroxide and topical antibiotics . <p> To maximize the effect of benzoyl peroxide products on your skin , wash your face with soap and water 15 minutes before applying any gels or creams on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face dry . When you first start using the product , leave it on for a few hours and then rinse it away . But with time , start leaving it on for longer and longer until you get to a time when you do not have to rinse it off after applying it . You can then start applying it two times a day . When you are using a facial wash , wet your face first with water , then pour the wash on your hands and then wash the affected areas . Leave it on your skin for a few minutes and then was it off and pat your face dry using a towel . Use lukewarm water and mild soap when washing your face . <p> Warnings and Precautions <p> Make sure to let your doctor know if you are pregnant or breastfeeding . Do not let a child who is under 12 years old to use the product on their face , unless it has been prescribed by a doctor . When you start using benzoyl peroxide , avoid staying in the sun or use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive to sunlight . <p> Keep the product away from your clothes and any fabric since it causes bleaching on clothes .

Notify a doctor if you notice any rash or itchiness , swelling , redness and you get blisters or a burning feeling . <p> Just getting rid of acne bacteria is never enough to keep your complexion clear and vibrant . It is always necessary to have a regular program that includes both cleansing and moisturizing as well as simple , painless microdermabrasion to get rid of reminders of past treatment errors .

The benzoyl peroxide product that is a " miracle " acne treatment for a person who has naturally moist and chemical-resistant skin may generate a horror story for someone who has rosacea . The exfoliant that works great for blackheads on oily skin may offer no benefits at all for someone who has tiny red pimples on dry skin . And cosmetic coverups that work great on one skin type may cake or smear on another . <p> Acne treatment is not all or nothing . The " wrong " product may not cause you major skin problems .

It used to be thought that acne only occurred on oily skin and that drying out skin was a good thing . Now its known that its only the oil that accumulates in pores , not the moisture in the epidermis of the skin , that is relevant to acne care . And it is also known that excessive oil in and of itself does not necessarily result in acne . <p> Skin may be sensitive or resistant . Some people experience redness or irritation no matter what chemical comes in contact with their skin . They are said to have sensitive skin . Other people have skin that is naturally insensitive to allergens and chemicals . They are said to have resistant skin .

In skin care , pigmentation usually refers to tiny areas of pigmentation , not the overall color and tone of the skin . Some types of skin are much more prone to change color " either darker or lighter " as acne heals .

I have had a severe case . ( 1 ) Yes . My doctor has diagnosed me as having rosacea. ( 2 ) Yes . My beautician or a friend has told me I probably have rosacea. ( 3 ) No , but I have wondered if I might have rosacea. ( 4 ) No , and I have no reason to believe I might have rosacea . <p> 5 .

Does wearing sunscreen make your skin feel itchy or turn red ? <p> ( 0 ) Any kind of sunscreen makes my skin feel itchy or turn red . ( 1 ) Certain kinds of sunscreens always cause skin problems for me , but those that are made with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are usually OK.

( 4 ) No . <p> Add up the points for each of your answers . Like the last quiz , this quiz has a maximum of 40 points . If your score is 20 to 40 , you have resistant skin . If your score is 35 or higher , you probably can use just about any skin care product without worry that it might make your skin break out . <p> If your score is between 15 and 25 , you have- resistant skin , and you only need to avoid common irritant ingredients such as cinnamon , menthol , mint , peppermint , wintergreen , and witch hazel . <p> If your score is between 0 and 20 , you have sensitive skin and you need to use products that are designed for sensitive skin . And if your score is from 0 to 4 , you have extremely sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin care products . <h> Is Your Skin Loose or Tight ? <p> Most consumers of acne care products do n't  realize that it makes a difference whether your skin is loose or tight . Loose skin tends to trap cellular debris and acne bacteria on the skin in tiny folds . These folds may be visible as wrinkles , but it is more common for people with acne who have loose skin just to have slight , barely noticeable changes in the contour of their skin as they move their heads up and down . <p> There is no such effect in people who have tight skin . If you have tight skin , there are not as many tiny lines in your skin that can give an acne bacteria a home . You may not need cleansers that are quite as strong " and you may be able to use milder products that have fewer side effects . <p> As in previous sections , each statement or question is followed by five options . Choose the response that best describes our skin . <p> 1 . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yes . Even when I 'm not raising my eyebrows , talking , smiling , or frowning , there are visible wrinkles in my face . ( 1 ) Yes .

People usually guess I am 5 to 10 or more years older than I actually am. ( 1 ) No . People usually guess I am 2 to 5 years older than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess my age correctly . ( 3 ) No . People usually guess I am 2 to 5 years younger than I actually am. ( 4 ) No . People usually guess I am 5 to 10 or more years younger than I actually am . <p> 3 .

( 2 ) I used to smoke every day but I quit or I do n't  smoke but I live or work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoked a few packs , total , in my lifetime , and I do n't  live or work with anyone who smokes now . ( 4 ) None , or just one or two individual cigarettes . <p> ( 0 ) The air quality is poor most of the year because of high levels of sulfur dioxide , ozone , and petrochemicals. ( 1 ) The air quality is poor most of the year because of dust and particulate matter . ( 2 ) The air quality is poor up to 30 days of the year for any reason .

( 3 ) I 've lived part of my life in sunny locations and part of my life in cloudy locations . ( 4 ) I 've always lived where there is cloudy weather most of the time . <p> 9 . During the last 10 years , how often have you participated in outdoor activities in bright sunlight without using sunscreen ? <p> ( 0 ) At least once a week for more than 5 years . ( 1 ) At least once a month for more than 5 years . ( 2 ) During the winter months for more than 5 years . ( 3 ) Not more than 10 times in the last 5 years . ( 4 ) Never . <p> As for the other sections , add up the points for each of your answers . There is a maximum of 40 points . If your score is 21 to 40 , you have loose skin . You may benefit from toners and astringents once you get acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 , you have tight skin . The good news is that you are highly unlikely to develop a problem with wrinkling , but you do n't  want to use any products that " tone " your skin and lock bacteria , excess sebum , and skin debris into your pores . <h> Is Your Skin Pigmented or Non-Pigmented ? <p> The final 10 questions will help you determine whether your skin tends to be pigmented or non-pigmented . Pigmentation refers to the concentration of color in the skin as it heals from inflamed acne blemishes . The pigments in the skin do not just give us our skin color . They are also antioxidants . The skin can use them to stop inflammation . <p> The good thing about having rich , dark skin tones is that the skin can stop inflammation relatively easily . The downside to having rich , dark brown or golden skin tones is that the process of stopping inflammation can leave specks , spots , or blotches of discoloration on the skin . <p> As in the other sections , choose the statement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin pigmentation quiz only has eight questions . Also , there are fewer choices for some of the questions . <p> 1 . How often does a pimple on your skin leave a brown spot after it has healed ? <p> ( 0 ) Never . ( 1 ) Sometimes , but the brown discoloration quickly fades . ( 2 ) Sometimes , and the brown discoloration is permanent . ( 3 ) Usually , and the older I get the more brown spots I have . ( 4 ) Always , and the brown spots do n't  fade away . <p> 2 . After you cut yourself , you <p> ( 0 ) Develop a red or pink mark that is quickly replaced by healthy skin . ( 2 ) Develop a brown mark that fades over the course of a few weeks or months . ( 4 ) Develop a brown mark that fades slowly or not at all . <p> 3 . Do you have any small brown spots on your face , arms , legs , or torso ? <p> ( 0 ) No. ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . ( 2 ) Yes , a few ( up to 10 ) . ( 3 ) Yes , more than a few ( more than 10 but fewer than 20 ) . ( 4 ) Yes , lots ( 20 or more ) . <p> 4 . What is the color of your hair ? ( If your hair is now gray , what color was it before it turned gray ? ) <p> ( 0 ) I do n't  have any spots on my skin . ( 1 ) I have spots on my skin , but exposure to the sun does not make them darker . ( 2 ) Yes , a little darker . ( 3 ) Yes , a lot darker . <p> 6 . If you stay indoors all winter and then spend a day out in the sun , what happens to your skin ? <p> ( 0 ) It burns , but it does not tan . ( 2 ) It tans , but it does not burn . ( 3 ) It neither tans nor burns . <p> 7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun later in the summer ? <p> ( 0 ) I may get sunburn or blister , but I do n't  tan . ( 1 ) My skin is a little darker , but not a lot . ( 2 ) My skin gets a lot darker . ( 3 ) I do n't  have a problem with sunburn , but my skin does not change color when I get lots of sun . <p> 8 . Have you ever been told you have melasma or age spots ? <p> ( 0 ) No. ( 3 ) Yes . <p> As before , add up your points from each question . This quiz has a maximum of 30 points , but this time there is a different way to interpret your score . If your score is 15 or higher , consider your skin to be pigmented . You may not have spots on your skin right this very moment , but your skin will tend to form pigmentation when it has been irritated . <p> If your score is less than 15 , then your skin tends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as careful about whether a skin care product irritates your skin , because your skin is less likely to form spots . You also do n't  have to be quite as careful about using sunscreen when you use benzoyl peroxide or tretinoin topical to treat blemishes . <h> Putting It All Together <p> The skin type quizzes tell you whether your skin has a tendency to be oily or dry , sensitive or resistant , tight or loose , and pigmented or non-pigmented . Knowing your skin type helps you choose products that have the ingredients that are best for your skin . There are some ingredients that are almost always helpful and other ingredients that are almost harmful , but which products are harmful or helpful depends on your skin type . <p> Here is an overview of product ingredients that can help you choose the right acne care products for your individual skin type .

@@98778514 @2978514/ <h> Vaping to Help Treat Acne : Yes , No , Maybe 19922 @qwx879922 <p> The connection between acne breakouts or flare-ups and vaping ( smoking using an electronic cigarette ) is just not clear . Some say their acne went away completely after they started vaping while still other say they got acne even though they had never had it before . The only clear answer is that smoking does affect and worsen acne and trying to quit is better than nothing at all . <p> Though that is true , its worth looking at vaping as a contributing factor , or not , in acne sufferers . This particular report is based on answers from people who previously smoked and are now vaping in order to put down the tobacco and all the harmful chemicals found in cigarettes . Many people have begun vaping " just to do it " or because " their friends do " , and this is not about those vapers . <p> Smoking is a definite antagonist in the cycle of acne . Introducing chemicals such as arsenic and formaldehyde to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most often , we see that expulsion manifest on the skin . From yellow , leathery skin , to pimples and cysts , the body will get the toxins as far away from vital organs as possible . <p> People who suffer from acne are well aware of this and most at least try to put down the habit , while others continue possibly to lessen their acne depression . But now , vaping has screamed onto the scene to try to help smokers lessen their intake of toxins and tobacco and even eventually quit the habit altogether . With flavors from typical cigarette taste to chocolate , caramel , raspberry and even Mt . Dew , vaping made quitting the traditional cigarette much more appetizing than just quitting " cold turkey " . <p> Ingredients of e-Liquid <p> The ingredients of e-juice or the flavor " syrup " used in electronic vaping devices or " vape pens " is made of only a few ingredients and may or may not contain nicotine . These ingredients are normally food grade propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerin , a non toxic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouthwash and food coloring , natural and artificial flavors that are all food grade and if the customer so chooses , a bit of nicotine . <p> All of these ingredients are non toxic but of course once vaped , release different chemical compounds as they are heated to produce the vapor that is exhaled . This vapor has been tested many times and each time it is found that the chemicals released and exhaled hold over 90% less harmful chemicals than traditional cigarettes . Though there are debates on whether the vaping industry should be regulated . No seller of vape pens claims that they are 100% safe but over 90% better than a regular cigarette seems like a good place to start for someone trying to quit ! <p> So what 's the connection to acne ? Again , the answer is n't clear , but of course any change in lifestyle habits creates an effect in and on the body . And something like Pro Active is n't going to be the be-all , end-all solution if there 's an underlying problem causing the acne . <p> What Do the Reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they transitioned over to vaping , they saw a slow decrease in their acne . Breakouts were few and far between and their skin begin to heal without leaving behind the discoloration often caused by pimples . Some of these vapers went on to report later that their acne had completely healed even though they were still vaping and this was the only change they had made in their habits . <p> Flare-ups and breakouts around the mouth were reported by some new vapers . After suggestions that they might be touching this area more than usual because of the moist feeling after exhaling vapor , the vapers made changes to this habit . Ultimately , it cleared the area and as they continued vaping , they too saw improvement in their skin . <p> Not everyone who transitions to vaping is going to see a full recovery from acne , as smoking is rarely the sole factor that caused the acne . Some vapers that hoped for changes in their skin found that vaping did n't  make a difference . It did , however , change their overall health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of their acne . In other words , switching to vaping may help the psychological effect of acne called acne depression . <p> For those who reported that they began to see acne appear only after beginning to vape , their symptoms were unexplained . Many of these vapers returned to conventional smoking and there are no reports in regards to their present acne conditions . Remember , these vapers were smokers before and still suffered from acne once switching to vaping . <p> Some claimed that it could be " quit zits " and continued to vape although they still had breakouts . " Quit zits " are pimples that appear right after a person makes a sudden change in their habits , most often seen in those quitting smoking whether they begin vaping or not . These can be bothersome but totally worth the wait for them to pass if it means stopping the habit of smoking cigarettes . Their breakouts continued but lessened in severity .

Even if the findings do confirm this , its apparent that scientists and doctors much prefer to see their patients vaping rather than smoking and will not admonish them for trying the vaping method as a means to quit .

Preventing and treating acne on the neck , however , is not as simple as keeping the neck clean , because almost any form of acne can occur on the neck . <h> Summary : <p> Acne on the neck can be very easy or very hard to treat . <p> If you have blemishes on your neck that look like blemishes on your face , you may be able to control them with nothing more than careful cleansing and benzoyl peroxide . <p> If you have pimples on the neck that form around ingrown hairs , you may need to treat them with a skin peel such as 0.05% tretinoin topical .

Whiteheads and blackheads on the neck are caused by the accumulation of dead skin cells , acne bacteria , and excess oil in pores on the skin of the neck , and reducing any three of these components of a clogged pore can reduce the number of blemishes on the neck . <p> Moms advice to wash your neck and to wash behind your ears is sometimes all you really need to do .

Use sunscreen if you use any kind of antibacterial gel on your neck . <h> Pimples Under the Chin in Men <p> Another target for acne in men is under the chin , especially on areas of the neck that are shaved every morning . Many many develop a form of acne called acne keloidalis nuchae where they shave their necks every day . This kind of acne is not triggered by clogged pores . It forms around ingrown hairs , which are attacked by the immune system .

The antibiotics used to treat common acne wont usually work in hair follicles , because they are more likely to be infected with staph or strep than with acne bacteria . Neosporin , however , will usually cause the bacteria in pimples under the chin . <p> It is important not to try opening up pimples that form over ingrown hairs on your own . They can cause serious infections that affect larger areas of skin than common acne , and the bacteria inside the pimple can even get into the bloodstream . If self-treatment does n't  work in 4 or 5 days , see a doctor . <p> The way to prevent this kind of neck acne is always to use a fresh safety razor . Dull edges trap hairs beneath the skin .

Over a period of 3 to 4 weeks enough skin matures and dies that the cyst opens on its own , and the ordinary skin care helps keep cysts from coming back . It is important to use sun screen on the back of the neck during tretinoin treatment to prevent the formation of brown spots on the skin .

And- when whiteheads and blackheads occur on beautiful brown , black , or Asian skin , they can leave lasting discoloration even after acne has been treated . <p> This article will tell you how you can remove acne blemishes safely from any kind of skin . The techniques in the article are safe enough for dark-toned skin , but effective " and far less irritating than many other treatments " for even the fairest skin . Let 's begin with an understanding of what blemishes are and why they tend to leave discoloration even after acne has healed . <h> Summary : <p> Acne blemishes are caused by a combination of clumps of dead skin cells , excess oil on the skin , and acne bacteria . <p> Anything that inflames your skin can cause it to produce even more oil . <p> The gentlest treatments are best for acne blemishes on all skin types . <p> Acne blemishes on brown , black , or Asian skin often leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . <p> Anything that heats your skin can make acne worse . <p> Hair care products can cause blemishes . <p> Steroid creams can thin your skin and leave it even more susceptible to inflammation . <p> The best way to prevent and treat acne blemishes is with a complete skin care system . <h> What Causes Acne Blemishes ? <p> Every pore in the skin lies on top of a follicle containing sebaceous glands . These tiny glands produce sebum , the lubricating oil of the skin . Without enough sebum , the skin is tight and wrinkly . Sebum does the work of lubrication while it is still in the pore , but it also carries dead skin cells up to the surface . In the mix of dead skin cells and sebum waiting to emerge at the opening of the pore there are bacteria . These bacteria in small numbers actually help maintain the health of the pore , by breaking down sticky sebum into less viscous fatty acids . <p> Sometimes the dead skin cells clump together and clog the pore . Sometimes the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responds to stress hormones . One way the skin deals with stress is by creating even more sebum . The combination of clumped skin cells and extra sebum can clog the pore , sealing acne bacteria inside . <p> If you scrub and rub the already-inflamed pore , it will spill its contents on the surface of the skin . The immune system , however , will act to prevent other bacteria , fungi , molds , viruses , and dirt on the skin from entering the skin and causing infection or toxic reactions . Squeezing or teasing a blemish often creates a pimple that looks even worse . But on brown , black , or Asian skin , that 's not the end of the story . <p> Everybodys skin contains melanocytes , the skin cells that make the pigment melanin . This pigment can be brown , black , or gray . If your melanocytes produce a lot of brown or black pigment , you will tend to have brown or black skin . If your melanocytes only produce brown pigment , you will tend to have Asian skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color on the basis of heredity , however , and everyones skin can produce more or less of certain pigments in response to stress . <p> If your skin naturally produces lots of brown or black pigment , it will produce even more when your skin is irritated . The antioxidants in melanin put the brakes on inflammation induced by the immune system , healing acne faster . The problem is that pigments stay in the skin even after acne has healed . Most people who have brown , black , or Asian skin find spots to be worse than pimples , but spots can also occur on fair skin . <h> What You Can Do to Stop Blemishes Before They Start <p> The best way to deal with blemishes is to stop them before they start . Especially if you have darker skin tones , you need to make sure that oils and hair products do n't  drip down from your hair onto your face . Hair spray , hair gel , hair mousse , pomades , and even shampoo and conditioner can activate acne . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clog pores . Sebum can dissolve the oils in makeup up to a point , but if the pore is already clogged with skin cells , the combination of old makeup and skin matter can cause a blackhead or a whitehead . <p> Heat and friction cause blemishes . Staying out in the sun too long or visiting the sauna or steam room can trigger an anti-inflammatory response in the skin . The skin protects itself from heat by making extra sebum , potentially clogging pores . The skin also responds to friction from your hair , from the side pieces of your glasses , or from rubbing your skin too hard when you wash by making more sebum that can clog more pores . <p> Steroid creams you put on your skin to stop inflammation can , ironically , cause it . When your skin senses stress , or when your whole body is stressed , it releases a substance called corticotrophin stimulating hormone . When you put steroid creams , for example , hydrocortisone creams you can buy in any pharmacy , on your skin , the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stressed , it releases more corticotrophin releasing hormone . The result is greater inflammation the second time around , causing more blemishes , more pimples , more melanin production , and greater damage to the skin . <h> Seven Simple Guidelines Anyone Can Follow to Prevent Blemishes <p> The anti-acne techniques used on skin with color are especially gentle for fair skin . Even if your ancestors came from Iceland , the skin care techniques used for preventing and treating blemishes on darker skin may work best for you . And if you have naturally brown , black , or Asian skin , you simply have to use these techniques to prevent blemishes prevent spotting . <p> 1 . Gently exfoliate your skin every day to remove hardened oils and to prevent spotting , but check with your doctor before you use a medicated cleanser that contains alpha-hydroxy acids , benzoyl peroxide , or sulfur . Beta-hydroxy acids ( the only beta-hydroxy acid used in skin care is salicylic acid ) are OK . <p> 2 . Do n't  use rough washcloths , alcohol-soaked pads , or sponges on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil and creates new blemishes . <p> 3 . Moisturize your skin with an oil-free and alcohol-free moisturizer every day after you rinse off your cleanser , and , if you use makeup , before you put on makeup . A moisturizer with alpha-hydroxy acids may be good for your skin , but ask your doctor first before using it . If fun in the sun or forced air heating in winter dries out your skin , low-cost options for additional moisture include Cetaphil and Olay . <p> 4 . Do n't  poke , probe , squeeze , or otherwise manipulate blemishes or pimples with your fingers , especially not with dirty fingers . Let your cleanser and exfoliants do the work of keeping your skin clear . <p> 5 . Never use over-the-counter corticosteroid creams ( for example , Cortizone 10 or Cortaid ) to treat acne . These will always cause rebound inflammation if you miss a treatment , and they make the skin thinner . <p> 6 . Never use any acne blemish product , not even vitamin creams containing retinol or ascorbyl palmitate , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 . For a skincare emergency , soak a clean washcloth in warm salt water and rest it on your skin . This will help relieve inflammation .

@@98778517 @2978517/ <h> Adjusting Your Diet to Treat Acne 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Limiting sugar and other refined carbohydrates in your diet can help reduce acne . <p> Just avoid chocolate , nuts , and fried food , and your acne will clear up , right ? The fact is , research found that some otherwise healthy foods make acne worse , and some foods that we never hear about can help heal it . But there is general agreement that sugar aggravates acne . <h> Summary : <p> If you have adult-onset acne , sugar is likely to make a big difference in your complexion . Limiting sugar and other refined carbohydrates reduces the sensitivity of your skin to inflammation and helps reduce pimples , nodules , and cysts . <p> More protein in your diet helps open pores , but only if you also consume healthy fats , like those in nuts , seeds , dairy products , avocados , and cold-water fish . <p> Sugar-sweetened soft drinks make your skin more likely to break out when you experience stress . So do energy drinks . <p> Vitamin A is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal weight , your body can make vitamin A for your skin from beta-carotene . If you are overweight , you need vitamin A from food or supplements . <p> Drinking as little as 1/2 cup ( 120 ml ) additional water per day may be enough to hydrate dry skin . <h> The Problem with Sugar <p> Medical researchers have learned that a high-protein diet ( in one study , 44% protein , 35% carbohydrate , and 21% fat ) slows the conversion of testosterone into a form that stimulates oil production in the skin . A high-carbohydrate diet ( in the same study , 10% protein , 70% carbohydrate , and 20% fat ) , has the opposite effect . <p> It only takes about two weeks for a high-protein diet to begin clearing the skin , but not everyone who has acne will benefit from this approach . Persons of European descent tend to develop acne after variations in stress hormones . If you have fair skin , chances are that sugar is not the major culprit behind your blemishes , although there are many other good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you eat . <p> If you have dark brown or black skin , however , you probably tend to develop acne after changes in testosterone levels . Especially if you were acne-free during your teen years and you only developed acne as an adult , limiting sugar may be of great help in stopping blemishes , pimples , nodules , and cysts , especially limiting sugar-sweetened soft drinks . <h> The Problem with Soft Drinks . <p> Sugary soft drinks and energy drinks usually contain a combination of sugar and caffeine . The sugar makes the skin more sensitive to testosterone . This increases oil production . <p> The caffeine makes the skin more sensitive to a chemical called substance P. Substance P is a pain transmitter . Your body makes more of it when you are under stress , but also when you are hungry . If you fill your hunger with a sugar-sweetened caffeinated soft drink , your body just keeps making more substance P so you want more soda . <p> In the skin , substance P triggers the release of a hormone that makes the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an overgrowth of acne bacteria , your skin can still break out when your drink sugar-sweetened soft drinks . <p> Diet soft drinks are not a whole lot better . Too many diet drinks interferes with digestion , and with the action of healthy bacteria in the colon that help reduce inflammation in the skin . The effect of all kinds of soft drinks on the skin is worse under conditions of stress . <h> Fats Have a Place in an Acne Diet <p> Fats , on the other hand , are not always bad for acne . Medical researchers in the Netherlands recruited 302 volunteers to have their faces measured with a device called a sebum meter . The volunteers also gave blood samples for measurement of common nutrients . <p> The Dutch researchers found that , when it comes to acne , there are good fats and bad fats . It is not surprising that at least a little fat in the diet actually reduces acne . The skin uses fats to stay moist and supple . Flexible skin allows sebum to drain out of pores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sebum appears in pores . <p> Although there are contradictory findings in another study of the effects of dark chocolate on acne , in general the fats in cocoa , avocados , nuts , seeds , and oily fish were found actually to reduce sebum production . These foods contain n-3 essential fatty acids that are toxic to acne bacteria . As healthy sebum breaks down , it releases these healthy fatty acids and reduces excess acne bacteria on the skin . When pores are clogged with the kinds of fats found in margarine and soybean oil , the same bacteria eat the irritating , n-6 essential fatty acids until just n-3 essential fatty acids are left . <p> The Dutch study found that the fat in most plant foods is healthy , while the fat in industrially processed oils is nearly always unhealthy . Even milk fat found in whole milk , butter , cream , and cheese seemed to protect the skin , although not as much as the monosaturated fats found in olives , nuts , seeds , and chocolate . <h> Protein Foods Help Hydrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods to make collagen . Collagen absorbs water , and hydrates the skin . It does not do any good to put expensive collagen products on your skin . They absorb moisture from skin care products and make your skin look smoother until you rinse them off , and you have to start all over again . <p> Eating protein foods to increase collagen in your skin , however , helps keep pores open . However , the Dutch study found that reducing fat cancels out the benefits of eating protein . You have to have the beneficial fatty acids from healthy plant foods and fish in your skin for increased collagen production to make a difference . But vitamins and plant phytochemicals make a difference , too . <h> Vitamins Can Help or Hurt <p> The Dutch researchers found that some vitamins help reduce oil production in the skin , while others increase it . <p> Vitamin A and chemicals derived from it , including retinol , retinyl palmitate , and the retinoid drugs such Accutane and Retin-A are important in fighting acne . If you are normal weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A it needs from beta-carotene . <p> If you are overweight , you need to get vitamin A from supplements or food , because beta-carotene is stored in fat . <p> Vitamin C slightly increases oil production in the skin , and slightly dries it out . If you do n't  take more than 250 mg of vitamin C a day , this should not make a difference in your skin . <p> Vitamin E in the form of alpha-tocopherol , the kind of vitamin E you get in industrially produced supplements , greatly increases sebum production in the skin . If you need to take vitamin E for some other health issue , be sure to take natural vitamin E , which includes other isomers of the vitamin , including gamma-tocopherol and tocotrienols . Most Americans get a great deal of vitamin E in their diets and are more likely to break out if they take vitamin E supplements . Most people in the rest of the world tend to be deficient in gamma-tocopherol and do not break out when they take natural vitamin E supplements . <p> Lycopene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases oiliness of the skin . A slice of tomato on your salad or squirt of ketchup on sandwich will not cause problems , however . <p> Beta-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin , phytochemicals which are found in sweet corn and kale , increase hydration of the skin , but only in men , and increase oil production in the skin , but only in men . <p> Calcium from dairy products raises the pH of the skin and makes it less hospitable to acne bacteria , but only in men . <h> Water in the Acne Diet <p> Not to be overlooked in any-acne diet is drinking enough water , at least 1200 ml ( 5 cups ) a day . Drinking tap water and mineral water raises the pH of the skin , just enough to fight acne bacteria . If you have dry skin , drinking just another one-half cup ( 120 ml ) of water per day usually makes a noticeable difference . A single extra glass of water at some time during the day probably wo n't make you have to race to the bathroom , but may add valuable moisture to your skin . 19923 @qwx879923

As long as the walls of the pore are intact , the chemical messengers that tell the immune system " Kill ! Destroy ! " do not reach the bloodstream . <p> When you squeeze a pimple , however , you injure the wall of the pore .

This acid makes it impossible for acne bacteria to use glucose as their cellular fuel . Even if they survive , they have to go into a dormant state . <p> Benzoyl peroxide is great for killing bacteria . Its not so great for clearing up your face . It does not remove redness from pimples . Most people get dry , flaky skin , at least for the first week they use it .

In fact , scrubbing your face to get rid of whiteheads and blackheads is almost as bad for your skin as popping pimples . But you can stop the accumulation of sebum . <p> To prevent the buildup of oily sebum , you need the right cleanser to remove excess oil from your pores .

In fact , any product that you can still feel on your face after you rinse it off has probably damaged your skin . <p> Benzoyl peroxide is an exfoliant , but you will get better results from using either alpha-hydroxy acids or beta-hydroxy acids .

If you do n't  have health insurance , however , and often times even if you do , however , your visits to the dermatologist can total hundreds of dollars per month and thousands of dollars per year . <p> Sudden eruptions of pimples , especially if they are not limited to your face , indicate something more than simple infections with acne bacteria . While only a doctor will know for sure , you could be suffering a severe hormone imbalance ( use of testosterone sometimes causes sudden and severe acne ) or you could be suffering an autoimmune disease .

Any method that fights inflammation with inflammation , such as harsh detergent cleansers , strongly acidic skin peels , lasers at a high setting , or just popping pimples instead of allowing them to heal naturally , can leave spots . You may need to see a doctor to find the kinder and gentler methods your skin needs to heal without forming excessive pigmentation . <p> 3 .

You have black or brown skin , and you develop nasty red pimples where you shave your skin . <p> Sometimes people who have darker skin tones develop severe inflammation around ingrown hairs left when the skin is shaved with a dull razor . This inflammation is actually the immune systems attack on the hair . Its not caused by acne bacteria .

@@98778522 @2978522/ <h> Boost Your Immune System to Fight Acne 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Thousands of so-called experts tell us that the way to fight acne is to strengthen the immune system . The immune system , however , is what causes the skin inflammation that manifests itself as acne . Acne bacteria only pull the trigger . The immune system is the gun . And understanding what " turns off " the immune system can go a long way in helping you control your acne for good . <h> Summary : <p> The inflammation that makes pimples red and keeps nodules tender is not caused by acne bacteria . It is caused by the immune system . <p> Anything that activates the immune system can make acne worse , especially harsh chemicals that damage the skin . <p> Anything that reduces stress on the skin gives acne a chance to heal . <p> The reason killing bacteria resolves acne is that the immune system stops fighting them . <p> The worst thing you can do for acne is to squeeze or lance pimples . <p> The best thing you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Exposed Skin Care . <h> Acne Bacteria Belong On Your Skin <p> Acne bacteria are not evil creatures whose only purpose in life is to make zits on your skin . Acne bacteria in small numbers are actually essential for healthy skin . The Propionibacterium acnes bacteria that live in your pores transform insoluble oils in the skin into propanoic acid , which is easily rinsed away with water . <p> As these bacteria consume excess skin oils as food , they also release beneficial essential fatty acids that reduce inflammation in the skin . The same essential fatty acids that nourish the skin , however , kill bacteria , so the skin is normally home to only as many acne bacteria as are beneficial to the skin . The mixture of water excreted as sweat and propanoic acid carries both excess bacteria and excess oil to the surface of the skin . <h> Acne Starts When Acne Bacteria Multiply <p> Acne becomes a problem when acne bacteria get trapped in a pore . Usually this happens when dead skin cells clump together on top of acne bacteria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of food . They do n't  start eating human skin . As they slow down because they are hungry , they release chemicals that sensitize skin cells to inflammatory compounds released by the immune system . These compounds can break up dead skin that is holding the bacteria in place , but they can also kill healthy skin cells . <p> Just how much inflammation is released by the immune system in the skin depends on several factors that are not related to bacteria . The more the whole body is stressed , the more stress hormones from the adrenal glands stimulate the release of histamine ( the chemical that also causes allergic reactions ) and leukotrienes in the skin . The more the skin is stressed , the more its own stress hormones also stimulate the release of histamine and leukotreines in itself . <p> Acne bacteria just redirect the immune systems " missiles " to the skin itself . They themselves cause very little inflammation . But when the bacteria are killed , the immune system stops destroying skin . <h> How Light Acne Becomes Bad Acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't  do anything , eventually the immune system decides it does not need to keep destroying healthy skin . <p> Other bacteria can train the immune system not to over-react in the skin . Probiotics in the colon trigger an immune reaction , too , but because the passage of waste is constantly removing them , the immune system gets used to fighting bacterial infection with less force . Eating yogurt with live cultures and taking probiotic supplements can reduce the severity of immune system reactions in your skin ( and also in your brain ) . <p> The way the process goes wrong is usually human intervention . Squeezing a pimple , for instance , forces some of the acne bacteria down even deeper into the skin . They go into a layer of skin that ordinarily just waits in reserve to heal the skin when there is a cut or a scrape . These skin cells , unfortunately , can also be made more sensitive to the immune system . The bacteria are pressed so far into the skin that they do n't  have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more inflamed around a nodule or a cyst . <p> Zapping zits with irritating chemicals can cause problems , too . Benzoyl peroxide usually causes only minor side effects , but stronger antiseptics like chlorhexidine can kill as many skin cells as bacterial cells . The skin has to repair itself . The irritation activates collagen-making cells in the " epidermal appendages " that provide a kind of natural bandage for the skin . This collagen forms scar tissue , either holding the skin down or pushing the skin up . The scar tissue will remain on the surface of the skin , constantly renewing itself like normal skin , until the " epidermal appendages " are activated again . This can make the scar even worse , or , in dermabrasion , finally replace the scar with smooth and healthy skin . <p> All of this happens because the immune system is over-stimulated . <h> What Can You Do to Calm Your Immune System ? <p> The most important thing anyone with acne can do to keep their immune system from destroying their skin is to treat their skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , the less it is stressed , and the less skin tissue is destroyed by inflammation . <p> The second most important thing anyone can do to keep their immune system from destroying their skin is avoiding stress . Stress at the whole-body level and stress in the skin itself both increase susceptibility to inflammation . You can reduce stress at the whole-body level by avoiding emotional drama , getting enough sleep , and minimizing your consumption of caffeine . You can reduce stress at the skin level by avoiding heat treatments , ice treatments , sudden changes of temperature on your skin , and by never putting anything on your skin that makes it tingle . Tingly sensations are not a sign your skin is being cleansed . Tingly sensations are always a sign that your immune system is killing skin cells that have been damaged by chemicals . <p> You can also treat your skin with substances that " calm " the skin , such as certain natural spring waters that are rich in magnesium and selenium .

Do n't  stock up on chin acne concealers , however , because simple changes in your personal health habits often can help you get rid of chin acne for good . Here are seven essential secrets for treating acne on the chin . <h> Summary : <p> Chin acne is one of the most challenging acne problems , but sometimes there are simple solutions for chin acne . <p> Sometimes using brands of toothpaste and mouthwash that are SLS-free can clear up acne fast . <p> Lip balm that includes flavors and fragrances can make your skin break out . <p> If you wear a helmet when you participate in a sport or if you hold a musical instrument to your chin for hours at a time , be sure to cleanse and dry the skin of your chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the chin as soon as you see it . Tretinoin topical may help . <p> Do n't  shave with a dull razor , especially on the chin or on the neck . <p> Avoid resting your chin on your hand . <p> There are no special acne products for your chin . You may just need more of the products you use for acne anywhere else on your face . One of the best sources of all the acne products you need is Exposed Skin Care . <h> 1 . Sometimes changing your toothpaste can clear up chin acne fast . <p> Most brands of toothpaste make a foamy lather that lifts particles off your teeth . Its only natural to get some of this toothpaste foam on your chin . The problem is that the chemical that makes most brands of toothpaste foamy , sodium lauryl sulfate ( also known as sodium dodecyl sulphate and SLS ) , can make your skin break out . <p> Girls and women tend to be more sensitive to SLS irritation than boys and men . In some women who have acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouthwash that contain SLS was enough to get rid of acne on the chin . If you just do n't  have the budget to buy toothpaste , mouthwash , and shampoo that is SLS-free , at least rinse very carefully to make sure you do not leave any residues on your chin . <h> 2 . Changing your brand of lip balm sometimes prevents acne on the chin and at the corners of the mouth . <p> Most brands of lip balm contain flavors that are chosen to keep you coming back for more . Chapstix , for example , has lip balms that combine chocolate flavor with Christmas tree scents , to remind you of Christmas every time you use the product . Other brands of lip balm taste like soda pop , candy , or tropical fruits you would eat on a vacation to Hawaii . These flavors add pleasure to using lip balm , but the chemicals that have to added to the lip balm can make your skin break out . <p> Rinsing your mouth every time you use lip balm would prevent chin acne but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acne on your chin , try switching to a non-flavored brand of lip balm , and be sure to rinse your chin at least twice a day to prevent accumulation of wax over pores . <h> 3 . Keep pressure on your chin to a minimum to prevent breakouts on your jawline . <p> Football acne , bicyclists acne , fiddlers chin , flautists chin , and other breakouts on the edges of the chin are often the result of acne mechanica , a kind of acne that breaks out when constant pressure on the chin traps perspiration in pores . The trapped sweat produces localized irritation of the skin a little like the shriveling you can see in your skin when you stay in water too long . The walls of pores flop shut and trap oil and bacteria inside . <p> There are two ways of dealing with this kind of acne . One is to reduce pressure on the chin . The other is to make a point of cleansing the skin immediately after any kind of activity that puts pressure on the chin . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in a sport , then be sure to shower as soon as possible when your event is over . If you play the flute or the violin , rinse your skin after you play your instrument . Be sure to pat your skin dry with a clean towel when you have done your cleansing . <h> 4 . Cystic acne on the chin often can be treated with tretinoin topical . <p> Many people who have naturally brown skin tones have very few problems with acne as teenagers , and then get cystic acne on the chin and neck when they reach young adulthood . The underlying problem is skin that keeps on growing at a youthful rate even after the bones and muscles underlying the face have fully matured , at the age of about 20 to 22 . Growing skin traps pimples and forms cysts , especially at the extremities of the face , on the jawline , on the upper neck , and on the chin . <p> The solution to cystic acne usually is encouraging the skin to grow even faster so cysts can open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tretinoin topical applied to the skin can increase skin growth so cysts open " but its better to start treatment as soon as possible . Smaller cysts are always easier to open than larger cysts. <h> 5 . Avoid resting your face on your hand to avoid chin acne . <p> Many people make a regular pose of tilting the head to one side and resting that side of chin on a hand supported by the elbow . Oils transfer from the hand to the face , and a dirty had can keep the skin on the chin constantly reinfected . Simple avoiding this posture can reduce acne on the chin and on the jawline. <h> 6 . If you shave your chin , be sure to use a sharp razor . <p> Dull razors sometimes bend hairs so they start to grow into a pore rather than out of it . The immune system can release inflammation to get rid of the hair that causes redness and irritation . Certain fast-growing skin types ( usually , but not always , in people who have brown or black skin tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inflammatory chemicals inside a raised pink scar , causing a condition known as acne keloidalis nuchae . <p> It is much easier to prevent this form of chin acne than it is to treat it . Do n't  shave too close , and do n't  use a razor with a dull blade , especially if you have skin tones typical of Blacks or Hispanics. <h> 7 . Womens " hormonal " acne is often more noticeable on the chin . <p> Many women of reproductive age get acne timed with their periods . Usually this kind of acne is most noticeable on the chin , just before menstruation . <p> One way of dealing with this problem is to get a prescription for birth control pills . Another way of dealing with this kind of acne is planning ahead , making extra sure to do skin cleansing and use moisturizer on the chin , beginning at the middle of the middle menstrual cycle , as progestin levels are increasing and thickening the skin around pores . <p> There are no special skin care products for chin acne .

@@98778524 @2978524/ <h> Looking to Prevent Pimples ? Read This Article ! 19922 @qwx879922 <p> A pimple is inflammatory acne , where bacteria has been trapped inside . <p> Blackheads and whiteheads are ugly . Pimples are even uglier , plus they itch and hurt and can leave nasty scars . Preventing whiteheads and blackheads from becoming pimples is the first step in successful acne treatment that can save you years of disfigurement and embarrassment down the line . <h> Summary : <p> A pimple is a whitehead or blackhead with acne bacteria trapped inside . <p> The redness , itchiness , oozing , and irritation of a pimple can be treated with sulfur , benzoyl peroxide , or tea tree oil . <p> As you get your pimples under control , five easy steps " and an acne treatment kit " can keep pimples from coming back . <h> What Are Pimples ? <p> A pimple is inflammatory acne . The medical literature refers to pimples , papules , pustules , nodules , and cysts as " inflammatory comedones , " which is just saying that a plug of hardened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has triggered inflammation on the skin . <p> If you treat a pimple soon enough , the infection is confined to a pore . If you pop , mash , smash , pick at , or prick a pimple and break the walls of the pore , it can spread underneath the skin . The skin can grow over the pimple and create a nodule or a cyst . When the infection escapes the pore , it can grow into a large knot that is protected by tough skin . High-risk medications or surgery are then required to remove it , but you can stop pimples before they start . <p> First , however , let 's take a look at how to treat pimples on your own . <h> Treating Pimples Safely <p> There are three basic kinds of home pimple treatments that do n't  cause more problems than they repair . One is the traditional remedy for infected pimples , sulfur . You do n't  have to descend into the pits of hell and bring back brimstone to treat your pimples . These kinds of products just smell that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does help stop acne infection , and it also relieves redness . Probably , however , you do n't  want your friends asking what died , so you will want to try benzoyl peroxide or tea tree oil , or both . <p> Benzoyl peroxide is the worlds most popular acne treatment . It is a combination of two chemicals that fight bacterial infection very well . It really is not designed to stop inflammation . Your own immune system stops creating inflammation when it no longer senses the presence of active acne bacteria . A small percentage of people who use benzoyl peroxide are sensitive to the chemical and actually get worse inflammation after using it . That is why it is always best to start with a product that is just 2.5% benzoyl peroxide , like Neutrogena Overnight Acne Control Lotion . <p> Tea tree oil , on the other hand , kills acne bacteria more slowly than benzoyl peroxide , but fights inflammation through other mechanisms . Using tea tree oil gels or lotions can begin to clear up pimples in just 3 or 4 days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only drawback to tea tree oil is that a few people will be allergic to it , so before you smear tea tree oil or gel all over your face , test a little dab on your arm overnight to make sure it does not make you break out . <p> Treating pimples safely takes time . It may take 2 or 3 months of diligent treatment with either benzoyl peroxide or tea tree oil to get rid of most of your pimples . Any product or procedure that gets rid of 80% of pimples is considered to be an enormous success . Then its important to keep them from coming back . <h> Simple Steps for Pimple Prevention <p> The basic principle of pimple prevention is simple . If you never get whiteheads or blackheads , they never get a chance to develop into pimples . Here is what you need to do . <p> Eat right . Chocolate , especially dark chocolate , makes pimples multiply . Avoid it . Do n't  overindulge in these foods that contain iodine that can make the skin break out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shellfish , and ocean fish . It is also important not to eat too many tomatoes or too much sweet corn , since they contain trace plant chemicals that increase sebum production in the skin . <p> Wash gently . Its more than just OK to have some oil on your skin . Oil is what keeps your skin lubricated so it does n't  wrinkle when you talk , laugh , smile , or eat . You ca n't scrub acne away , and you should n't try to get all the oil out of your skin . Gentle washing with gentle cleansers ( that do n't  make big bubbles or leave your skin feeling tingly ) is the key . Let the cleanser do the work . Just place cleanser on your skin and then rinse it off . No rubbing is necessary . <p> Do n't  dry out your skin . This means that you should not apply any product that contains alcohol on your skin . Ironically , some " moisturizers " are mostly alcohol ! Do n't  use them . Anything that is dissolved in alcohol , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin . <p> Protect your skin from the sun with mineral-based sunblocks . Sun screens made with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide will help protect your skin from the sun without clogging your pores ( although they may leave a noticeable white cast on your skin if you have dark brown or black skin . ) The reason stopping sunburn stops acne breakouts is that any kind of inflammation closes pores . Blocked pores are where whiteheads and blackheads begin , and if you never get whiteheads or blackheads , you do n't  get pimples . <p> Treat other skin infections promptly . If you get a tender , elevated bump on the skin where you have not previously had a whitehead or a blackhead , it technically is not a pimple . Most likely it is a staph infection of the skin . Everybodys skin has staph bacteria all the time . They are only a problem when they multiply out of control . This usually happens when the skin has been exposed to a harsh , foaming detergent soap that takes the so much oil off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moister , more nutrient-rich home .

Cleansing the skin of the forehead each and every evening , especially if you wear makeup , is essential to fighting forehead acne . <p> You may need to wash your face in two steps to keep your cleanser from getting into your eyes . Unfortunately , you will probably need more cleanser on your forehead ( because its part of the faces oily " T Zone " ) than you need on the rest of your face . <p> Before you cleanse the rest of your face , remove makeup from your forehead with cold cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream to your forehead and let it stand on your skin for 60 seconds . Then with a clean cotton small , blot the cold cream off your forehead , using minimal pressure against your skin . Do not rub your skin .

Wait 15 to 30 seconds , close your eyes , and splash your face with warm water three or four times to remove the cleanser . You need to use a cleanser that gets any remaining makeup off your face without your needing to rub , and that does not leave your skin red or irritated . <h> Washing and Combing Your Hair to Prevent Forehead Acne <p> Most of us only need to wash our hair once a week . Its important to rinse the hair thoroughly after shampooing . Hold the head back so any excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your hair , not onto your face .

The Aveda Product moisturizes your skin and may not be appropriate if you have extremely oily skin . <p> If you blow dry your hair , use a diffuser on your blow dryer . This keeps a hot blast of air from drying out your scalp or your forehead . It also helps prevent dandruff and flaking on your scalp .

@@98778526 @2978526/ <h> Using Soap to Cure Acne It Really Works ! 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Soap and water can be used to cleanse acne-prone skin , but choose a soap that lathers or has small bubbles . <p> Are you trying to treat acne on a budget ? You really can cleanse your face with soap and water . The key is using the right kind of soap . <h> Summary : <p> Even soap and water can cleanse acne-affected skin , but choosing the right acne soap is essential . <p> Big bubbles and foamy lathers of soap usually damage sensitive or dry skin . Small bubbles and creamy lathers of soap or cleanser are best . <p> You cant scrub your acne away . Let your cleanser do the work . <p> Clean towels help you maintain clean skin . <p> There are many good acne cleansers in all price ranges , but a complete skin care system may be a better investment . <h> Soap and Your Skin <p> Many of us think of a " good " soap as a soap that makes a lots of suds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin needs . <p> The problem with big bubbles of soap is that they have relatively high tension along their edges . This forces the soap into the top layers of the skin , and that is a bad thing . When soap gets into pores , it dissolves oily sebum , but it may get stuck if the pores are too narrow . And the act of washing the skin with bubbly soap narrows pores by drying out and tightening the skin around them . <p> A desirable acne cleanser makes a creamy lather of very small bubbles . Small bubbles do not force soap into pores , and make the cleanser easier to rinse off the skin . This is important because many soaps contain ingredients that can irritate the skin . Generally speaking , it you can smell your soap , with the exception of neem or tea tree oil soaps , it contains an ingredient that can irritate your skin or dry it out . <h> You Ca n't Scrub Your Acne Away <p> The very worst way to use soap as a cleanser for fighting acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrub away at your pimples . A used wash cloth can put grease , grime , skin oils , soap film , and acne bacteria right back on your skin as you are trying to get them off . <p> In fact , you should not use a wash cloth on your face at all . Instead , let your soap do all the work of cleansing your skin . With clean fingertips ( so you do n't  put bacteria on your face ) , make a lather of soap . Apply the soap lather to your skin and allow it to do its work for 15 to 30 seconds . Then rinse off the soap with warm water and pat your face dry with a clean towel . <h> How You Can Tell Your Soap Isnt Right For Your Skin <p> When you wash your face , you should not feel any lingering after-effects from your soap . You should not : <p> Feel tightness in the skin on your face 5 to 10 minutes after you dry your skin . Tightness is caused by excessive evaporation of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your skin dries . Soaps that contain acetone , alcohols , or sudsing agents often have this effect . <p> See redness or irritation when your skin dries . This is a sure sign that you have broken down the skin barrier . <p> Break out in hives after you use a soap . Herbal essences , fragrances , and floral ingredients are most likely to cause this problem . <p> The longer you leave a soap on your skin the more likely it is to irritate the skin . The more alkaline your soap is , the more likely it is to irritate the skin . Most dermatologists now agree that an acidic soap , with the same pH as the skin ( 4 to 6.5 ) is the best product for getting rid of excessive acne bacteria . ( A few acne bacteria on the skin are actually beneficial for the skin , by consuming excess oil without damaging pores . ) <p> The right cleanser can make acne , rosacea , or skin damage from Retin-A or Accutane better . There are also soaps that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin caused by Sj+grens disease , but you probably do n't  want to put them on your face . <h> Which Soaps Are Best for Acne ? <p> There is always someone who gets a bad reaction to just about any skin care product . When you are using a product for the very first time , test a tiny dab on the skin of your inside forearm , leaving it there for at least 12 hours . If you do n't  have a skin reaction on your arm , you probably wo n't have an immediate , severe , allergic reaction on your face . <p> There are soaps in all price categories that are good for acne . Here are just a few . <p> Alpha Hydrox Face Wash and Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash are great for cleansing all the very driest skin . They cost between US $6 and $9 . <p> Dove Cool Moisture Facial Cleansing Cloths are also good for all but the very driest , flaking skin . Each cloth in a package of 30 costs about US 20 cents .

It costs about US $30 per bottle . <p> Clean and Clear Daily Pore Cleanser , the oil-free version , is great if you have a problem with blackheads or whiteheads . It costs about US $6 a bottle . <p> Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser , for about US $7 a bottle , is good for blackheads and whiteheads . It wo n't remove them immediately , but you may see results as soon as the next day or as long as a week later , depending on how impacted the blemish is .

@@98778527 @2978527/ <h> Five Tips to Fight Acne 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Nearly everyone gets acne , but acne does not have to get the best of you . If you take care of skin care each and every day , you can get rid of mild to moderate blemishes and pimples and keep them gone for good . It just takes careful attention to what you skin needs . Here five ways you can give your skin what it needs and win you fight against acne . <p> Many teens take on acne by trying to make their skin completely clean without the slightest trace of bacteria . That is always a mistake . In small numbers , the bacteria that live in your pores are helpful . They break down excess sebum into free fatty acids that fight inflammation , and that also keep their numbers in check . Its only when lots of acne bacteria get stuck in the bottom of a pore underneath dead skin and excess skin oil that they become a problem . <p> This means that what you really need to be taking off your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your face with a washcloth only rearranges dead skin on your face . And anything that makes your face feel tingly will just irritate your skin , causing it to soothe itself by making more skin oil . <p> The way to cleanse your skin is to let a gentle cleanser do the work . Unless you have been mud wrestling or you have taken a part time job as a clown for childrens parties , you should not see dramatic changes in your skin when you cleanse . Just cleanse once a day , putting cleanser on your skin , then rinsing it off , letting the cleanser do the work " unless your skin is covered with dirt or makeup . Then you can rub very gently . <h> 2 . Skin needs moisture . Make sure your skin does not dry out . <p> You cant dry up your skin to get rid of acne . The moisture in your skin keeps it flexible , and flexible skin allows pores to expel dead skin , excess oil , and excess bacteria . <p> Do n't  try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach does not hydrate your skin . Instead , add moisture to your skin . This can be as simple as splashing your face with clean water several times a day if you do not wear makeup . And whether or not you wear makeup , you can use moisturizer . <p> Apply moisturizer to damp , but not dripping , recently cleansed skin . Use a water-based or even oil-based moisturizer , never a product made with alcohol . Alcohol wont necessarily kill germs , but it will definitely kill the top layer of cells in your skin , creating debris that can clog pores , and causing irritation that increases the production of skin oils , that can also clog pores . Even if you have naturally oily skin , a little moisturizer around the eyes can stop whiteheads and blackheads. <h> 3 . Popping pimples never work . Use disinfectant gels instead . <p> Popping a pimple may or may not open your skin , but it will definitely force acne bacteria deeper into your skin . Your immune system continues to fight them even when skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may create a cyst . <p> The way to treat a pimple is to kill excess bacteria and then let your skin do the rest of the work of healing . Use the mildest possible benzoyl peroxide product in the morning , starting at 2.5% or less . This kills excess bacteria . Then dab the pimple with a clean cotton swab you have soaked in tea tree oil in the evening . This gets the red out . If you have fair skin , this may be enough , but if you have Asian skin , you also need to use a vitamin E product on the pimple ( its OK to use at the same time as you use tea tree oil , but not at the same time you use benzoyl peroxide , because the hydrogen peroxide released by benzoyl peroxide will neutralize the vitamin E ) . Vitamin E prevents the formation of a brown spot when the blemish heals. <h> 4 . Popping blackheads does not work , either . Use exfoliants to loose the skin around a blackhead so that it comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What most often happens if that the attempt to pop the blackhead punctures the skin around the blackhead , so you are left with a cut or a scratch with a blackhead in the middle , looking even worse that before . <p> Let blackheads come up on their own . You can apply moisturizer around the blackhead to loose the skin that is holding it tight . You can even lay a clean cloth you have soaked in warm ( not steaming ! ) water to the skin for a few minutes several times a day . <p> Or you can exfoliate your skin with a mild ( 8% or less ) glycolic acid skin peel or a mild ( 2% or less ) salicylic acid peel to help the process along . Use glycolic acid products if you have dry skin . Use salicylic acid acid products if you have oily skin . Its important to stick to recommended brands . Some products have the right acid in the wrong concentration , or at the wrong pH . In fact , most products are not put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when you find one that works , it usually works overnight . <h> 5 . When you cant get rid of a pimple or blemish right away ( and you usually ca n't without damaging your skin ) , cover it up . <p> There are different kinds of coverups for different kinds of skin . If you have fair skin , you can use a gray or yellow coverup . The budget basement coverup for pimples on fair skin is milk of magnesia , the same thing used to treat constipation . Put a dot on a pimple and it will look less red , although it may be even more noticeable if you have dark brown or black skin . <p> Otherwise , use yellow concealer followed by flesh-tone foundation if you have fair skin , or brown concealer followed by flesh-tone foundation if you have Asian , brown , or black skin . It is always important to rub the concealer across surrounding skin ( do n't  rub pimples ! ) to make the coverup less noticeable . It is also always important to rinse off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the fight against acne , you need to get every one of these steps right . That takes products and planning .

@@98778528 @2978528/ <h> Using Lotion to Cure Acne For Good 19922 @qwx879922 <p> The most important thing about choosing an acne product is the ingredients used to make the product . <p> Whether you treat your skin with an acne gel , acne cream , acne foam , or acne lotion is not as important as the ingredients the product contains . For some skin care problems , however , lotions are best . <h> Summary : <p> There is nothing special about a product for acne just because it is a lotion , a gel , a foam , or a wash . What counts is what 's used to make the product , the right ingredients in the right amount at the right pH . <p> Never put anything that feels thick or heavy on your face if you have acne . If it feels heavy , it is probably blocking pores . <p> Alcohol and plant essences can increase oil production instead of reducing it . <p> Probably the best way to find the right acne lotion is to start with a skin care system , such as Exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lotion is nothing more than a liquid product that is thin enough to be spread over the skin easily and thick enough to stay on the skin for minutes or hours until it is washed off or dissolves in perspiration . Usually lotions have very small bubbles or no bubbles at all , and they are used to provide substances for the skin rather to remove dirt , grime , or oil off the skin . <p> Most lotions contain both water and at least one ingredient that is not readily soluble in water . To make sure the active ingredients stay dispersed , and do n't  precipitate down the bottom of the container , most lotions contain one or more surfactants or slipping agents to keep the ingredients mixed .

The main problem areas are : <p> Addition of alcohol and/or menthol to make the skin feel tingly .

Any product you use should feel light . Thick lotions clog pores and , whatever potential benefit they may have for other skin problems , they make acne worse . <p> Now let 's take a look at some of the top selling brands among acne lotions . <h> Alpha Hydroxy Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener <p> Here is a product retailing for US $9.99 that can be good , bad , or ugly , depending on the skin type of the person using it .

The mica and titanium dioxide give skin a healthy glow .

My well-intentioned and very cost-conscious mother told me that what I needed to do was to scrub my face . By this , she meant I should fill the lavatory with steaming hot water to make a big foamy lather of Dove soap . I was to use the same scrub brush she used to get the dirt off potatoes to use that foaming lather of Dove soap to get the acne off my face . <p> I do n't  recommend this procedure for anyone . It did n't  work . I was able to get rid of the acne scars , but it took about 10 years . <p> An acne scrub really is a great way to get rid of whiteheads and blackheads . But you do n't  do the scrubbing . You do n't  use a potato brush or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You let the scrub do all the work for you . <h> Summary : <p> An acne scrub does all the work of scrubbing . You do n't  have to rub it in , on , or across your face . <p> Any kind of scrub that makes big bubbles irritates your skin because big bubbles pull on your skin . The area under the bubble , however , gets less cleansing action . <p> Any kind of scrub that makes little bubbles focuses the force of the cleanser on oil and dirt rather on the skin itself . <p> Scrubbing your face with a brush or a washcloth wont make acne better . Your skin will be clean , but your pores will stay irritated . <p> Fiber usually does not do a good job of cleansing the skin . Polyethylene microspheres usually do . <p> You can take scrubbing to the next level with alpha-hydroxy and beta-hydroxy exfoliant peels . These are OK in a scrub you use every day , but do n't  pay extra for them . <p> One of the most effective scrubs uses corundum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine lines and wrinkles as well as hardened sebum , Exposed Skin Care . <h> How a Scrub Scrubs <p> Acne scrubs are not big bubbles of detergent lather that blasts dirt and oil off your skin . You can put detergents on your skin , but they can cause more problems than they fix . Any product you use to scrub your skin should have small , flat bubbles that do n't  make your skin feel like they are doing anything . <p> If its strong enough to make your skin tingle , its damaging the walls of your pores and locking oil and bacteria inside . Your acne scrub wont " prove " its working . You have to wait a few days to see . <p> The way a scrub scrubs is by dissolving the oils on your skin without dissolving the skin itself . Detergents dissolve both skin oil and skin . As contrary to common sense as it may seem , you really want to use oil to get oil off your face . Like dissolves like . Oil dissolves oil . You want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dissolves the excess oil on and in your pores . And you want the cleanser to do all the work . <h> Do n't  Do Any of the Work <p> Rougher is not tougher on acne . Avoid rough scrubs or wrapping bar soap in a wash cloth . <p> Why not do some scrubbing of your own ? <p> There are several problems with using a literal brush or a scratchy wash cloth on your skin . One reason you should not wash your face with a washcloth is that any dirt or germs on the washcloth gets transferred to the skin you are trying to clean. - If you wrap a washcloth around a bar of soap , you will definitely get visible loose dirt off your skin . But you will force soap film into your pores , and that can give you zits , too . Also , vigorous rubbing of the skin can damage the walls of pores and leave the susceptible to infections like impetigo that are even worse than acne . <h> Scrubs that Cleanse , and Scrubs that Heal <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , but there is actually active motion across your face as bubbles expand , contract , and collapse . These bubbles can drag tiny particles of abrasive cleansers across your skin to loose hardened sebum in whiteheads and blackheads . The emphasis here is on " tiny . " <p> If you can see the scrubbing agent in your acne scrub product , it is not going to do your skin any good . It is too large to be rubbed across your skin by the action of bubbles . <p> Coconut fiber , apricot , mica , walnut seeds , oatmeal fiber , and various kinds of barks look like they could scrub your face but they really do n't . They cause tiny cuts on your face , which you cant see . These cuts allow bacteria to get into your skin and this can result in inflammation , blemishes , redness and skin sensitivity . Some of these popular scrubs are so harsh on the skin that they cause your skin to look older than it actually is . If you continue using these scrubs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressively get damaged and inflamed . Even if you can not see this process with your naked eye , it does n't  mean that it is not happening . The scrub will promote the release of free radicals which will eventually age the skin due to the oxidative damage it does to it . <p> For this reason , it is best to check the ingredients of the scrub and avoid any scrubs which have ground shells or seeds . Also , avoid any scrubs which have emulsifiers since they will cause your skin to dry and age . Emulsifiers work by binding together the oil based and water based ingredients in lotions and creams . This makes it possible to use these products without necessarily having to shake them first . However , after you have applied the oil on your skin and all the ingredients have been absorbed , the emulsifier is left on top of your skin . <p> The soapy residue it leaves damages your skin by : <p> Interfering with the natural pH of your skin . It will cause the pH of your skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 6-7 , which is alkaline . Your skin will respond by trying to restore its natural pH balance , which will result in it secreting excess oil , which can lead to redness , acne or rosacea . <p> Impairing the skins natural ability to protect and heal itself since it throws the skins pH off balance . <p> Reducing the protective barrier of your skin , since it binds on the natural oils produced by your skin , so when you wash , you essentially wash away the lipids on your skin , leaving your skin dry and prone to wrinkles and aging <p> Before buying any product , check if it has an emulsifier and if it does , stay away from it . Emulsifiers can also be known with other names such as : <p> Emulsifying wax <p> Steareth <p> Polysorbate <p> Ceteareth <p> Stearate <p> Cetearyl <p> Microscopic polyethylene beads , on the other hand , actually break up hardened sebum .

These scrubs contain alpha-hydroxy and beta-hydroxy acids . <p> In the concentrations you will find in over-the-counter products , alpha-hydroxy acids and beta-hydroxy acids loosen the " glue " that holds dead skin cells to the surface of the skin . They remove pressure on the skin that keeps it tight . They also remove pressure that keeps younger , healthier skin cells from moving to the surface of the skin . <p> When the skin senses that it has fewer layers of tough epidermis , it starts making a protein called collagen . This protein is useful as building material for the skin . It makes the skin more resistant to distortion and injury even as the exfoliation of the upper layers makes the skin more attractive . And it reduces pressure on pores , letting them drain so existing whiteheads and blackheads can fall out of the skin and new whiteheads and blackheads are much less likely to form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmless , natural product that could actually cause problems . <p> Just Being Natural is n't Always Good <p> Just because a product is natural does n't  mean that it is good for your skin .

It has a strong fragrance , which is not very good for the skin , especially if used over a long period of time . The advantage of this scrub is that it can easily be washed off and it will leave your skin feeling softer and smoother . The disadvantages of using it is that it is likely to irritate your skin due to its strong fragrance , it is not any better than a wash cloth that with water soluble fiber .

Most of the scrubs with this kind of labeling are actually too harsh for any kind of skin . <p> Also , it is a good policy not to pay more for a scrub just because it contains alpha-hydroxy or beta-hydroxy acids .

Unless you are removing obvious dirt , grime , or makeup , do n't  rub your skin when you wash it . <h> 3 . Never try to dry out your skin to get rid of acne . <p> Getting lots of sun to dry out your skin used to be the standard advice for getting rid of acne . It turns out that it is not drying out your skin that makes the difference when you get sun .

The skin on your back and can stand up to benzoyl peroxide treatment . <p> Use that same strength of benzoyl peroxide on your face and you may have an entirely different experience .

Other treatments may be needed for face acne. <h> 5 . Keep your hair out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out just over your eyebrows and on your nose is often due to oils from hair falling over the face . Acne at the hair line at the top of the forehead is often due to hair care products clogging pores .

Learn how to conceal acne without having to conceal the concealer . <p> Sometimes you cant get acne treated fast enough before a big date , graduation , or some occasion where you will be in photos . You have to cover it up . The traditional advice is to use green concealer to cancel out the redness of a pimple , and then to use foundation makeup to cover up the green concealer .

When you use a lotion on your face , make sure you cover the jawline . <p> Blackheads , whiteheads , and pimples on the jawline are often invisible to you but extra-visible to other people . Prevent them by making sure you that any skin care treatment you use on your whole face is applied over your jawline , too . <h> 8 . Use stronger skin care products as spot treatments rather than all over your face . <p> If you have a problem with cysts or nodules , you might want to treat them with a product known as tretinoin topical , the over the counter version of a medication known as Retin-A .

They get the red out of pimples as well as killing bacteria . <p> Retin-A , Accutane , and Differin are not primarily anti-bacterial , but they can deprive acne bacteria of their food . <p> Oral antibiotics for acne sometimes stain the teeth " in persons up to 22 years of age . <h> Acne Bacteria Do n't  Cause Acne <p> Most of the time the acne bacterium Propionibacterium acnes is a natural fixture on human skin . The skin makes an oil called sebum to keep it flexible and lubricated . The skin produces extra sebum when the skin is stressed . This production of extra oil can be part of a generalized reaction of the entire body to stress , or it can part of a specialized reaction with the skin to stressors that only affect the skin itself , such as allergens , irritant chemicals , rubbing , or heat . <p> Acne bacteria feed on sebum , but they are only naturally active when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fresh " sebum is overabundant , acne bacteria have an abundance of food . As sebum production declines , " stale " sebum begins to release essential fatty acids . These are useful for the skins health , but toxic to acne bacteria . Most of the time acne infections are self-limiting . They are only a problem when the passage of oil and bacteria to the surface of the skin , where they can both be washed away , is blocked by tightening of the skin or hardening of sebum . <p> When pores are clogged , acne bacteria have a way of " breaking out " of the pore so their descendants can go to live in another pore . They release chemicals that sensitize skin cells to the immune system . When the immune system attacks the bacteria , it also kills healthy skin cells . This reddens and inflames the skin , and at some point , some bacteria will escape when the pimple bursts open . That is , they will escape if the pimple bursts open . Mashing or squeezing pimples presses bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin for good . The result is replacing pimples with nodules and cysts . <h> Killing Acne Without Killing the Skin <p> Many products prevent the formation of nodules and cysts by killing the skin . This works , but it leaves scars , and its not very pleasant for the user of the product ! Some acne products , however , control acne infections without causing irritation or inflammation or damaging the skin . Let 's take a closer look . <p> 1 . Benzoyl peroxide . <p> Benzoyl peroxide , also known as BP , or , since the BP oil spill , as BPO , is the active ingredient in the majority of acne products you can buy over the counter or get by prescription . Benzoyl peroxide breaks down into two compounds that both kill bacteria and reduce the sensitivity to the skin to the immune system . Almost all the bacteria in a pore will die within 48 hours of exposure to BP . <p> The downside to benzoyl peroxide is that it only stops the new inflammation . It does nothing to remove existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Drying out the skin tightens it and creates new clogged pores elsewhere . If benzoyl peroxide is all you do for you skin , that is , you do not have an effective blemish treatment program , you 'll just get rid of pimples in one place and create whiteheads and blackheads in another . Still , used with the right cleanser and moisturizer , BP can do most acne sufferers a lot of good , especially in treating acne on the back and chest . <p> 2 . Tea tree oil . <p> Tea tree oil is the leading herbal remedy for acne breakouts . Like benzoyl peroxide , it kills acne bacteria in pores , although it takes about 72 hours instead of only 48 . Unlike benzoyl peroxide , tea tree oil also is anti-inflammatory . It " gets the red out . " Tea tree oil also does not dry out the skin and does not cause new blemishes . <p> The downside of some tea tree oil products is that they contain enough tea tree oil to smell good but not enough tea tree oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at least 5% tea tree oil to do any good . There is a single report in the medical literature about tea tree oil possibly interfering with the way hormones work in boys who have not entered puberty , so just to be on the safe side , do n't  use this product for acne in babies or in children under 12 . Always test a dab of tea tree oil on the forearm and wait 12 hours to make sure there are no allergic reactions . <p> 3 . Calendula . <p> Calendula is the botanical name of chrysanthemum petals . This natural ingredient is used in skin care soaps and washes for eczema and insect bites as well as acne . <p> Calendula contains natural anti-inflammatory compounds related to aspirin . It also contains compounds that kill both acne bacteria and staph bacteria . Staph infections create bumps that look like especially nasty pimples , with circles of yellow pus visible in the center . You will get better results from a gel left on your skin than from an acne wash . Always test for possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> 4 . Triclosan . <p> Triclosan in higher concentrations can kill both bacteria and skin cells by breaking down their outer membranes . In lower concentrations it kills bacteria by shutting down their ability to use fatty acids . Since acne bacteria feed on fatty acids , triclosan causes them to starve . <p> The issue with using products that contain triclosan , such as Body Shop Tea Tree Clearing Lotion , is that using it at high concentrations damages the skin , and using it at low concentrations kills acne bacteria but has no effect on staph bacteria . Triclosan just removes the bacteria that compete with staph bacteria for moisture and food , so instead of pimples , you may wind up with boils caused by staph infection . Do n't  rely on products based on triclosan to get rid of acne on your skin . They may just cause you even worse problems . <p> Tretinoin , the active ingredient in topical Retin-A and Avita , does not actually kill acne bacteria . This potent acne treatment works primarily by stimulating the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain . It also counteracts the effects of stress on the skin , and desensitizes skin cells to the immune system , reversing their sensitivity caused by bacteria . There are many potential side effects of tretinoin treatment and it must always be used under medical supervision . <p> 6 . Isotretinoin ( Accutane , taken as a pill ) . <p> Isotretinoin , also known as Accutane , is another potent acne-fighting drug that stimulates growth of the skin . By shrinking sebum-producing glands , however , it slowly starves acne bacteria as it helps open pores . Like Retin-A , Accutane has many potential side effects , and should only be used under medical supervision . <p> 7 . Adapalene ( Differin ) <p> Sold under the trade name Differin and available as a cream , gel , or pledget ( small compress ) , adapalene opens pore and counteracts the inflammation caused by acne bacteria . The bacteria are removed , however , as pores open and they can drain to the surface . Adapalene has little or no direct antibacterial action . <p> 8 . Minocycline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teens in the United States , but usually not prescribed for acne in teens in Europe . It fights both acne and other common skin infections , but it has the side effect of staining the teeth brown , gray , black , or blue , especially along the gum line . American doctors typically do n't  give the drug to young acne patients who still have their " baby teeth , " but European doctors seldom give it to anyone under the age of 22 . <p> 9 . Tetracycline . <p> This antibiotic used to be very popular for treating acne . The problem with tetracycline and many related antibiotics is that they have potential for kidney damage . If you use any antibiotic for acne you should also use benzoyl peroxide or tea tree oil to kill the especially resistant bacteria they may leave behind . <p> 10 . Medicinal honey . <p> Medicinal honey , especially Manuka honey , is available in sanitary skin preparations " you do n't  have to dip your fingers in the jar . It fights a wide range of bacteria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manuka honey , in particular , is collected from hives of bees that feed on the plants used to make tea tree oil , and offers all the benefits of tea tree oil plus the power to kill a broader range of infections . <p> pls I have a very serious acne problem I have tried the bp lotions and tea tree soaps yet my acne returns thereafter its troublesome annoying and more like a pest to me pls I need your assistance because all other products mentioned above are no where to be found in my country(Nigeria) .. <p> I went to a dermatologist for help and as soon as i started talking a medicine ( pill ) the acne started spreading more !

Try not to over wash your face and keep hands off of breakouts . I have scars but my skin is clear . I feel your pain .

Get to know the facts about oily skin acne so you do n't  make expensive and potentially disfiguring acne care mistakes . <h> Summary : <p> Oily skin acne requires special handling . <p> Skin oil does not cause acne . Accumulation of dead skin from the lining of pores creates the clog . The amount of skin oil produced in the pore determines how large the blemish will be . <p> The first thing to do in treating oily skin acne is opening pores with salicylic acid . Do n't  use an product containing more than 3% salicylic acid at home . <p> The second thing to do in treating oily skin acne is stopping the production of excess oil with green tea extract , applied to the skin in a lotion or cream . <p> When pores have healed , its OK to seal them with acne care products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oily skin , sometimes you will need moisturizer for dry skin , especially on the sides of your face and along the jaw line . <h> What Makes Oily Skin " Oily ? " <p> Oily skin is not what most people believe it to be . Its possible ( although unusual ) for skin to be both oily and dry at the same time . A working understanding of what makes oily skin " oily " requires a little background in the anatomy of the skin . <p> The topmost layer of the skin , called the epidermis , is made of four distinct layers . When we look at the skin , we only see light reflected from about the top four layers of 25 layers of cells . When the top layer is smooth , it reflects light more evenly than when it is rough . When there is more moisture in the skin , it appears to have deeper colors . When there is more oil on the skin , it looks shiny . <p> At the bottom of the four layers of the skin lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells " create " daughter cells " that migrate to the surface of the skin over approximately 26 to 42 days . In children , the skin usually renews itself about every 26 days . By the time someone is 30 , the skin takes about 35 days to regenerate . By the age of 75 , the skin may only restore itself every six weeks or so . <p> The skin you see is your oldest skin . It is protected from drying out prematurely by compounds known as natural moisturizing factors or aquaporins . These chemicals " hook " water so that it can keep the outer layer of skin moist without interfering with bloodstream beneath the skin or causing the skin to leak . <p> In dry weather or when the skin has been dried out by alcohol or detergents , the lower layers of skin produce more aquaporins to keep the topmost layer of skin healthy . That process takes a few days , so in the meantime , glands at the base of nearly invisible skin pores produce more of an oil known as sebum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oily " skin , those glands are especially active , protecting the skin . <h> Why Is Oily Skin a Problem for Acne ? <p> Skin oil is not the fundamental cause of acne . Oily sebum naturally flows upward in pores and onto the skin , where the excess is consumed by bacteria or simply rinsed away with daily cleansing . Pores do n't  get clogged so that acne forms unless there is something blocking the flow of sebum to the surface . Usually that something is tiny flakes of dried skin matted together with a protein " glue . " <p> Mats of dried skin stop the flow of oil out of pores . The oil becomes compacted and dries out , forming a plug in the pore . If the oil in the pore has not oxidized , it appears yellow or white . If the topmost layer of of oil plugging the pore has reacted with oxygen in the air and oxidized ( and it has n't  been washed off ) , the plug appears to be black , forming a blackhead . If acne bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the immune system may try to destroy them . The bacteria can secrete compounds called chemotactins that redirect the attack to nearby skin , creating a pimple . <p> Pores that produce a lot of oil tend to produce larger , more noticeable whiteheads and blackheads . The oil dilutes the bacteria in the pore , however , so that the formation of a pimple is less likely . Pores that do n't  produce a lot of oil tend to produce smaller , redder pimples . That is because any bacteria in the pore are trapped closer to the lining of the pore and more of their chemotactins reach the bloodstream around the pore . <h> What Is Different About Treating Oily Skin Acne ? <p> If you have tight , dry skin that tends to form pimples , you need to focus on getting rid of acne bacteria . But if you have loose , oily skin that tends to form blackheads and whiteheads , then you need to focus on getting rid of excess oil . The key to successful acne treatment , however , is removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without drying out the skin and causing the flaking that clogs the pore . Here is how it is done . <p> 1 . Open up pores with beta-hydroxy acids . <p> It does n't  do any good to apply a treatment to stop excess oil production in pores that are too clogged to absorb it . The first step in treating oily skin acne is to break the tiny , usually invisible mats of cellular debris that keep oil in pores . The way to do that is by using beta-hydroxy acids . <p> In practice , the only beta-hydroxy acid used to in skin treatments is salicylic acid . Salicylic acid can be manufactured from willow bark , but it is not the same as willow bark . When applied in a concentration of 0.5% to 3% , at a pH between 3 and 4 , salicylic acid dissolves the dead skin that keeps pores from draining and allows them to heal themselves . <p> Why not just mash or squeeze the blackhead out ? Even if you are successful , and most people are n't  , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ugly enlarged pore . Salicylic acid treatments get rid of the noticeable , black head of the plug of sebum quickly and then let the pore drain slowly , giving the walls of the pore time to fall back into their normal shape . <p> 2 . Stop excess oil production with green tea extract . <p> There are several natural products that stop excess oil production . Witch hazel , for example , is loaded with tannins that literally " tan " ( in the sense of making leather ) the skin . The problem with witch hazel is that it can lock oil pores as well as lock oil out of pores . <p> A better choice is any product that contains at least 3% green tea extract . Green tea reduces the production of sebum by the glands at the base of the pore . It wo n't get rid of blemishes , but it will keep them from coming back . <p> 3 . Keep your skin moist as needed . <p> It may seem counterintuitive that moisture can prevent the return of blemishes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin . Using moisturizers when your skin has not had a chance to make its own aquaporins keeps the skin from shrinking around pores and locking dead skin , oil , and bacteria inside . You may not need moisturizer on your nose and across your forehead , but areas of the face are more vulnerable to dehydration , especially the sides of the face . <p> There are many good products recommended throughout this site , but the easiest way to get all the products you need for taking care of oily skin acne and keeping your skin blemish-free are found at Exposed Skin Care . <p> What Is The Acne Cosmetics Connection ?

Does that mean that garlic treatment for acne is a waste of time ? <h> How Garlic Is Used to Treat the Skin <p> Garlic is a traditional skin treatment in Unani medicine , still used in Turkey , Iran , Pakistan , and Kashmir . Traditionally garlic is used to stimulate growth of the skin after inflammation or infection . More specifically , garlic is used to stimulate growth in hair follicles rather than in sebum-producing follicles . When alopecia areata has made hair fall out , or acne keloidalis nuchae has trapped hair in pores , garlic is applied to the skin to correct the problem . Unani physicians in India have conducted clinical trials that have found that garlic enhances the effects of steroid drugs in treating these kinds of skin problems . <p> If you have acne keloidalis nuchae , chances are you will prefer treatment with topical tretinoin to rubbing garlic on your head . However , garlic tablets may have some usefulness in stimulating the immune system to deal with acne infections from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treatment <p> Stimulating the immune system generally is not something you want to do if you have acne . The inflammation and irritation that make the skin break out are caused by the immune system itself rather than by acne bacteria . Acne bacteria trapped deep inside pores can be killed by the byproducts of consuming the sebum on top of them . As the acne digest the waxy sebum , they release n-3 essential fatty acids that nourish the skin but that are toxic to bacteria . Acne bacteria can not eat their way free of the skin . <p> The way acne bacteria eventually escape the pore is by releasing chemicals that make surrounding skin cells more sensitive to inflammation . When the immune system attempts to kill the bacteria by releasing histamine and interleukin-8 , it kills some of the bacteria , but it also kills some of the skin cells around them . Eventually , some bacteria escape the pimple as it heals , and wait to be transferred to another pore so they can go back to their task of consuming excess sebum . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune system to attack your skin . Instead , you give your immune system something else to do . The chemicals in garlic that give it color and flavor are lectins that can cause irritation in your stomach . The immune system sends white blood cells to the villi , or collection points , of the large intestine , that release antibodies to destroy the garlic lectins . Since the digested garlic does not put up a fight , the immune system learns that fewer antibodies are needed to get rid of an infection , and this learning can be transferred to the immune system in the skin . <p> That 's a lot of effort , however , for a very indirect benefit to the skin . Rubbing garlic on your skin will have no effect at all " other than fewer people will notice your blemishes because the smell will make them run away .

This article will tell you why acne breaks out on the body and what you can " and cant " do to get rid of it for good . <h> Summary : <p> Medical surveys have discovered that about 98% of people who have acne somewhere on the body other than the face also have acne on the face . <p> The basics of treating body acne are the same as for treating facial acne , except that stronger products are needed . <p> The first line of treatment for most cases of body acne ( except acne conglobata ) is benzoyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the face . <p> Benzoyl peroxide foam works on body acne , but benzoyl peroxide washes do not . <p> If you break out when you work out , be sure to take a shower within four hours of perspiring heavily , and use a shower mitt to exfoliate dead skin that can clog pores . <h> What Are the Types of Body Acne ? <p> Most people who have acne on the chest or back also have acne on the face . A survey of Canadians who were referred to dermatologists for acne treatment found that 92% had facial acne , and 45% and 61% and acne on the chest and back , respectively . An American study found that 47% of acne patients had blemishes on the face alone , while 52% had acne breakouts on both the face and back .

The type of acne that breaks out on the body , however , is usually the same as the kind of acne that breaks out on the face . <p> Acne vulgaris or common acne forms in the same way on the body as it does on the face . The difference between acne vulgaris on the body and acne vulgaris on the face is that the skin on the body is tougher and less flexible around pores . <p> " Friction " acne , or acne mechanica , most often breaks out on the skin where straps or pads in uniforms or jerseys rub against the skin and trap sweat . The friction between the skin and clothing breaks down the lining of pores . The trapped sweat over-hydrates the skin so that it wrinkles and the topmost layer of skin dies . Flakes of skin get lodged in the openings of pores and oil and acne bacteria accumulate inside , making blackheads and pimples break out . Most people who get friction acne also have facial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is limited just to acne on the body where skin is constricted by clothing . <p> Acne conglobata is a " burrowing " form of acne that can appear on the face , neck , shoulders , chest , or buttocks . Pimples pop out in groups of two or three , and then coalesce into a large , painful , dark red lesion . <p> Acne conglobata is a different story , though . Its a kind of acne that is n't really due to clogged pores . Its caused by fluctuating hormones and usually has to be treated medically . Acne vulgaris and friction acne on the torso , however , can be treated with the same kinds of treatments used to treat facial acne , only at a stronger concentration . <p> Note : Its not always acne . <p> Bustline If little red , itchy , irritated bumps pop up along the bra-line , it might be a yeast infection or a bacterial infection and not acne . You can help prevent and treat this by using an anti-fungal powder or antiperspirant to the area .

You can treat it with something gentle like hydrocortisone or aloe vera . <h> Possible Causes <p> Both gym equipment and the clothes you workout in could be a problem . <p> Spandex <p> Just skip spandex and other synthetic materials and stick to lightweight cotton materials . Synthetic materials like spandex just ends up trapping moisture and oil in that can lead to clogged pores and breakouts .

Bring along some antibacterial wipes to wipe down equipment before using it . Dab away sweat often with a towel during a workout and get into the shower as soon as possible after you 're finished . <p> Dirty- Sheets <p> Sheets that are n't  changed out and washed regularly collect dead skin cells , sweat , dirt and oil that can be transferred onto your skin while you 're sleeping . Again , choose light weight , moisture-wicking sheets like cotton and wash them a couple times per week . <p> Diet <p> Its been said for ages chocolate and fatty junk foods cause you to breakout . - But this is n't really true . Yes , there is some research that 's recently shown that certain foods might influence or aggravate acne or make a current breakout worse . But enjoying a candy bar today does n't  mean you 're going to breakout tonight or tomorrow . However , a balanced , low-glycemic diet with plenty of nutrients and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veggies is not only healthy for your body , but for your skin too . <p> Stress <p> Stress is known to be a big factor in adult acne , so it only makes sense that it could be a factor in your body acne too . When you 're under stress , cortisol levels are increased by the adrenal glands , which leads to an increase in oil production by the sebaceous glands . More oil means better chances of clogged pores . But your immune system is also affected , making it harder for your body to deal with blemishes . Your immune systems effectiveness can drop by 40% . In fact , the link between stress and the immune system is so well known that today there 's a medical field dedicated to it - psychoneuroimmunology . <p> Medications <p> Unfortunately , there are some medications that could be a contributing factor to your body acne . These medications can include , but are n't  limited to : <p> Treatments being used for hormones ( particularly testosterone ) <p> Certain birth control- methods ( pills , implants , injections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're using any medications or undergoing any type of medical treatment , talk to your doctor to see if it could potentially be known for causing or worsening acne . <h> Benzoyl Peroxide for Body Acne <p> Benzoyl peroxide is the worlds most commonly recommended product for facial acne . It is available in over-the-counter and prescription products . Usually over-the-counter products contain 2.5% to 10% benzoyl peroxide , while prescription products are 5% benzoyl peroxide or more . <p> There is no doubt that benzoyl peroxide can kill acne bacteria , but that 's really only part of the process of healing acne . Killing acne bacteria stops new inflammation and gives the skin a chance to heal itself , but it does not " get the red out " and it does relatively little to break up hard , waxy sebum deposits in blackheads and whiteheads on the face " because the skin of the face is too delicate for the higher-strength formulas of benzoyl peroxide that can get rid of whiteheads and blackheads as well as pimples . The skin on the neck , chest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger benzoyl peroxide product . <p> A 5% benzoyl peroxide foam will kill bacteria in pores on the chest , back , and buttocks . It will also break up hardened skin oils that form over whiteheads and blackheads . About 10% of people who use 5% benzoyl peroxide foams may experience slight itching when they start using the product , but stinging , burning , and peeling of the skin on the torso with this strength of benzoyl peroxide are rare . ( They are nearly universal when the product is used on the face , however . ) <p> Its easy to use benzoyl peroxide foam . Just point and spray . Even if you are a man who has a hairy back , the foam will find the pores where it is needed for disinfection and exfoliation . Leave the product on acne-prone skin for five minutes and then rinse thoroughly with warm water , taking care to use a clean towel when drying off . It is important not to put dirt and bacteria on your skin after you have rinsed them away . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  work , because they are rinsed away too quickly for the product to do its work . Only benzoyl peroxide foams are effective on body acne . <h> What About Other Products and Treatments for Body Acne ? <p> There are many other great products for acne on your face , including tea tree oil , alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids , and medications that have to be prescribed by your doctor . Over the counter products will normally contain ingredients like benzoyl peroxide to unclog pores , alpha-hydroxy acid or salicylic acid to dry up existing blemishes or tea tree oil to kill acne causing bacteria . <p> Most of these products will rarely- work for body acne . The toughness of the skin and the difficulty of reaching the affected skin makes them impractical for treating blemishes on the back , chest , and buttocks . Benzoyl peroxide foams are your first choice for treating body acne . <p> Hygeine <p> If you are in that small minority of people who have only body acne without facial acne , however , there is another approach to getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it is critically important that you shower after you work out in tight uniforms or gym clothes . Scientific studies have found that acne bacteria and oil begin to accumulate in pores about four hours after the skin is placed under restrictive clothing . That means that if you work out for an hour , or you have a gym class for an hour , you have a maximum of about three hours to get a shower to keep pimples from breaking out on your back and chest . <p> Body acne also responds to benzoyl peroxide , but if you use a shower mitt when you clean up , you 'll remove the dead skin that can accumulate in pores and cause breakouts . It also helps to loosen straps and pads whenever possible as you work out to give your skin a chance to " breathe . " <p> But while cleansing is a vital part of preventing or clearing body acne , remember that there is such a thing as going overboard . Excessively scrubbing your skin , showering too often , showering in super hot water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negative impact and end up making the situation worse . Exfoliation is good , but should only be done once or twice per week . Cleanse two times a day with a gentle cleanser , shower after a workout and reduce friction on the skin . <p> Medications <p> Birth control and other medications may be an option . <p> In severe cases , sometimes home treatment and over the counter products just are n't  going to cut it . In this case , there are many medications that may be used to clear your acne . <p> Antibiotics Antibiotics used to treat acne often contain erythromycin or tetracycline , which help keep bacteria from growing . Its a known fact though that the type of bacteria that causes acne can become resistant to them . <p> Oral medications Thankfully , antibiotics are far from the only answer . Several types of birth control pills are commonly prescribed to women to keep hormone levels in check and acne under control . In severe cases , isotretinoin may be prescribed , which shrinks sebaceous glands and helps prevent excess oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of topical treatments that are commonly used : retinoids to unclog pores and antimicrobials to decrease the number of bacteria that causes acne . They can come in the form of a cream , lotion , gel , liquid or other form . These are fine for treating face acne , but it can be a challenge to reach some types of body acne with them . Ask your doctor about spray forms to make it easier to reach those trouble spots . <p> Find What Works for You <p> When you 're dealing the acne on your face , you do n't  want to jump right in using different products at the same time that might irritate the skin . When that happens , its hard to tell which product is the culprit . But with body acne , the skin is thicker and stronger so it can tolerate stronger products with minimal or no irritation . In the off chance that any irritation does occur , its likely easy to cover just by putting clothes on . Not so easy when it happens on the face . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works for your skin . With that said though , do n't  go completely crazy with it . Rubbing and scrubbing every possible thing you think might work will probably make the situation worse . And remember that products with active ingredients like AHAs and salicylic acid may make your skin more sensitive to the sun . So do n't  forget the sunscreen ( which you should be using anyways ) . <h> Body Acne Scars <p> Acne scars are n't  limited to just the face . Body acne can just as easily leave scars . If you 're dealing with scars leftover from blemishes on the body , there are a number or things that can help . Its a good idea to talk to your doctor about the best method for you . <p> Normally , methods of removing severe body scars will involve removing top layers of the scar tissue and skin layers . Dermabrasion is often used in severe cases . For scars that are less severe , microdermabrasion with a hand-held device may get the job done . Chemical peels or laser resurfacing are also possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scraping , burning or removing skin layers . If that 's the case , then collagen injections might be something to consider if the scars are the type that have left an indent in the skin . The collagen will plump up the skin , creating the illusion of a smoother surface and minimizing the scars appearance . <p> Body acne tends to be easier to control than facial acne . But for the best facial skin care , consider a complete treatment such as Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923

@@98778536 @2978536/ <h> A New Treatment for Impetigo 19922 @qwx879922 <p> People who pop pimples often are punished by an even more disfiguring skin condition called impetigo . Entering the skin through tiny scratches , nicks , and tears , impetigo can spread all over the body and cause temporary disfigurement that 's a lot worse than acne . Scars and permanent disfigurement from impetigo , fortunately , are rare . <h> A Little Like Acne in the Beginning <p> The very first stages of impetigo look superficially a lot like acne . In the most common form of impetigo , the disease starts as a single macule , an area of reddened skin that is neither elevated above the general contour of the skin or indented below the general contour of the skin . Looking a little like a pimple that has been flattened out , this macule is usually between 5 and 10 mm ( 2/10 of an inch to a little under half an inch ) across , larger than a pimple caused by acne but the same color . <p> The macule does n't  stay that size very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bursts , releasing a honey-colored fluid that dries to a light brown . This fluid can carry infection all over the body , where the process of discoloration , swelling , and bursting is repeated over and over again . <p> Occasionally impetigo is first observed as a bulla ( plural , bullae ) . The bulla is filled with clear fluid that bursts and spreads the infection all over the body . A burst bulla leaves a ring of tissue called a collarette , which may be all that is left of the lesion just 24 to 48 hours after it first appears . The bullous form of impetigo can also cause fever , diarrhea , and fatigue . <p> Both kinds of impetigo are worst where the skin is already broken . Impetigo can get into the skin where pimples have been popped or the skin has been rubbed raw by excessive cleansing . Unlike acne , impetigo can spread across the neck , chest , back , groins , arms , hands , legs , and feet . <h> Who Is At Risk for Impetigo ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child in a family gets the infection and quickly passes it on to siblings . Or one person who uses a locker room gets the infection and infects everyone in the gym . The spread of impetigo is faster in and on : <p> Hot and humid conditions , <p> Crowded living conditions , <p> Shared towels and wash cloths , <p> Shared clothing , and <p> Locker rooms , exercise equipment , school desks , school books , upholstery on seats in public vehicles , and work surfaces that are not properly sanitized . <p> Certain people are more likely to come down with impetigo , including : <p> Small children , <p> People in hospitals , nursing homes , and jails , <p> Diabetics , <p> People who have any condition that compromises immune function , such as HIV , and <p> People who receive medical treatments that compromise immune function , such as most cancer therapies , all steroid drugs , and most treatments for autoimmune disease . <h> What You Can Do to Prevent Impetigo Infection <p> The most important thing you can do to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have skin-to-skin contact with another person who has impetigo .

Wipe down or spray common surfaces when there is a possibility they are contaminated . <h> What to Do If You Come Down with Impetigo <p> Impetigo sometimes replaces an unsightly blackhead or pimple with an even more unsightly red , black , and blue skin wound . The most important thing you can do to if you come down with impetigo is to keep the infection from spreading from your face to the rest of your body . <p> How do you do that ? <p> Bandaging bullae helps . Rinsing off the fluid released when impetigo bursts the skin with warm , soapy water does too . And it helps to use topical antibiotic ointments and creams .

The Dominican doctors use preparations of the amino acid taurine as " minimal bacteriocides " to kill just enough of the impetigo bacteria that the immune system can do the rest of the job . <p> The advantage of a minimalist approach to skin treatment is that there is far less risk of skin infection .

The downside of this medication is that is contains large amounts of propylene glycol , which can leak through the skin into the bloodstream if it is used on large areas of skin . <p> Retapamulin , which is sold under the trade name Altabax . Also a relatively new drug that has a new mode of action against bacteria , it can cause nose bleeds if it gets into the nose . <p> You might also be offered antihistamines , the same drugs used to treat allergies .

It is used to treat cystic acne and a condition called keratosis pilaris , which causes patches of thick , rough skin on any part of the body except the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet . Retin-A is the brand name for tretinoin used to treat acne ; the medication is also available under the trade names Aberela , Airol , Atralin , Refissa , Renova , or Stieva-A ( not to be confused with the herb stevia ) . Tretinoin is also used in treating hair loss , age spots , leukemia , and Alzheimers disease . <h> Summary : <p> Retin-A has been around since the 1960s as a prescription treatment for acne . In the last few years , however , a form of Retin-A known as tretinoin topical has been available over the counter in the United States . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get over the counter usually only open smaller cysts . <p> Neither Retin-A nor tretinoin topical gets rid of all your blemishes .

Without enough vitamin A in the diet , the skin dries out and becomes inflamed . Vitamin A has to be absorbed from food , but the form of vitamin A in food has to be chemically transformed by the human body into the forms that regulate the growth of the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for ways to increase the availability of vitamin A. They learned how to imitate the process the liver uses to transform the retinyl esters in food into retinol for use in the cells . They also learned that retinol could be treated to create forms of two forms of vitamin A that are even more available to the skin , retinal and trans-retinoic acid . The skin can use tretinoin as soon as it is absorbed , without enzymatic transformation . <p> Tretinoin is not just a vitamin . It is a hormone . It can activate specific sequences of DNA in the chromosomes of skin cells . The result of activating DNA in the skin has three effects : <p> Tretinoin increases the production of skin cells in the outermost layer of the skin , the epidermis , so that it grows stronger . <p> Tretinoin causes the compaction of skin cells in the epidermis so that it grows thinner . <p> Tretinoin increases the production of glycosaminoglycans so that the skin lays down collagen fibers in a orderly fashion . <p> Tretinoin rejuvenates the skin .

Thickening of the skin can even out smooth lines and growth of skin can obscure the borders around rough skin . <p> The problem with tretinoin is that it causes the skin to open where it is healthy as well as where it is sick . The skin between cysts can be red and inflamed . The rapid growth of the skin can also , ironically , increase the number and activity of sebaceous glands that make oily , waxy sebum . New pores can clog even while old cysts open . <p> Another problem with tretinoin is that it makes the skin thinner before it makes the skin thicker . It makes the skin more susceptible to sunburn , and increases the likelihood of skin injury when it is waxed for hair removal . ( If you have to have hair removed , threading will not injure the skin . ) <h> Should You Try Tretinoin Topical ? <p> It is no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as tretinoin topical . Even though it costs as much as US $80 for one-half ounce ( 14 grams ) , tretinoin topical only costs 10% to 20% of the price of a visit to the dermatologist and a prescription for Retin-A . It is not necessary to have blood tests to monitor for potential toxicity of tretinoin topical because only tiny amounts of the medication are absorbed through the skin . Any formulation of tretinoin topical that uses microsphere technology will be absorbed more slowly and do more good for the skin with fewer side effects . <p> What kind of results can you expect from tretinoin topical ? <p> Its important to understand that tretinoin topical will not get rid of all of your blemishes . People who have fair skin usually have 60% fewer pimples and 50% fewer blackheads and whiteheads after eight weeks .

One study even suggests that they are safe for dark skin " but be careful. - Use glycolic acid as a skin peel and rinse it off your skin before applying tretinoin topical . Be sure to use sunscreen if you use either product on your skin , especially if you have dark skin . <p> In the North America , Canada , Australia , and New Zealand , you need a prescription to get products that combine Retin-A and antibiotics .

@@98778538 @2978538/ <h> How to Get Rid of Jawline Acne Quickly and Safely 19922 @qwx879922 <p> One of the most difficult skin everyday skin care problems is treating acne on the jawline . Blackheads and pimples on the jawline ruin the contour of your face , and draw attention away from your eyes , nose , and the expressive muscles under the cheeks and brows of your face . Making the problem harder to handle , the kind of acne you get on the jawline often is not the same kind of acne that you have on the rest of your face . <h> Summary : <p> Acne on the jawline is easy to miss and hard to treat . <p> One of the most important causes of jawline acne is mechanical stress on the skin , either from straps that are too tight , or from poorly fitted dental appliances . <p> If you wear a hat or a helmet with a strap that fits over your jaws and under your chin , taking off your head gear from time to time and making sure you shower as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Smokers tend to get blackheads on the jawline . <p> Anything that relieves puffiness in the face helps reduce the visibility of jawline acne . <p> It is especially important to reduce puffiness or swelling of the face if you have Asian or brown skin , which becomes pigmented with sun exposure . <p> Using a mirror that shows you the side of your face and making sure you use acne care products over your entire face , including the jawline , reduces jawline acne . <p> Exposed Skin Care is a good source of products for acne anywhere on your face , including the jawline . <h> What Causes Acne on the Jawline ? <p> The kind of mild to moderate acne that most commonly occurs on the forehead and cheeks is a condition known as acne vulgaris , or common acne . The kind of acne that most often crops up on the jawline is acne mechanica , or irritation acne . In the USA , teens who get acne on the jawline are usually those who play football or march in the band , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , however , straps for hats and helmets as well as for dental appliances can cause irritation and acne at the end of the jaw . <p> The reason acne mechanica breaks out under tight straps is that the straps trap perspiration on the skin . Perspiration encourages the growth of all kinds of bacteria in pores . If you are lucky , it is just acne bacteria that multiply . They mix with dead skin and skin oils in pores on the jawline and clog pores that quickly form blackheads and whiteheads . <p> If you are especially unlucky , staph bacteria " which are easy to pick up in locker rooms and changing rooms " can get trapped in pores on the jawline . These bacteria cause larger , much more prominent pimples with yellow pus inside that often hurt . <p> Even if you do n't  wear a hat or a helmet , however , you can get acne on the jawline . Braces and spacers placed on and between the teeth can tighten skin on the jawline . Pores do n't  have a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working at the Istituti Fisioterapici Ospitalieri in Rome have observed that jawline acne seems to occur more frequently in teens and young adults who smoke . Smoking increases the production of whiteheads and blackheads , and at least in Italy , about 80% of adults who have jawline acne smoke . <p> Doctors in the US have observed that chin and jawline acne occur more frequently in people of all ages , but especially teenaged girls and young women , who use toothpaste and mouthwash containing the ingredient SLS , or sodium laurel sulfate ( also known as sodium dodecyl sulphate outside of North America ) . <h> What Can You Do About Jawline Acne ? <p> More important than any skin treatment products , reducing pressure on the jawline is key to preventing jawline acne . If you simply keep the skin on your jawline as loose as possible , blemishes are less likely to be a problem . This means loosening straps and seeing your dentist about changes in retainers and spacers . <p> The next most important thing in treating acne mechanica is cleansing the skin whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can at least rinse it away as soon as possible . It also helps to take off hats and helmets from time to time during a sports competition or performance . <p> When you rinse the skin , do n't  try to rub acne away . But consider using a shower mitt to clean your skin every time you wash up after sweating . <h> Which Products Are Best for Jawline Acne ? <p> The skin on the jawline dries out faster than the rest of your face . If you need moisturizer around on the bottom of your forehead and to the sides of your eyes to prevent whiteheads and blackheads , you probably need moisturizer on your jawline , too . <p> Puffiness in the rest of your face wont cause more acne on the jawline , but any kind of puffiness makes any acne you already have on the jawline much more visible . Creams that contain the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid stimulate circulation of fluids . These creams should be packaged in a squeeze tube rather than in a jar or bottle , and the package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antioxidant . <p> Using these creams may make jawline acne less noticeable at the same time that they relieve bags under the eyes and puffiness in the cheeks . If you have Asian or brown skin , taking care of puffiness also keeps the skin on the jawline from being exposed to as much sunlight , so that there is less discoloration of the skin when acne heals . <p> A technique known as Facercise can also work wonders for jawline acne . The motions you do to keep your jawline from sagging also help keep pores open . The added benefit of doing daily exercises to prevent double chins and sagging jawlines often is less acne on the jawline . <p> There are not any acne-fighting products that you need to buy especially for acne on your jawline . But you may need to use the acne products that work for you in a different way . <p> When you are looking straight into the mirror , it is only natural to apply more skin care product to over your eyebrows , across your cheeks , and on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jawline . Using mirrors that also give you a side view of your face , however , will make it easier to be sure you treat acne problems on the jawline as soon as the occur . <p> Make a conscious effort to treat your skin on your jawline . You wont use products any faster , and you may even help resolve blemishes on the rest of your face by using a lighter coating of creams and lotions . <p> Getting rid of jawline acne is a matter of changing mechanical stresses on your skin . If you do that , you wont have any more acne on your jawline than anywhere else on your face . But you still need basic acne care , preferably from a kit of products from a reliable company such as Exposed Skin Care . <p> I do not wear head gear , I usually leave less pressure on my face . I wash my face along my jawline every morning and using the correct cream every morning for my face .

Some of the products you probably have will kill acne . Some acne products are fast . Others are slow . But some acne products actually make acne worse . This article will tell you the good , the bad , and the ugly of anti-acne products you can buy for under $20 . <h> Summary : <p> Some products kill acne fast . Some just kill your skin . <p> Isopropyl alcohol ( not the kind you drink ) kills acne bacteria , but only if the concentration is at least 45% . <p> If you use a product with less than 45% alcohol , it wont kill bacteria , but it will irritate your skin . This makes your skin make even more oil . <p> If you use a product that contains more than 45% alcohol , it will kill acne bacteria , but it will also make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from alcohol wipes , lotions , and facial masks .

You can buy pure isopropyl alcohol in bottles for a few dollars at the store . Most acne pads and face washes contain 20% to 50% alcohol with other ingredients that are supposed to help your skin . <p> It takes about 45% alcohol to kill acne bacteria on contact . Anything less than 45% alcohol just irritates your skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This means that if you use a 20% alcohol solution on your face , not only will you not kill any bacteria , you will make your skin even oilier . <p> But a 45% solution makes your skin oilier , too . Alcohol wont be a disaster for your face if you have dry skin , but there are better products for your skin . You do n't  need to throw out your alcohol-soaked acne pads , however . They are great for killing the acne bacteria on your cell phone " something you should do once or twice a week . <h> Benzoyl Peroxide <p> Countless face washes , lotions , foams , and gels fight acne with benzoyl peroxide . This synthetic chemical breaks down into hydrogen peroxide , which dissolves the cell membranes of acne bacteria , and benzoin , which makes acne bacteria more sensitive to the blue rays of visible light that can kill them . <p> The problem with benzoyl peroxide is that not only can it kill bacteria , it can also kill your skin , at least- until it peels down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dead skin makes your skin tight , and tight skin keeps pores clogged . Along with other peeling agents , such as salicylic acid , benzoyl peroxide both kills the bacteria that cause pimples and loosens the hardened oils that cause whiteheads and blackheads . <p> You just need to be careful with how you use this product . Always start with the mildest concentration of benzoyl peroxide you can find , preferably 2.5% or less . Use a gel to treat pimples before you use a lotion to treat your whole face . Test a dot of the gel on your forearm to make sure it does n't  make your arm break out . It makes your arm break out , it will certainly make your face break out . But if you can leave the product on your arm for 8 to 12 hours with no irritation , its probably safe to leave for 3 or 4 hours on your face . <p> There are two times benzoyl peroxide is a must for killing acne . One is for back acne , also known as bacne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your face , so you need something stronger to break up hardened oil . <p> The other time it is a good idea to use benzoyl peroxide is when you are taking antibiotics , whether you are using an antibiotic lotion or you are taking an antibiotic pill . Sometimes a few acne bacteria develop resistance to an antibiotic . Antibiotic treatment wipes out all the other bacteria that would compete for them with food , and the next thing you know you have an untreatable infection on your face . <p> Bacteria do n't  develop resistance to benzoyl peroxide . Your antibiotic will miss some bacteria that benzoyl peroxide will get . Using both treatments at the same time can save you the experience of a really nasty infection . Just be careful not to overdo it . You do n't  want to irritate your skin , just to disinfect it . <h> Clay , Also Known as Mud <p> Medicinal clay is great for getting oil off your face . Medicinal clays are also known as " mud , " but do n't  go digging up dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack . You do n't  know what 's in that mud . Instead , use sterile mud packs you can buy at the store . <p> When it comes to clay for your face , cheaper is almost always better ( as long as it is a packaged product ) . You do n't  want products that have lots of alcohol or emollients or botanical essences , because they can irritate your skin , and when you irritate your skin , it makes more oil . ( Some companies intentionally add these ingredients so you keep buying their product . ) <p> All you want in a mud pack is mud . It is especially important to avoid any products that heat your face " because heat makes your skin break out . <h> Dragons Blood <p> Dragons blood does not come from dragons . It is the red sap of a South American tree known as sangre de drago , and also as a croton . <p> Dragons blood has awesome healing powers . You can put a dab of it on a cut , and it seals it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrape , and it stays put until your skin heals beneath it . <p> That 's not what you want to happen if you have acne .

It actually makes acne worse . <h> MOM <p> MOM , not your mom , but Milk of Magnesia , is a cheap way to cover up a zit . It conceals redness , and it also relieves inflammation . If you have brown or black skin , however , a dot of milk of magnesia over a pimple may be even more noticeable than a pimple " but it will still relieve inflammation . <h> Tea Tree Oil <p> Tea tree oil is , you guessed it , oil distilled from the leaves and branches of the tea tree , a mangrove plant that grows in Australia and New Zealand .

@@98778540 @2978540/ <h> The Anti-Acne Apple Diet 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Eating apples can help make a difference in your skin by helping to fight allergies and reducing inflammation . <p> Can an apple a day keep the dermatologist away ? No matter how light your acne , an apple diet wont get rid of blemishes overnight . You still have to do basic skin care . This remarkable , inexpensive , and widely available fruit , however , can do a great deal to reduce inflammation in your skin . <h> Summary : <p> An apple a day really can keep the dermatologist away . <p> The anti-acne ingredient in apples is the free radical fighting flavonoid quercetin , also found in onions and citrus rinds . <p> Quercetin calms the skin , and also helps prevent allergies . <p> One apple a day is enough to provide enough quercetin to make a difference in your skin . <p> Red Delicious apples contain the most quercetin of commonly available varieties . <p> Organic apples are best , since the quercetin is in the peel . Do n't  forget to wash them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some people are allergic to apples , but people who have apple allergies usually are already eating several pieces of the fruit each day . <h> What 's Special About Apples ? <p> Apples are not going to make any Internet list of sensational foods . They are too easy to find . They are too inexpensive . Most people already eat them . <p> But apples are a solidly nutritious food . They are not the best source of fiber , but they are a good source of fiber . They are not the best source of potassium , but they are a good source of potassium . They are not the best source of vitamin C , but they are a good source of vitamin C. And along with onions and citrus zest , they are a really good source of a plant compound called quercetin . <p> Quercetin is what makes the anti-acne apple diet possible . This plant compound survives digestion . It circulates through the bloodstream to the skin . In the skin ( and in the nasal passages ) , it binds to receptors on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggers allergies . Histamine is also a major trigger for acne . <p> When the skin senses stress , which may be either whole-body stress of which you are very where or skin-localized stress such as too much alcohol in a face scrub or some irritant chemical , it generates its own stress hormones . These stress hormones activate the mast cells to release histamine . <p> You experience the release of histamine as redness , itchiness , and irritation , as pimples become more prominent and unsightly . The purpose of the release of histamine , however , is to kill skin cells and flush out any offending substance to the surface of the skin . The problem is , you can have this skin reaction with or without having encountered any offending substances . Sunburn or emotional stress can also make your skin break out . Quercetin , abundant in apples , onions , and citrus peels , slows down the process of inflammation and helps keep your skin clear . <p> You could just as easily go on an onion acne diet as you can go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onions causes its own beauty and attractiveness issues . You could also boil down about 8 oz/224 g grapefruit rinds for a really awful-tasting soup , or eat about half a cup of lemon zest a day , and your skin would probably get better . But apples do n't  make your breath smell bad , and you probably could not deal with the bitterness in large amounts of citrus zest or citrus rinds . <h> The Best Way to Use Apples to Fight Acne <p> The blemish-fighting quercetin in apples is concentrated in the peel . You get more benefit from eating fresh , organic , unpeeled apples than you get from eating apple sauce , apple butter , apple jelly , or apple pies , or from drinking apple juice . While white sugar in small amounts is not a terrible thing for your skin , its best to get your quercetin from fresh fruit , so your body only has to deal with the natural sugars in the fruit . <p> The apple makes quercetin to protect itself from sunburn . There is more quercetin in apples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are grown in dry-summer climates , such as Chile or Washington state in the United States . Apples grown in conditions of summer drought also produce up to 3 times as much vitamin C as apples grown in areas where it rains during the summer growing season . Certain varieties of apples have more quercetin than others , especially Northern Spy and Red Delicious . Empire apples have relatively low amounts of quercetin . <p> Since you need to eat the peel , organic , unsprayed apples are preferred . About 20% of the fungicides absorbed by the peel break down during storage , so an older conventionally produced apple is less potentially toxic than a recently picked one , but it wont taste nearly as good . No matter whether you choose organic or conventionally grown fruit , its a good idea to rinse the fruit as soon as you get it home from the store . Running water removes as much dirt and bacteria as commercial fruit and vegetable washes , but you have to remember to turn the apple upside down under the tap to get bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store it . <h> Is There a Downside to the Acne Apple Diet ? <p> Even the best skin treatments do n't  work for everyone . Nearly everyone will enjoy clearer skin on the acne apple diet , but there are a few people who wont , specifically , those people who have both acne and an allergy to apples . <p> Apple allergies tend to be most common in people who live in areas where apples are especially abundant , such as the countryside of England and Wales , and the Pacific Northwest of the United States . ( There are few reports of apple allergies in Chile or New Zealand . ) <p> People who are allergic to apples tend also to be people who eat large numbers of apples , three , four , five , and more a day . If you already eat more than one apple a day , eating more apples a day wont clear up your skin . In fact , you might take a vacation from eating apples for two weeks to see if you do n't  experience beneficial clearing of your skin . 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778542 @2978542/ <h> What Does pH Have To Do With It ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Acne is the most common skin disorder in the United States today . 40-50 million people visit the dermatologist for just this disorder every year , according to a study done by the American Association of Dermatology . This begs the question , WHY ? Even experts havent whittled down the exact answer to this question , but its apparent that the balance of pH both inside the body and on the skin is a very important factor . <p> What is " pH " <p> " pH " stands for " potential of hydrogen " . This " potential of hydrogen " is what determines the acidity or alkalinity of a substance . The pH of a substance is measured on a scale of 1-14 . Substances with values lower than 7 are considered acidic and those above 7 are considered alkaline or basic . A value of 7 is a perfect neutral . <p> The human body is a fairly neutral entity coming in at about 7.4 . Small fluctuations are normal , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body measures in at an acidic 4.5-5 though . This is a very important factor in regard to acne and many other skin disorders . <p> pH and Bacteria <p> Of course , its been proven that acne is often caused by the Propionium bacteria that become trapped beneath the skin . As it begins to multiply and grow , as bacteria does , it becomes an infection . This infection then begins to show above the skins surface and becomes a comedone or " pimple " . Of course , when the skin is at its natural optimum acidity of 4.5-5 , its better able to protect itself and the rest of the body from bacteria , allergens and other pollutants in the environment . This pH factor alone would greatly reduce the amount of bacteria on the surface of the skin , as more alkaline environments are a favorite breeding ground for bacteria . <p> There are many ways to balance the pH of the skin to its normal pH value . From diet to skin care , pH levels can be affected both positively and negatively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal to advise them to drink cranberry juice . The reason for this is that cranberry is a very acidic berry and quickly changes the pH of the body , especially the urinary system of the body . After a short time , the person suffering the bladder infection often begins to feel relief , as the acidic environment stopped the growth of the bacteria causing the infection and are flushed away . It is exactly the same idea that protects our skin from bacteria and other environmental factors . <p> How to Normalize pH <p> Inside the Body - Eating foods that begin to normalize the inside of the body as well as using skin care products that return the acidic pH to the skin is the first step to healthier skin . There is a layer of protection on the skin called the " acid mantle " . Here is where most of the warfare on bacteria and allergens takes place . The acid mantle is built by the functions of the body and skin and for that structure to be built correctly , the building blocks must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are processed , artificial sweeteners , heavy meats and dairy products are considered acidic . These are foods that are considered a Western diet . Is not at all uncommon that many people include these foods in their daily diets . By eating foods that are more alkaline such as dark leafy greens , cucumbers , green beans , garlic and even lemons and limes you can help to balance the inside of your body . This will allow it to begin functioning properly and part of that function is to create an acid mantle for the skin . As the acid mantle is returning to normal there will be a healthy change in the skin . Skin care products can completely cancel this improvement if not chosen properly though . <p> On the Skin - Most bar soaps ( even those labeled as " facial bars " ) are extremely alkaline . They usually measure in on the scale around a 10-11 ! Even though the skin feels oil free , fresh and clean after using these soaps , the truth is , they have stripped away the acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replace the acid mantle completely , but by then , the face has already been washed again and the cycle can never really complete , leaving the skin vulnerable to the environment and bacteria as well as either over or under producing oil in order to compensate for the stripping away of its own natural moisturizing factor . Over produced oils and sebum is again , a breeding ground for bacteria . <p> Choose skin care products carefully for treating acne conditions . Look for products that will balance the pH of the skin after cleansing and exfoliating . Even look for full lines of products that are pH balanced for the skin , as Proactiv products claim to be . The right products will promote the healthy construction of the acid mantle to protect your skin from further bacterial infection . It will also cause the skin to relax and not feel the need to over produce oils in order to protect itself . Healthy skin will begin to prevail over acne and healing can begin . <p> Although there is much research and many articles on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood . As dermatologists and skin care researchers become more and more convinced of its importance though , there will be a surge in importance among skin care manufacturers as well . Knowing the truth about pH and realizing its effects on the skin may be the next battle to be won in the war against acne 19923 @qwx879923

Using acne concealer to obscure whiteheads , blackheads , and pimples , however , requires more than just putting concealer on your face . <p> Concealing acne requires two products , not just one . You will need at least one small jar of concealer , and you will also need a brush to put it on your face . You may also need other cosmetics to smooth out the matte of your skin and to tint the concealer to match your natural flesh tones . <h> Summary : <p> When you cant get rid of acne , you can usually hide it with concealer . <p> Ideally , you need both concealer and a feather brush to apply it . <p> Green cancels the red in pimples , but yellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pimples , and you can use the concealer skin problems other than acne , such as circles under the eyes . <p> A light touch is essential in applying concealer .

There are concealers for fine lines and wrinkles , for circles under the eyes , and for red and pink marks caused by acne . The concealer needs to set to a satin finish without flaking , cracking , or streaking , and it should not make fine lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works well on most of your face , but a creamier concealer is needed where your makes lots of lines , such as around your mouth and around your eyes . <p> A concealer does not conceal anything unless it matches your skin color and skin tones . You cant put a pink concealer on black skin or a black concealer on fair skin and expect nobody to notice . <p> Also , a single layer of concealer usually wont work . You need a treatment you apply directly to the blemish and usually also a layer of foundation in your natural skin tone . A concealer in your skin tone , however , will not cancel out redness in a pimple . <p> The best way to cover up a red pimple is with green concealer . If you do n't  have a palette of different concealers at home and you just cant afford to buy green concealer ( its usually about US $10 per jar ) , then you can start with : <p> Gold-toned concealer if you have Asian skin or <p> Beige-toned concealer if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to your natural skin tone if you have black skin . <h> Choosing the Right Brush <p> When you conceal a pimple , you do n't  want it to break out more .

Its easy to lose brushes , and best to keep them in a bag . <h> How to Apply Concealer <p> Wash and dry your hands , and then take a tiny lump of concealer out of the jar , about the size of a pea , about 1 or 2 grams . Place the lump of concealer on the back of your non-dominant hand , the one you do not use to hold the brush , and run the brush back and forth through the concealer to coat the brush .

If the pimple is still somewhat visible after applying the rest of your makeup , add just a dot of concealer over it as the last step in making your face . <p> It is important to remember that making blemishes less noticeable is the purpose of using concealer .

A matte finish product is best for oily skin , but there is no guarantee than any kind of concealer you use to hide acne will not also cause new breakouts . <h> What About Medicated Concealers ? <p> For a medicated concealer to work , it would have to contain both an exfoliant , which loosens dead skin around and over clogged pores , and a disinfectant that kills acne bacteria without irritating the skin .

There are even lines of make made for acne , like Neutrogena , or Clinique ( which , both are available @ drugstores like Walgreens and CVS ) . Do n't  use any cream concealers , which offer more coverage , but are n't  good for acne . Powder foundations are good for oily skin . You cant wash your face too often , or it will remove too much oil and actually over-produce , making it worse . Moisturize or use a moisturizing face wash to prevent this . You can use spot-treatment , like zit cream in a small bottle .

Use a gentle one , like witch hazel or rose water . Simple is a face line that your mom will probably like if she 's into natural stuff = Try you best to not touch your face , spreading oils . If your going to apply any makeup , use the appropriate brushes , or other applicators . Once a month you can steam your face to open your pores and do a clay mask to deeply clean your pores .

By treating the root causes of acne , future breakouts and flare ups are often times also prevented . Naturopathic medicine for acne treatment can also help heal scarring and present a healthier glowing skin . This treatment along with a balanced diet optimized for skin health should result in smooth acne free skin . <p> Information Your Naturopath Will Need From You <p> Its always a good idea to know what to expect when visiting any medical practitioner . Your first visit will be somewhat familiar to visiting a conventional physician or dermatologist . You will need to have your medical history available , fill out the same basic intake forms and HIPPA agreements as well as answer a a questionnaire specific to the reason for your visit . Unlike a typical doctor visit , your first appointment time might be close to 1.5-2 hours . <p> The naturopath will take time to find out who you are , what your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out about how long you 've had acne , when it started and what youve already tried . A naturopath will dig as deep as they need to get to the root of the acne . <p> You can also expect to have a blood test run so that the naturopath can see what your vitamin and mineral levels look like . This will also help expose any underlying problems you may have in relation to the acne you are experiencing . They may even expose things like inflammation and infections that have gone undiagnosed . <p> Visiting a naturopath is quite a unique experience and you will find that you have never felt more secure about your medical treatment . You will probably learn more about your own body and how it is functioning than ever before including why you have acne ! <p> What Your Naturopath Might Prescribe <p> Knowing why you have acne and what makes your body function the way it does will give your naturopath the very best idea of what to do to counteract your acne .

Taking milk and dairy products out of your diet will lower your intake of tran-fats . This will also mean cutting out fried foods , margarine and other hydrogenated vegetable oils and hydrogenated oil products . As with any reduced diet , theyll probably suggest you increase the amount of other foods such as those containing Omega-3 fatty acids . Using ground flaxseed in cooking , or whole flaxseeds on salads , increasing healthy dark meat fish such as salmon and sardines will help balance your dietary needs . <p> Your naturopath will of course tell you to cut out all those yummy junk foods and carbonated drinks as well but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturopath has looked at your test results as well as your lifestyle and dietary choices , they will then be able to more accurately pinpoint the cause of your acne and begin treating it .

Maybe the best way to improve your skin is to try wearing your oatmeal instead of eating it . An oatmeal mask for acne can help freshen and rejuvenate your skin " but its not a miracle cure for acne . <h> Summary : <p> An oatmeal mask is a great way to reduce inflammation and redness of the skin . <p> The way cooked , colloidal oatmeal soothes the skin is by reducing the production of one class of inflammatory chemicals . <p> The right kind of honey added to a cooked oatmeal mask can reduce inflammation further . <p> Oatmeal or oatmeal and honey masks are an addition to sensible daily skin care , not a substitute for it . For the best products for daily skin maintenance , check out Exposed Skin Care . <h> How to Make an Oatmeal Mask <p> You prepare oatmeal for a face mask the same way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook according to the instructions on the box . You wont need to cook more than the equivalent of one serving . Allow the oatmeal to cool to room temperature . <p> Then , with a towel in place to protect your clothes and the table over which you are working , apply warm ( not hot ) oatmeal over your face and leave in place for 20 to 30 minutes . After the oatmeal has set on your face , rinse off with warm water and pat your skin dry . <h> How to Make an Oatmeal and Honey Mask <p> The oatmeal and honey mask is an even more effective treatment for your skin . Cook one serving of oatmeal . While it is still hot , add 2 tablespoons ( about 30 grams ) of honey . Any kind of honey is helpful , but Manuka honey is best for your skin . Allow the mixture to cool , and use as directed above . <p> Why not just mix raw oatmeal in water and use that for the mask ? <p> Raw oatmeal contains fibers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin and hardened skin oils from your face than the fibers in cooked oatmeal , but they can also cause irritation and inflammation on sensitive skin . If you already have red and itchy skin , you need to use a cooked oatmeal mask , not a raw oatmeal mask . <h> How Oatmeal Rejuvenates the Skin <p> Oatmeal is the basis of all kinds of bath additives and skin treatments labeled as " Avena , " from the scientific name for oats . There have been over 100 studies of why colloidal oatmeal " the form of oatmeal after it has been cooked " should relieve inflammation in the skin , and there is general agreement among scientists that it contains chemicals that influence the arachidonic acid pathway in the skin . <p> Arachidonic acid is a " bad " fatty acid that is found in eggs , organ meats , and fatty beef . In a cell , arachidonic acid encourages the production of pro-inflammatory substances rather than anti-inflammatory substances . Inflammation is not always a bad thing . Bodybuilders sometimes take arachidonic acid supplements to increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear in the place . <p> In the skin , inflammation destroys pathogenic microorganisms and opens a path in the skin for them to be forced out of the body . But acne bacteria have the ability to release chemotactic compounds that protect them from inflammation by making surrounding skin more susceptible to inflammation . That 's why acne makes your face break out . Your immune system is trying to get rid of bacteria but actually getting rid of healthy skin . <p> Colloidal oatmeal contains compounds that reduce the production of inflammatory chemicals in the skin . More specifically , these compounds reduce the formation of tumor necrosis factor alpha ; they do n't  interfere with the skins ability to get rid of foreign particles by releasing the chemical histamine . This action stops redness and inflammation and helps soothe the skin . Raw oatmeal , on the hand , just scrubs debris off the surface of the skin . <h> Why Oatmeal and Honey Is Even Better <p> Cooked oatmeal is a great anti-inflammatory , but honey is a great antiseptic . Together these two face mask ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to keep their hives free of infection . That is a daunting task , considering that thousands of bees make thousands of trips for long distances in every direction from the hive . They carry in bacteria , viruses , fungi , yeast , and molds , all of which could cause devastation inside the hive . Fortunately for the bees , honey contains potent antioxidants and compounds that kill microorganisms that could kill bees or infect human skin . <p> Honey also reduces the activity of a kind of skin cell known as a fibroblast . This is the cell that causes skin to grow over a cyst or to raise up to form a pink acne scar . Applying honey to the skin after a scar has formed wo n't shrink it , but applying honey to the skin while acne is still active will help keep the pore open , reduce infections , and stop scar formation before it starts . <h> Why Manuka Honey Is the Best Oatmeal Additive <p> There are additional benefits to using Manuka honey . This is a kind of honey that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand . There is no such thing as Chinese Manuka honey . <p> Manuka honey is made by bees that feed on the manuka bush , also known as the tea tree ( which is actually a coastal bush ) . The pollen of tea tree bushes contains compounds that reduce redness and inflammation by canceling out the ability of bacteria to use their chemotactic compounds . Colloidal oatmeal reduces the production of inflammatory compounds , and Manuka honey helps make sure that the inflammatory compounds that are produced attack bacteria , not the skin . <p> Manuka honey has one other advantage over other kinds of honey . Its easier to spread over your face evenly . When Manuka honey is stirred with your fingers rubbing over your skin , it becomes thinner and more spreadable .

Still , antibiotics can play an important role in getting rid of acne for some people " if they are used correctly . This article will tell you what you need to know about acne antibiotics that really work . <h> Summary : <p> Antibiotics shut down the metabolic machinery of bacteria . Some antibiotics kill acne on contact , but others just cause them to go dormant . <p> Antibiotics are available as pills you take by mouth and as gels , lotions , creams , and serums you put on your face . <p> The antibiotic you used 10 years ago may no longer be effective , as acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain acne antibiotics to anyone over the age of 8 that European and Canadian doctors will not prescribe to anyone under the age of 22 , because of the possibility of staining the teeth . <p> Some antibiotics can cause sensitivity to sun for users who have brown , black , or Asian skin types .

In small numbers , they keep too much oily sebum from accumulating in pores . The bacteria feed on the long-chain fats in sebum , using part of the fat for food , and releasing skin-healthy n-3 essential fatty acids as a byproduct . These fats reduce inflammation in the skin , but they increase inflammation in bacteria .

When the face is not washed properly , or when hormonal changes make skin tight , or when the skin produces extra oil to deal with stress or inflammation , acne bacteria can get trapped in the skin . These bacteria release chemicals that let them out " by making surrounding skin more sensitive to the immune system . It is actually the immune system that causes the redness , irritation , inflammation , and itching of pimples , not bacteria . But killing bacteria stops the process that keeps the immune system on red alert . <p> Antibiotics alone have a harder time getting rid of acne today due to antibiotic resistance . <p> Antibiotics kill bacteria by interfering with their ability to make proteins .

Some of the newer antibiotics for acne , such as azithromycin , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The problem with any kind of bacterial treatment is that some individual acne bacteria area likely to have the ability to resist it . They pass this ability on to their descendants , and they can also exchange genetic material with nearby bacteria to make them resistant , too . Antibiotics by themselves are usually not enough in this era of antibiotic resistance . <p> If most of your blemishes are in the form of blackheads and whiteheads then antibiotics probably are n't  needed and wont do much , if any good . Use a topical treatment that unclogs pores instead . If there 's a mixture of whiteheads , blackheads and inflammatory pimples , then a combination of antibiotics and a topical treatment like benzoyl peroxide may be recommended . A complete acne kit- that treats acne from all angles , - like Exposed Skin Care , may be an easier , less-expensive option too . <h> Minimizing Risk of Antibiotic Resistance <p> If you 're prescribed oral antibiotics , your doctor will probably start with a higher dose and decrease the dosing over time .

Research shows that the use of benzoyl peroxide , in addition to oral antibiotics , can also minimize the risk of resistance . <h> Acne Antibiotics that Work , and Acne Antibiotics That Do n't  <p> Acne antibiotics are offered in pill form , and as antibiotic lotions and creams . Some options for treating acne with antibiotics- include : <p> Substances that kill acne bacteria by inflammation , such as benzoyl peroxide , oil of cloves , and chlorhexidine gluconate .

However , it is often recommended during pregnancy or if you 're breastfeeding . It is also one of the few that both adults and kids can take and wo n't cause staining of the teeth . <p> If you live in the United States , you probably want to have a discussion with your doctor about the possibility of staining your teeth if you are offered a prescription for Minacin ( minocycline ) or any form of tetracycline ( now sold as a generic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian skin , or if you are on the Pill , you will need to use at least SPF-15 sunscreen to protect your skin from spotting if you use any antibiotics . <p> Allergic reactions may occur with certain antibiotics . <p> Antibiotics can also cause deficiencies of the B vitamin folic acid .

Topical antibiotics do not carry the risk of as many side effects as oral antibiotics , but they still need to be used with care . Here are some practical suggestions for success with topical antibiotic treatment for acne : <p> Antibiotic creams and lotions are usually less irritating than antibiotic gels or serums . <p> Antibiotics do not break up whiteheads or blackheads .

Place a dot of the antibiotic or antibacterial product on the skin of your forearm , and leave it for 8 hours . If there is no irritation on your arm , then it is probably safe to use the product on your face . 19923 @qwx879923

Just a few of the potential side effects of Accutane include : <p> Dry skin and peeling skin . Accutane breaks down the " glue " that holds skin cells together over cysts and blemishes . The peeling of skin opens a cyst without lancing , but it also can cause itchy and raw skin all over the body . It can cause nosebleeds in both sexes and vaginitis in women . About 40% of Accutane users experience dry or peeling skin . <p> Irritation at the corners of the mouth . About 90% of Accutane users experience irritation at the corners of the mouth . <p> Closing of bone ends . When the ends of bones close , growing stops .

Changes in the " basement material " surrounding capillaries in the skin can cause rosacea outbreaks in people who have never had rosacea before . <p> Miscellaneous side effects . Accutane has also been known to cause hair loss , elevated liver enzymes , back pain , high blood sugar levels , permanent thinning of the skin , easy bruising , formation of calcified cysts in the muscles , high blood pressure , cataracts , and erectile dysfunction . <p> Some of these side effects may become permanent . There is a well-known increased risk of suicide among users of Accutane , and about 10% of women who use Accutane during the first trimester of pregnancy bear children born with facial birth defects . Using lower doses of Accutane , many researchers have reasoned , ought to reduce the risk of side effects . But would lower doses of Accutane control acne as well ? <h> Lowering the Dose of Accutane for Acne <p> Accutane comes in 10 mg ( pink ) , 20 mg ( red ) , and 40 mg ( yellow ) pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 40 mg dosage . American acne sufferers have to pay out of pocket for their medications , and the various sizes of the drug cost about the same . Many expect to get their moneys worth by taking the highest available dose of the medication . <p> Many of the dosing recommendations that appear in English-language medical journals include studies of patients who were not being treated for acne . Accutane is also used as a treatment for certain kinds of cancer . Cancer treatment requires much higher doses of the drug , but these dosages were included in the recommendations recorded in the medical literature for dosing Accutane for acne . It is entirely possible that decades-old dosage recommendations are simply too high , but have become standard medical procedure in the USA . <p> In Italy , there is no incentive to prescribe a higher dosage of the drug . Researchers in Italy conducted a a clinical study to see if dosage really makes a difference . <p> In the Italian study , 114 people with " mild " acne and 36 people with " moderate " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 30 mg a day ( one pink pill and one red pill ) . Essentially all of the patients in the group studied by the researchers went into remission from acne during the study . Only about 10% relapsed after they were taken off medication after taking the lower dose of the drug . <p> These results are consistent with the results of a study of the 30 mg daily dosage conducted in Germany in the 1990s . German researchers found that about 1/3 of patients given 30 mg of Accutane a day instead of 40 mg of Accutane a day needed a second course of treatment , on average a little under 8 months after they first came off the drug . The German doctors only had one person who failed to respond at all to taking just 30 mg of Accutane a day . <p> In another study , Korean researchers studied 60 people who had " moderate " acne . They were given either a regular dosage of Accutane , a low dose , or intermittent Accutane treatment , taking Accutane only one week per month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were taken off the drug . In the low-dose group , 18% relapsed after being taken off the drug . In the one-week-a-month group , however , 50% had their acne come back when they stopped taking Accutane . Taking Accutane once a week was apparently enough to control acne but not enough to cure it . <p> It seems that lower- ( 30 mg ) doses of Accutane are about as likely to cure acne as higher ( 40 mg ) doses of Accutane , if they are taken regularly . Taking a vacation from Accutane treatment for 3 weeks out of the month results in relapses soon after the drug is discontinued . <p> The reality is , however , that many people take Accutane on an intermittent or occasional schedule even though their doctors tell them to take it every day .

And some people do n't  take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take their pills . <h> Should You Ask Your Doctor About Low-Dose Accutane ? <p> Many doctors are sold on Accutane . Its the only oral medication for acne that both opens the skin and shrinks the oil glands that become inflamed at the base of pores . It shrinks cysts as it opens the skin above them , and it treats blackheads and whiteheads by peeling skin that covers them , too . Some studies suggest that Accutane is also anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial , if it is taken in the right dose . <p> Probably the best time to ask your doctor about taking the smallest dose of Accutane is when it is first prescribed . Ask your doctor if he or she thinks that a 10 mg dose might be as effective for you as 20 mg or 40 mg " and why . Be especially sure to ask about lower doses if you have any history of inflammatory bowel disease , as this sometimes life-threatening condition can be aggravated by taking the drug . <p> I use to be one of Accutanes biggest ambassadors and advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always told about side effects hand heard stories however , I just thought those were the minority of people . <p> The actual fact is people who suffer from permanent side effects , such as irritable bowel conditions to loss of vision go on doing so unreported . Therefore , certain statistics are skewed and not accurate . My first course of accutane 40mg for 6 months yielded the best results . However , results only lasted approximately 8.5 month before my acne resurfaced again , but less aggressive . <p> Long story short , I found a new dermatologist as the old one took a lot of effort into convincing to put me on accutane , I was always wondering why he was so reluctant . So with a google search for best dermatologist within my city , I found one who would readily and easily prescribe almost any acne sufferer . I got what I wanted , 40mg of accutane once again . <p> So during my first month I noticed the typical normal dry lips , but this time my vision started to be affected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that straining my eyes to hard caused this as accutane decreased the oil glands that secrete oil in the eye lid tear film . So here 's when I stopped " being the so called ambassador of accutane " One day I woke up in the morning to use the washroom . I noticed I was severly constipated , to the point where the anal sphincter was causing me pain as I had to force my feces out . I just thought what the heck , probably something I ate . By the 3rd day I realized this was probably the drug , and lo and behold with some research I was spot on . Accutane did this to me . Its been 1 week since my bowel movements have been significantly affected , every time I defecate I am exhausted . Keep in mind I am a 21 year old young man , very fit and active . My intestines and especially my anal bowels feel constantly constricted . <p> I did some reading on this and it can be permanent ! I was only 1.5 months into my treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going for the full 6 . But after reading articles about people who had permanent damage I stopped . <p> MY point is this drug can be very very DANGEROUS . I am hoping side effects of my sever constipation will eventually reside due to me quitting my treatment early . Its just insane at one point I was advocating and loved this drug and now I would tell me be leery . This is a very serious drug . IF someone as fit and healthy as me was affected like that , it can happen to anyone . So I advise take with caution . Now I understand why some dermatologist do n't  like to prescribe it . <p> I went on the original Accutane 25 years ago for cystic acne and it got rid of the cysts for about 10 years . I still had some minor superficial acne but that was it . I had no bad side effects on the original Accutane , but about 8 years ago , I went back on the generic version for 5 months and it was hell . I barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It can occur at almost any age , whether or not acne appears on the face . <p> The most common form of chest acne is sports acne . <p> Sports acne on the chest occurs when tight-fitting pads , elastic , or clothing trap sweat and oils on the skin . <p> People with Japanese skin types are especially prone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with African skin types are especially prone to acne on the chest caused by trapped sweat . <p> The best way to prevent sports acne on the chest is to be sure to wear looser clothing . <p> The best way to treat sports acne on the chest is to be sure to shower after wearing tight clothes . <p> Many men who shave get acne on the chest from the drip of shaving cream or after shave irritating the chest . <p> Some men who shave their chests can develop a condition called acne keloidalis nuchae .

In women , this form of acne most commonly appears when the brassiere is too tight . In men , this form of acne most commonly appears when chest pads are too tight . <p> Sports acne can occur along with contact dermatitis , usually a reaction to elastics used in straps that hold undergarments to the chest . People of African descent are most likely to get the friction-induced type of sports acne , and people who have Japanese skin types are the most likely to break out in pimples along with allergic reactions to elastic . <p> The easiest way to prevent acne mechanica on the chest is to loosen tight clothing .

Men who shave often pop out with pimples just below the neck . And when this happens , it is usually due to dripping of shaving cream and after-shave from the neck down to the chest , irritating the skin . <p> There are several ways to prevent shavers chest acne .

Hairs on the chest get crimped by dull razors and start growing back into their follicles . The immune system can attack the hair follicle and cause a condition known as acne keloidalis nuchae , in which the skin grows over the hair and the immune system tries to dissolve it by releasing histamine , the same chemical that causes hives and hay fever . A dome of pink skin grows over the trapped hair , and may take years or decades to resolve on its own . <p> Trying to dig out the trapped hair always makes the condition worse .

These pimples can be the result of a combination of friction acne " the breasts expand just before a womans period and the brassiere may be too tight " and acne triggered by increasing levels of progesterone in the womans bloodstream after ovulation and before menstruation . <p> The right brand of oral contraceptive may reduce premenstrual acne .

When children get acne , their skin grows so fast that a pore that is inflamed by acne is simply left out of the growing process , and gets covered by scar tissue . Teenage acne leaves slightly less severe scars for the same reason . <p> The small , inward sinking scars caused by adult acne are usually the result of an overly exuberant response of the immune system to acne infection . White blood cells including monocytes , macrophages , and neutrophils attack not just acne bacteria but also the collagen around the lining of a pore . The collagen scaffolding holding the skin together around the pore becomes tangled and loses its regular shape . When the skin begins to close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual framework and leaves an indented scar . The stronger the immune systems reaction to acne , the more prominent the scar . <p> Keloidal scars are tough pink tissue that protrudes upward over an area of healed acne . This kind of acne scarring is more common on brown , black , and Asian skin . The rich tones of Asian , brown , and black skin are due to melanin . This pigment relieves inflammation in the skin and helps it heal . <p> Melanin-stimulating hormone also makes collagen soluble . As pimples heal , the skin gets darker , but collagen dissolves and floats to the top of the skin . It accumulates as a poorly unorganized mass of pink skin over the healed pore , tough but ugly . <h> Skin Peels for Minor Acne Scars <p> Acne scars differ from other kinds of scars only by their location . Any kind of scar on the delicate skin of the face is always hard to treat without causing a new skin problem , whether the underlying problem was acne or not . Treatments that work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for acne scars , assuming acne is not still active . <p> It is always easier to treat smaller and newer scars than it is to treat larger and older scars . Small , indented scars can be treated with products that contain glycolic acid ( an alpha-hydroxy acid ) or salicylic acid ( the only beta-hydroxy acid used in skin care ) , or both . These skin peeling acids work by stimulating the production of collagen underneath the skin , helping it grow at the edges of the scar , raising the scar tissue to the contour of the skin . <p> For glycolic acid or salicylic acid to work , however , you need the right amount of the product at the right pH . You need 3 to 10% glycolic acid at a pH above 3 and below 4 , or 0.5% to 3% of salicylic acid at a pH above 3 and below 4 , or there will be very little benefit for your skin . Usually stinging sensations are not a good thing in skin care products , but alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Exposed Skin Cares Clearing Tonic is a good example of a product that can slowly erase acne scars while preventing new blemishes . The 35% glycolic acid skin peel by Skin Laboratory and the 40% glycolic acid skin rejuvenator by Skin Obsession will work even faster " but it is very easy to burn your skin with these products . That makes scars worse . <p> A silicone gel scar sheet can help reduce small , raised scars . You simply place the silicone sheet over scarred skin every night like a tight bandage . Over a period of a few weeks to a few months , your skin grows into a more even contour . It is important to pay special attention to removing the glue with a non-abrasive cleanser every morning to prevent whiteheads and blackheads from forming on the skin covered by the edges of the silicone sheet . You can also use a silicone gel or cream . Missing just one treatment , however , can undo weeks of skin care . <h> Microdermabrasion for Small Acne Scars <p> Another way to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microdermabrasion . The idea behind dermabrasion is to remove skin down to the " quick , " that is , until you begin to bleed , to encourage healthy regrowth of smooth skin . This method strips away about 25 layers of skin cells . <p> The idea behind microdermabrasion is to remove just 1 or 2 layers of skin cells to expose younger and more deeply colored skin beneath them . The additional color in your skin makes scars less noticeable , and encourages the ( slower ) growth of healthy skin to help fill in scars . <p> Aestheticians usually do microdermabrasion with a spray jet of aluminum oxide crystals , along with a vacuum hose to remove them from your skin . There are at-home microdermabrasion products that encourage you to rub aluminum oxide crystals into your skin , but they usually do n't  come with the vacuum tube to remove them . <p> Aluminum oxide can irritate your skin , so better at home microdermabrasion systems use corundum crystals instead . You still need to rinse your skin thoroughly after using the microdermabrasion scrub , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use corundum . Or you can just gently scrub scar tissue with a polyethylene microdermabrasion cloth . You will gradually remove the edges around raised scars and lighten pigmented skin left behind by pimples . <h> When Medical Treatment Is Necessary <p> Medical treatment is necessary for the worst acne scars , but it is important to understand that you wont walk out of the doctors office with clear , smooth skin . Even the best medical treatments for acne scars are usually only partially successful " since the doctor has to avoid creating a new scar while removing the old scar . Here is a roundup of the most common treatment methods . <p> Steroid injections make pink , raised scars less noticeable , but if they are repeated too often , they lighten and thin the skin . <p> Surgery can cut out scarred skin , with the risk of creating a new scar .

They are cheap , they are effective , and they do n't  require any special skill or expensive ingredients . The best egg white facials , however , do n't  use just egg whites . <h> Summary : <p> Egg whites can be used to make a facial mask that helps reduce discoloration of the skin caused by acne . <p> Egg white masks also firm and tone the skin . <p> The best way to use egg whites in a face mask is to beat them into a meringue-like foam first . <p> Do n't  use egg yolks on your skin .

The lemon juice loosens clumps of dead skin cells at the openings of pores and on the skin , and the egg white sticks to the clumps so that they can be washed off the skin . <p> To make the mask you will need 3 eggs , 1 lemon , one clean mixing bowl and two smaller clean bowls , and two clean towels . A copper mixing bowl is ideal , since copper will stabilize the foam you will make by whipping the egg whites . ( But do n't  add cream of tartar to this mixture to make the egg whites fluffy . Its not good for your face . ) <p> Break the eggs and separate the egg whites , placing the yolks in one of the small bowls ( they can be used in cooking ) and the whites in the mixing bowl . Cut the the lemon in half , and squeeze the lemon through a strainer ( to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 1 tablespoon ( 15 ml ) of lemon juice and add to the egg whites .

Allow it to dry for about 15 minutes , and then rinse off with warm water . Pat your skin dry with the other clean towel and inspect in the mirror . <p> Your egg white and lemon mask should leave your skin with a more even finish and deeper tones . It probably wo n't have an immediate effect on acne blemishes , although it may loosen blackheads and lighten pimples . After you have inspected your skin , apply a light moisturizer to your face to seal in the moisture left in your skin by the mask . <h> Is There a Scientific Basis for Using an Egg White Mask to Treat Acne ? <p> Researchers have investigated the enzymes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lysozyme in egg white is about 20 times more active than the natural skin lightener kojic acid . Like kojic acid , egg white lysozyme helps prevent oxidation and browning of the skin , and it helps preserve red and pink colors in the skin . It may even help reverse the black and blue discoloration of the skin that can occur after the use of hydroquinone skin lighteners in people who have a condition called onchronosis . <p> Many users of egg white masks report that putting egg whites on the skin leaves it feeling tighter and firmer . That effect is due to the interaction of albumin in the egg white with salts in the skin . If you desire a tighter feel after you use an egg white mask , add up 1/4 teaspoon ( 1 gram ) of salt to the egg white mixture before you whisk it for application to your face . <p> There is also a scientific basis for not using egg yolks to make a mask to treat acne . The yellow color in egg yolks is due to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen peroxide to make your skin more sensitive to sun . There is a tiny amount of hydrogen peroxide released by acne bacteria . There is a lot more hydrogen peroxide released by benzoyl peroxide . If you have active acne , and especially if you are using benzoyl peroxide to treat it , egg yolks can leave your skin much more sensitive to sunburn . This does not happen with egg whites . <h> Safe Handling of Egg Whites <p> Most eggs are free of disease-causing microorganisms , but from time to time raw eggs can be contaminated with Salmonella . When the egg is passing through the chicken to be laid , there can be tiny cracks in the shell that admit disease organisms . The longer the egg is allowed to remain in the hen house before it is cleaned and refrigerated and the longer it waits in a wholesalers distribution center or on the shelf before it is bought , and the longer you have kept eggs in the refrigerator , the more likely it is to have grown enough bacteria to cause disease . Simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection against disease . <p> The egg white , however , is always safer than the egg yolk . Egg whites are deficient in iron , while egg yolks are high in iron . Like people , bacteria need iron to be healthy . You are far more likely to be exposed to a disease causing microorganism by placing egg yolks on your skin that by placing egg whites on your skin . Egg whites also contain enzymes that can kill bacteria both in the egg and on your skin . <h> What About Egg Allergies ? <p> Allergies to egg whites are usually triggered by lysozyme , which is also the component of egg whites that corrects discoloration of the skin . If you have never had an allergic reaction to eggs or egg whites before , you are not likely to suffer an allergic reaction the first time you use an egg white mask for acne . However , if you use a commercially prepared egg white mask ( available in parts of Europe and in Latin America ) , you might suffer an egg white allergy due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  use commercial egg white masks , and do n't  use egg white masks if you are allergic to eggs . <p> An egg white mask is a useful addition to day to day acne skin care .

The primary benefit of laser therapy , as well as the primary drawback of laser therapy , is that is has very precise effects . <h> Summary : <p> If you are squeamish about blood , chances are you will prefer laser treatments for acne to microdermabrasion . <p> Laser treatments remove scars and pigmentation by heating hemoglobin in the blood in capillaries beneath the skin . <p> Heating blood vessels deprives upper layers of skin of oxygen and nutrients so they slough off , giving new healthy skin a chance to replace them . <p> The darker your skin , the less likely laser treatment is to be successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely laser treatment is to be successful . <p> Laser therapy always requires multiple visits and never gets rid of 100% of scars or pigmentation . A program of regular skin treatments such as Exposed Skin Care may complete the job started by laser therapy , at much lower cost . <h> Understanding Acne Scars and How they Form <p> Acne happens when pores in the skin fill up with dead skin cells , oil and bacteria . They then eventually become inflamed and burst . When this happens deep within the skin , all that infected gunk spreads among the deeper tissues , resulting in even bigger lesions . <p> Your body will create collagen to to try to repair the damage , which ends up changing the smoothness and the texture of your skin . This could mean depressions and indentations on the skin or excess skin forming . Basically there are two types of scars : hypertropic and atrophic . <p> Hyptertropic " This type of acne scar happens when too much collagen is produced and results in skin bumps , flaps of skin or ridge-like areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite , tissue is lost during the healing process , resulting in depressions in the skin . Ice pick and boxcar scars are in this category . <p> Acne occurs when skin pores become filled with oil , dead skin cells and bacteria . The pores becomes inflamed and eventually burst . If the pore wall bursts deeper in the skin , the infected debris leaks into the deep tissues , which creates larger lesions . <h> How Laser Skin Treatments Work <p> Lasers produce intense monochromatic light , light that is limited to a very a narrow band of wavelengths . This light has no effect on some substances , and high-intensity effects on others . One setting might heat hemoglobin but have no effect on neighboring skin cells . Another setting might- " melt " the melanin that causes deep pigmentation on the skin . A third might vaporize tattoo ink . Dermatologists use lasers to destroy specific substances at specific depths in the skin . <p> The primary effects of laser light in skin resurfacing are photothermal , heating a particular substance in the skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin is known as photothermolysis , the breakdown of selected tissues in the skin . Continuous laser light would destroy tissues surrounding the target as the target tissue heated , so laser skin treatment is usually done with pulsed lasers . <h> Continuing Improvements in Technique <p> Laser therapy for acne scars and brown spots first arrived in dermatologists offices about 1980 . The early continuous wave **33;93;TOOLONG ( Nd:YAG ) laser was used to heat the basal cell layer underneath the skin to stop collagen production . Tissue above the treated layer of the skin charred and sloughed off , initially growing back without scars or pigmentation . Scars always returned , however , about a year after treatment with this early kind of laser . <p> In the early 1990s , doctors were introduced to the vascular-specific 585-nm pulsed dye laser ( PDL ) . Treatment with PDL was targeted on hemoglobin . The topmost layers of the skin were unaffected by the laser . Only the hemoglobin in the blood underneath them was heated . Pulsing the laser kept skin above blood vessels from charring . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purple skin discoloration , and also acne scars . <p> A third type of laser treatment , carbon dioxide laser ablation , could be used to remove overgrowth of skin tissue lying on top of scars . <p> Doctors discovered that the key to getting lasting results from laser therapy was to make sure the immune system did not send white blood cells to " eat " dead skin tissue . Accumulations of the clean-up cells known as macrophages- could cause scars to form all over again . Laser treatments were followed by treatment with steroid creams to prevent swelling and malformation of new skin . <h> The Pluses and Minuses of Acne Laser Treatments <p> The tremendous advantage of acne laser treatments over earlier techniques of scar removal was that it was bloodless . Dermabrasion involved mechanically stripping off just the top 25 layers of skin cells down to the " quick , " where blood vessels were found . Regenerative skin cells underneath this layer could then rise to fill in the scar as they replaced the skin . <p> Dermabrasion left a bloody wound that could easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside out without bleeding and with much lower risk of infection . <p> The downside of laser treatments for acne has always been that one treatment is never enough to remove a scar . And certain skin types just do not respond very well to laser treatment . <p> The darker the skin , the more melanin there is to absorb some of the light energy intended for hemoglobin . Skin above the level of the capillaries serving the skin can char and leave an open wound . When the skin grows back , it may be lighter than surrounding skin . The darker the skin , the greater the problem with loss of pigmentation after treatment . <p> Another problem in laser treatment of black and dark brown skin is that darker skin tends to form tough scars known as keloids . These disfigurements require more treatment than ordinary acne scars , running greater risk of damage to the skin . About 1 in 6 people with black skin and acne will develop keloids that can not be treated with laser , compared to about in in 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should You Have Laser Treatment for Acne ? <p> Even if you have fair skin , there are reasons you may not want to have laser acne treatment . <p> Laser treatment for acne is expensive , and not typically not covered by insurance . Each session may cost up to US $1000 and as many as 10 sessions may be needed . <p> Raised acne scars eventually smooth themselves out , although this may take several years . <p> If you have used Retin-A , Renova , or tretinoin topical , your skin may be thin underneath indented acne scars . Its important to wait at least six months after using any of these products before having laser acne procedures . <p> Contact dermatitis , eczema , and psoriasis are worsened by laser treatments . <p> Also , as mentioned at the beginning of this article , laser treatments are very precise . There may be a noticeable difference between treated and untreated areas of skin , almost as if a line had been drawn across your face . <p> Laser treatment is not the final answer for acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that laser treatment will remove 100% of your acne , chances are that your dermatologist will reject you as a patient for this procedure because of unrealistic expectations . Laser acne treatments improve the skin , but they never perfect it . <h> 2 Important Tips to Help Prevent Acne Scarring <p> You do n't  have to avoid the sun completely , but use sunscreen , hats or even an umbrella . <p> The best thing to do is avoid scarring all together . If you have acne and are worried about possible scars , there are two simple things to keep in mind that will help . <p> Do n't  Pick This is probably the hardest thing to do when you have troubling bumps and pimples , but its extremely important not to pick at and squeeze them if you do n't  want to end up with scars . When you pop a whitehead , you 're doing more damage . Inflammation increases and more collagen is lost , which means your skin cant heal as well it should .

@@98778557 @2978557/ <h> What Kind of Medication is Neosporin ? <p> Neosporin is an antibiotic . More precisely , it is three antibiotics . Neosporin is a combination of bacitracin , neomycin , and polymyxin B. They are mixed together in a base of cocoa butter , petroleum jelly , sodium pyruvate , tocopheryl acetate , and cottonseed oil . <p> Bacitracin is an antibiotic commonly used when there is a possibility of staph infections . It works well on the body , but it works poorly in the body ( except in chickens ) . Bactracin by itself is most commonly use to prevent infections when the skin is tattooed , but it only kills one kind of bacteria , Steptococcus pyogenes . <p> Neomycin is a chemical Streptococcus bacteria release to kill Staphylococcus bacteria . It wont kill strep bacteria on the skin , the way bacitracin will , but it will kill staph most staph bacteria . Neomycin is sometimes given as a pill to treat bowel infections . It is not absorbed into the bloodstream when taken as a pill , but if it were injected into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Polymyxin B is a mixture of two other compounds , polymyxin B1 and polymyxin B2 , that kill bacteria by attaching to their cell membranes and making them very permeable to water . The bacterium absorbs so much water that it bursts . <p> Polymyxin B is an antibiotic that either kills a bacterium or does n't  . If the strain of bacteria is " gram-positive , " that is , it has a tough outer wall , polymyxin has no effect . Acne bacteria are gram-positive . <p> None of these three antibiotics has any direct effect on acne bacteria . If anything , they will just wipe out all the other , competing bacteria in a pore so acne bacteria will be in charge . Neosporin will not kill acne bacteria but it sometimes is what is needed to clear up your complexion . <h> When Pimples Are n't  Caused by Acne Bacteria : Staph Infections <p> Sometimes raised bumps on the skin look like pimples but are n't  . Staph and strep bacteria can cause inflammation on the skin , too . These are the bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the skin typically cause a painful , raised bump on the skin . It usually has a round yellow center of pus that makes it look and feel something like a little volcano . The main way you can tell the difference between acne and a staph infection is that acne always breaks out from a pore , and staph always breaks out from a tiny cut . Acne usually occurs on your face , and you cant spread it to other parts of your body . Staph infections can break out anywhere on your body , and they are easy to spread with dirty fingers . <p> There is an even more important difference between acne and staph infections that makes staph infections potentially deadly in the very young , the very old , and people weakened by illness . Acne infections do n't  cause inflammation on their own . The immune system causes the inflammation that attempts to flush them out of pores . Staph infections release their own toxins , and can even clot blood . A staph infection is something you want to stop as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . <h> When Pimples Are n't  Caused by Acne Bacteria : Strep Infections <p> Staphylococcus aureus can protect itself from the immune system by making blood clot so white blood cells can not reach the skin . Streptocococcus pyogenes can spread itself from one site to another on the body by interfering with clotting factors and aggregating factors in the blood so white blood cells can not band together against it . <p> Infections of the skin with this kind of strep bacteria can literally dissolve layers of the skin . This is the kind of reaction you see in a skin infection known as impetigo . The skin dissolves from the inside out and forms a blister . In just a few hours the blisters burst , releasing a honey-brown fluid that quickly dries on the skin . The fluid spreads the infection . <p> The kind of impetigo caused by strep infections can cause intense itching but does not leave scars unless the skin is treated too aggressively . This kind of strep infection on the skin can even resolve on its own , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat and scarlet fever . Untreated blisters on the skin can also cause permanent enlargement of the lymph glands nearest the blisters . <p> There is also a kind of impetigo caused by staph bacteria . This skin infection originates in the nose . Staph bacteria from the nose and sinuses are spread onto the skin by mucus . They also cause blisters , but these blisters do not easily burst . After 2 or 3 days they may release a thin , yellowish or clear liquid . The blister deflates from the middle out . This kind of impetigo usually does not cause permanent activation of the lymphatic system . <h> Neosporin Is Important for Treating Impetigo <p> Since Neosporin kills both of the kinds of bacteria that can cause impetigo , it is good thing to keep on hand , especially if you have small children . But you should only treat impetigo on your own if you manage to catch the infection when it has just caused one up to three or four tiny blisters . <p> If you are treating just a few blisters , apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each blister and wait for them to pop . Remove dead skin with warm water and a soft washcloth you throw away after use . Do n't  pick at the blisters . If you are treating a child who has impetigo , make a game of wearing gloves or mittens so they will not pick at the infection and spread over the rest of their bodies , or other childrens bodies , as they sleep . Clean all clothes , bed clothes , and towels in hot water . <p> Neosporin cant treat severe cases of skin infection caused by strep and staph . If there are multiple blisters , or if there are any signs of sinusitis or sore throat , see a doctor . There are medications for impetigo that will not cause side effects , although they tend to cost more . A topical medication called mupirocin may control infection so that oral antibiotics do not have to be used . <h> What About Neosporin for Everyday Acne ? <p> Neosporin may be just what you need when you have staph or strep infections . It really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the antibiotic components of Neosporin fights acne bacteria . These antibiotics are most useful for bacteria that do not have cell walls .

And Neosporin can not penetrate deep enough into the skin to get rid of any kind of bacteria that live in the sebum-producing glands themselves . <p> Benzoyl peroxide and tea tree oil are what you need for fighting acne bacteria . Benzoyl peroxide kills acne bacteria that antibiotics miss , and tea tree oil controls not just acne bacteria but also staph infections on the skin while it relieves inflammation in the skin .

But through the 60 years most of live our adult lives , women are more likely to get acne than men . <p> Dr. Julie Harper , an associate professor of dermatology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham , and her colleagues published findings that adult acne is more common in women than in men in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology . There is a general misperception , Dr. Harper writes , that acne is only a disease of teenagers . Many dermatologists , however , treat patients who first developed acne as adults . <h> Dr. Harpers Acne Survey <p> Harper and her colleagues sent 1,013 men and women 20 years of age or older a one-page questionnaire . The survey asked respondents whether they had ever had acne-related skin blemishes or pimples during their teens or later in life . Respondents were queried whether their acne had gotten worse , gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Asked whether they had ever had acne , 73% of people surveyed reported that they had . Nearly identical numbers of men and women reported that they had had acne during adolescence , 69% of men responding to the survey and 67% of women responding to the survey reporting that they had . In every age group among the adults answering the survey , however , significantly more women reported they currently had acne than men . <p> The most common form of adult acne in women is premenstrual acne . Among the women responding to survey who had not yet passed menopause , 62% reported that their acne is worse the days just before they had their periods . Among women participating in the survey who had already past menopause , - 86 said their acne improved when they started using hormone replacement therapy , 75 said that hormone replacement therapy made no difference , and 2 said that hormone replacement therapy made their acne worse . <h> What Adult Women Who Have Acne Need to Know <p> Dr. Harper believes that this survey will stimulate new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . But what do mature women who have acne need to know that they did n't  need to know when they were teenagers ? Here are some of the essential facts of acne care for adult women . <p> Sugar aggravates acne more than fat in adult women . High intake of sugar and other fast-acting carbohydrates increases blood sugar levels . Most tissues in a womans body can " switch off " their responses to insulin so that they are not flooded with sugar when women eat too much sugar , but the ovaries can not . They use extra sugar to make extra hormones , both estrogen and testosterone . The excess estrogen interferes with menstruation and fertility , and the extra testosterone fuels unwanted hair growth and acne . Sometimes cutting back on sugar consumption enough to lose just 2 or 3 pounds ( 1-2 kilos ) is enough to correct both acne and menstrual irregularities . <p> Womens skin responds better to alpha-lipoic acid than mens . Alpha-lipoic acid is a naturally occurring antioxidant that has the unique property of being soluble in both water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissues of the face , and it can also cross through the fatty phospholipids that form the outer membrane of cells so it can be absorbed directly inside .

The biggest problem in most cosmetics is the addition of botanicals . Certain herb and spice extracts irritate the skin , especially balsam , cinnamon , citrus , lemon , lime , mint , peppermint , wintergreen , and witch hazel . Your skin may be able to tolerate small amounts of these botanical additives , but if you have rosacea , or you have the kind of acne that is more likely to cause pimples rather than blackheads , these botanical ingredients can easily make acne harder to manage . <p> Oral contraceptives have a major effect on acne , but not all brands are equally beneficial .

High-estrogen contraceptives are no longer recommended for treating premenstrual acne , and most women have to try several brands of the Pill before they get the results they seek .

@@98778559 @2978559/ <h> Sunscreen and Acne : What 's the Connection ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Its important to use sun screen when treating acne to help prevent skin discoloration . <p> If you are just starting an acne treatment program , one of the first things you need to do is to choose he right sunscreen for your acne-prone skin . Protecting your skin from the sun is essential to the long-term success of your acne treatment program , especially if you have Asian , brown , or black skin . <h> Summary : <p> Everybody needs a little sun so the skin can make vitamin D. Otherwise , you need to take a vitamin D supplement or cod liver oil . <p> Sun protection is especially important when you are using products to disinfect the skin . <p> The darker your skin , the more important it is to use sun protection when you are treating acne , because you have greater potential for long-term discoloration of the skin . <p> Even if you have black skin , you need sunscreen when you are using acne medications such as benzoyl peroxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need different kinds of sunscreen . <p> Cosmetics that contain sun protection may be enough for people who have dark skin , but they are never enough for people who have fair skin . <h> Sunlight Is Both Good and Bad for Your Skin <p> The way most of us relate to the sun for our skin care is that the sun is either totally good or totally bad . If you love to lie out in the sun , you might argue that tanning your skin makes imperfections harder to see " and the fact is , it does . A great tan can shift attention from blemished skin to a manly torso or shapely legs . But unnaturally golden skin can become freckled and spotted skin , and the brown ( or even black ) imperfections in the skin will be worst where skin has not been treated . <p> At the opposite extreme , some people always cover every inch of skin with sunscreen before they step outdoors . When the national health service of Australia started encouraging people to slather themselves with sunscreen in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , instead of down . It turns out that vitamin D protects against skin cancer , and the skin needs about 20 minutes of exposure to ultraviolet light , without sunscreen to block ultraviolet light , every day in the summer and even more during the winter if you live in a temperate or northerly climate . <p> Unprotected skin out in the sun for hours each day is not healthy . Overprotected skin that never makes vitamin D is not healthy , either . Everyone , whether they have acne or not , needs at least a little sun , but also a little sunscreen to keep skin vibrant , unblemished , and , it is to be hoped , cancer-free . <h> Everyone Who Has Acne Needs Sunscreen <p> Generally speaking , fair skin usually burns , while black skin never burns . Dermatologists classify skin color into Fitzpatrick skin types . Skin type I is fair skin that burns easily when exposed to sun . People who have this skin type often have blond or red hair and blue eyes . Sunburned skin freckles in childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have skin type I never tan . <p> Fitzpatrick skin type V is dark brown skin that rarely burns . And Fitzpatrick skin type VI is black skin that never burns , that is , unless it is being treated for acne . <p> There is one thing that everyone who has ever been told about their skin type needs to remember about skin types and acne : Acne medication can make every skin type behave as if it were Fitzpatrick type I. Even if you have deep , dark black skin , if you use benzoyl peroxide , or if your doctor has prescribed Retin-A or Accutane , going out into the sun can cause irritation , inflammation , and burning . <p> And if you have Asian , brown , or black skin , that irritation can leave permanent discoloration on your skin . Even if you have dark brown or black skin , you may need a sunscreen when you are treating acne-prone skin , although just SPF 15 may be enough . Especially fair skin in tropical sun may need SPF 70 . <h> How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate the feel of sunscreen even though they know they need it . The problem usually is that they are not using the right type of sunscreen for their type of skin . Here are some basic guidelines . <p> If you have oily skin and you do not use makeup , use sunscreen that contains zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide . These chemicals serve as a physical barrier to sunlight and do n't  feel greasy on your skin . Since the whiteness of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide can leave black skin looking purple , use tinted sunblock made with these ingredients if you have black , oily skin . <p> If you have oily skin and you use makeup , choose a foundation that contains sunscreen . At least SPF 15 is needed , but you cant have too much sun protection . If you have oily skin and your makeup tends to streak , use tinted sunscreen instead of foundation and finish with an oil-absorbent powder . <p> If your skin is very shiny , you can mix a shine control product with your sunscreen to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunscreen and shine control . <p> If you have dry skin and you do not use makeup , sunscreens that also contain pcynogenol ( grape seed extract ) , cucumber , or saxifrage ( strawberry begonia ) extract can prevent freckling of your skin . <p> If you have dry skin and you do use makeup , any product that contains jojoba oil offers additional protection for your skin . <p> If you tend to break out due to " whatever , " that is , you have sensitive skin , avoid products that contain avobenzones , benzophenones , oxyphenones , methoxycinnamate ( most commonly found in waterproof sunscreens ) , and para-aminobenzoic acid ( also known as PABA ) . These ingredients can cause pimples . <p> Loose powder with sunscreen ingredients may provide sun protection of SPF 8 to 20 . This is enough for African skin types , but people with people with other skin types who use makeup need a sunscreen in addition to powder . <p> If you have Asian skin , it is critical to use non-irritant skin protection when you are using whitening agents . 19923 @qwx879923

From baking soda to dryer sheets , people have tried some pretty odd things . Some of these treatments might seem gross but remember , it worked for someone , somewhere ! By no means is this a DIY instruction sheet . It is informational only and if it strikes your fancy to try one of these , please consult with your physician before trying any of these at home . Yes , even the banana peel . <p> Coal Tar <p> Coal is known to belong to a class of drugs called keratoplastics . When used as an exfoliant its shown to effectively cause the skin to she 'd dead cells away , as well as slow the growth of new cells . Slowing the growth of skin cells might possibly prevent trapping the bacteria that cause acne beneath the skin . Its very often used for those suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is just what it sounds like . Catching the urine and applying it to pimples or the entire face has been shown to be quite effective for a FEW people . Using it as a mask for 10-20 minutes and then rinsing away leaves behind a more conditioned skin due to the substance called Urea that is found in urine . It can also be used with compresses or spread on with a washcloth soaked in urine . <p> Windex <p> That 's right . Windex . Somehow , Windex made it on to the acne treatment scene soon after its introduction as a cleaning product . This treatment is GREATLY discouraged though , as Windex contains many volatile chemicals and the pH of Windex is highly alkaline . Our recommendation ? Do n't  try this one at home ! Thanks a lot " My Big Fat Greek Wedding " ! <p> Banana Peel <p> Banana peel contains a chemical called lutein . It also contains Vitamins A , B and C as well as potassium , magnesium and many other great vitamins and minerals . Using a banana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may even help clear pimples . <p> Potato <p> The potassium , sulfur , phosphorus and chloride in potatoes is rumored to help clear break outs .

Potatoes are very " starchy " and when they start to dry they leave behind a gritty powder that will flake . Not pretty . <p> Athletes Foot Powder <p> In the summer its not uncommon to experience a rash and breakout under the bra , that 's a two fold issue . More than likely its both a bacterial and fungal infection . Simply powdering with Athletes foot powder is believed to help clear all of this rash and return the skin back to normal . The powder wicks away moisture while also providing a fungal fighting medication . <p> Aspirin <p> Many acne patients would love to go to their esthetician and get the strongest , deepest chemical peel possible .

That being said , aspirin is made from acetylsalicylic acid and can provide those anti-inflammatory benefits as well as drying the blemishes for faster healing . All of that right at home in medicine cabinet . <p> Dryer Sheets <p> Here is a strange one . After a dryer sheet has been used , SAVE IT ! Some say rubbing the sheet on the face will remove oils and gently exfoliate it as well . It is probably best to dryer sheets that are already only slightly scented as the fragrance could cause further irritation , but these sheets can be washed , rinsed and dried again for use and re-use . <p> Bird Poop for Geishas <p> Bird poop ? It is said that geishas would use the droppings of Nightingales each night as a facial mask to keep their skin clear and smooth . The poo was probably part of a concoction of other ingredients , but who thought this was a good idea in the first place ? But again , this worked for someone , somewhere .

While this strength of benzoyl peroxide is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in over-the-counter acne products , it can cause dryness , stinging , burning , and peeling of skin in about 80% of people who use it . Most people can not use a benzoyl peroxide product that is this strong for more than about a month before side effects become intolerable . The new formulation of Advanced Blemish Treatment , however , is less drying and irritating than the old formulation , in that the product no longer contains alcohol . <p> You will probably lose about 2/3 of your pimples and 1/3 of your blackheads and whiteheads during the very first month , but you are likely to find the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 0.33 oz/8 grams , you may want to check out Clearasil , Neutrogena , and Exposed Skin Care , which offer similarly effective products for a lot less money . <h> Proactiv Concealer Plus Sulfur Acne Treatment <p> Since benzoyl peroxide only gets rid of about 2/3 of your pimples ( after about a month , new pimples form about as fast as old pimples heal ) , you may want to use a concealer . This Proactiv product claims to cover up pimples while helping them heal with the power of sulfur . <p> The US Food and Drug Administration has approved this 6% sulfur product for use as an over-the-counter treatment for acne . The problem with this Proactiv product is similar to the problems with Advanced Blemish Treatment , in that sulfur can irritate the skin . The sulfur also gives the makeup a grainy finish which could call even more attention to your pimples than the odd orange , peachy , and pink tones used in the concealer . This product unfortunately can not be recommended for anyone who has acne . <h> Proactiv Repairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and oil-free lotion containing " finely milled prescription-grade benzoyl peroxide " that you can use over your entire face . Costing just $22 for 2 oz/56 grams , this product is a relative bargain compared to the Proactiv Advanced Blemish Treatment . And even though it contains just 2.5% benzoyl peroxide , the minimum amount of the acne-fighting ingredient approved by the US FDA , it is likely to get rid of just as many pimples and blackheads with a lot less skin irritation . <p> What makes benzoyl peroxide " prescription grade , " by the way , is not how finely it is milled . A few products offer benzoyl peroxide microspheres which slowly release tiny amounts of the chemical into pores , enough to kill bacteria without causing irritation . The process of making microspheres involves combinations of chemicals , not additional grinding of the product . <h> Proactiv Clear Zone Body Pads <p> Although branded as " body " pads , this Proactiv product is really a salicylic acid peel intended for use in treating acne on the face .

The main ingredient in this mask is kaolin , the sterile clay used to make " mud packs .

Unfortunately , many people are allergic to iris root , and it offers no benefits in skin care . <h> Proactiv Mild Exfoliating Peel <p> Proactiv advertises this product as a mixture of mild , calming botanicals with the sloughing action of salicylic acid .

This simple fact means that people who have acne who know they are about undergo a period of high stress need to be especially diligent about doing their daily skin care routine and taking any prescription acne medication . It also means that doctors need to take stress into consideration when they prescribe medication for acne . Even if you can not stop stress , you can plan for stress , and do everything you need to do for the health of your skin . But sometimes acne is triggered by stress that is localized in the skin . <h> How Stress Causes Acne on Oily Skin <p> People who have oily skin tend to get whiteheads that just wont go away and blackheads the size of traffic lights . These acne blemishes form in response to stress , but not the kind of stress that comes with finals in college or pledging a fraternity . <p> Pores in oily skin tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sebum . Even though oily skin by definition makes an unusually large amount of sebaceous oil , the oil usually can flow to the surface because pores are larger , too . The problem comes when both dead skin and oil have to flow through the pore . This can be too much for the pore . The oil and dead skin harden and form a persistent whitehead that can become a prominent blackhead . <p> What kills oily skin ? Sunburn , for starters . People who have oily skin often have darker skin that usually does not burn " so they do not use sunscreen . Unusually hot and bright sun , however , or exposure to the sun after using benzoyl peroxide , Accutane , Retin-A , Tazorac , or Differin , however , can make the skin peel . Tiny bits of dead skin get stuck in pores and clogs result . <p> The second most common cause of acne on oily skin is using the wrong acne care products . Alcohol dries out the skin . Big bubbles of detergent cleanser can dry out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other essential oils , particularly menthol , actually can kill the uppermost level of the skin . Anything that leaves the skin feeling tingly is killing cells in the epidermis which can subsequently clog oily skin . <p> One of the most important principles of preventing blemishes on oily skin is gentle cleansing . Oily skin repairs inflammation by producing even more oil . As long as you can keep up with oil production and dead skin , it will stay clear . But clearing up acne on oily skin is a lot easier if you do not add the stress of detergent cleansers , menthol , and alcohol-based skin care products . <h> How Stress Causes Acne on Dry Skin <p> People who have dry skin tend to get pimples , lots and lots of tiny , red pimples . Dry skin breaks out it is exposed to irritant chemicals that sensitize the pores to inflammation generated by the immune system . <p> The pores in dry skin tend to be smaller because they produce less oil . There is less room for the pore to conduct dead skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the walls of the pore are in closer contact with the tiny blood vessels that bring nutrients and oxygen to the skin and connect the skin to the immune system . <p> The tiny red pimples that are characteristic of dry skin are not actually caused by acne bacteria . They are caused by the skins release of histamine after it is " excited " by contact with irritant chemicals . The reddening of the skin that is concentrated in pimples is the skins way of isolating an irritant that finds it way into the pore . <p> Unfortunately , this also traps bacteria inside the pore along with skin oils . But the immediate cause of most pimples on dry skin is some kind of irritant chemical . This can be alcohol in an acne care product . It takes 46% alcohol to kill acne bacteria on contact , but this amount of alcohol also causes skin irritation . Lower amounts of alcohol not only do not kill acne bacteria , they trap bacteria inside pores by irritating the skin . <p> Some essential oils irritate dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wintergreen . Some botanicals irritate skin , including all of the botanical ingredients in Noxzema , camphor , menthol , and eucalyptus , as well as cinnamon , citrus , lemon oil , and linalool in other products . Disinfectant chemicals can irritate dry skin . The stress of irritation makes dry skin break out , usually after use of the wrong acne treatment products . <h> Taking the Stress Out of Acne Treatment <p> There is a long list of safe and unsafe products for treating acne-prone skin . You can check your product choices against cosmetic safety guides or the articles on this site one by one . Or you can invest in a safe acne treatment system that takes the stress out of acne treatment with simple , inexpensive products that work , such as Exposed Skin Care . <p> I 've an oily skin , and I do n't  have a white skin I want 2 know the suitable skin treatment that ll be good for my skin I 've had acne 4 over 5years now , I 've so many blackheads and spots 4rm previously healed acne what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urine thrapy can it really work 4 me ? <p> I have acne all over my face . lots of black spot on my face for serveral years and have used lots of medications but the black spot wont go away I 'm having a oily face pls what can I do to clear my black spot of my face and the whole of my body ?

@@98778566 @2978566/ <h> Will A Birth Control Pill Control Your Acne ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Millions of women take oral contraceptives so they can plan pregnancies . Most women discover that when they go on the Pill their skin changes , and the right formulation of the Pill can sometimes cure premenstrual acne . Your doctor has to prescribe the best brand of the Pill for your health and your personal choices , but here is the information you need to know before you ask for a different brand of- oral contraceptive for acne . <h> Summary : <p> Testosterone causes increased skin oil production in both sexes , but womens skin also responds to progesterone . <p> Among women in their reproductive years , progesterone production is greatest after ovulation , during the second half of the menstrual period . <p> Increasing estrogen production at the beginning of the period normalizes production of oil and tightness of the skin , relieving acne until progesterone levels once again go up around the time the woman ovulates . <p> The contraceptive Pill can help relieve acne by supplying estrogen . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of a smaller dose . This reduces side effects . <p> Acne usually does not begin to clear up until a woman has been on the Pill or the Patch for three months . <p> Even when women used hormone-based contraception , they still need regular skin care to prevent acne . An acne treatment system like Exposed Skin Care combined with appropriately prescribed contraception may greatly accelerate healing of acne-prone skin . <h> What Is the Relationship Between Hormones and Acne ? <p> Many women of reproductive age notice that they break out with pimples just before they have their periods . The reason acne is in sync with the menstrual cycle is that estrogen and progesterone change the flexibility of the skin . <p> During the first half of a womans period , her ovaries release more estrogen in usual so that the lining of the uterus can thicken to receive a fertilized egg . Estrogen levels continue to increase during the first 10 or 11 days of a 28-day period , until the woman ovulates . Then , the corpus luteum begins releasing progesterone either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to remove the lining of the uterus so the cycle can start all over again . <p> As a womans estrogen levels increase , her pores open and acne heals . As a womans progesterone levels increase , her pores tighten and pimples can pop out . The cycle continues month after month until menopause . <h> How the Pill Affects Acne <p> The contraceptive Pill stops ovulation but , in typical doses , does not stop menstruation . A woman who does not ovulate can not get pregnant . The Pill stops ovulation with a combination of synthetic estrogen and progestin , a chemical similar to progesterone . Different brands of the Pill contain different amounts of estrogen and progestin . <p> When women receive added estrogen during the third week of their periods , their core body temperature does not increase as much and their skin produces less oil . These changes do not guarantee that pimples wo n't break out , but usually the right brand of the Pill can reduce the total number of blemishes by 45% to 65% . The Pill is not a cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why Not Take a High-Estrogen Oral Contraceptive for Acne ? <p> Larger amounts of estrogen have greater effects on the skin . The problem with supplemental estrogen is that it can have far-reaching effects on womens health . Estrogen can increase risk of breast cancer and cancers of the ovaries and uterus . It can increase risk of blood clots , heart attacks , and stroke . It also cause fluid retention and weight gain . <p> Most doctors try to minimize the side effects of estrogen by giving women some brand of the Pill plus antibiotics . Antibiotics , however , also have side effects . The most commonly prescribed acne antibiotic in the US , minocycline , can cause staining of the teeth in women under the age of 22 . The most commonly prescribed acne antibiotic in Canada , clindamycin , often causes abdominal pain and diarrhea .

In any given month , one survey found , about 1/3 of teens ( and a little over 10% of women over the age of 30 ) forget to take a Pill . The Patch only has to be changed once a month , if it does not fall off the skin . About 1% of contraceptive Patches have to be replaced because the adhesive fails . <p> Because the hormones in the Patch do not have be processed through the digestive tract , dosing is more predictable and reliable . <p> Younger women , in particular , experience less dysmenorrhea and fewer heavy periods when they use the patch . <p> The kind of estrogen used in the Patch , norgestimate , slows down the conversion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulates skin oil production and unwanted hair growth . <p> This kind of estrogen reduces the response of the skin ( and uterus ) to progesterone during the second half of the users menstrual period .

They are usually not seen until the fourth month . The Patch also can cause some undesirable side effects . Like Pill users , Patch users may experience irregular vaginal bleeding when they first start the drug . Some women are concerned about the appearance of the patch when they are nude . ( The Patch is usually applied to the lower abdomen or the buttocks . ) There can be a dark circle on the skin around the patch , although this is usually caused by the adhesive and can be resolved by carefully washing the skin .

@@98778567 @2978567/ <h> Lithium and Acne 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Lithium has been a mainstay of treating bipolar disorder for many years . Although other medications are also often used to treat this commonly diagnosed psychiatric condition , when the cost of medication- is a major concern , lithium is almost always the medication of choice . One of the serious potential side effects of lithium treatment , however , is acne . And its not just lithium as a medication , but also lithium in food and drinking water , than can be a concern . <h> What Is Lithium ? <p> Lithium is the lightest of all the metal elements . It is used to make ceramics and glass , in lubricants , and in the manufacture of batteries . All living creatures contain small amounts of lithium , especially plants and animals that live in the sea . About 0.02% of the human body is made of lithium compounds . <p> Scientists known that all living things contain lithium , but they are not completely sure what lithium does . Japanese scientists in 2011 found that increasing lithium in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found that that towns in Texas and Arizona where lithium is abundant in well water have lower rates of violent crimes . <h> How Lithium Is Used in Mental Health Care <p> A form of lithium known as lithium carbonate is used to treat bipolar affective disorder , which is also known as manic-depression . In bipolar affective disorder , the mood can swing from depressed to elated and back over long or short periods of time . Lithium is very useful for smoothing out mood swings in bipolar disorder , especially euphoric mania that leaves the sufferer feeling good about wild or extreme actions . It has a specific anti-suicide effect that is not obtained from newer medications for the condition . <p> Lithium is not an easy drug to use . It has to be built up in the bloodstream over time . It is not always possible to build up lithium levels fast enough to prevent a manic episode . About 50% of people who take lithium develop intense thirst , which dilutes the bloodstream and lowers the effective concentration of the lithium , making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , which can cause problems ranging from bad breath to tooth decay . Many people who take lithium develop hand tremors , involuntary batting of the eyelashes , memory lapses , confusion , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , overreactive reflexes , and vertigo , all of which become less common over time . <p> The complication that becomes more common over time , however , is acne . <h> Why Lithium May Cause Acne <p> Not everyone who takes lithium develops acne , but many do . The reason lithium triggers acne is counterintuitive . It increases the activity of the immune system which in turn increases skin inflammation . <p> Lithium causes a condition called leukocytosis . The technical definition of leukocytosis is an increase in white blood cell ( WBC ) count due to any cause . When people who have bipolar affective disorder take lithium , the drug causes them to produce more stress hormones ( which is actually a good thing ) when they are depressed . These stress hormones make it easier to find the energy to function day by day . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They trigger the release of histamine from storage packets in the skin . Histamine is the same chemical that causes allergies . It breaks down skin cells or cells in the membranes lining the nose and throat to remove foreign bodies and germs . When the release of histamine is induced by stress , however , histamine destroys healthy tissue that has not been penetrated by foreign bodies or infected by germs . The result is redness , itching , and even pain in the skin that is worse in pores that are affected by acne . <h> Not Just from Medication <p> It is n't just medications like lithium carbonate or Eskalith that can cause an excess of lithium to accumulate in the body . Its also possible to accumulate lithium from food . Tomatoes and hot green peppers ( especially jalape+os and serranos ) , the main ingredients in pico de gallo and salsa , are rich in lithium . When eating too much salsa or pico de gallo makes the skin break out , its not necessarily an allergic reaction . It can be a reaction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peppers were irrigated with high-lithium water such as is found in Arizona , New Mexico , and far western Texas in the United States . <h> What to Do When Lithium Causes Acne Outbreaks <p> If you take lithium and your face breaks out , the last thing you should do is to stop taking your medication . It also wont help to use skin disinfectants or pore cleansers , unless you happen also to have the common form of acne known as acne vulgaris . What you need to do is to reduce the amount of inflammation in your skin as best you can . <p> It usually helps to limit or eliminate consumption of hot peppers , tomatoes , and potatoes that may be high in lithium . It also helps , as we have mentioned elsewhere on this site , to take a probiotic like Lactobacillus acidophilous . Probiotic supplements deliver more of the friendly bacteria to your small intestine than yogurt , and yogurt is only helpful if it contains live bacteria . ( Some " probiotic " yogurts do n't  , and among the brands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  sold as probiotic supplements , only Stonyfield Farms and Oikos are actually helpful . ) <p> The reason probiotic bacteria help compensate for the effects of lithium is that they " train " the immune system to release less inflammation . When the immune system first encounters friendly bacteria in the small intestine , it treats them as if they could cause disease . It releases inflammation to kill probiotic bacteria . <p> If you are eating yogurt with live cultures or taking a probiotic supplement , however , your immune system ca n't get them all . Eventually it learns that fighting probiotic bacteria is not necessary . Some of the cells that are " trained " in the small intestine circulate through the bloodstream to the skin , where they are less likely to release inflammation when they encounter acne bacteria . <p> If you take lithium and live in a town in the USA or Australia that has high concentrations of lithium in drinking water , it also helps to drink bottled water . You can save money by buying 5-gallon ( 20 liter ) containers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the activity of probiotic- bacteria helps clear up acne without interfering with essential medical treatment . <p> Thank God I finally found a website that is anti-lithium ! Every one else acts like lithium is oh-so-totally-awesome . Its not ! Lithium is a horrible poison that causes kidney and thyroid damage . Lithium = dialysis ! <p> I would n't say that this site is anti-lithium . Not everything about lithium is perfect but for some people is very necessary . There 's no arguing that lithium does n't  cause acne , or that it is n't dehydrating ( its a salt , so of course it is ) but for those who suffer from severe bipolar disorder if you monitor it carefully it can be tremendously helpful in modulating symptoms ( which can , for some , be quite deadly ) . Just like consuming too much of most compounds can be deadly , too much lithium is deadly , but in healthy , low amounts its just fine for anyone . <p> For most people these medications are the better of two evils . Many people who need these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little physical health ( see side effects ) for a great gain in mental health . <p> Lithium is a miracle drug for me , though it does have some bad side effects . I have the hand tremors and the thirst , and since my dose has been raised , acne . But I suppose this is better than the alternative . I just wish I knew how to stop the acne , it does n't  help my self esteem and sometimes , is quite embarrassing . But again , better than being suicidal or crazy manic . <p> I am the lucky one . Lithium for 3 years without a single side-effect and no mania whatsoever . My daughter inherited my bipolar brain , and she too is greatly helped by lithium . Unfortunately , she gets BAD acne and has to take a thyroid medication . It is like a deal with the devil . damned if you do , but even more damned if you do n't  . Does anyone have any secret remedies to relieve the inflamation ? <p> Taking Lithium for 5 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long period of time . The only challenge is some random outbursts of acne . It can be helped by keeping skin clean and dry by frequent face wash . Increasing water intake helps as well . I have noticed that reduction in coffee intake helps as well . <p> All you fighting with bi-polar its a war and we win with Lithium ! Acne is your glory scar ! = <p> Lithium has been a life saver for me . I suffered terrible bipolar symptoms that no other meds could help . The down side is I have hand tremors and bad acne .

It is pretty smooth and I do n't  have many wrinkles but because I always had oily skin , I will be susceptible to acne until the day I die . I recently started taking lithium again ( less than a week ago ) to treat recurring bi polar symptoms which were brought on by work stress . The one thing is that Accutane left me with sensitive skin for the rest of my life . It did work though and I recommend it if nothing else works . I only get very small breakouts now and then if I eat a lot of chocolate . I can easily control them with a topical cream like Benzagel . <p> I had a seizure on lithium which meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acne , hand tremors , thirst . I would n't recommend to anyone .

I hope to be off my medication in less than 3 months . 19923 @qwx879923

You want to get dirt and grime off your skin , but you do n't  have to , and in fact you cant , scrub your acne away . Cleansing your skin prevents future blackheads and whiteheads , but it does not remove existing blackheads and whiteheads right away , if at all . <p> Most people who have common acne on the nose , especially people who have brown skin tones and have acne on the nose , need to adjust their cleansing routine with the seasons . During the winter , the skin on the nose and forehead may be oily , but the skin on the cheeks and chin may be dry . Cleanser should be left on the nose and forehead for about a minute , but on the rest of the face for just 30 seconds or so . During the summer , all the skin on the face may get oily . Its a good time to use a light cleanser like Neutrogena glycerin bar on all the face during the summer , and to take extra care to keep hair care products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nose Affected By Rosacea <p> Rosacea is caused by broken blood vessels . There is absolutely no way you can rub , scrub , or wash it away . In fact , the more pressure you put on the skin of your nose , the more likely it is to break out . Any kind of detergent cleanser and anything that makes your skin red " especially cinnamon oil " can make your nose break out in unsightly pimples that can become permanent bumps . <p> If you have rosacea , you need to use an anti-inflammatory cleanser like Avon Clearskin Professional Deep Pore Cleansing Scrub . Do n't  take the reference to a " scrub " literally . You need to let the cleanser do all the work on your skin . Just place it on your skin , leave it there up to 30 seconds , and rinse it away . <p> It may also help to use facial waters ( mineral waters containing magnesium , selenium , and/or sulfur that are spritzed onto your face after you cleanse and pat it dry ) .

People who have rosacea often have the type of skin that never tans and always burns . Unfortunately , most people who have this skin type are determined to get a tan to make their acne less noticeable , and venture out into midday sun to try to do it . The result is only more rosacea plus sunburn and wrinkles . Because sun exposure weakens the collagen around blood vessels , the more sun someone who has rosacea gets , the more pimples will break out , too . <h> What If You Have Both Kinds of Acne on Your Nose ? <p> It is possible to have blackheads , whiteheads , and pimples caused by both common acne and rosacea at the same time on the nose .

Melanin is made by specialized skin cells called melanocytes , which are found in the lowest basement level of the skin . Everyone has roughly the same number of melanocytes , but genetic differences affect how much melanin the melanocytes make . <p> Different kinds of melanin can be gray , black , or brown . When melanocytes make only tiny amounts of brown melanin without gray or brown , the skin looks yellow or the hair looks blond . It takes the addition of black melanin for skin and hair to appear brown . <p> Melanin in the skin fights inflammation . It acts as antioxidant to neutralize chemicals that can cause inflammation . Because the skin produces large amounts of brown melanin to fight acne inflammation , brown spots can linger on the skin long after acne has healed . These spots are more prominent on brown skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cause Skin Discoloration ? <p> Just because the skin looks brown , however , does not mean that acne will leave lingering brown spots . Here are some signs that after-care of acne can be very important for maintaining clear , brown skin : <p> After you have either a pimple or an ingrown hair , its usually followed by a black or brown spot . <p> After you cut yourself , your skin turns brown , not pink . <p> You tend to get more brown spots on your cheeks or upper lips than anywhere else on your face . <p> If you are a woman who has taken the contraceptive Pill , starting contraception caused skin all over your body to break out in brown spots . <p> You get freckles or sun spots on your face , chest , back , or arms . <p> The first time you go out into the sun after staying indoors for several months , your skin does n't  burn , it only gets darker . Or it does n't  burn , and does n't  get any darker , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There are lots of advantages to having brown skin . Brown skin is more resistant to sun burn and sun damage . The melanocytes in brown skin produce more antioxidant pigment to quench sunburn as fast as it happens , so sun damage to the skin is minimal . Brown skin has a warmer skin tone , that conveys muscle movements beneath the skin , making emotions more visible . And brown skin shows fewer signs of aging , such as fine lines and wrinkles . <p> The downside of having brown skin is that it is more prone to brown discoloration , and it is also more prone to raised acne scars . In fact , a kind of acne known as acne keloidalis nuchae is almost exclusively found on brown skin . <h> Keloidal Acne and Brown Skin <p> Many people who have brown skin do n't  get mild to moderate common acne at all . Children with fair skin may develop acne as early as the age of eight , when their adrenal glands start making the raw materials for stress hormones . These stress hormones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria build up in pores . Puberty makes the effect even worse . <p> Children who have brown skin tones often do n't  develop acne during their teenage years , but when there is an excess of testosterone , a particularly nasty form of acne known as acne keloidalis nuchae may strike in the early 20s . The people who are most at risk to this kind of acne are young men aged 18 to 25 who have " browner " brown skin tones . <p> In this condition , ingrown hairs are attacked by the immune system . Skin grows over the hair , forming a raised , pinkish scar . These acne scars can occur anywhere hair is shaved , on the face , on the scalp , and in women , under the arms and along the bikini line . A doctors care is necessary for treating this kind of acne . But some people who have brown skin can get mild to moderate common acne , usually in their late teens . <h> What to Do About Mild to Moderate Common Acne on Brown Skin <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the methods used to treat acne on fair skin just wont work .

These products just increase the risk of spot formation after acne has healed . <p> Mild to moderate acne on brown skin usually does respond well to exfoliants . These keep pores open while removing excessively brown skin . People who have brown skin can exfoliate with a medicated product ( containing sulfur or resorcinol ) made with salicylic acid , or an alpha-hydroxy acid exfoliant with a non-medicated cleanser . <p> Sulfur is usually a good treatment for pimples on brown skin , although it tends to make pimples redder on fair skin . <p> Brown skin is not always oily skin , and even people with brown skin who ordinarily have oily skin can have problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on most brown skins . <p> Brown skin does not need high-SPF sunblocks .

Allow the mask to dry for 15 to 30 minutes , and then rinse your face with warm water and pat dry with a clean towel once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You get the greatest benefits from baking soda you take from a fresh box . The baking soda you have had sitting in your refrigerator for weeks or the baking soda that has been sitting on a shelf in your cupboard for months may already have reacted with other chemicals .

Since most of the irritants of sensitive skin are acidic and baking soda is alkaline , a baking soda mask can neutralize some of the chemicals that cause skin irritation . The baking soda mask adheres to clumps of dead skin as it dries , and rinsing off the mask rinses off dead skin cells along with it .

They add more natural color to the skin , and they loosen the skin around tight pores . <h> Do Baking Soda Masks Really Work ? <p> There is no doubt that baking soda masks can neutralize excess acids applied to the skin . They are also useful for soothing itchy skin , especially when the itch is caused by eczema or contact dermatitis .

This just makes a mess . <p> A slow mixture of vinegar into baking soda drop by drop makes an exfoliant scrub that may pick up loose flakes of dried skin and leave your complexion looking a little more deeply colored . However , the only advantage of using baking soda and vinegar mixed in the same bowl is as a scrub , and alpha-hydroxy ( glycolic ) and beta-hydroxy ( salicylic ) acids are much more useful for this purpose . <p> Some days you can use a baking soda mask to exfoliate your skin , removing dead skin and loosening blackheads and whiteheads , while encouraging growth of collagen to fill in indented acne scars .

Sometimes as they heal , these blood vessels can accumulate scar tissue that can lend a lumpy texture to the skin , especially on the nose . <p> Rosacea differs from common acne in that it comes on much faster , often in just minutes .

The facial flushes that come with emotion may start leaving redness across the cheeks . Some of the inflammation across the cheeks may start coalescing into tiny red spots . These spots form where blood vessels burst . Purple streaks may form where blood vessels have been bruised . <p> Eventually it is possible to recognize triggers for outbreaks . The body cools itself by sending blood to the surface of the skin . When someone who has rosacea drinks a hot drink , blood flows into the capillaries of the cheeks and nose to exchange heat with the skin so the skin can drain heat into the surrounding atmosphere . If the linings of the blood vessels are weak , they make leak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But there are many other circumstances in which circulation to the cheeks and nose increases and rosacea flares . Some people break out with rosacea when they eat foods that contain natural serotonin .

But there is also serotonin in : <p> Tomatoes ( 2 micrograms/gram ) <p> Plums- ( 4 micrograms/grams ) <p> Plantains ( 30 micrograms/gram ) <p> Pineapple ( 18 micrograms/gram ) <p> Pecans ( 29 micrograms/gram ) <p> Kiwi fruit ( 5 micrograms/gram ) <p> English walnuts ( 87 micrograms/gram ) <p> Bananas ( 15 micrograms/gram ) <p> One way to find out whether these foods are the culprit behind rosacea outbreaks is to stop eating them and see if your skin gets better . But if you have a skin reaction to these foods , you are also likely to have at least mild stomach upset from these foods . <p> Another common but overlooked trigger for cheek acne is taking iron pills . The body uses iron to make hemoglobin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron in the bloodstream can also cause free radical reactions that increase inflammation in the skin ( and everywhere else in the body ) . <p> Nose spray can trigger rosacea across the cheeks . The steroids in prescription nose spray reduce inflammation in the sinuses , allowing trapped blood to circulate suddenly to the cheeks . <p> Steroid treatments for ordinary acne can trigger rosacea . Rubbing prednisone cream or getting a steroid injection into a pimple takes the redness out of the pimple , but also weakens and thins the skin . Thinner skin shows rosacea more easily . <p> And acne across the cheeks can be triggered by coming into a warm room from cold outdoors , exposure to the wind , drinking alcoholic beverages , eating spicy food , heat from the sun , heat from acne treatments , menthol in skin treatments , rubbing alcohol applied to skin , isopropyl alcohol in acne treatments , and almost every kind of herb and botanical that is added to " natural " acne care products . <p> Treating rosacea becomes in large degree a matter of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment that works for both rosacea and any other form of acne on the cheek . <h> Azelaic Acid for Cheek Acid <p> Azelaic acid is often recommended for rosacea . It is also often recommended for the kind of common acid that causes whiteheads , blackheads , and pimples on the cheeks . <p> Plants make azelaic acid when they are infected by bacteria . In the plant , azelaic acid becomes a platform for the accumulation of salicylic acid , the same chemical that is used to make aspirin , to prevent destruction of tissues by bacteria . <p> In rosacea , azelaic acid reduces redness and inflammation . In common acne , azelaic acid stops acne bacteria . If you have either kind of acne or both on your cheeks , azelaic acid can be very useful for stopping outbreaks of pimples . If you have Asian skin tones , it will help reduce the formation of brown spots where there has been inflammation in your skin . <p> There is one important cautionary note for the use of azelaic acid . If you are a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Azelaic acid has also been known to stimulate the growth of hair on the neck and chin .

It has definitely helped the flare ups and moisturises really well . I use on my cheeks morning and night under foundation .

Its all in how you use it . This article explains what you need to know to use foundation on acne-prone skin . <h> Summary : <p> Choosing the right foundation is fundamental to caring for acne-prone skin if you use cosmetics . <p> Foundation should provide a matte finish rather than a glossy finish . A glossy finish can turn shiny if your skin produces oil during the day . <p> Foundation should not contain oils or emollients . These can clog pores . <p> Foundation should match your skin tone . <p> Foundation should contain sun screen , but only a few sun protection ingredients are safe for acne-prone skin . <p> Certain brands of liquid foundation can help heal blemishes , but they cant do the whole job of acne skin care .

You are likely to have enough problems with oil shining through your foundation without adding gloss to your face . If your makeup looks dewy when you put it on , it may look droopy by the end of the day . <p> A foundation for acne-prone skin should contain no emollients or oily ingredients .

This way they only have to put on one layer to protect the skin from sun instead of two . Using foundation that contain sunscreen saves time , and prevents clogged pores . <p> Foundation comes in loose powder , pressed powder , sticks , creams , cream-to-powder , and mineral makeups . If you have oily skin , you will probably do best with loose powder . Pressed powder can form streaks when oil accumulates on your skin .

Most of the time you do n't  need sunscreen at all . If you have brown or Asian skin , you definitely need sunscreen when you use skin rejuvenation products , and to protect your sun from midday summer sun .

@@98778575 @2978575/ <h> A New Antibiotic for Acne ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Using Nadifloxacin to treat acne may cause antibiotic resistance , and make it less effective for the more serious infection MRSA . <p> Dermatologists are always looking for new antibiotics for acne . Due to a phenomenon known as antibiotic resistance , fewer and fewer people benefit from old antibiotics and new medications are constantly sought . A antibiotic known as nadifloxacin is the latest addition to the armory of antibiotics that fight acne . <h> What is Nadifloxacin ? <p> Nadifloxacin is the generic form of a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has been available for several years under brand names such as Acuatim , Nadiflox , Nadoxin , Nadixa , and activon . Like all fluroquinolone antibiotics , it works by interfering with the ability of the bacterium to " unwind " its DNA . If the germ can not transform DNA from a helix into a " rope , " then it can not copy DNA to reproduce . Antibiotics in this class do not kill bacteria . They just keep them from reproducing . <p> Until recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive skin infection known as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA . This sometimes-deadly infection had developed resistance to other antibiotics , but not to nadifloxacin . Not only did nadifloxacin work , it has a half-life of 19 hours , so it only has to be used once a day , and it can be applied to directly to the skin in the form of a cream . <h> Some Doctors Do n't  Think Nadofloxacin Should Be Used to Treat Acne <p> Doctors in India have been testing nadifloxacin as a replacement for clindamycin in treating acne . The problem with clindamycin in India has been that some strains of acne bacteria have developed resistance to it , so a new antibiotic will be needed . There is concern elsewhere in the world that using massive amounts of nadifloxacin to treat acne will make it ineffective against the much more dangerous MRSA . Let 's take a moment to explain how that works . <p> Billions of bacteria may live in a single drop of fluid on the skin . Ultraviolet light , infinitesimal amounts of chemicals , or glitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a million or one in ten million of these bacteria at any given time . <p> Usually , random modification of DNA kills a bacterium , but once in a while the mutation of DNA gives the individual bacterium a way to resist an antibiotic . In the case of nadifloxacin , some mutation in the DNA might enable it to uncoil so the bacterium can reproduce itself even in the presence of the drug . If nothing else kills this bacterium , it passes its new gene down to its progeny , one at a time . <p> Bacteria , however , have the ability to conjugate , to swap genetic material when they collide with each other . While a bacterium could pass the new gene for antibiotic resistance to just one of its " children " at a time , it can pass copies of the gene to hundreds or thousands or its " conjugation partners . " Eventually so many of the bacteria that have the new antibiotic resistance gene occur on one patch of skin that the antibiotic ca n't treat the infection any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billions of bacteria in their pores . Eventually someone is going to have so many resistant bacteria that a treatment wont work . That 's why dermatologists keep looking for new antibiotics . Its also why dermatologists fear that using nadifloxacin for acne will eventually make it useless for treating MRSA ( since some people who have both acne and MRSA infections that are not active enough to recognize will be using nadifloxacin to treat acne ) . But does nadifloxacin for acne really even work ? <h> Effectiveness of Nadifloxacin in Treating Acne <p> If the question is whether nadifloxacin used by itself will clear up your acne , the answer is no . Clindamycin wont , either . Doctors typically prescribe both an antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide . The benzoyl peroxide is needed to kill bacteria that the antibiotic misses . <p> In a study in India , researchers found 84 volunteers in their late teens and early 20s who had an average of 25 active blackheads , whiteheads , and pimples on their faces at the beginning of their study . They asked half of the volunteers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other half of the volunteers to use a combination of nadifloxacin and benzoyl peroxide creams on their faces . <p> At the end of eight weeks , the volunteers who used clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide had an average of 16 blemishes on their faces . At the end of the same eight weeks , volunteers who used nadifloxacin and benzoyl peroxide had an average of 13 blemishes on their faces . Both groups still had on average about 3 pimples even after eight weeks of treatment . There was a better result from using both nadifloxacin and benzoyl peroxide , but not a significantly better result . <p> That has n't  kept experts from touting nadifloxacin as a new " cure " for acne . You just need to know that its really not . <h> Multiple Treatments for Acne <p> Getting rid of acne bacteria does n't  always get rid of acne . That 's because bacteria do n't  inflame the skin . Your own immune system inflames the skin , and it can do that when there are no bacteria and it might not do that when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " trick " the immune system into destroying your pores rather than the bacteria themselves . <p> On the other hand , antibiotics often help . They just are n't  enough . You need to cleanse your face gently to remove excess oil . Its important to cleanse your face without drying it out . <p> You need to stop excess production of oil in your pores by using treatments like either green tea extract creams or red light lamp therapy . You need to keep your pores open by removing dead skin that accumulates around them , either with a microdermabrasion cream or microdermabrasion cloth or with alpha- or beta-hydroxy acids . You need to manage both shine and flakiness of your skin and you need to make sure you are n't  using personal care products that make acne problems worse . <p> Antibiotics and benzoyl peroxide only address part of the problem . Complete acne care systems like Exposed Skin Care address the rest . <p> Understanding Acne Treatments like Ziana Ziana is a prescription medication that combines the antibiotic clindamycin with the exfoliant and skin rejuvenator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> Nadoxin cream is used for treating acne .

The lining of a pore in the skin starts producing skin at a high rate . Dead skin cells accumulate in the pore faster than the sebum it makes can push them to the surface . The oily sebum made by the sebaceous gland at the base of the pore gets trapped under dead skin , along with acne bacteria . The immune system generates inflammation to kill the bacteria , but the bacteria release chemicals that target surrounding healthy skin . Squeezing or mashing pimples forces acne bacteria deeper into the skin , where they can continue to trick the immune system into destroying more and more healthy tissue while pink scar tissue grows over them and locks them inside the skin . <p> Stopping any step in this process will reduce acne .

Blemishes and pimples are unaffected . <p> The problem with the old rub-and-scrub approach to acne is that it only takes care of one part of the problem . Vigorous detergent treatment of the skin only gets rid of excess oil on the skin . Sometimes that makes a difference , but if the problem is that the oil is trapped under tiny flakes of dead skin stuck together with a kind of biological glue at the top of a pore , all that washing your skin will do is to irritate the healthy skin surrounding blemishes . <p> And that irritation of the skin usually triggers a reaction to repair the skin by producing still more oil .

The two FDA-approved ingredients for this purpose are benzoyl peroxide and salicyclic acid . <p> FDA-approval , by the way , does not mean a product is a wonder drug that immediately clears up acne in all cases . The US FDA has studied benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid and declared them to be GRASE , or generally recognized as safe and effective . The FDA took over 20 years to examine scientific studies , medical case reports , and expert testimony to decide only in June of 2011 that : <p> Benzoyl peroxide is safe and effective in concentrations of 2.5% to 10% , <p> Salicylic acid is safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling is recorded in the US Federal Register and has the force of law for acne product makers in the USA .

The first step in the process that causes acne is accumulation of dead skin . Salicylic acid breaks up clumps of dead skin . The second step in the process that causes acne is accumulation of oil and bacteria in a pore . The salicylic acid helps oil escape the pore and benzoyl peroxide kills acne bacteria in 48 hours or less .

Everyone needs to get a minimum amount of vitamin B12 . But taking too much vitamin B12 can make your acne worse , and even trigger breakouts when you have clear skin .

Neither is it enough to treat pernicious anemia ( that requires injections ) , but it will help prevent both high homocysteine and pernicious anemia . <h> Do You Need to Take a B12 Supplement If You Have Acne ? <p> If you are not using any oral medications for treating acne , you do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many situations in which taking supplemental vitamin B12 is a very good idea . <p> If you take a proton pump inhibitor such as lansoprazole ( Prevacid ) or omeprazole ( Prilosec ) , the drugs may reduce the amount of acid in your stomach to the point it can not release vitamin B12 from food , although there- is enough stomach acid to dissolve vitamin B12 from supplements . Deficiency conditions usually take several years to develop . The H2-receptor antagonists such as cimetidine ( Tagamet ) , famotidine ( Pepsid ) , and ranitidine ( Zantac ) can also interfere with the release of vitamin B12 from food , but their effects are not as severe . <p> The diabetes medication metformin ( Glucophage , Glucophage XR ) binds vitamin B12 to calcium .

Well i ended up taking way too much . Since then I 've had terrible acne and its not going away . I stopped the B12 supplements as soon as I saw that my levels were through the roof after a test . How long for the levels to lower and my face returns to normal ? I 've never had acne in my life . Its been 5 months since I last took any B12 . The acne is mainly all over my forehead . Comedones everywhere ! <p> I have the exact thing , i thought i was the only one , its mainly on my forehead and i never had acne before its been two months since the last injections , since your post is from 2014 i 'm hoping you found a solution ? ? <p> I have the same finished my 6 injections just over 4 weeks ago and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin , cheeks and chest had them for about 5 weeks now never had any problems with my skin or acne before how long does it last ? ?

I rarely have pimples and before taking the shots my face was clear . Now I have pimples all around my mouth and chin and small ones all over my forehead . It is very embarrassing and stressful . <p> Omg same here . I was told a while ago I had a deficiency so I have been taking supplements since August ( almost 4 months ago ) ca. every other day . Dosage was 5,000 mcg but it was an oral pill . However , I developed severe acne over my cheeks and neck and basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I never would have linked it to the vitamins but then my mom told me she heard this . I cant believe this . I stopped a few days ago and I hope it will go away soon , but from what I read here it can take a while . I hope itll be faster ! I do n't  even want to go out anymore . <p> I started taking a hair vitamin that had a very high dosage of all types of Vitamin B. This included a high dose of B12 and B6 , I began to see that a month in after taking this vitamin my skin was going crazy with acne flare ups . I had bad skin in my teenage years and even went on accutane to treat it , once the B12 and B6 was in my system my skin looked as if it did when I was a teenager . I had been going to my dermatologist not knowing what was the cause of my horrible skin returning and he put me back on all types of acne medication but the flare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that these flare ups can be a cause of all this extra vitamin B I 'm in taking and i was taking this vitamin for months . I 'm very surprised my dermatologist did n't  see that the high levels of vitamin B I had in my system could of been a cause this whole time . Needless to say I would love to know how long it takes for this to leave the system , I want my skin back . <p> I just want to share my little story with supplementing b12 . I turned vegan around january 2014 and I did n't  care for the first year about supplementing much . I took a few b12 pills ( cyanocobalamin ) sporadically with no noticable effects though it was n't much so I did n't  feel like I was supplementing it properly . 1 year into veganism I became a bit concerned about a B12 deficiency and I went to buy b12 iv/im injections ( Erycytol ) . The doctor gave it to me ( intramuscular ) and the day after my first injection I got numerous relatively small pimples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done a blood test in advance ) . I had clear skin before that , so I 'm pretty save to say that the Erycytol injection was the cause ( probably overdose ) . Too bad I went for a second injection 2 weeks later ( originally 3 injections should be done ) Again I got more pimples show up . While they are not too nasty , they are itching a bit and are not exactly good looking as you can imagine . Its been around 5 weeks since the last injection and I feel like they are slowly starting to fade away .. I guess 1 or 2 more months and I have clear skin again . However , I 'll do a full blood test this week to finally see my b12 level and other important vitamin/mineral levels . <p> My son has had bad acne for awhile now . He is 16 years old and has had some other issues as well , like stomach problems . Recently , I had read that a vit B12 deficiency can cause stomach issues , like what he was experiencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been taking it daily .

Acne on forehead and chinugh ! I have stopped eating red meat , seafood , cut way back on dairy , I have n't been taking any b12 supplements whatsoeverbut its been 2 months now ! ! ! ! I 'm at my wits end , I do n't  know what else to do ! ! <p> Also prior to the b12 injections , I had been on acne medication for a year and had very clear skin .

I put it on before bed n i wake up in less pain and not swollen . It does n't  get rid of the acne type spots . My GPS was no help at all <p> Same story here . My stomach problems were caused by lack of vitamin b12 . I had one injection and took vitamin pills for almost 8 months . 3 months ago my face exploded , i had acne before but never like this .

Aloe vera gel is working for redness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day by day new pimples appear .

I have slowly been getting spots on my forehead and thought it was just hormones as I was due on . However , they did n't  go and yesterday I had several more , followed by what is obviously an acne breakout today . I recognised it as acne as soon as I saw it this morning , as I had acne from 13-17 . I am now 50 and have had clear skin since my teens , with the occasional pimple or two when due on . This is unbearable though ; it is swollen and sore , the lumps are very red and all over my forehead , down the sides of my face , on my chin and in my hairline and eyebrows !

Keep Reading ! 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Preventing acne or preventing mild to moderate acne from coming back once you have blemishes cleared up is not hard . It just requires using the right products in the right ways . Here are eight ways to prevent acne that work every time . <h> Summary : <p> The most frequently overlooked way to prevent acne is to keep pressure off the skin . Any kind of strap can leave acne in its wake . <p> Skin needs to be cleansed without rubbing and scrubbing to keep acne at bay . <p> Being ready to treat a single pimple when it pops out can help you stop many more . <p> Chocolate can cause acne , and yogurt can prevent it . <p> Moisture keeps the skin flexible so pores can drain . <p> Facials that do n't  irritate the skin feel good and keep pores from getting clogged . Remember to wash off all the facial , of course . <p> " Peeling " the skin keeps dead skin and sebum from accumulating in pores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all skin types . <h> 1 . Avoid constant pressure on your skin . <p> Getting acne off your cheeks and forehead is hard . Getting acne off your chin , shoulders , and back is nearly impossible . It is much easier to prevent acne in awkward places than it is to treat it , and one of the most important ways to stop acne before it starts is to avoid constant pressure on the skin . <p> Violinists often get chin acne , due to constant pressure on the jaw while holding the instrument . Preteens may break out with acne where straps for backpacks wear on their shoulders , especially if the experience of going to school is otherwise stressful . Young football players pop out pimples where they did n't  pimples could pop out , when protective sports gear is a size too small or secured too tight . Retainers cause acne while they straighten teeth . And brassiere straps are a cause of acne for all ages . <p> If you cant avoid pressure on your skin , you can at least compensate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . When possible , wear uniforms or work out clothes made with cotton instead of nylon or Lycra . Cotton " breathes " better . When you shower , exfoliate your skin with a shower mitt , but do n't  rub so hard your skin feels raw or looks red . And make sure you wear clean clothes every day . This way you do n't  constantly reinfect your skin with acne bacteria . <h> 2 . Keep your skin clean , but not too clean . <p> Next to chanting " Die , acne , die , " trying to scrub your acne away is one of the least effective common methods of acne prevention . You do n't  have to kill all the bacteria in your pores and rub away every last dead skin cell to keep acne from popping out . All you have to do is to prevent the combination of clumps of dead skin and excessive bacteria from accumulating in your pores , where they can get trapped under excess sebum . <p> There are two important things to remember about washing your face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanser do all the work . You do n't  need to rub your face clean with a wash cloth . You do n't  need for your face to feel tingly . If you irritate your skin , it will repair itself by making even more skin oil . <p> The other thing to remember is to stay clean once you get clean . Do n't  spend half an hour and $10 cleaning your face and then towel it dry with a dirty towel used by someone else . Once you get acne bacteria off your face , do n't  put them back on your face with dirty towels or dirty hands . Wash your hands before and after you touch your face . <h> 3 . Do n't  eat dark chocolate . <p> Many people who have acne can get away with eating milk chocolate . Some people who have acne can keep their skin clear even if they eat dark chocolate . Chocolate-sensitive individuals , however , can break out in dozens of whiteheads , blackheads , and pimples after eating dark chocolate . The effect usually occurs after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 4 . Be ready to fight pimples as soon as they break out . <p> The sooner you treat a pimple , the sooner it can heal . But treating a pimple never involves popping it . <p> The way to treat a pimple is by killing the bacteria inside and letting your skin do the work of repairing your skin . Different skin types respond to acne treatments in different ways . <p> If you have black skin , use the lowest strength of benzoyl peroxide you can find ( under 2.5% ) and use that to treat the pimple in the morning . Put some vitamin E cream on the pimple at night to avoid spotting of the skin as it heals . You can also use arbutin powder on the pimple " but not on surrounding skin " to lighten the skin as it heals . If you have Asian skin , try a foaming sulfur product in the morning with topical tretinoin in the morning . The sulfur does n't  smell great , but you should not use any product that includes a fragrance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browning of the skin after the pimple heals . Use topical tretinoin at night to open the skin . If you have light brown or fair skin , try vitamin C ( in the form of ascorbyl palmitate ) in the morning and benzoyl peroxide ( up to 10% ) at night . Be careful with benzoyl peroxide . Just use it on the pimple , and do n't  let it bleach hair or clothes . <h> 5 . Keep your skin moist . <p> Locking moisture into your skin can unlock your pores so sebum , bacteria , and dead skin can come to surface to be washed away . No one should ever use an alcohol-based moisturizer . Water- and even oil-based moisturizers keep the skin flexible , keep pores open , and add natural color to the skin . If you do n't  use makeup , even a splash of water in your face several times a day will help keep it moist . <h> 6 . Get regular facials . <p> Facial masks you wash or peel off your face soak up extra oil and loosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facial for preventing acne , but there is no need to spend a fortune on products . Any face mask that feels good probably is good , but you do n't  want anything that leaves your skin feeling tingly or looking red . Sulfur in face masks is OK if you have Asian skin , but probably not a good idea if you have fair skin with small pimples . Any mask that is hard to peel off can irritate your skin . Facials should be fun and easy to clean up . <h> 7 . Eat probiotic yogurt , or take probiotic supplements . <p> Yogurt is not a particularly useful product for making face masks , but it is a very useful product for helping maintain probiotic bacteria in your colon . These friendly bacteria can " train " your immune system to fight acne bacteria while doing less damage to your skin . <p> The way acne damages is the skin is through inflammation , but it is the immune system that creates the inflammation , not acne bacteria . A particularly nasty pimple , if its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune systems attempt to get rid of both bacteria and the skin in which they reside . <p> Lactobacillus bacteria in the colon can teach immune system that it is not necessary to fight them with inflammation to stay healthy . The immune system in the colon transfers this knowledge to the immune system in the skin , and helps the face stay clear . Try it . Any kind of yogurt that contains live cultures can help your skin . <h> 8 . Peel , but do n't  mash . <p> Mashing , smashing , tweezing , poking , probing , and lancing pimples never works . The action of destroying the skin to save it only forces bacteria deeper into the skin where they can never be cleansed away . <p> Peeling dead skin off the surface , however , stimulates the production of new collagen underneath the skin , helping fill in acne scars and fine lines and wrinkles . And it loosens the skin so pores can drain and heal acne on their own . <p> A great source of skin peels that work is Exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of alpha-hydroxy acids to rejuvenate any kind of skin . 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778580 @2978580/ <h> Using Glycolic Acid to Treat Acne 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Glycolic acid has to be used at the right concentration or it wont work . <p> Glycolic acid is one of the most useful products for " peeling " the skin to remove the brown spots that often linger on the skin after acne heals . Glycolic acid has to be used at the right concentration and at the right pH to work , and not every skin type responds well to glycolic acid in acne treatment . Here is what you need to know about glycolic acid for acne-affected skin . <h> Summary : <p> Glycolic acid is a " fruit acid " used to peel blemished skin . <p> Glycolic acid has to be used at the right concentration and the right pH or it wont work . <p> The most expensive glycolic acid products work about as well as the least expensive glycolic acid products . <p> Any product that you put on the skin for only a few seconds before rinsing does your skin little or no good . <p> Alcohol and essential oils can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product remove old blemishes . <h> What is Glycolic Acid ? <p> Glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxyl acid ( AHA ) derived from sugarcane . Glycolic acid is often combined with benzoyl peroxide to create- acne treatments . This acid is able to deeply penetrate the skin due to the fact that it has small molecules , making it also one of the best treatments for wrinkles , fine lines , oiliness , dullness and blackheads . Chemicals peels which have this acid are quite effective in treating inflammatory acne . Most chemical peels use a high percentage of glycolic acid , which make them effective when properly used . <p> In addition , consistent use of this acid in lower doses will also get you good results , just as much as heavy concentration peels , except that this is safer to use with a lower chance of causing skin irritation . This acid works by inhibiting the growth of p. acnes , which is the bacteria that is responsible for the growth of acne . Peels and creams made using glycolic acid exfoliate the skin , helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Exfoliation is important since oily skin and acne prone skin exfoliate naturally much more slowly than other skin types . This makes them prone to big , clogged pores , which can result in nodular acne or whiteheads and blackheads . According to the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology , increasing the ability of the skin to naturally exfoliate reduces chances of acne flare ups . <p> Glycolic acid also keeps the skin moisturized . This together with the removal of dry , flaky skin cells helps to keep the skin healthy and balanced since the production of oil and sebum on the skin is regulated . Spot treatment on an affected area can prove to be effective if dealt with early enough . If you notice a pimple forming , treat it with 2.5 percent benzoyl peroxide and give it time to dry . Then apply 10 percent glycolic acid , this combination of benzoyl peroxide and glycolic acid helps- stubborn skin parts on the body , such as the back and the back of the neck .

A product that just has pure glycolic acid at lower concentration levels is much more effective than a product that combines this acid with other ingredients . <p> Exfoliation products that contain glycolic acid or lactic acid are a much better substitute for products that contain salicylic acid if you are pregnant ; it is risky to use salicylic acid when you are pregnant . <h> Where Would You Find Glycolic Acid Products ? <p> Do n't  shop blindly Here are some glycolic acid products to consider , as well as skip . <p> Most people do n't  go to the cosmetics counter or surf the internet with " glycolic acid " in mind when they look for acne skin care . And most acne products that contain glycolic acid do n't  have the term " glycolic acid " in their names . Here are some common glycolic acid acne products , good and bad , expensive and inexpensive : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US $120 for two 0.5 oz ( 14 gram ) tubes of glycolic acid and a neutralizing agent . <p> Now let 's take a look at what makes these glycolic acid products work , or not . <h> C Renewal Double Renewal System <p> This pricy glycolic acid product provides a small amount of glycolic acid " about 3.6% , up to 30% may be beneficial " that is followed with small amount of a neutralizing agent that ensures there is no lasting irritation to the skin . For about $120 a treatment once or twice a week , it will lighten brown spots left when pimples heal in about two months . Unlike other Sothys products , it is fragrance-free and safe for allergy-prone skin . <p> Other products that works as well , however , cost over 75% less , such as the Neutrogena Advanced Solutions product mentioned below . <h> Acne Spot Treatment by Murad <p> Murad is one of the best known names in skin care . That does not guarantee all Murad products will work . <p> The Murad Acne Spot Treatment contains a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can block pores from dry skin , plus about 1% salicylic acid for removing dead skin cells that can block pores from oily skin . The main active ingredient in the product , however , is sulfur . <p> Sulfur really does kill bacteria and relieve irritation , but none of the ingredients in the spot treatment stays on the skin to do any good . They are rinsed down the drain almost as soon as they are put on the skin . <h> Acne Wash by B. Kamins , Chemist <p> Acne Wash by B. Kamins , Chemist is unusual among products that claim to stop acne breakouts in that it actually stops acne breakouts . The main active ingredient in this formula is salicylic acid , a beta-hydroxy acid that helps open pores on either dry or oily skin . The product contains glycolic acid and lactic acid ( fruit and milk acids , respectively ) to buffer the other ingredients and to break down dead skin that is n't stuck to the skin with oil . <p> There is just a little mint in this formula , enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause irritation . Still , its probably a good idea to be careful when using this product around the eyes . The longer you leave the product on your skin before your rinse " up to about 5 minutes " the more good it will do for your skin . <h> Advanced Solutions Complete Acne Therapy System ( by Neutrogena ) <p> Here is a combination of three products that only cost $24.99 that also actually work for treating acne and preventing breakouts . This Neutrogena acne therapy system has you start with a cleansing scrub . There is a tiny amount of glycolic acid and salicylic acid in the product , but it really works by the " scrubbing " action of tiny beads of polyethylene plastic in the foaming cleanser . These beads remove dead skin and hardened skin oil without scratching or cutting the skin . <p> The acne therapy system also offers a Sun Shield Day Lotion with SPF 15 . The added benefit of this product is that it protects the skin with zinc oxide . The zinc in the formula helps reduce inflammation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against mild sun for short periods . The only possible drawbacks to using this sunblock are that its really not strong enough for tropical or desert skin protection , and it can leave a slight white cast to the skin . <p> Finally , the Advanced Solutions Complete Acne Therapy System provides an overnight skin treatment that contains 2.5% benzoyl peroxide , and just the benzoyl peroxide , not a lot of additional ingredients that can irritate the skin . This is enough to kill acne bacteria without causing any irritation on most skin types . It is always a good idea , however , to test any acne product on your forearm before using it on your face . If it causes arm irritation , it will certainly cause face irritation , and you should be sure to take the product back for a refund . <h> Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash <p> Here is a product that actually works at a bargain price . It strips off makeup without harming the skin , but because it contains alpha-hydroxy acids , including glycolic acid , it will also slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even on darker skin , this product only costs about $0.40 per use , compared to $120 for some other brands . The formula available in the USA may not actually contain glycolic acid , using citric acid instead , but works just as well as those that do . <h> Clear Skin Blemish Dissolver by Kinerase <p> Here is a product that contains the right amount of glycolic acid at the right pH to remove blemishes . Unfortunately , it also contains the right amount of lemon oil to cause them to return . <h> Clearskin Blemish Clearing Pads by Avon <p> Here is another product that contains the right amount of glycolic acid and salicylic acid at the right pH to exfoliate the skin and remove brown blemishes . This product contains so much alcohol , however , that it stimulates the production of sebum and causes new breakouts that make you constantly need to the product . <p> Here are some products that wo n't harm your skin . They just wo n't do your skin any particular good , either , because the glycolic acid in the cleanser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less expensive cleansers work just as well . Be sure not to splash any of these products into your eyes . They will burn . <h> Pores No More Vacuum Cleaner by Dr. Brandt <p> A non-comedogenic , matte powder is better to reduce the appearance of pores than Pores No More . <p> One of the lingering problems of successful acne treatment is enlarged pores , especially after removal of blackheads . There is no vacuum and not a lot of cleaner with Pores No More Vacuum Cleaner by Dr. Brandt . Instead , this product is a mask you apply to the skin . Like most facial masks , it is good for removing excess oil . It just wo n't remove pores . If you want to conceal pores , use powder to create an even matte on your skin . Its a lot less expensive , and it does n't  contain any of the irritant ingredients in this mask , including alcohol and lavender oil . <h> PurAcne Oxygen Purifying Gel by G. M. Collin <p> Here is another product that offers glycolic and salicylic acids for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drain before they have a chance to work . The rose , geranium , boldo , arnica , and chamomile extracts in the product , however , stick to skin and can cause skin irritation long after use . <h> Using Glycolic Acid <p> The best treatment plan when using glycolic acid is to use a cleanser , which probably has benzyl peroxide too , for two to three weeks and then follow this up by using glycolic peels for six weeks . If this does n't  work , simply stop treatments for a week or two and then start another round of treatment . Do this until your skin clears . Giving your skin a break in between treatment periods is essential in preventing your skin from getting stripped of essential oils . <p> Since most glycolic acid treatments are meant to be used on mature skin , they mostly have moisturizers and comodogenic oils that aim at moisturizing non acne affected skin .

It can cause redness of skin or irritation if it is used at a higher concentration than what your skin is used to . In severe cases it can lead to frosting , though this typically only happens during strong , deep chemical peels . This is where your skin crusts as a form of self preservation . This can last for several days . If you pick at this frosting , it will lead to scarring and hyper pigmentation .

It is advisable to use sunscreen when using BP to prevent skin hyper pigmentation . <p> In general , the glycolic acid products that work the best are also the least expensive .

@@98778581 @2978581/ <h> Sugar and Acne The best Tips 19922 @qwx879922 <p> There is a fungus among us , many would-be acne experts would have you believe . Fungus feeds on sugar , we are often told . And actually that 's true . Acne bacteria are closely related to fungi , its said , so all anyone with acne really needs to do is stop eating sugar and acne will cure itself . Unfortunately , that is not true . <h> Summary : <p> Excessive consumption of sugar is bad for health for many reasons , but sugars effects on acne are indirect . <p> Sugar by itself does not have a major effect on acne . Sugar in combination with certain kinds of fats increases acne inflammation . <p> The kinds of fats that work with sugar to make inflammation worse are the " fake fats " used to make shortening and margarine . <p> Having enough fat and the right kind of fat in the diet partially cancel out the skin-damaging effects of sugar , and cutting out sugar without consuming the right fats will not do any good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acne . Choosing and using the right acne products will always offset poor dietary choices . <h> Acne and Inflammation <p> Acne blemishes are the result of clogged pores . Sometimes the clogged pores are not inflamed , as is the case with whiteheads and blackheads . Sometimes the clogged pores are inflamed , as happens with pimples , pustules , papules , nodules , and cysts . <p> Pimples contain acne bacteria , but the bacteria themselves do not cause the bulk of inflammation . The human immune system generates inflammation to kill the bacteria , but the bacteria defend themselves by releasing their own chemicals that redirect the inflammation to the skin itself . The immune system kills most of the bacteria , but a few escape when a pimple ruptures or is popped . <p> The amount of sugar in the diet makes a difference in the amount of inflammation generated by the immune system , but only in relationship with various kinds of healthy fat . Certain essential fatty acids known as n-6 essential fatty acids become the chemical building blocks of hormones that cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oils , especially soybean and canola oil . <p> Other essential fatty acids known as n-3 essential fatty acids become the chemical building blocks of hormones that regulate inflammation . These fatty acids are most abundant in cod liver oil , fatty cold-water fish , nuts , seeds , and flaxseed . <p> When there are too many n-6s and not enough n-3s in the diet , and this is almost always the case , the body makes more inflammatory hormones than regulatory hormones . Even when there are more n-3 essential fatty acids in the diet , too much sugar can shift the balance of hormone formation so that more inflammation results . <h> So What 's the Effect of Sugar on Acne ? <p> If you eat fewer of the " bad " fats and more of the " good , " at least as far as skin inflammation is concerned , your body can tolerate a little more sugar . If you have a typical Western diet with lots of canola and soybean oil but very little oil from nuts , seeds , flaxseed , and fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is always a combination of foods that improves or worsens inflammation . <p> Certain foods , however , are especially detrimental when combined with sugar . These are the foods that highest in a fatty acid called arachidonic acid , which is especially abundant in duck eggs ( which contain more twice as much arachidonic acid as any other food ) , chicken eggs , liver , kidney , and , in much lower concentrations , other cuts of meat . Everything about arachidonic acid is not bad ; it is essential for breaking down muscle so it can be rebuilt after exercise . But the combination of arachidonic acid and sugar causes a cascade of reactions that create more and more inflammatory chemicals . <p> Inflammation , as mentioned earlier , is only relevant in inflammatory acne that causes pimples , papules , pustules , nodules , and cysts . Blackheads and whiteheads are not caused by inflammation . Only pimples and similarly inflamed and irritated as the indirect result of additional sugar in the diet . So does avoiding sugar make a difference in acne care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time researchers attempt to prove that sugar causes acne , so they look at the amounts of sugar consumed by teens and adults who have acne compared to the amounts of sugar consumed by teens and adults who do not . Studies consistently find that skin conditions that are caused by fungus infections actually are worse in people who consume more sugar , but consuming more or less sugar has no effect in and of itself on acne . The microorganisms that cause acne are not fungal . <p> Eating foods that are low on the glycemic index does not seem to help either . The glycemic index is a measure of how fast the body is able to digest glucose from foods containing carbohydrates . The higher the glycemic index , the fast sugar is released from the food . There are many conceptual and methodological problems with the glycemic index , but it is useful as very rough estimate of how fast food can be digested into sugar . <p> Researchers at Australias RMIT University found that volunteers who ate low glycemic index foods had more sebum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of low-glycemic index foods , containing slowly digested sugars . The study found that the volunteers who ate combination of sugary desserts and low-glycemic index fruit and vegetables actually had fewer pimples and less sebum production . <p> Studies have not determined a link between acne and consumption of low-carb foods and sugar-free soft drinks . While its hard to imagine that Nutrasweet-sweetened beverages are good for the skin , no one has found a scientifically confirmed link between Nutrasweet and acne . <p> So what is a good diet for acne control ? The answers may surprise you . <p> 1 . A teaspoon of cod liver oil a day is good for acne . Cod liver oil contains copious amounts of vitamin A , so much , in fact , that you really should not take more than 1 teaspoon ( 4-5 ml ) three times a day . The human body can make vitamin A out of beta-carotene , but when it does , it has to take the beta-carotene out of stored fat . This causes increased oil production in the skin . Getting natural vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this effect . Among plant foods , only a few kinds of mushrooms contain vitamin A. <p> 2 . Vitamin C in supplements and fruit slightly increases sebum production and also dries out the skin . Do n't  take megadoses ( more than 2,000 mg a day ) of vitamin C. These can cause as many problems as they treat . High-dose vitamin C for up a week to fight a cold is OK . <p> 3 . Men who have acne should just say " Cheese ! " A Dutch study found that calcium from dairy products , but not from other foods or supplements , raised the pH of the skin in a way that kills acne bacteria . The Dutch study did not find this effect in women . <p> Diet is just one small part of acne treatment . Cleansing , moisturizing , and exfoliation are also essential . The simple fact is that it can be overwhelming to look for , buy , and try all the products you need to fight acne . A simple acne treatment system with a money-back guarantee like Exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have had acne for 25 years . I always ate a healthy diet , low fat , no junk food . 2 years ago I gave up sugar , which left my skin noticeably less greasy , but did n't  rid me of daily spots .

It is also sometimes used in non-prescription strength to treat mild to moderate common acne. - It is particularly good for people who have a lot of blackheads and whiteheads , otherwise known as comedonal acne . <p> Retin-A is the only treatment that addresses all the causes of acne . It- changes the responsiveness of the skin to stress . It helps the skin adjust to fluctuations in estrogen and testosterone , it stops excess sebum production , and it speeds up the growth of skin around pores . <p> This incredibly useful acne drug can be used as a pill you take by mouth or as lotion you put on your skin . But the use of Retin-A is often complicated by side effects . <h> Summary : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The prescription product may be necessary for deep infected pores and stubborn acne spots . <p> Almost anyone can use some strength of Retin-A , but the ideal candidate has dry , chemical-resistant , slightly loose skin . <p> Retin-A and topical tretinoin combined with benzoyl peroxide does a better job of getting rid of acne bacteria . <p> Retin-A combined with a vitamin E product does a better job of preventing and treating brown spots , especially on Asian skin . <p> Even if you " never burn , " even if you have black skin , use sunscreen when you use Retin-A . <p> Do n't  eat celery or take St. Johns wort when you use either tretinoin topical or Retin-A . <h> How it Works <p> Retin A works by accelerating the turnover rate of skin cells .

It will also clear your skin and make it brighter and smoother <h> Are You an Ideal Candidate for Retin-A ? <p> The people who respond best to Retin-A for acne have dry skin that is not easily irritated by chemicals and that tends to turn brown after irritation or sunburn , and that is wrinkle-prone rather than tight . What kind of skin should be treated with Retin-A ? <p> Skin that turns gray or ash-toned when it is not moisturized . <p> Skin that has a little " give " when the face moves , wrinkling when there is a smile of a frown . <p> Skin that does not break out when it is exposed to alcohol , botanicals , or essential oils . <p> Skin that does not flush during embarrassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots , age spots , and brown spots left when acne heals . <p> Skin that is just a little wrinkly , rather than skin that has no wrinkles at all . <p> Retin-A is used on almost all skin types except the most sensitive . The people who will notice the greatest benefit from Retin-A treatment , however , are those who need to keep the skin tone even , concealing spots caused by acne or overexposure to the sun . <h> Should You Use Tretinoin Topical or Prescription Retin-A ? <p> Use benzoyl peroxide along with tretinoin topical for better results . <p> Retin-A comes in two forms . The non-prescription strength of Retin-A is known as tretinoin topical ( tretinoin is the chemical name of Retin-A ) . This product can be very useful in keeping your skin clear , especially if you combine it with a low-concentration ( up to 2.5% ) of benzoyl peroxide to disinfect pores as Retin-A opens them . <p> Retin-A is also available by prescription . In most countries , you can get up to 0.05% Retin-A over the counter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescription . Both products are considered safe enough to use with minimal supervision . You do not need , for example , to sign an affidavit- pledging- that you will use two types of birth control if you 're a woman , as you do to get Accutane. - Other brand names for Retin A include Avita , Retin-A Micro and Tretinoin . <p> Tretinoin topical gels are not for people who are extremely sensitive to sun , and if you use tretinoin topical , you will need to use sunblock , even if you have black skin ( although SPF-15 will be enough ) . If you take an ACE-inhibitor such as lisinopril or ramipril for high blood pressure or if you take St. Johns wort for depression , you should- use extra sun protection because the combination of products can make skin especially sensitive ( but maybe not like we once thought see more information on this at the bottom of this article ) .

Tretinoin topical costs about $50 a tube , but the trip to the dermatologist to get the prescription strength will cost about $500 a visit , usually not covered by insurance . <p> Some of the side effects of using Retin A include dry skin , peeling , flaking , itchiness , redness , stinging and burning sensation . These side effects are more evident when you start using the product for the first time but these symptoms will ease with time . <h> What About Renova ? <p> Renova is a formulation of Retin-A into a cream . It is usually used to treat age spots and wrinkles . It is not a good idea for acne-affected skin , since the cream formulation can clog pores . However , if you have extremely dry skin and your physician permits , it can be less expensive than tretinoin topical . <h> Secrets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to treat blemishes and acne spots with Retin-A , there are things you can do that will help the product work a lot better on your skin . Here are seven important suggestions . <p> 1 . You always need to cleanse your skin about 20 minutes before you use you topical tretinoin or Retin-A . The product is more easily absorbed into your skin if the pH of your skin is slightly acidic . Be sure not to use a foamy , detergent cleanser ( they are usually very alkaline , and they are n't  good for your skin ) or splash a little freshly squeezed lemon juice on your skin at the end of your cleansing routine . Rinse the lemon juice off your skin and pat dry at least 5 minutes before you use the tretinoin product . <p> 2 . If you have Asian skin and you are using Retin-A to treat or prevent spots , alternate with a vitamin E treatment . Like Retin-A and retinol products , vitamin E has to come in an opaque tube . Jar products and products in clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Some foods , like celery , can make skin more sensitive to sunlight . Play it safe and skip them . <p> 3 . Alternate Retin-A with benzoyl peroxide in the lowest available concentration , preferably 2.5% or less . Retin-A is mildly antibacterial , but benzoyl peroxide will get acne bacteria that Retin-A does not . <p> 4 . Be sure to use sun protection , even if you have black skin . This will prevent sunburn , and , if you have Asian , brown , or black skin , sun spots . Even if you never burn and you do n't  tan , Retin-A and tretinoin topical might- make your skin sensitive to the sun ( see below ) . <p> 5 . Avoid eating celery , celeriac , and a North American vegetable known as the " prairie turnip . " Do n't  take St. Johns wort .

Even though retinoids break down when they are exposed to the sun , some experts now say they do not increase your chances of getting sunburn . In the past , it was thought that retinoids resulted in increased risk of sunburn since most people reported feeling a sense of burning immediately they walked into the sun after applying Retin A. According to clinical research , retinoids do not cause a reduction in minimal erythemal dos on the human skin , which is basically the amount of UV light your skin can absorb before it starts to burn .

The problems with most acne products that list salicylic acid as an ingredient are that they do not contain the right concentration of salicylic acid at the right pH . <h> Summary : <p> Salicylic acid is an exfoliant ingredient that is chemically similar to aspirin . Like aspirin , salicylic acid can remove redness and inflammation as it opens pores . <p> Whether salicylic acid successfully exfoliates the skin depends on concentration and pH of the product . Exfoliant products that are too alkaline will not work . <p> Anyone who uses salicylic acid must be sure to rinse it off according to product instructions . Some people should not use salicylic acid at all . <h> What Is Salicylic Acid ? <p> If you have heard of salicylic acid , chances are that you know it as the primary ingredient in aspirin . The chemical gets its name from the Latin term for willow trees , salix , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willow bark . There are some companies that make acne care products claiming that they contain salicylic acid from willow bark , but the compound does not occur in the bark of the tree . The powdered bark has to be treated with oxidants and filtered to make the acid . <p> Salicylic acid is a very useful pain reliever . For a time , researchers even supposed it might be a vitamin , which they called vitamin S. Taken inside the body , salicylic acid relieves pain and improves circulation . Applied to the skin , it breaks down fatty compounds such as the oily sebum that can clog pores . In fact , it breaks down the fats and fat-like compounds in the skin so well that it is generally considered to treat facial- skin with more than 2% salicylic acid with 98% of the lotion a neutral carrier agent . Up to 3% salicylic acid may be used on other parts of the body , and 10% to 30% will dissolve warts . <h> How Is Salicylic Acid Used to Treat Acne ? <p> Applying a mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the benefits of scrubbing , without the risk of rupturing pores or breaking tiny blood vessels . Salicylic acid treatment , however , has many benefits that simple scrubbing does not . <p> Gently removing dead skin does more than just open pores . Salicylic acid increases cell turnover . This makes the skin grow faster , opening up pores . It increases collagen production , filling in indentations in the skin and making it less " floppy . " It removes discoloration from the skin , although it is often too strong for use on dark skin . <p> Salicylic acid is the only beta-hydroxy acid used in skin care . It accomplishes the same goals in skin care as alpha-hydroxy acids such as lactic acid and glycolic acid , but it is used in a much weaker concentration . Acne care products may contain as much as 30% alpha-hydroxy acids , but the same action is achieved by 0.5% to 2% salicylic acid . <p> Similar to benzoyl peroxide , salicylic acid is most effective only if applied continually even after the acne has cleared . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid , the pores can clog again resulting in the return of acne . <p> Salicylic acid is also used in many acne treatments as a combination therapy at low concentrations . The exfoliating effect of the acid help to enhance the efficacy of other active ingredients . As salicylic acid is effective at low concentrations , it is significantly less irritating than other products . <h> Who Benefits Most from Salicylic Acid in Acne Treatment ? <p> There is an advantage of salicylic acid over other products to open pores that is due to its close relationship to aspirin . Like its chemical cousin aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ) , salicylic acid can stimulate circulation , in this case , it can stimulate circulation of oil out of pores . Also like aspirin , it can relieve inflammation and redness . As long as salicylic acid is used at the right concentration , it can produce better skin color than alpha-hydroxy acids . Salicylic acid is especially useful on oily skin . <p> Not everyone , however , benefits from skin treatment with salicylic acid . Dermatologists advise caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Fitzpatrick Scale : <p> Fitzpatrick Scale Skin Type V. This is dark brown skin that almost never gets sunburn and that tans easily . <p> Fitzpatrick Scale Skin Type VI . This is black skin that never burns and that tans very easily . <p> These skin types contain many cells that produce the pigment melanin . The skin uses this antioxidant pigment to limit inflammation . Since salicylic acid inflames the skin , albeit in a good way , and these skin types can make large amounts of melanin , the risk is that acne can ( and often is ) replaced by brown or black skin spots . Anything else that inflames the skin , whether intentional ( for example , a lightening agent ) or unintentional ( for instance , an infection or acne itself ) , can also leave permanent darkening on the skin . If you have beige to black skin , you should only use salicylic acid under professional supervision . <p> Salicylic acid based treatments generally do a good job of getting rid of blackheads and large pimples . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may help you to reduce them . It is also a good choice for dealing with scarring and hyperpigmentation once the pimple is gone . <h> How to Use Salicylic Acid to Open Pores <p> If you have fair skin , especially if you have oily skin , then you may benefit a great deal from using salicylic acid to open pores . The first thing to know about choosing a salicylic acid product to treat your skin is that it has to be sufficiently acidic to break down fats and open pores . This means that the product has to have a pH of about 4 or lower ( more about the importance of pH levels here ) . It has to be acidic enough that it is likely to sting . And while Salicylic acid does not kill acne causing bacteria , it helps to unclog the pores that harbor these bacteria . <p> Higher pH products wo n't sting , but they wont open pores , either . <p> The next thing to look for in a salicylic acid product is the right concentration . Too much salicylic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't open pores . Most products that work provide 1% to 3%- of this ingredient , possibly as little as 0.5% , but never more than 3% ( unless treating warts ) . <p> Salicylic acid in a face wash wont help your skin , because you rinse it off almost as soon as you put it on . Salicylic acid in a powder is not at the right pH to have any effect on skin . Only salicylic acid in the form of a gel that stays on the skin will do any good , but it is essential not to leave the product on the skin any longer than directed , to remove it as directed , and not to use the product around the eyes . <p> Salicylic acid is generally a safe compound when applied at proper concentrations for the treatment of acne . However , one thing that you might notice with salicylic acid based acne products is the fact that sometimes , they may leave your skin a bit dry . So it should go without saying that you should avoid any harsh cleansers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is very important to make sure that you have a balanced acne regimen , especially if you are using salicylic acid based products . Make sure that you are regularly moisturizing your skin and using soothing products while using a salicylic acid based treatment . Also , make sure that you are not applying salicylic acid to extensive areas of your skin , stick to the areas that have pimples on them . If your skin is broken , swollen , red or infected , avoid using salicylic acid based products . <h> What Are Some Salicylic Acid Products That Work ? <p> Ineffective salicylic acid products are easy to find , but it takes some effort to find products that work .

Those who are allergic to melons , papaya , fish , or latex get especially severe sports acne when they work out in heat and humidity wearing uniforms that are fitted too tight . <p> Divers and cold-water surfers often get all-over acne when they wear tight wetsuits .

@@98778586 @2978586/ <h> A Look at Accutane Side Effects 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Accutane can lead to numerous side effects , but the most common is drying of the skin and mucous membranes . <p> Accutane is sometimes almost a miracle drug for cystic acne , but this potent drug can cause significant side effects . Accutane is usually a drug of last resort for acne , used only when all other treatments fail . Many people who use Accutane , however , fail to realize the potential for serious complications in treatment . <h> Summary : <p> Accutane is a potent drug that can cause serious side effects . <p> The most common side effects of Accutane result from drying of the skin and mucous membranes . <p> About 90% of people who use Accutane experience irritation at the corners of the mouth . <p> Avoiding flavored lip balm and using toothpaste that does not contain the ingredient SLS can help reduce this symptom . <p> About 40% of people who use Accutane suffer dry eyes . Liquid tears remedy the problem . <p> Other side effects of Accutane are rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both men and women who use Accutane will have to be enrolled in the iPLEDGE system , requiring updated medical information every 30 days . <h> How Accutane Fights Acne <p> Every case of common acne begins with an event known as retention hyperkeratosis . For reasons that researchers do not yet understand , the linings of a pore in the skin start to produce cells at an unusually fast rate . They begin to tighten the pore so that sebum can not drain . <p> After a few days to a few weeks , these additional cells in the lining of the pore are shed so that younger cells beneath them can come to the surface . They form a clump in the pore that blocks the flow of oil and traps acne bacteria . The immune system attacks the bacteria with inflammation , and makes the pore even tighter so that a whitehead or blackhead forms , or the lining of the pore begins to break down , causing a pimple . <p> Sometimes there is also hyperkeratosis of the skin surrounding the pore . Skin can grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The immune system continues attacking the bacteria , destroying more and more healthy skin tissue until a cyst or a nodule forms under the skin . <p> Accutane reverses this process by making hyperkeratosis less " hyper . " It reduces the production of an enzyme called telomerase , which repairs cellular DNA . Without the action of telomerase , cells die more quickly and can be flushed out of pores and off the skin . It also activates a gene that codes proteins to make neutrophil-gelatinase associated lipocalin , an enzyme that breaks down the " glue " that holds clumps of dead skin cells together inside pores and on the skin . Pores begin to open from the inside out , spilling their contents on the skin . The chemical changes induced by Accutane are temporary , but clearing of the skin may be permanent . <p> Accutane is found under a variety of trade names . In the United States , the drug formerly known as Accutane has been marketed by Hoffman-La Roche a Roaccutane since July of 2009 . In other countries , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarus , Decutan , Isohexal , Isosupra , Isotane , ISOTRET , Isotroin , Izoteik , Oratane , Ruatine , and Sortret . There also is a lotion made with the same drug marketed as Isotrex and a combination of Accutane and erythromycin sold as Isotrexin . <h> What Can Go Wrong with Accutane ? <p> Accutane is a very effective treatment for cystic acne that can and often does cause serious side effects . Because the drug breaks down the " glue " that holds skin cells together , it often causes itchy peeling of the skin . Oral Accutane causes dryness of the skin and mucous membranes . Dry skin can cause dandruff and rashes . Dry mucous membranes can lead to nose bleeds and ( in women ) vaginitis , caused by yeast infections . <p> The US Food and Drug Administration warns that the drug may cause the premature closing of the ends of long bones , stopping further growth . The long bones in the upper body- may continue growing until age 18 , and the long bones in the lower body may still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may stop further growth . <p> Users of Accutane who are prone to rosacea may have breakouts ( even if they have never had rosacea before ) . There can be hair loss , eye irritation , permanent thinning of the skin , easy bruising , elevated liver enzymes , back pain , and high blood sugar levels . In rare cases , use of Accutane can result in loss of night vision , depression , formation of calcified cysts in muscle tissue , cataracts , increased blood pressure in the brain ( cranial hypertension ) , and erectile dysfunction in men . Some of these side effects may become permanent . There also seems to be an increased risk of suicide associated with the drug . But the most serious side effects of the drug do not occur in its users . <h> Birth Defects Caused by Accutane <p> The risk of birth defects caused by the use of Accutane is real . Birth defects caused by Accutane are most likely to affect the frontal lobes of the brain . A child who is exposed to Accutane through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenged with severe learning disabilities . There have been cases in which an anecephalic ( brain-less ) child was born to a woman using the drug , although most of the time the use of the drug in early pregnancy results in spontaneous or intentional abortion . <p> In the United States , a peculiar system called iPLEDGE has been developed to prevent the use of Accutane by women who could become pregnant . The iPLEDGE system is non-discriminatory . Women who have passed menopause are required to be enrolled in the system if they are to be given Accutane . And just in case some man might get pregnant , males who are given prescriptions for Accutane are required to be registered with the system , too . <p> There is a 7-day window for anyone getting a first prescription for the drug . If a prescription is not picked up in those seven days , the physician must re-enroll them in the system . Patients are only allowed to get refills for Accutane as long as their physicians update iPLEDGE information every 30 days . Women are only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use not just one but two different forms of contraception , and womens prescriptions for Accutane begin on the second or third day of their menstrual periods , when there is no risk that they might be fertile . <p> There are also restrictions on the use of Accutane in Canada , Australia , Colombia , Mexico , and Brazil . About 200 babies worldwide were born with birth defects before Accutane was regulated . Roughly 1 in 10 pregnancies of women who were taking Accutane results in the birth of a baby with serious developmental challenges . <h> What Can Be Done To Reduce Other Side Effects of Accutane ? <p> As dreadful as the side effects of Accutane can be , most of the the worst side effects of the drug are very rare . However : <p> 90% of Accutane users experience irritation at the corners of the mouth , <p> 40% of Accutane users experience irritation of the skin , and <p> 40% of Accutane users experience eye irritation . <p> The remedy for all of these side effects is to avoid additional irritation and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the face should be treated with moisturizer and sun screen daily . It also helps to avoid using lip balm or lip gloss that has flavors or fragrances , and to avoid use of toothpaste and mouthwash that contain the ingredient sodium lauryl sulfate ( SLS ) , since these can also irritate the corners of the mouth . People who wear contact lenses , in particular , may benefit from using liquid tears several times a day to keep the eyelids moist . <p> I just recently began taking Absorica ( basically the same thing as Accutane ) and I am experiencing the worst yeast infection of my life .

@@98778588 @2978588/ <h> Is Dermabrasion the Answer for Your Acne Scars ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Dermabrasion gets rids of acne scars by removing the top layer of blemished skin , and activating cells underneath to produce new , smooth skin . <p> Dermabrasion is a process of wearing away the outermost layers of scarred or blemished skin so they can be replaced by new , smooth skin without blemishes . Dermabrasion used to be a scary procedure accomplished with rotating metal brushes designed to make the skin bleed . Nowadays microdermabrasion is a procedure you can do with pain or bleeding at home . Different dermabrasion techniques , however , cost more or less and get faster or slower results in restoring acne-prone skin . <h> Summary : <p> Dermabrasion is a century-old mechanical method of getting rid of acne scars . <p> Dermabrasion ( unlike microdermabrasion ) removes the top layer of skin to reactivate skin-making cells that have been inactive beneath it . <p> Dermabrasion may be better than peels in that it involves a smaller area of skin . <p> Dermabrasion may be better than laser resurfacing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and untreated skin . <p> It is essential to follow the dermatologists instructions to the letter to prevent raised scarring of the skin after dermabrasion is used to treat pitted scars . <p> It is better to prevent acne scars by stopping acne before it starts with a complete treatment system such as Exposed Skin Care . <h> Dermabrasion the Old-Fashioned Way <p> The first dermatologist to use controlled , intentional dermabrasion of the skin was a German doctor named Kromayer , who reported his results in a medical journal in 1905 . Dr. Kromayer used a system of rotating brushes and rasps to grind away the top-most layers of the skin over acne scars , brown spots , and thickened skin . Because he published his findings in German , doctors in the English-speaking world did not begin to use dermabrasion until the 1950s , when it became very popular for treating acne scars . <p> Understanding the way dermabrasion works requires a knowledge of the differences between the epidermis and the dermis of the skin . The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nutrients , oxygen , and waste disposal , all of which are accomplished through the dermoepidermal junction . <p> The dermis is also responsible for the growth of the epidermis . It reaches into the dermis with " epidermal appendages " filled with cells that can grow into new dermis if the skin is injured. - Some of- these epidermal appendages do double duty as skin pores , sweat glands , and hair follicles , providing a path for waste products to exit the skin . Other epidermal appendages lurk deep in the fat beneath skin , only activated when there is a major trauma to the skin above them . <p> Peeling off the epidermis activates epidermal appendages deep in the skin . They provide extra skin growth that replace skin marked by scars or excessive pigmentation that may be years or even decades old . Just 24 hours after the skin above these low-lying epidermal appendages is stripped away , they start producing new skin with the same organization and smoothness as youthful skin , without scars or spots . <p> The secret to successful dermabrasion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dermis of the skin , since the dermis contains the cells that make quick regeneration of the skin . For most of the twentieth century , doctors and aestheticians operated high-speed brushes to tear away skin just until it began to bleed . Going deeper would only create a new and even worse scar . <h> Who Benefits from Dermabrasion ? <p> But why in this age of chemical peels and laser resurfacing would anyone get old-fashioned dermabrasion for acne ? After all , lasers are much more precise , and peels do n't  go as deep into the skin . What could possibly be the reason for doing dermabrasion ? <p> In in the twenty-first century , there are certain people who get a better result from dermabrasion than from any other technique . Generally speaking , surgery is best for tiny areas of deep skin tissue . Peels are best for treating large areas of damaged skin . Dermabrasion is best for focused treatment skin . It is useful for pitted acne scars that cast a shadow on the skin , as well as for tattoos , age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acne , damage to the nose by rosacea ( rhinophyma ) , chicken pox scars , and acne scars around the mouth . <p> Dermabrasion is better when there is a problem with not enough pigment in the skin . It is more useful for fair skin , and for treating skin when there is a risk of vitiligo . Dermabrasion has an advantage over laser resurfacing in that dermabrasion does not leave a clear line between treated and untreated skin , as laser resurfacing often does . <p> Some people should not have dermabrasion . Most dermatologists will not use dermabrasion to treat blemishes on dark brown or black skin . There is too much risk of permanent discoloration of the skin . And most dermatologists will not do dermabrasion on skin of people who have Sj+grens disease , because the results of the procedure are too unpredictable . <h> Getting Ready for Dermabrasion <p> Most doctors will ask their patients to use topic tretinoin or Renova ( products that are forms of Retin-A ) for about two weeks before having dermabrasion . These products cause the skin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dermabrasion . The day of the procedure , it is important not to have any soap , moisturizers , or cosmetics on the skin that could be transferred to deep layers of the skin and cause inflammation . <h> The Day You Have Dermabrasion <p> Dermabrasion is performed under local anesthetic . The surgeon uses a hand held device rotating at 200 to 250 revolutions per second to rub a sandpaper-like bur , wire brush , or diamond fraise over the skin . The device usually has a foot pedal the doctor uses to control its speed and to keep it from cutting too deep into the skin. - The doctor will either hold the skin taut with one hand or apply a freezing spray to the skin " but the use of freezing spray requires a lighter touch with dermabrasion to prevent grooving of the skin . Dermabrasion around the eyes or on the nose may be done with a manual device that is much slower but much less likely to cause excessive bleeding . <h> Recovery from Dermabrasion <p> Done correctly , dermabrasion begins to produce results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks to heal .

Its not unusual for insurance companies to deny a claim months after the visit and then the doctor has to ask you to pay . But if they can sell you one or two or three $25 to $50 products every time you have an office visit they can cover overhead . <p> You 'll probably be told that the products your doctor has for sale are " medical grade " and that they are unique , high-end , or contain exotic ingredients .

The B-vitamin nicotinamide . <p> People with common acne , the kind that takes at least a day or two to break out and that is caused by oil in pores , sometimes respond very well to taking nicotinamide supplements or to a product called Nicomide T-Gel , which is applied directly to the skin . People who have rosacea , which comes on within minutes of changes of temperature and is mostly limited to the cheeks of the face and the nose , should avoid it . <h> 6 . Apple cider vinegar . <p> Apple cider vinegar can soothe the skin , but its real use is in acidifying the skin so other acne products can work . If you have been trying a skin peel that just does n't  peel , try blotting a tiny area your face with a clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vinegar dry , and then try just a dot of your face peel on the skin you have pre-treated with apple cider vinegar . If your skin does not turn red and irritated after 30 minutes , then you can pre-treat the rest of your face and use the product on a wider area of skin . Be sure to rinse your skin well . Acne is not attractive , but neither is running around smelling like a pickle factory . <h> 7 . Milk of magnesia . <p> Milk of magnesia is good for relieving redness and irritation in pimples . It also makes them less noticeable on white skin , although if you have dark brown or black skin , it just changes their color . Place a dot of milk of magnesia directly on the pimple after your cleanse your face in the morning and it will be less irritated all day . <h> 8 . Avoid cocoa butter and shea butter skin repair lotions . <p> Some people who have never had acne in their lives break out after using sun screens or skin repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people are allergic to chocolate or to nuts , other people are allergic to cocoa butter or shea nuts , used to make shea butter . If you stop using the product , however , the breakouts will go away in a week or so . <h> 9 . But use zinc oxide sun blocks . <p> Zinc oxide is great for protecting the skin of the face from sunburn . It also provides zinc , an important nutrient for the skin , directly to the skin . Zinc helps reduce the intensity of inflammation around pimples , and also reduces the production of whiteheads and blackheads . The only drawback to using zinc oxide ( and combinations of zinc oxide and titanium oxide ) in sunscreens is that they can leave dark brown or black skin looking unusually white . The effect wears off in about two days . <h> 10 . Keep your skin hydrated . <p> Let 's suppose your personal budget has absolutely no money left over for buying moisturizers , and you want to help keep your pores open by keeping your skin moist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splash of water on your face , blotted just enough to keep the water from running off your face , temporarily increases the moisture in your skin by about 500% . This is more than any moisturizer can do for you , although the effect only lasts an hour or so . Repeatedly splashing your face 4 or 5 times a day , however , can make a big difference in keeping it soft and smooth , if you do n't  wear makeup . <p> These 10 home remedies work on just about any budget . But why not take the next step and try an acne treatment system with a money-back guarantee like Exposed Skin Care ? 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778592 @2978592/ <h> Is Tretinoin an Effective Treatment for Acne ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Topical tretinoin for acne is the over-the-counter ( or , more often , over the Internet ) form of the best-known acne drug Retin-A . It is not as strong as prescription Retin-A , but sometimes it is exactly the right treatment for stubborn acne problems . <h> Summary : <p> Topical tretinoin is the non-prescription form of Retin-A . <p> It is always best to start with lowest strength of topical tretinoin you can find , although most people have minimal problems with 0.05% . <p> Topical tretinoin is not recommended for children under the age of 12 , or for women who are or who may become pregnant , or who are nursing . <p> Tretinoin topical is best for treating stubborn blackheads and pimples that are beginning to be covered over with skin . <p> Cleanse your skin 20 minutes before you put on tretinoin . <p> Use a pea-sized amount of gel ( about 1-2 grams ) that you apply to blemishes with clean fingers . <p> It is best to use tretinoin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , avoid excessive sun . <p> Do n't  buy products that combine tretinoin with a skin-lightening agent such as hydroquinone or mequinol . If you are concerned about brown spots left after acne treatment , use arbutin instead , especially if you have Asian , brown , or black skin . <h> What 's Special About Tretinoin ? <p> Tretinoin is an acid form of vitamin A. When it is delivered to the skin in a gel , it stimulates normal maturation of cells in the epidermis of the skin . Right as it does , it activates genes that cause them to live out a 21-day life cycle during which they are pushed to the surface of the skin . Assuming the problem in the skin was sluggish growth that kept pores tight and tough skin locked over blackheads , nodules , and cysts , stimulating the growth of the skin can be just the thing for hard-to-treat blackheads and small cysts . <p> Have a little too much fun in the sun ? Tretinoin can also help with sun damage . <p> Topical tretinoin is also a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have oily skin do n't  have acne problems until they spend too much time in the sun . The heat and dryness of the sun makes the skin flake . Some of these flakes get stuck in pores , where they mix with oil . The pore can not produce enough oil to bring both dead skin and excess oil to the surface , so it quickly fills and creates a hardened plug of sebum that oxidizes , and turns black , with exposure to air . <p> Tretinoin stimulates skin growth around the clogged pore . The pore opens naturally with squeezing , tweezing , picking , poking , steaming , or detergent treatment . The " floppier " your skin , the better the results you will get from topical tretinoin . Tight skin does not respond as well to tretinoin , but tight skin also is less prone to whiteheads and blackheads . <p> Gels made with tretinoin are also also good for treating small , newly formed nodules and cysts that are covered with a transparent layer of skin . Encouraging the skin to grow around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have tough pink scar tissue over a knot , nodule , or cyst , however , the strength of tretinoin you can get over-the-counter probably wont work . <p> Apart from treating acne , Tretinoin also has other benefits . It helps in the healing of sun damaged skin , hyper pigmentation , makes your skin glow , reduces oiliness and minimizes wrinkles . The cream also helps in the formation of new blood vessels and new collagen , which will improve the overall appearance of your skin . <p> In order to see noticeable results on your skin , you have to use the cream on an ongoing basis for quite some time . Some of the side effects you may notice as a result of using this cream is redness of the skin or skin flaking . This is a result of the exfoliation that is taking place . To get rid of the dead cells on the skin , use a wet piece of cloth to gently clean your skin . <h> What Topical Tretinoin Does Not Treat <p> There are some acne skin care problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any nodule , cyst , or ingrown hair that is old enough to be covered with pink skin probably will not respond to topical tretinoin . In fact , treatment could make the cyst or nodule worse . There could be just enough growth in the skin over an old cyst to make it redder and more noticeable , but not enough growth to make the skin open up and drain the infection . <p> Larger pimples take longer to respond to topical tretinoin . Stimulation of skin growth over the pimple temporarily makes it redder . More skin has to be stimulated for the pimple to drain . Smaller pimples on tight skin , on the other hand , often are healed more quickly with the right amount of tretinoin . <h> How to Use Topical Tretinoin <p> Non-prescription tretinoin comes in 0.01% , 0.02% , 0.025% , 0.375% , 0.04% , 0.05% , and 0.10% strength . You will most commonly find the 0.05% strength offered on the Internet . Even the 0.01% strength of this drug is considered too strong for children under the age of 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is always best to start with the lowest available strength product and increase strength every time you get another tube , to make sure it does not cause unacceptable irritation to your skin . <p> There is a tretinoin lotion called Renova , but this is primarily a treatment for sun-damaged skin . There are also tretinoin creams , but they can clog pores . Gels are best . There are several brands of rub-ons available on the market including Aknemycin- Plus solution , which has erythromycin , an antibacterial agent . There 's also Treclin- gel , containing clindamycin , which has antibacterial properties. - Most people experience some irritation when they use the 0.05% product , but they can adjust the amount they use so that any side effects are minimal . <p> It is essential to cleanse the skin before applying topical tretinoin . It is never a good idea , whether you are using topical tretinoin or not , to clean the skin with a bar of soap wrapped in a washcloth or with a detergent that makes big , foamy bubbles . Washcloths are abrasive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubbles can pull apart the skin where the edges of the bubbles touch the skin . <p> It will take several weeks to a couple months before you see results . <p> You do n't  want to use a strong soap or a literal scrub to loosen up your skin . You want to use tretinoin to stimulate the growth of the skin so it accomplishes its own loosening . Wait 20 minutes after you have used a mild cleanser and rinsed it off , and , with clean fingers , apply a pea-sized amount of gel to the skin you want to treat . Do n't  get the gel in your mouth or your eyes . Let the tretinoin dry on your skin , and wait another 20 minutes before applying makeup or sunscreen . <p> It takes about three to four weeks of continuous use before you can see any noticeable results on your skin . For brown spots , it will take about six to eight weeks to notice any difference . When you first start using the cream , it may seem like your skin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to reverse and you will start observing some positive improvement after sometime . <h> Sun and Tretinoin <p> The strengths of tretinoin you can get without a prescription wont make your skin especially sensitive to sunlight . Even so , it is best to use tretinoin in the evening . If you use tretinoin in the morning , take care not to burn . Apply at least SPF-15 sunscreen even if you have black skin , and up to SPF-70 sunscreen if you have fair skin and you are going out in strong sun . <p> Some formulations of over-the-counter tretinoin include skin lighteners to treat the browning that can be left behind as acne heals . Most of these products are a really bad idea if you have Asian , brown , or black skin . Asian skin , in particular , may react badly to treatment with products that contain a combination of tretinoin and the skin-lightening agent hydroquinone . Sometimes this combination is fine , but sometimes it causes a skin reaction that leaves permanent black and blue marks on the skin , especially at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the ears . <p> When tretinoin is combined with another lightening agent known as mequinol , treated skin may look very pale . This is undesirable if you have fair skin , but it is completely unacceptable if you have brown or black skin . If you have colored skin , do n't  use either mequinol or hydroquinone on your skin . It is a lot safer to use a separate skin treatment with arbutin to prevent pigmentation after tretinoin has helped you clear up blemishes . <h> Precautions <p> Before you start using Tretinoin , you have to take extra care since it may not be suitable for people who have certain conditions . Do n't  use Tretinoin without your doctors advice if : <p> You are breastfeeding <p> You are pregnant or you are actively trying to get pregnant . The drug may get absorbed in your skin and harm your unborn baby . <p> You have other skin care problems , such as eczema or rosacea <p> You had skin cancer before or if any of your close family members has had skin cancer <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribed by a doctor <p> You reacted allergically to any other medication before , especially Vitamin A related drugs , such as isotretinoin <p> You can use a moisturizing cream if your skin becomes very dry . Water based creams which are fragrance free are the best ones to use . Avoid oily creams , since they could cause your skin pores to get clogged again . It is also best to avoid any creams that may dry your skin or exfoliate it . <p> You can apply moisturizers and make up , as long as you do not apply them at the same time you are applying Tretinoin . <p> Avoid any cosmetic products that have alcohol , spices , lime and menthol as they can result in your skin stinging , especially when you are using Tretinoin for the first time . <p> Other things to avoid include other topical medications like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid . This can decrease the effectiveness of Tretinoin if they are applied at the same time Tretinoin is applied and it could lead to irritation of the skin. - Dandruff shampoos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Tretinoin Is Not Enough <p> Tretinoin can be just that extra something that helps you achieve clear skin , but it is never enough just to use tretinoin . You still need complete skin care to keep blemishes from coming back . Thats easiest with a skin care system like Exposed Skin Care . <p> Hi Joseph , I 'm sorry , but I cant recommend a particular medication .

And in the morning i applied moisturizer with sunblock SPF15 . And then , put my make up on . But after 2-3 hours my face starting to be oily skin again .

That should soak up a lot of the oil for at least a few days . Although its hard to do , the best thing l can suggest is to stop wearing make up . No matter how hypoallergenic or sensitive to skin it is , it definitely can damage your pores when you have oily or acne prone skin . I know that you may fel self conscious , but it will all be worth it when you have clear , beautiful skin . <p> I do n't  have cysts or nodules , I have small white heads , and I guess a few black heads .

Your skin responds by producing even more oily sebum than before you tried to dry it out . <p> Just say no to dark chocolate .

Do n't  try to remove oil in the skin . Always focus on removing oil on the skin . <p> Tens of millions of people who have acne follow the outdated advice to " dry out " skin to prevent blemishes . While it would seem to make good sense to remove the oil that can cause clogged pores , the reality is that using alcohol or harsh detergent soaps to get oil off and out of the skin causes an extremely undesirable reaction : The skin repairs itself by producing even more oil . <p> And all that extra oil feeds acne bacteria . Alcohol-soaked blemish treatment pads and sudsy soap may make your skin feel clean temporarily , but over the long run they make acne much worse , especially on dry skin . <h> 2 . Just say no to high-quality dark chocolate candy . <p> Milk chocolate does not always make skin break out . Dark chocolate often stimulates production of pimples , sometimes as many as 75 to 80 new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teen or in your early 20s , and especially if you are male , it is a good idea to avoid chocolate altogether . If you have to eat chocolate , eat milk chocolate , not dark chocolate . <h> 3 . Avoid heating your skin . <p> Many people have sudden breakouts , especially across the cheeks of the face and on the nose , when they come into a warm room from outdoors on a cold day . Or their faces may break out when they drink hot chocolate or eat spicy foods . Heating the skin or stimulating the peripheral nerves of the face can cause sudden relaxation of blood vessels in the skin , an action designed to cool the skin . If the walls of these capillaries are weak , red bumps and purple streaks can appear , often in minutes . Even if you do n't  have a diagnosed case of rosacea , you may experience acne-like reddening of the skin when it is warmed too suddenly . <h> 4. - Never rub bar soap across your skin . <p> Rubbing bar soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into pores , causing them to clog , but certain soaps are worse than others . Any soap that contains a botanical essence , an herb extract , an essential oil , or a fragrance or perfume can irritate the skin , which increases the production of sebum and clogs pores even more . Its best to apply a lather of cleanser to the face or a body wash to the rest of the body , allowing the product to cleanse the skin without any rubbing . Then rinse it off with warm water and pat dry . <h> 5 . If you have pimples , treat them with benzoyl peroxide , but start with the lowest concentration you can find , preferably 2.5% or lower . <p> Benzoyl peroxide kills the bacteria that cause pimples . It takes about 48 hours to work . This does not actually heal pimples , but it stops the release of messenger molecules that generate new inflammation from the immune system . Clearing up pimples usually takes about a week if you have rapidly growing teenaged skin , or about two weeks if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason it is important to start with a low concentration of benzoyl peroxide is to make sure you do n't  have an unusual , unfavorable skin reaction . Nearly everyone who uses 5% benzoyl peroxide or higher gets some kind of disagreeable side effect from the product , such as itching , peeling , or redness . Some people just ca n't use benzoyl peroxide at all . Be sure to use the lowest strength product you can exactly as directed , not leaving it on the skin longer than suggested by the manufacturer . <h> 6 . Try microdermabrasion before you do peels . <p> Microdermabrasion is a process that loosens the skin around pores to help open up or stay open . You can do microdermabrasion with special coarse plastic cloths . Always use a clean cloth , since you do n't  want to put germs and oil right back on your skin .

If you use a skin peel , use the right product for your skin . <p> Dry skin usually responds well to alpha-hydroxy acids such as glycolic acid , lactic acid , or fruit acids . Oily skin usually responds well to the only beta-hydroxy acid used in skin care , salicylic acid . For a product to work , however , it must contain the right hydroxy acid in the right concentration at the right pH , and the best products also contain neutralizing solutions that keep the peel from burning the skin . Check out reviews of specific products elsewhere on this site to choose the best peel for your skin . <h> 8 . If you Black or Hispanic , treat every pimple just as soon as you see it . <p> Most people of Black or Hispanic heritage develop mild to moderate acne vulgaris ( common acne ) only in their late teens or early 20s if at all .

To prevent cystic acne , it is essential to treat the pimple before it is covered with healthy skin . Since males with brown or black skin tones are also more likely to get their hair cut in bald fades or to shave their heads , it is very important to check the top and back of the head for acne of the scalp . Early treatment , with the mildest possible strength of benzoyl peroxide , can prevent permanent scars. <h> 9 . If you have Asian skin , beware of detergents . <p> Asian skin is especially sensitive to detergents . This is true of skin all over the body , not just the face . Anything that makes big bubbles or a tingling foam can irritate the skin and leave lingering brown spots .

The oil extracted from jojoba seeds is extremely similar to human sebum . Since like dissolves like , jojoba oil is great from removing excessive soft sebum , but it can make hardened sebum deposits in pores even worse .

Only a desert creature known as Baileys pocket mouse can eat jojoba nuts in large quantities without stomach upset . The reason most animals do n't  eat jojoba nuts is that the oil they contain is actually a wax , with a chemical composition similar to whale blubber or the sebum in human skin . <h> Jojoba Oil as a Skin Treatment <p> Native American tribes of the American Southwest traditionally used jojoba nut oil as a treatment for burns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production of collagen in the skin without stimulating the production of enzymes that break collagen down .

Nearly 80% of the vitamin E in the nuts is gamma-tocopherol , which is usually deficient in European and Australian ( although not American and Canadian ) diets . The nuts also contain alpha- and beta-tocopherol , and a compound called beta-sitosterol , which can interact with testosterone in the skin . <p> The waxy oil of jojoba nuts is not a triglyceride ( a building block of fat ) , so it is very stable . It does not go bad when it is stored at room temperature , and it has little color or odor . Since there is essentially nothing in jojoba oil but the waxy oil itself , it does not cause skin irritation or inflammation and will not trigger oil production when it is applied to human skin .

It is most commonly employed as a carrier agent to help deliver healing substances deep into pores . Since jojoba oil is chemically similar to sebum , it easily mixes with sebum , and carries other substances deep down into the skin . Of course , whether this is a good thing or a bad thing depends on the substance it is used to carry . <p> You do n't  have to buy an expensive acne skin care product , however , to take advantage of the healing properties of jojoba oil .

While adding antioxidants to jojoba oil certainly does not hurt , it usually does not help , either . Antioxidants go bad when they are exposed to the air , and jojoba oil is so thick that it is hard to package as a product in a tube . If you buy a jar of jojoba oil with antioxidants , the jojoba oil wont go bad , but the antioxidants quickly will .

This is black skin that never burns . Most people who have black skin only get cystic acne on the face . When cystic acne occurs elsewhere on the body , it is a telltale sign of another condition that is most common among people of African heritage , sarcoidosis . Blacks and Whites get acne about the same rate , although Blacks typically develop acne in response to changes in sex hormones , while Whites typically develop acne in response to stress hormones . <p> White people can get cystic acne , too . Unlike people of African heritage , people of European heritage usually develop cystic acne on the back and chest , not on the face . In Whites , cystic acne on the face is a sign of immune deficiency disease . <p> Women of all races can develop persistent acne with polycystic ovarian syndrome , or PCOS . In PCOS , acne is due to overproduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the overproduction of testosterone by the ovaries . Growth hormone also affects the condition of the skin . Ironically , the women who are working hardest to control their PCOS by natural means are the women who are most likely to develop cystic acne . This is due to the fact that fasting diets are used to bring down blood sugar levels to bring down testosterone levels , and growth hormone levels increase during fasting . <h> What Can Be Done About Cystic Acne ? <p> Nothing you put on your skin heals cystic acne . Microdermabrasion wont work , because the skin over the cysts is still healthy . Laser therapies wo n't work because they do n't  penetrate deep enough . Natural therapies just do n't  work , either . This form of acne has to be treated from the inside out with heavy duty acne medication , or treated with surgery . Most people prefer medication to lancing or surgery . <p> The drug most commonly prescribed for cystic acne is isotretinoin , also known as Accutane . This drug is taken by mouth , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encasing the cyst , and it stimulates the growth of the skin over the cyst so it eventually opens to the surface without lancing . But that 's when your daily acne skin care routine has to begin in earnest . <p> Stimulating the growth of the skin opens cysts , but it also closes pores . If you do not follow an effective daily skin care routine , preferably with the help of a treatment kit such as Exposed Skin Care so you take care of every aspect of mild to moderate acne care , your underlying condition can cause your skin to form new cysts about as fast as the old cysts heal . It is essential to do the same cleansing , moisturizing , and exfoliating routine anyone does for non-cystic acne , probably for the rest of your life . But if you keep up your skin care , cysts will be gone for good . Then you can turn your attention to acne scar removal . <h> Never try to treat cystic acne on your own . <p> There are conditions that look like cystic acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuchae , which occurs most frequently in Black and Hispanic teenaged males . Never take someone elses acne treatment . Work with your dermatologist to find your own acne solutions to get the best results . <p> My sons acne has escalated and he has had a couple of cystic acne blemishes . His dermatologist just prescribed him Doryx ( doxycycline ) . I 'm reading about the side effects right now . You might check it out . <p> Ahhhhh , no ! Doryx is awful ! It is awful in the sense that when you stop taking it , the cysts come back even worse . I had to learn that the hard way . I researched the drug and read a lot about it and the vast majority of people who took it ended up with cysts worse than before , but I did n't  care at the time . I just wanted the nasty cysts gone so I went ahead with the treatment . Mine is back after a little over a year after I stopped taking it . I really regret taking Doryx . Back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cysts then use grapeseed oil on them overnight ( i used Hobe Labs brand ) but other brands will work too i think .. avoid sugar , caffeine , wheat and soyQueen Helene Mint Julep mask is very good toopeople say drinking Lugols iodine will make acne worse but it actually improves for me ! <p> I have heard Queen Helene Mint Julep Mask works well , also , but I have not tried it yet . But I think I 'll try it soon because I was prescribed " Doryx " and it DID work for the most part , but about a year after finishing the treatment ( NOW ) , it is rearing its ugly head again , worse than before , in my opinion . You are correct about icing , though . it really does help . <p> I am a male in my early 30s and have had cystic acne on my back and chest since I was about 14 years old . I am of Australian Greek background . I have taken Accutane . The drug helped only slightly . But more than helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin from tanned southern european to whiter northern european looking skin . I much preferred the skin I was born with ! Anyway , that was 15 years ago . Since then , I have found that a number of major lifestyle changes have really helped , to the point where I can go whole weeks without any acne and clear lovely tanned skin . They are as follows : -Avoid alcohol , caffeine and chocolate ; -Regular exercise ( sweatinga lot , by running 8km for an hour every couple of days or swimming in salt water . AVOID chlorine where possible ! I have actually become quite a good surfer as a result ! ) ; -Eat low GI and low sugar food and drink and minimise saturated fatty foods ; -Eat lots of green and yellow vegetables ( good for the skin ) ; -Drink 7-8 glasses of water a day ! <p> My daughter is half greek and at 14 her acne became horrible . Aside from everything you listed , have you found anything else that has helped . Shes been on doxy and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe a birth control .

But the preparation of marigold petals known as calendula also has potent anti-inflammatory power for calendula . <h> What Is Calendula ? <p> The species of marigold used to make calendula skin care products is Calendula officinalis , which is also known as a pot ( as in a container ) marigold . Not an especially showy flower , it bears yellow petals around a golden flowerhead on a short , dark green stalk . <p> Calendula has been used as an herbal medicine for thousands of years . It used to be employed in making teas for calming the stomach , but nowadays it is more commonly used in small amounts to make creams for skin care . <p> Calendula kills the Propionibacterium acnes bacteria that cause acne and the staph and strep bacteria that kill impetigo . Its mildly antiviral , and gets the redness and swelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also used in mouthwashes , but in the mouth it is more useful for relieving inflammation than for killing germs . <h> How Effective is Calendula for Acne ? <p> Most of the clinical studies of calendula as a skin care treatment have been conducted in tropical countries , where moisture is seen as the missing factor when acne breaks out . Scientists at the Islamic University at Bahawalpur in Pakistan tested various formulations of calendula for moisturizing the skin and making it more elastic . They found that skin creams that contain about 4% calendula ( 1 part of calendula and 24 parts of a carrier oil ) work best for making tight skin more flexible so both wrinkles and blemishes smooth out . <p> Skin researchers at the Universidade de S+o Paulo in Brazil tested calendula creams as a means of preventing damage to the skin caused by ultraviolet light .

Scientists at the Amala Cancer Research Centre in India conducted experiments that found that plant chemicals in calendula seem to help the skin use the amino acid hydroxyproline , which appears in the connective tissue around which it builds new skin . Calendula reduces whole-body stress after a burn and accelerates the healing of a wound , but the effects may take several day to be noticeable . <h> How You Can Use Calendula to Treat Acne <p> The very best time to use a calendula product to treat acne is when you have both acne and impetigo . This most commonly occurs when you have been a little too rough in trying to treat your acne . Maybe you tried to pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it . Or you rubbed and scrubbed your skin raw trying to get rid of discoloration . Or you used a harsh detergent soap . <p> The first thing calendula does is to soothe your skin . That 's important , because it is n't just the rubbing and scrubbing and irritant chemicals that damage your skin . The skins nervous system can sense the damage you do to your skin and send a message to skin cells to release histamine . This is the chemical that also causes allergic reactions . It also can destroy skin that might be " held hostage " by a skin-irritant ingredient to keep it from getting into the bloodstream . If you had the stinger of a bee or a tiny fleck of a toxic metal in your skin , this would be a good thing , but if the problem is just having done too much rubbing and scrubbing or having used a detergent chemical on your skin , then the histamine reaction is n't helpful .

Allergies to calendula are possible . The people who are most susceptible to calendula allergies are those who have allergies to other plants in the same family , such as arnica and ragweed . Generally speaking , if you have an allergy to ragweed , you should not use any products that contain either of the calming herbs in the same family , calendula and chamomile . <p> What if you do n't  know whether you are allergic ?

This article wont tell you that you should n't smoke ( even though we really think you should n't ) but rather what women need to know to keep acne under control if they choose to smoke . <h> What 's Different About Acne in Women Who Smoke ? <p> Acne is usually considered to be an inflammatory disorder . In women who smoke , researchers at the San Gallicano Hospital in Rome have discovered , acne-related blemishes tend to have a non-inflammatory character . <p> Women who smoke tend to get whiteheads and blackheads instead of pimples , papules , nodules , and cysts . These non-inflammatory blemishes can still leave scars when they heal , and women who smoke also can develop scars on previously clear skin . <h> Why should smoking cause acne ? <p> It turns out that the skin is sensitive to nicotine . The keratinocytes ( the cells that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( that repair broken skin ) have nicotine receptors . When these cells come in contact with nicotine , they are stimulated . They release more collagen and add new layers to the skin , so that pores become tight . In turn , tight pores keep sebum inside . It hardens and forms whiteheads . The outermost end of a whitehead can oxidize as it is exposed to air and become a blackhead . <p> Nicotine also has an effect on the small blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to the skin . It causes these blood vessels to constrict . This makes it harder for the immune system to send white blood cells to release inflammation-causing chemicals in the skin , so that red , peeling , itchy , and irritated acne is less likely . However , the skin is also less able to get rid of the skin oils that get stuck inside pores and less able to repair nicks and scratches . <p> Using a nicotine patch , incidentally , has the same effect on the skin . Both smoking and nicotine from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <h> If You Are n't  Going to Stop Smoking , What Should You Do ? <p> There are acne treatments that work well for smokers , and acne treatments that do n't  . <p> Basic skin cleansing goes a long way in treating acne in women who smoke .

You may be able to see subtle differences in your skin the first or second time you use products of this type , although full benefits take several months . <p> Red light treatments are helpful treating blemishes in smokers skin . They help shrink the oil-producing glands at the base of pores . Blue light and combination light treatments are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not caused by overgrowth of acne bacteria . It can also be helpful to use skin creams that contain green tea extract or the form of vitamin C known as ascorbyl palmitate . <p> Perhaps more than any other group , smokers benefit from using skin care creams that contain vitamin E. Also perhaps more than any other groups , smokers are likely to run into unexpected side effects from taking nutritional supplements that contain vitamin E. <p> In smokers , the skin is usually depleted of vitamin E. Using a cream that contains vitamin E ( which may be labeled as alpha-tocopheryl rather than alpha-tocopherol ) restores the free radical fighters the skin needs to control inflammation . Taking vitamin E supplements , however , drastically increases the production of sebum " in some people , as much as 3000% " and in some smokers can cause blackheads and whiteheads to multiply . <h> Acne Treatments that Are n't  As Helpful for Women Who Smoke <p> There are other common treatments for acne that are not as helpful for women who smoke . Exfoliants and skin peels , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way an exfoliant or skin peel treats acne is by using an acid to loosen up the " glue " that keeps old or dead skin cells stuck to the surface . Removing dead skin by the use of microdermabrasion cloths or microdermabrasion creams gets rid of dead skin in ways that open up pores . <p> Treating skin with alpha- or beta-hydroxy acids such as glycolic acid or salicyclic acid , however , not only lifts dead skin but also stimulates the growth of collagen underneath the skin . In smokers , this excessive production of collagen is part of the problem . Exfoliants leave the skin red longer for smokers than for non-smokers because circulation is impaired , and they stimulate the production of collagen that can make the skin even thicker . <p> Skin care products that contain the B vitamin nicotinamide are also problematic for smokers .

Allergy-prone , sensitive skin makes treating acne difficult because skin care products often cause as many problems as they resolve . <h> Frequently Overlooked Signs of Skin Allergies <p> Many people who do n't  have hay fever or asthma nonetheless have skin allergies .

Quercetin is an antioxidant that is found in most fruits and vegetables but especially in their peels . Apple peels , for example , contain about 10 times as much quercetin as unpeeled apples . Onion skin ( not that you should start eating onion skin ) contains far more quercetin than the edible onion beneath it . The reason quercetin is abundant in the outer layers of fruits and vegetables is that it protects them from sun and insect damage . <p> Apples , onions , grapefruit juice , green tea , and red grapes are the most abundant sources of quercetin in most Western diets .

The chemical action of quercetin is similar to jamming the wrong key into a lock .

There is no warning label on apples about daytime drowsiness or precautions for driving or operating heavy machinery . <p> An apple a day may indeed help keep acne away . Grapefruit juice contains even more quercetin , but it contains so much quercetin that it can interfere with the livers ability to clear certain medications " especially prescription antihistamines .

Cleanse your skin every day , but with the right products . <p> You cant rub your acne away , and you cant clean your acne away , but daily gentle cleansing of your skin can stop the formation of new blemishes on your skin while old blemishes heal . <p> The best cleanser for your skin is a mixture of oils in water that are held together with an ingredient called propylene glycol . You actually can cleanser your skin , even oily skin , with pure olive oil . Because like dissolves like , oils dissolve oils on your skin . <p> The problem with using pure oil as a skin cleanser is that it is hard to blot off your face . That is why the best cleansers for acne-prone skin contain a mixture of oil and water held together the other ingredients that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are always bad for your skin . Any kind of cleanser that makes big foamy bubbles- Any kind of cleanser that leaves your skin red is bad for your skin . And any kind of cleanser that leaves your skin feeling tingly today can cause pimples to break out tomorrow . <p> Just how important is it not to over-wash your skin ? Scientists at Harvard Medical School found that washing your skin as frequently as four times a day is OK " as long as you do n't  use cleansers that contain ingredients that irritate your skin . <h> 2 . Treat your skin with ingredients that tonify your skin . <p> Skin " tonics " are products that reduce the production of excess oil without drying out your skin . In the old days , most skin products were mostly alcohol . Any alcohol product that is more than 46% ( or 92-proof ) kills acne bacteria on contact and dissolves excess skin oil . But its better to stop the production of excess skin oil rather than to try to melt it off your face once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin tonics is green tea extract . Your acne skin tonifier does not have to contain more than about 3% green tea extract to reduce production of oil in your skin . When your pores make less oil , they are less likely to get clogged and form blemishes " no matter what else you do . <h> 3 . Moisturize your skin . <p> Your skin forms a protective barrier like a brick wall . Skin cells known as corneocytes are the bricks . Skin components such as ceramides and cholesterol are the mortar . Sometimes your skin can have too many bricks and not enough mortar . That 's the condition moisturizer is designed to correct . Moisturizers add ceramides and cholesterol or just a tiny amount of water to the skin to help keep it flexible . <p> Or sometimes moisturizers do n't  add anything to your skin at all . They just prevent the skin from losing the moisture it already has . <p> One of the best moisturizers for the skin is a chemical that helps the skin preserve its natural moisture known as dimethicone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dimethicone is non-toxic , non-irritating , and inert . Its what is used to make Silly Putty . <p> Placed on the skin , dimethicone seals water in the skin . It also prevents irritation and itching and unnatural redness in the skin . Unlike oils , it wont clog pores . Unlike alcohol , it wont dry out the skin . If you have extremely dry skin because of some kind of autoimmune disease , you need a different product that adds moisture to the skin , but because dimethicone protects moisture rather than increasing it , it is useful for all skin types . When you keep your skin naturally moist , it has deeper and richer color and allows pores to stay open . <p> Microdermabrasion is a process of removing tiny amounts of dead skin and hardened oils off the surface of your skin without injuring healthy skin . Its an alternative to much more vigorous procedures that expose the regenerative layers of the skin to attempt to force healing . <p> All you do to perform microdermabrasion at home is to cleanse your skin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth across the surface of your face like a piece of completely non-scratchy sand paper . You will see some results right away . You will see more results as the weeks go by . The microdermabrasion cloth can be used over and over again as long as you keep it clean , and only costs about US $10 for your initial investment . <h> 5 . Stop inflammation from the inside out . <p> Acne involves the accumulation of excess acne bacteria in pores , but the inflammation that makes pimples is not caused by the bacteria themselves . Itchy , oozing , red pimples are due to the immune systems attack on those bacteria that takes out healthy skin cells at the same time . But you can train your immune system to fight acne bacteria with less inflammation . <p> The way to do that is by eating yogurt that contains live cultures or by taking probiotic supplements . These friendly bacteria find their way to the tiny indentation of the colon known as the villi . In the colon the immune system sees them as hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probiotic bacteria in yogurt are constantly getting removed with waste and they do n't  ever attack human tissues , the immune system learns that excessive inflammation is not necessary . It transfers this immune memory to its reactions to acne bacteria in the skin , and the skin clears . <p> All of the best products for these five tasks of healing acne are available from Exposed Skin Care . Exposed Skin Cares Facial Tonic , Acne Treatment Serum , Moisture Complex , Microdermabrasion Cloth , and Probiotic Complex are exactly what you need to heal mild to moderate common acne and keep it gone for good .

But there are a number of foods that often make acne worse or make acne better " although cleansing , disinfection , and other aspects of acne skin care are also important to keeping your skin blemish-free . <h> Summary : <p> No food always causes acne , and no food always prevents acne , but some foods make acne more or less likely . <p> Greasy foods do not cause acne by themselves , but consuming too many foods made with corn oil or soybean oil can make your skin break out . <p> Lard , butter , cheese , and nuts are actually good for your skin , although eat too much of this kind of fat may have a detrimental effect on your waistline . <p> Whey in bodybuilding supplements and instant milk products can cause blemishes and pimples . <p> Soy can be helpful for hormonal acne in women . <p> Raw vegetables reduce the incidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cause breakouts in teenage males . <h> Greasy Foods and Acne <p> The old advice used to be that greasy foods always cause acne . Then more enlightened commentators started telling acne sufferers that greasy food have no effect on acne . The truth is , whether greasy foods give you blemishes depends on both what you eat and how much you eat . <p> Every cell in the human body uses a group of fatty acids known as the n-6 ( or omega-6 ) essential fatty acids to make the hormones that cause inflammation . Every cell in the human body uses a group of fatty acids known as the n-3 ( or omega-3 ) essential fatty acids to make hormones that stop excessive inflammation . Both kinds of fatty acids are " essential , " meaning everyone needs to consume in their diets to live . But the problem is that most people get far more n-6 fat than n-3 fat . <p> The n-6 fatty acids are abundant in corn oil and soybean oil . If you live in North America , almost every processed food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The n-3 fatty acids are abundant in flaxseed and flaxseed oil , and cold-water fish and cod liver oil , as well as many nuts and seeds . Outside of some parts of northern Europe , most people just do n't  get enough of the n-3s . <p> There is n't any little pipeline that goes from your stomach to your pimples to deliver grease you eat from food . In fact , the oil in your pores is made by your pores . It is not extracted from your food . But whether or not your pores get inflamed depends in part on the ratio of n-6 essential fatty acids to n-3 essential fatty acids in your diet . And nearly everyone who has acne gets too many of the n-6s . <p> The solution to the problem is to cut back on certain kinds of fat in general , not just to avoid greasy foods . Margarine can make your skin break out . Chips ( crisps ) that are fried in corn oil or soybean oil can make your skin break out . Most packaged candies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . <p> Lard , cheese , butter , olive oil , fish oils , and coconut oil , on the other hand , actually help clear up your skin . Just be sure to consume them in moderation . These fats may not make your skin break out , but excess calories have a way of becoming belly fat . <h> Chocolate <p> " Everybody knows " that eating chocolate can cause pimples to pop out on acne-prone skin . It turns out , however , that its not the fat in chocolate that causes irritation of the skin . Its the chemical called theobromine . <p> When the skin breaks out in pimples , it is responding to stress by releasing inflammation . Nerve endings in the skin sense " stress " ( which can be something like rubbing alcohol on the skin , or something more general like studying for final exams ) . Theobromine blocks a chemical called adenosine that turns off the stress receptors in the skin , so they churn out more of the inflammatory chemicals that make the skin break out . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may make it break out . Dark chocolate has more theobromine than milk chocolate . And you liver transforms about 10% of caffeine into theobromine .

Its a great source of protein . It can help stimulate the immune system . In fact , it stimulates the immune system so much that it in some people can cause acne . <h> Soy <p> Soy is often called a super-food , but the cultures that consume soy on a daily basis usually consume it in a very natural form , either as edema ( whole green soy beans ) or tofu , and in very small amounts , seldom more than 1/2 oz ( 14 grams ) a day .

Only 1/2 ounce a day is needed for supporting healthy skin . <h> Vegetables <p> Scientific researchers have found some surprises regarding vegetables and acne . Norwegian researchers have found that eating raw ( or pickled ) vegetables does more to protect against acne than avoiding fat . Norwegian teens who do n't  eat salads or pickles tend to have more acne . <p> Dutch researchers , on the other hand , have found that cooked carrots and tomatoes , especially if they are served with olive oil , butter , or margarine , tend to increase sebum production , making the skin oilier , especially in teenaged males . Teenaged males still need to eat their salads , but they may have a good excuse for skipping the cooked carrots and stewed tomatoes . <p> Am in africa Ghana am 17 years old and am a male acne are all over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face as well my face keeps on swelling and a yellowish juice do appear when ever i press them pls what do i intend to do in other to help cure my acne and also to avoid oil from kamin on my face ? <p> the yellow juice is called pus .

Of course that is just my reasoning if both your article and their article is correct . I really wish I knew which statement is more true . Any ways below is the part of the article I am referencing . Paragraph from article below -&gt; " Most people know that carrots aid eyesight , but did you know that they can also be great for treating acne ?

" article in Health with Food.org Also , I have read more than 1 article that states All dairy , ( milk , cheese , butter ) are bad for acne and will have a tendency to worsen the breakouts because they are higher on the glycemic index , which can cause our sugars to not process properly which then causes a peak in our insulin which causes a hormone fluctuation .

For mild to moderate common acne , however , other combinations of treatments sometimes get better results . And even if you need strong prescription acne medication to fight nodules , cysts , and joint disease caused by acne , you will need the same simple , commonsense measures to keep acne from coming back . <p> This article will review the prescription acne medications from low-potency to high-potency , with suggestions on how to make each medication work optimally well . <h> Summary : <p> Always discuss options when you are offered prescription acne medication . <p> Over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide may be easier to use and produce far fewer side effects that prescription benzoyl peroxide . <p> In the United States , minocycline is the preferred antibiotic for acne . In Canada , clindamycin is offered to children , teens , and young adults to prevent staining of their teeth . <p> Never pick out your own antibiotic for acne , even if antibiotics are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is important to avoid getting a secondary infection that can be much worse than acne . <p> Topical tretinoin can treat both acne and wrinkles . <h> Benzoyl Peroxide <p> Benzoyl peroxide , also known as BP , is the worlds most frequently prescribed acne treatment . Some of the prescription names it is sold under include Brevoxyl , Benzaclin , Benzac AC and Triaz . It is available in gel , cream and wash form . It works by bringing oxygen under the skin . Since it is not possible for bacteria to live where there is oxygen , 99.9% of the bacteria under the skin die instantaneously. - This medication can often eradicate acne if used in the right dosage and in the right way . <p> The problem with prescription benzoyl peroxide usually is that it is too strong to use over the whole face . Most people experience stinging , burning , itching , flaking , peeling , and redness when they use benzoyl peroxide gels that contain more than 5% benzoyl peroxide , and doctors often start off their patients at 10% or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks after starting treatment . This is normal and is known as the hardening effect of Benzyl Peroxide . However , - 1% to 3% of individuals who use this product react allergically to it . This results in extreme crusting of the skin and inflammation . This is not similar to the hardening effect of BP , so it should not to be confused with it . <p> Ask your doctor about starting with a milder formula of benzoyl peroxide , as low as 2 to 2.5% . These products are much less likely to cause side effects that make you want to stop treatment . Save stronger benzoyl peroxide products for spot treatments " but be forewarned that a stronger produce may make the pimple even redder before it heals . <p> If you have Asian skin , use a vitamin E product in addition to benzoyl peroxide . The vitamin E will reduce the production of pigment that can discolor the skin even after acne heals . <p> Note : BP can cause beaching of the hair , skin and even clothes , towels and bedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Azelaic acid is a natural acid that is derived from whole grain cereals and animal products . This acid helps the skin by stimulating the fast renewal of skin cells . This prevents cell build up . This reduces chances of the skin pores getting clogged hence , minimally reducing the chances of pimples and blackheads forming . This acid has anti inflammatory properties and it kills bacteria that cause acne . You can find this in over the counter medications , but not in very strong concentrations . For it to kill the bacteria , it should be used in concentrations of 15% to 20% , which requires a prescription . <p> This product is popularly sold under the brand name Azelex . Azelex is a cream that has 20% azelaic acid . It should be applied twice a day . <p> 1 to 5% of the people who use this cream will experience some side effects .

It is one of the top rated medications that is used to fight against acne . <h> Antibiotics <p> Minocycline can lead to discolored teeth , or " blue smile " , in younger people . <p> Minocycline : In the United States , dermatologists usually treat acne with the tetracycline antibiotic minocycline . In Canada and Europe , dermatologists usually reserve minocycline for patients who are past the age of 22 . <p> The reason to be careful with minocycline is that it can stain growing teeth , causing a condition known as " blue smile . " American dermatologists insist that if your teeth turn black or blue after you use their prescription , something else must be the problem , but European doctors " who in most cases ca n't be sued " take the safer and more conservative route and treat acne with clindamycin ointments instead of minocycline . In Canada , doctors may also offer a clindamycin pill , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain of bacteria known as Clostridium difficile in Europe that is more severe after treatment with oral clindamycin . <p> Tetracycline- drugs are still used to treat acne , but they can cause stomach upset , and they are not safe for people who have kidney problems . <p> Erythromycin : Erythromycin- is- a- macrolide antibiotic- best used combined with Benzoyl Peroxide and sometimes helpful- for cystic acne . However , do n't  use other products on your skin when using Erythromycin since it can lead to irritation . Other side effects include burning , peeling , drying , itchiness , oiliness and redness . Some of the brand names it is sold under include Benzamycin , Erymax , Erygel , Akne-Mycin , Emgel , T-Stat , ETS , Theramycin Z , Ery-Sol , Erythra , A/T/S and Statisticin . <p> Oral antibiotics are taken in the form of pills at least once a day .

Taking low doses of antibiotic may still be effective while eliminating the risk of the acne bacteria becoming resistant to the antibiotic . <p> Other antibiotics are used to treat acne and other infections occurring simultaneously , but the fluoroquinolone antibiotics used for combination treatments , such as Cipro , ca n't be used if you eat certain citrus fruits . <p> Do n't  choose antibiotics on your own , even if you live in a country where antibiotics are available without a prescription .

It is available as a pill and in the form of gels that can be applied directly to acne-prone skill . <p> The way tretinoin works is by locking into receptors on the surface of a special class of skin cells known as keratinocytes . These are the cells that create baby skin cells that mature as they travel from the basal layers of skin to the surface . Increasing the production of these cells causes the skin to stretch and grow around pores , opening them without any need of deep-cleaning cleansers or , in the case of nodules and cysts , lancing or surgery . Retin-A is also anti-inflammatory and encourages the growth of white blood cells that fight infection , while it shrinks the glands that make sebum . <p> The problem with oral Retin-A is that it can cause problems in the liver and central nervous system . It can also overstimulate growth in the human embryo , and cause birth defects if taken during the first month or pregnancy . And a significant problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin that new skin blemishes occur . <p> The best way to use Retin-A is as a gel applied directly to the skin . Products for this purpose are labeled as " topical tretinoin . " You do n't  have to get a prescription , and the product is much less expensive over-the-counter than from the pharmacy . Results can be very fast , and you can control the amount of tretinoin you apply to your skin to limit irritation . Using both benzoyl peroxide and topical tretinoin , at different times of day , can prevent new infections as the skin opens up around pores . <h> Oral Contraceptives <p> Often used for hormonal acne , birth control pills contain progesterone and estrogen and help to decrease the levels of testosterone in the body . This reduces the severity of acne in females . Total lesion count reduces by 30 to 60 % .

It was quite popular before antibiotics such as Penicillin were introduced . It has antibacterial properties and stops the growth of bacteria . It is also an anti-inflammatory . Some of the side effects that are normally experienced by less than 2% of its users include irritation , burning and stinging . More severe reactions have led to some of its users dying , though this rarely happens . <h> Spironolactone <p> This medication is available in tablet form . It is a potassium sparing diuretic used to treat acne in women and particularly useful for non-hormonal acne . Its available in a wide range of doses and often combined with other treatments . In many cases- spironolactone- can dramatically reduce sebum production , leading to less acne formation . Some of the side effects of using it include loss of appetite , weakness , cramping , pain , bleeding and bruising . <h> Accutane , Tazorac , and Differin <p> Women using Accutane must do everything possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Differin are medications that work in much the same way as Retin-A , but they have very different side effects . <p> Accutane ( isotretinoin ) takes about 5 hours to enter the bloodstream and lasts about 24 hours . It is a strong stimulant to skin growth that can cause significant side effects . In the United States , doctors will require all women of reproductive age to use not just one , but two forms of birth control to prevent genetic damage to unborn babies. - It is usually prescribed for people who have severe nodular acne that does n't  respond to other treatments . A complete dosage taken in 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to completely clear acne , with no future remissions . <p> Tazorac ( tazarotene , also sold under the trade name Avage ) is derived from vitamin A and used as a cream , gel , or lotion applied to the skin . Its normally found in concentrations of .05% to .1% . The gel form is the best for acne . Applied once a day , it begins working immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bloodstream . Creams and lotions can clog pores and cause whiteheads and blackheads , however . It can not be used by people who have eczema , it should not be used after a sunburn , and it should not be used for more than 10 days at a time . Some people who use this drug are more sensitive to sun after they eat celery or celeriac or after they take St. John 's wort . Up to 30% of people who use this experience side effects including peeling , dryness , redness , itchiness and burning . <p> Differin ( adapalene ) is also used as a cream , gel , or lotion applied to the skin that has anti-inflammatory properties . As with Tazorac , the gel form is best for acne . Sometimes Differin is combined with benzoyl peroxide to prevent infection of surrounding skin as cysts and nodules open . The product works by keeping pores from being covered with new skin , and is best for people who need to keep cyst-prone skin clear . <p> There are many other medical treatments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or very specialized applications .

@@98778603 @2978603/ <h> The Contraceptive Pill , Acne and You 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Oral contraceptives can help reduce acne , but they do not completely eliminate it . <p> Contraceptive pills are often used to treat acne in women . They are safe and readily available , and they often make the critical difference in recovery from acne . The contraceptive pill is not for every woman , however , who has problem skin . <h> Summary : <p> Nearly every woman has acne at some time in her life . <p> Stress hormones are as important as sex hormones as a cause of acne . <p> Oral contraceptives usually reduce the number of whiteheads , blackheads , and pimples , but they do not completely eliminate acne . <h> Acne Is Nearly Universal Among Women <p> Almost every female develops acne after her adrenarche , the age at which the adrenal glands begin producing large amounts of dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , usually around the age of eight . Acne usually appears even before the menarche , or first menstruation . Nearly 100% of girls develop some degree of mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ages of eight and eighteen . About 10% of women continue to have acne even in adulthood . <p> Adult acne can be just as debilitating as diabetes , chronic back pain , or seizure disorders . Women who have ongoing acne through adulthood usually suffer emotional pain , and they enjoy far fewer employment opportunities than their peers . Doctors often use every treatment they can to help bring womens acne under control . <h> Hormones and Acne <p> The first trigger of acne in girls is increased production of DHEA by the adrenal glands . After the adrenals start making more DHEA and more of the stress hormone cortisol , just about aything that causes stress increases the activity of the adrenals , and increases activity in the oil-producing sebum glands of the skin . When a young womans body starts making relatively large amounts of testosterone , usually right at and after puberty , the hormonal effects on the skin are even greater , causing oil glands to swell and clog , trapping sebum and acne bacteria inside . <p> Most women who have acne do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testosterone levels that are on the high end of the normal range . Women who have polycystic ovarian disease ( PCOS ) tend to have high blood sugar levels that cause the ovaries to produce excessive testosterone that leads to hair growth and acne . Excesses of DHEA , stress hormones , or testosterone can lead to acne in women . <h> How the Pill May Stop Acne <p> The contraceptive pill contains a combination of varying amounts of some form of estrogen , usually ethinyl estradiol , and some form of progesterone , usually progestin . These hormones stop acne in several ways . <p> Estrogen lowers sebum production in the skin . When the skin produces less sebaceous oils , pores are less likely to be clogged . <p> Estrogen lowers the sensitivity of the skin to testosterone , so oil glands do not grow as large . <p> Estrogen interferes with the feedback loop between the ovaries , hypothalamus , and pituitary gland so that the pituitary produces less luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and the ovaries make less testosterone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PCOS . <h> Side Effects of Estrogen Treatment <p> When the contraceptive pill first became widely available in the 1960s , most brands used what would now be considered a very high dose of estrogen , about 0.1 mg per pill . Now contraceptive pills contain much , much lower amounts of estrogen , usually just 0.02 to 0.035 mg per pill , only 1/4 to 1/3 as much . The reason the amount of estrogen in the Pill has been reduced is that estrogen treatment can have detrimental side effects in many women : <p> As almost all women already know , high estrogen levels can cause bloating , swelling , headaches , and indigestion . A womans body does not produce the same amounts of estrogen and progesterone throughout her menstrual cycle , so pills have had to be reformulated to deliver more progestin at the end of a womans period to imitate nature and to keep periods predictable . <p> The amount of estrogen in the Pill usually does not cause the problems associated with estrogen replacement therapy ( ERT ) . <h> Does the Pill Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using nearly 80 different brands of the Pill have considered contraceptives as a treatment for acne . Oral contraceptives are not a complete cure for acne-affected skin in women , but they definitely seem to help most women . A Cochrane review of 81 acne studies concluded that : <p> Taking the Pill usually reduces the total number of whiteheads , blackheads , and pimples by 40 to 80% over the course of three months . <p> No one brand of the Pill consistently works any better than the others for treating acne , so women and their doctors can choose their contraceptives on the basis of other concerns . <p> No one brand of the Pill causes more or less side effects when used to treat acne . <h> Is Using the Pill to Fight Acne Safe ? <p> There have been a few reports of women who took the Pill to treat acne who actually got worse acne as a result . When this happens , the progestin component of the Pill is too high . Switching to another brand will resolve the issue ; the changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Some women who take the Pill for acne experience bloating , breast changes , fatigue , irritability , and lower LDL levels , but these can also occur in women who take oral contraceptives for birth control . Oral contraceptives can also increase blood pressure , aggravate problems with varicose veins , reduce folic acid levels , and cause swelling in the legs . They can induce depression , migraines , and mood changes . They can change cervical mucus and aggravate yeast infections . Women who take both the Pill and tetracycline antibiotics for acne may need a back-up method of contraception , since the antibiotics reduce the effectiveness of the Pill . <h> Starting on the Pill <p> Doctors usually order a quick pregnancy test before starting women on the Pill . The reason for this is that the Pill does not cause miscarriage or spontaneous abortion , but it can do genetic damage to the embryo if taken during the first two weeks of a pregnancy . Even when the doctor prescribes the Pill on the " quick start " method , couples are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a back-up method for the first month to make sure there is no pregnancy with risk of birth defects . <p> When bleeding or spotting occurs during the first part of the period , the problem usually is that the Pill does not contain enough estrogen . When bleeding or spotting occurs during the second part of the period , the problem usually is that the Pill does not contain enough progestin . Women often have to work with their doctors to find the right dose of the right Pill to help keep acne under control . 19923 @qwx879923

Most diseases remit and relapse , that is , they get better and they get worse , no matter what anyone does . At some point , the prisoners who drank water would get better , and Batmanghelidj would attribute their improvement to drinking water . When the doctor was released from prison , he fled to the United States . <p> Once in the USA , Batmanghelidj wrote a three-page editorial in the American Journal of Gastroenterology suggesting that researchers study water cures , and then wrote a bestselling book entitled Your Bodys Many Cries for Water .

Dr. Batmanghelidj died of an infection at the age of 72 in 2004 . <p> Many readers assumed that water cures had been extensively researched , but there actually have been no studies of water as a treatment for any disease , including acne . Drinking water wont cure water . But could drinking water prevent it ? <h> Drinking Water to Keep Skin Hydrated <p> There 's no doubt that dehydration affects the skin . When the entire body is in a fluid deficit , the skin turns ash-colored . Shrinking of tissues below the skin cause it to shrivel and wrinkle . The skin becomes- so loose that the contents of pores can just fall out " as the dehydrated person approaches death . Dehydration might resolve acne , but it also can bring about the end of life . <p> What about the opposite extreme ? Can you drink so much water that some of it has to go to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of the water it can absorb . After all , one of the main functions of the skin is to keep the water-soluble contents of the interior of the body from leaking out in the surrounding world , and to keep water from the external environment from diluting delicately balanced fluids in the interior of the body . <p> Drinking more and more water may make your stomach slosh , and it may make you take extra trips to the bathroom . In extreme cases , drinking too much water is also fatal , because it upsets the concentrations of electrolytes needed for nerve messages to reach the heart and lungs . <h> If Drinking Water Does n't  Moisturize Your Skin , What Does ? <p> The best way to understand how moisture makes a difference in the skin is to visualize the skin as a brick wall defending the body . The bricks in the wall are skin cells called corneocytes . The mortar that holds the bricks together is made up of fat-like substances such as the ceramides ( often labeled as " skin-identical " ingredients in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " also includes a group of substances known as aquaporins , which can transport tiny amounts of water in and out of the skin . They also can transport other substances such as glycerin . <p> Anything that can be transported through the aquaporins moisturizes the skin . Water moisturizes the skin , but only a very , very small amount of water can enter the skin . The skin has to be almost totally water-tight to protect the tissues beneath it . <p> The aquaporins can also transport glycerin , which adds to the liquid content of the skin , and helps keep it flexible . The fats in the skin can absorb fats from moisturizers . This is the reason that many moisturizers contain oil . It is also the reason that oil-based moisturizers , assuming they are so creamy or clumpy that they can clog pores , are good for keeping the skin smooth and flexible . They dissolve into the 25% or so of the skin that is the " mortar " between skin cells . <p> Alcohol also penetrates the skin , but it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortar between the bricks of the skin . This irritates the skin , and the skin has to repair itself by making more fats , some of which will find their ways into pores . Alcohol can temporarily leave your skin feeling damp , only for a few minutes , but it actually forces your skin to become greasy to keep the skin barrier intact . <h> What 's the Best Way to Use Water for Acne ? <p> Water itself only plays a small role in moisturizing the skin . A single splash of water on dry skin binds to the aquaporins and temporarily increase the moisture content of the skin as much as 500% . These conduction channels , however , quickly transport the added moisture to the tissues beneath the skin , and most of the water you splash on your face just rolls off or evaporates . A second splash of water wont do any additional good for your skin because the aquaporins are already full . Neither will steaming your skin , or standing underneath the shower . <p> You can trap water in your skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break down the skin . Their effects are always very short-lived , just a few minutes to a few hours . Oil-based moisturizers keep water in the aquaporins for as long as 12 hours . This leaves your skin moister and softer and helps pores drain , although you still need some time every day ( or night ) that you have nothing on your skin so the contents of pores can come to the surface . <p> Drinking water does not do anything special for your skin " although you absolutely must drink fluids to survive . But just as is there is no way you can scrub acne away , there is no way you can drink acne away , either . <p> The best way to take care of acne-prone skin is with a treatment system that provides you the tools to cleanser and tone your skin , as well as keeping it moist . One good acne treatment system that comes with a money-back guarantee is Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778605 @2978605/ <h> Can You Really Detox Acne Away ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> The wrong kind of detox , like colon cleansers , can actually make skin problems worse . <p> Many natural health experts tell us that redness and pimples on the skin are caused by poisons in the body trying to break out , and the best way to get rid of acne for good is to do an acne detox . The kind of acne detox that really works , however , is a great deal different from the kind of detox advocated by the marketers of colon cleansers and liver flushes . You detox your system with a product you add , not with " toxins " you take away . <h> Summary : <p> The wrong kind of acne detox can cause more problems that it resolves . <p> Skin inflammation is not caused by bacteria . Skin inflammation is caused by the immune systems attack on bacteria . <p> The reason you kill excess acne bacteria is to take away the immune systems reason for causing pimples . <p> It is never necessary to irradiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , although there are other kinds of skin infections that may require drastic medically supervised treatment . <p> Colon cleansers usually make the skin worse . <p> Probiotic bacteria in the colon " train " the immune system to control bacterial infections with less inflammation . They help reduce inflammation in the skin and in the brain . <p> Exposed Skin Care provides a product with the right probiotic bacteria for healthy skin , as part of a complete acne treatment system offered with a money-back guarantee . <h> What Really Causes Acne Blemishes <p> Acne is not really caused by toxins trying to force their way through the skin . Acne is actually caused by the immune systems over-reaction to bacteria that normally live on the skin . <p> The human skin is a complex ecosystem . Billions of skin cells are hosts to trillions of microorganisms , most of which belong on the skin and improve the health of the skin . Acne bacteria normally live in pores . They help the pore push excess oil out of the skin by consuming the fatty acids in sebum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soluble in water and can not be rinsed off the skin with water . Acne bacteria , however , convert waxy , oily sebum into some of the same kinds of fatty acids you can find in flaxseed oil and fish oil , and make propanoic acid as a byproduct . ( The making of propanoic acid gives acne bacteria their scientific name , Propionibacterium acnes . ) Thanks to acne bacteria , the thick and heavy sebum the skin makes to lubricate itself is transformed into smaller fatty acids and mild propanoic acid , which are water-soluble . For uncounted centuries before the invention of skin cleansers , bacteria made keeping the skin clean possible . <p> Acne breaks out when acne bacteria get trapped in the bottom of a pore . Every skin pore also provides a passage to the surface of the skin for dead skin cells . Sometimes these skin cells clump together . When they get stuck in the pore , the acne bacteria beneath them run out of food and go dormant . As they start to go dormant , they also release chemicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release inflammatory chemicals . <p> These chemicals destroy some of the bacteria , but the also sensitize the skin cells around them to immune destruction . Enough healthy skin dies that the pore opens up , after it has become red and inflamed . <p> You could " detox " your skin and get rid of acne bacteria , but the immune system can cause pimples to form even when there are no bacteria at all on the skin . You know this is true if you have ever eaten something that made you break out , or put some cleanser or chemical on your skin that made you break out . <p> In fact , efforts to kill all the bacteria on the skin usually cause more harm than good . Chemicals like alcohol can kill bacteria if they are applied in a sufficiently strong concentration . For alcohol , it takes a 46% ( 92-proof ) solution to kill bacteria on contact . Much lower concentrations of alcohol , however , can kill skin cells . These dead skin cells can clog pores . The immune system has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clogged pores become pimples . An acne detox of the skin is never a good idea . But what about detoxing the colon ? <h> Colon Health and Acne Detox <p> The human colon is another organ that is an ecosystem . Trillions of bacteria , usually about 1/3 of the content of the intestines , live in a healthy body . Without these bacteria , the stool is hard and bowel movement is difficult . <p> A few of these bacteria cause disease , but trillions more compete with harmful bacteria for food , water , and space on the lining of the colon , so we seldom experience infections of the colon . When we do , the colon usually finds ways to empty itself so the harmful bacteria are simply flushed away . <p> Some symbiotic , or helpful , bacteria make vitamins . Some symbiotic bacteria make essential fatty acids , especially propanoic acid , which fights colon cancer . And some symbiotic bacteria , a group of bacteria we also know as probiotic bacteria , both fight disease-causing bacteria and train the immune system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cause Acne <p> The lining of the intestine is covered with villi . The bloodstream sends billions of white blood cells to the villi to make sure no disease-causing bacteria enter the bloodstream . ( Its not unusual for some pathogenic bacteria to enter circulation , but usually not in numbers that make us sick . ) <p> Healthy , helpful bacteria such as Lactobacillus acidophilus live in the villi . The immune system naturally tries to destroy them with inflammation . But when the immune system " learns " that these bacteria do n't  have to be destroyed for the lining of the colon to stay intact , it makes fewer inflammatory chemicals all over the body . Healthy bacteria in the colon reduce inflammation in the skin and brain . Making sure you have probiotic bacteria in your colon keeps the immune system itself from causing toxic reactions . And the most severe toxic reactions in the body are almost always caused by the immune system itself . <h> How to Do a Real Acne Detox <p> Stopping inflammation in your skin , therefore , is not something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to stop inflammation in your skin is to be kind to the friendly bacteria in your colon . Eat yogurt every day ( either dairy or soy is fine ) , or take probiotic supplements . <p> Limit your use of colon cleansers for times you are constipated . You do n't  want to flush any more helpful bacteria into the toilet than you have to . And limit your use of skin cleansers for times you have visible inflammation of the skin . Remember that what you are doing for your skin is taking away the reason your immune system has to keep your pores inflamed . You are not killing bacteria that actually causing the inflammation . <p> Probiotic support is much more helpful for your skin than any kind of " acne detox .

We review it here . <p> Sometimes shoulder acne is just a reaction to tight-fitting clothes or shoulder pads , but often shoulder acne is a sign of a much more serious form of this common skin condition . Shoulder acne can be especially severe because the pores on the shoulders are large and pimples can grow especially large . <h> Summary : <p> Acne on the shoulders is almost never the mild to moderate common form of acne known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulders when clothes are too tight or when you do n't  take a shower after you work out . <p> Steroid acne causes breakouts on the shoulders after steroid injections . <p> Yeast infections can cause a plaque-like acne on the skin . <p> Common medications can cause shoulder acne , including some medications used to treat acne on your face . <p> The best ways to treat shoulder acne on your own are to be sure to shower after exercising , to exfoliate your skin with a shower mitt , to use an acne-fighting body wash whenever possible , and to avoid additional irritation to your skin . <h> Acne Mechanica on the Shoulders <p> The easy-to-treat form of shoulder acne is a condition known as acne mechanica . In this form of shoulder acne , the initial cause of irritation to the skin is the accumulation of sweat underneath shoulder pads , brassiere straps , or tight-fighting clothing . The skin responds to irritation by creating more sebum . The oily sebum builds up in pores that become clogged , resulting in whiteheads , blackheads , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shoulder acne from folliculitis , which occurs in hair follicles , especially after shaving the shoulders . It can also occur after use of a hot tub or wearing a wet suit . Folliculitis is more likely to be painful than acne , and is caused by a different microorganism .

Consulting a doctor is usually necessary for treatment of folliculitis . <p> The treatment for acne mechanica on the shoulders is uncomplicated . All that is necessary is to stop the accumulation of sweat on the skin . This can mean placing cloth over shoulder pads or buying a better-fitting brassiere . <p> The best acne product for treating breakouts on the shoulders is benzoyl peroxide .

Both prescription and illegal steroid drugs can cause steroid acne . The greatest number of pimples and papules occur on the shoulders , but there are also breakouts on the torso , buttocks , hands , and feet , with less involvement of the face . Steroid acne usually clears up when steroid use is discontinued . <h> Pustular Eruptions on the Shoulders <p> Certain antibiotics may cause the breakout of pimples and pustules primarily on the shoulders , but also elsewhere on the trunk and , to a lesser extent , on the face . Penicillin antibiotics are most likely to have this effect , but pustular eruptions on the shoulders can also be caused by the antibiotics doxycyline and co-trimoxazole , which are antibiotics that are sometimes used to treat acne on the face , as well as the drugs chloramphenicol , itraconazole , hydroxychloroquine , mercury , lithium , isoniazid , and olanzapine .

It usually accumulates under shoulder pads or shoulder straps . The surface of the skin may be covered with pimples at first , but they appear to grow together in to a single , itchy plaque . Anti-fungal treatment gets rid of this condition . <h> Acne Conglobata of the Shoulders <p> Acne conglobata is an especially severe form of acne in which large , red lesions burrow and connect to each other .

Emotional support of men who have this severe form of acne is essential to their recovery . <h> What Can Be Done About Shoulder Acne ? <p> The most important thing to do for shoulder acne is to stop anything that is causing it . If the problem is acne mechanica , then it is necessary to stop wearing tight clothes . If the problem is steroid acne , then steroid injections have to be discontinued . <p> Most of the treatments that work for acne on the face , such as antibiotics , tea tree oil , Retin-A , topical tretinoin , Accutane , Tazorac , Differin , cleansers , moisturizers , exfoliants , and skin peels , usually have very little effect on shoulder acne . <p> And of all the various forms of shoulder acne , only acne mechanica can be treated without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most common form of shoulder acne .

Usually the problem that causes acne around the mouth is lip balm or some oral care product . When you stop using the wrong product , acne around the mouth clears up on its own . But you have to know which products are causing the problem to make the changes that clear the skin around your mouth . <h> Summary : <p> Acne around the mouth is often preventable . <p> One cause of acne around the mouth is overuse of lip balm , especially scented and flavored lip balm . <p> Switching to a pure wax lip balm will help , but stopping lip balm altogether is usually better . <p> Toothpastes that contain sodium lauryl sulfate ( SLS ) can also cause acne around the mouth . <p> Switching toothpaste plus making a habit of rinsing the face with warm water after brushing the teeth will help reduce acne around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balm and Acne Around the Mouth <p> Lip balm is addictive . The reason lip balm is addictive is that it tastes good , and it both moistens your lips and dries them out at the same time . <p> Just how addictive is lip balm ? If that little tube of lip balm in your pocket or your purse seems to chanting " Use meUse me " all the time , you are not alone . There is actually a 12-step program known as Lip Balm Anonymous . There really are stores that station an in-house detective around displays of lip balm to prevent shoplifting by desperate lip balm addicts . <p> The makers of lip balm add flavors and fragrances that are associated with happy events . They make lip balm with the taste of chocolate and the scent of Christmas trees . They make lip balm with cola flavorings many people first tasted with Happy Meals . They add fruit flavorings that also used to make adult beverages at resorts in Hawaii . <p> All the happiness induced by lip balm might not be a problem except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sebum on skin surrounding the mouth . The wax from the lip balm can clog pores . The fragrances and flavorings used to make lip balm irresistible irritate the skin , which causes it to make more sebum " which gets trapped underneath the wax inside a pore surrounded by dry skin . Because these ingredients are also irritating , the inflame the pore that is already clogged , and tiny red pimples multiply at the corners of the mouth . <p> The most obvious way to stop these pimples is to stop using lip balm , but it is not for no reason at all that there are chapters of Lip Balm Anonymous . If you just have to keep using lip balm , opt for a brand that is pure wax with no added fragrance or flavorings . This still clogs pores around the mouth , but at least it does not inflame them . <p> It also helps to keep your lips hydrated by drinking small sips of water throughout the day .

Facial waters that contain magnesium or selenium will calm the skin so blemishes are not as red and noticeable . Lip balm , however , is just one cause of acne around the mouth . <h> Toothpaste and Acne Around the Mouth <p> Another cause of acne around the mouth is toothpaste . The flavors and perfumes added to flavored toothpaste can cause breakouts around the mouth in the same way that the flavors and perfumes in lip balm can cause breakouts around the mouth , but most brands of toothpaste have an additional problem ingredient , sodium lauryl sulfate . <p> Sodium lauryl sulfate , which is also known as sodium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sudsing agent . It it added to toothpaste to make sure it does n't  get stuck in the bottom of the tube , and also to give the product a foaming action against your teeth and gums . This chemical is added to tens of thousands of other detergents to make them foamy so they can lift grease and grime . <p> The problem with SLS or any other sudsing agent on your skin , especially at the corners of your mouth , is that the surface tension generated at the edges of the bubbles can force tiny cracks in the skin . The skins first aid for these cracks is sebum generated by nearby pores . That does n't  cause acne breakouts , but if toothpaste also gets into those pores and irritates them , excess sebum can get trapped . Surrounding skin is not protected , and the clogged pore forms a whitehead or blackhead if it not inflamed or a pimple if it is . <p> Womens skin is more sensitive to SLS than mens skin .

But since you do n't  want to replace your acne problem with a rotting teeth problem , you still need to use toothpaste , just without the SLS , flavorings , and fragrances .

This article will tell you the basics anyone who has mild to moderate common acne can use to get rid of acne for good , without expensive skin care products or exotic medical treatments , step by step . <h> Summary : <p> Getting rid of acne usually takes at least several weeks and probably several months . <p> Using a combination of methods gets rid of the most blemishes and keeps them from coming back . <p> No single treatment gets rid of all acne blemishes . <p> Cleansing is fundamental to acne care , but it is important not to use any cleanser more often than twice a day . <p> Cleansing does not involve rubbing or scrubbing . Its important to let your cleanser do all the work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soap film can clog pores . <p> Do n't  try to get rid of blackheads or pimples with brute force . Chances are that you will just injure the skin . <p> Treat pimples with benzoyl peroxide to kill acne bacteria . This stops the process of inflammation . <p> Get the red out of pimples with tea tree oil . <p> Remove blackheads with salicylic acid . This loosens up the skin slowly so that you do n't  replace an unsightly blackhead with an unsightly enlarged pore . <p> People who have unresolved acne problems tend to fall into two categories . One group does n't  cleanse skin daily . The other group cleanses skin three times a day or more . <p> Its essential to keep dead skin and excess oil from accumulating in pores . Its also necessary to remove grit , grime , and makeup that may have accumulated during the day . Cleansing your skin wont get rid of existing acne , but it can help prevent new blemishes from forming . <p> Its also essential to keep your skin from drying out . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blackhead , or a pimple is not accumulation of oil or dirt . Its drying out of the skin . Tiny flakes of skin fall into a pore , forming a lid over oil and bacteria that would normally drain out to the surface of the skin where they can be washed away . If you are washing your face so often it dries out , or it feels itchy or flaky , you are making acne worse . <h> 2 . Let your skin cleanser do the work . <p> You do n't  need to rub your skin to get it clean . Just making a lather of cleanser and placing it on your face for 30 seconds to 3 minutes is enough . You do n't  need to feel it working " if you do , it is probably drying out your skin and setting up new blemishes . Just put cleanser on your skin and rinse away . If your cleanser is n't strong enough to get up stubborn makeup , then apply cold cream and blot cold cream and makeup off your skin . But never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture of oil and water . <p> The number one ingredient in your cleanser should be water , and the number two ingredient should be some kind of oil that dissolves the oil in your skin so water can wash it away . Do n't  use cleansers that contain alcohol . Cleansers never contain enough alcohol to kill acne bacteria ( it takes 46% alcohol to kill bacteria ) , but they often contain enough alcohol to dry out the skin . <h> 4 . Say nope to soap . <p> Do n't  use bar soap on your skin . The film soap leaves behind clogs pores that have just been cleaned , and acne bacteria can survive on bar soap until you " or someone else in your household " uses if for cleansing body parts unknown . <h> 5 . Be patient with pimples . <p> Squeezing , picking at , poking , and probing pimples just forces bacteria farther into the skin . Even a healthy immune system fails to do a good job at getting rid of acne bacteria . That is because they can secrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The area of infection just grows larger and larger beneath the skin where skin treatments cant reach it . <p> The way to treat pimples is to kill the bacteria with benzoyl peroxide or tea tree oil , or a combination of both , and then allow the skin to heal naturally . Killing acne bacteria just stops the immune systems misguided efforts at getting rid of them . Pimples still have to heal on their own . Benzoyl peroxide does a better job of getting rid of bacteria , but tea tree oil does a better job of getting rid of inflammation . The only over-the-counter product that contains both ingredients in effective amounts is Serious Skin Cares Clearzit Acne Medication . Be careful to use it just on pimples , not on healthy skin . <h> 6 . Get rid of blackheads with salicylic acid . <p> The problem with squeezing blackheads is that you usually miss . All you manage to do is to make tiny cut in the skin next to the blackhead that gives infection a pathway into the skin . And even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an extraction device , an equally unsightly enlarged pore is left behind . <p> The way to get rid of blackheads is by using exfoliating products that contain salicylic acid , which dissolves the hardened oil that causes blemishes . The first part of the plug of oil in a pore that is dissolved is the " black " in the blackhead . Often you can see immediate improvement in your complexion , just a few minutes after you use a product like Paulas Choice 2% Beta-Hydroxy Acid Gel for All Skin Types or the much less expensive Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Stress Control 3-In-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment . If you leave these products on your skin overnight , they slowly loosen whiteheads and blackheads , giving the skin time to spring back into place so they do n't  leave an enlarged pore . <h> 7 . Take the easy way with acne scars . <p> If you have small acne scars ( less than 1/4 ? or 6 mm deep and less than 1/4 ? or 6 mm across ) , there are several non-surgical , non-medical treatments that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be applied to raised acne scars . Fitting the skin like a bandage , they stretch the skin around a scar so that the collagen fibers holding it in place break down . The skin allows oxygen but not water to travel to the skin so bacteria wont grow but the skin wont shrivel like a prune from excessive hydration . It may take as long as 90 days to smooth out a small scar . You can take the silicone sheet off for a few hours at a time for photos or special occasions . <p> Microdermabrasion wears away the edges of indented scars . Microdermabrasion is done with a polyethylene microdermabrasion cloth or with a microdermabrasion gel that you rub on your skin . Corundum crystals , used in Exposed Skin Cares Microderm Scrub , are less irritating that the aluminum oxide crystals used in most other microdermabrasion products . Getting rid of acne scars is a slow process , but you will usually see results on small scars in 30 days or less . 19923 @qwx879923

Popping pimples only makes them worse . That is especially true if you have what looks like a pimple but that is really staph infection . <p> This article will tell you how to remove pimples in five slow but easy steps . Before you get started , however , it is important to know for sure that what you are dealing with is really a pimple . <h> Summary : <p> Its never a good idea to pop , prick , poke , needle , or lance a pimple . This usually just forces the infection deeper into the skin . <p> Not every blemish that looks like a pimple is caused by acne bacteria . Staph infections of the skin require different handling . <p> Removing pimples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its possible to get rid of inflammation and redness much faster . <h> Why Popping Pimples Is a Bad Idea <p> Pimples are ugly , itchy , red , and sometimes tender . The inflammation of the skin caused by pimples actually is only in a small way caused by acne bacteria . A small number of acne bacteria on the skin is actually a good thing . Acne bacteria eat excess skin oils , keeping the skin from becoming oily . After all , for most of human history , there were no skin care products . Human beings relied on symbiotic bacteria on the skin to keep the skin healthy . <p> The problem starts when acne bacteria are trapped in a pore that normally opens to the surface of the skin . When they are trapped underneath hardened skin oils , they emit a small amount of hydrogen peroxide as a waste product of digesting those skin oils as they try to eat their way out . <p> Most of the inflammation of acne , however , is caused by the immune system itself . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make surrounding skin cells very sensitive to the immune system . Instead of zapping the bacteria , the immune system inflames the skin . Eventually enough skin cells will die that the infection drains out harmlessly to the surface , that is , unless something forces the bacteria to travel down deeper into the skin instead of up to the surface . <p> Popping a pimple forces some acne bacteria deeper into the skin while it forces other bacteria and the oil that had them trapped outward . The skin heals over the place that is popped , but the bacteria are still there . They keep on producing their sensitizing chemicals so the immune system continues to inflame the skin , but they are no longer in a pore . There is no easy exit . Instead of eventually being pushed to the stop by new , growing skin , they are trapped inside . <p> The bacteria form a nodule or a cyst that can only be drained by cutting the skin open or by taking a medication like Accutane , Retin-A , Differin , or Tazarac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens up over the cyst to let it drain . ( These medications have many side effects . ) Popping a pimple gets rid of the pimple , but can leave a cyst . That is , however , not the worst that can happen . <h> Not Everything That Looks Like a Pimple Is a Pimple <p> Not every kind of inflamed skin blemish is caused by acne bacteria . Many are the result of staph infections . <p> Staph bacteria , like acne bacteria , normally live in small numbers of the skin . Acne bacteria eat excess skin oils , and staph bacteria eat dead skin cells . Small numbers of staph bacteria are a kind of cleanup crew for the skin . <p> Staph bacteria usually do n't  enter pores , because the acne bacteria can overwhelm them . The usually entryway for staph into the skin is through a tiny crack or cut . Inside the skin where they are not exposed to air , sunshine , and skin cleansers , they can multiply and emit their own toxic chemicals to cause a nasty zit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Children most commonly get staph infections on their buttocks . Adults most commonly get staph infections on their faces . Staph infections , unlike acne infections , can occur almost anywhere on the body , and require special treatment : <p> Staph infections and acne infections can both be spread from hand to face , but staph infections are also transmitted from kitchen utensils , seats in public buses , toilet seats , damp clothing and towels , and the like . A friend or family member is not likely to catch your acne infection . A friend or family member can easily catch your staph infection " especially from the pus you pop from bumps on your skin . <p> Staph infections develop much more quickly than acne infections and spread to other parts of the body much more quickly .

Knowing the difference between staph and acne is the first step to removing pimples . <h> Five Easy Steps to Removing Pimples <p> Once you have made sure that you are dealing with acne rather than some other skin problem , then the most important thing to remember about removing pimples is not to make the problem worse . Do n't  try to scrub the pimple away . Do n't  try to rub the pimple away . Do n't  lance , poke , prick , mash , smash , or needle it . Be sure you use a mild skin cleanser that makes tiny soap bubbles . Big bubbles irritate the skin . Alcohol dries out the skin . Avoid sudsy soap and do n't  use rubbing alcohol on your skin . <p> And do follow these five easy steps for removing pimples from your skin . <p> 1 . Stop inflammation . You can get the red out of pimples with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , take a clean cotton swab and dab a little pure tea tree oil directly on the pimple , taking care not to get the tea tree oil in your mouth or eyes . Benzoyl peroxide will deal with infection , but not with inflammation . Tea tree oil will deal with both . <p> 2 . Moisturize . There 's a difference between oil and moisture . Oil is on your skin . Moisture is in your skin . Excessive oil is a bad thing , but enough moisture is a good thing . Use a moisturizer once or twice a day to give your skin a chance to open the clogged pore on its own . <p> What is the very best moisturizer ? Water ! Simply splashing your face with water temporarily increases its surface moisture content as much as 500% . Since you cant do that all day , choose a moisturizer that is made with water or oil , but not alcohol . <p> 3 . Protect your skin from the sun . You cant heal a pimple if it gets sunburned , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots . Be sure to protect your skin from sun . <p> 4 . Exfoliate . Gentle exfoliation with alpha- hydroxy or beta-hydroxy acids will loosen up the skin , increase circulation , and stimulate the growth of healthy cells beneath the pimple , effectively forcing it out of the skin . Do microdermabrasion for whiteheads and blackheads , but exfoliation for pimple . <p> 5 . Keep pimples from coming back by avoiding foods that trigger breakouts . Some people are very sensitive to iodine . Eating a lot of ocean fish or shellfish , taking an iodine supplement , or using iodine antiseptics can make the face breakout . <p> Many people are sensitive to chocolate . A University of Miami study found that some young men develop as many as 85 pimples in 5 days after eating just 6 oz ( 168 g ) of dark chocolate .

But I accidentally picked up the wrong product when I went to the cosmetics counter and came home with a tube of Clean &amp; Clear , so I tried it myself . <p> To my considerable surprise , Clean &amp; Clear worked . It worked literally overnight . Since I have to be honest about what I know really works , I took a second look at the Clean &amp; Clear product line and I think I 've figured out why these products really work . And that 's a great thing , because Clean &amp; Clear is one of the most affordable brands of acne care products you can find in the USA and Canada . Let 's take another look at their bestselling brands . <h> Summary : <p> Clean &amp; Clear Mark Remover can literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treatment is one of the few treatments that will work on blackheads as well as pimples . <p> Some Clean &amp; Clear products are n't  advisable if you have dry or allergy-prone skin . <h> The Clean &amp; Clear Product That Worked for Me <p> By the time you are 56 years old , you are n't  supposed to get acne any more . I usually do n't  . But once or twice a year I get whitehead or a blackhead and every year or two I get a pimple . When I do , I can treat them easily with moisturizer ( to help a whitehead or blackhead pop right out on its own ) or benzoyl peroxide ( to stop the bacteria in a pimple ) . But because I live in an especially hot and sunny climate , I get brown spots that last a lot longer than blemishes . <p> A few days ago I accidentally picked up a tube of Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Mark Treatment . Its usually US $6.49 but it rang up as $4.99 at the cash register . This product contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the right amount of salicylic acid at the right pH to gently lift and remove the top few layers of cells on pigmented skin . Because the product is made with salicylic acid instead of glycolic acid , it is good for treating red marks on the skin as well as brown marks left behind when acne-prone skin is exposed to the sun . <p> I dabbed a little bit of the mark treatment on some spots that have been on my face for about two months . I had a couple of blackheads that were easy to treat , but the day I treated them I also took a stroll down to the market in afternoon heat . <p> That particular day it was n't just hot . The sun was so bright and strong that it literally hurt to go out in it . The air temperature was just at our all-time record high , 112- F/56- C but the temperature of exposed skin was about 165- F/73- C. Thats hot enough literally to cook your skin if you ca n't sweat . <p> I do n't  have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I got back from the store .

The next morning I looked in the mirror and they were gone . <p> I 've never used any product that worked that well . I can say with absolute confidence that if you are a 56-year-old man who has olive skin tones and very mild acne Clean &amp; Clear is the mark remover for you . And this probably true for a lot of people who ( 1 ) are a lot younger or older than their mid-50s , ( 2 ) have skin tones other than olive and ( 3 ) are n't  men . <h> The Pluses and Minuses of Clean &amp; Clear <p> I happen to have especially resistant skin . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory or a steel mill and not break out . But not everybodys skin is resistant . <p> If you have allergy-prone or chemical-sensitive skin , the alcohol and witch hazel extract in Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Mark Remover might be a little too much for you . The salicylic acid will still get rid of existing pigmentation , but the alcohol and witch hazel can cause new inflammation . You are n't  going to get any new blemishes that are worse than the ones you have now as long as you use the product as a spot treatment , but its not impossible that you would create new spots as you clear up old ones if you have sensitive skin and you do n't  use sunscreen when you are using Clean &amp; Clears mark remover . Some Clean &amp; Clear products , however , are safe even if you have sensitive skin . <h> Safe Clean &amp; Clear Products for Sensitive Skin <p> Clean &amp; Clear makes a moisturizer that is great for sensitive skin unless you happen to be allergic to cinnamon .

Its based on salicylic acid instead of benzoyl peroxide , so it works better on blackheads instead of pimples , although it will also stimulate healing of pimples . Again , if you have an allergy to cinnamon , you should not use this product , but its one of just a few acne spot treatments that you can use to get rid of blackheads without popping or squeezing . <p> Unfortunately , there still be to a lot of problems with other Clean &amp; Clear products , especially if you have sensitive or oily skin .

If you wash your face and cleanse your face regularly and religiously , it may help a great deal to keep your skin clean and healthy , get rid of the acne and open pores so that your skin can breathe which would reduce acne and it also helps in undarken your blemishes caused because of the acne . <p> It is very important to keep your skin clean , scrub your skin regularly to get rid of the black and white heads . <p> This was the biggest piece of shit I 've used my whole life . I cant believe I actually spent money on this prouduct . I was trying to use it to lighten up some scarring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , woke up , and it was like all of those past pimples had resurrected , just without the pus , but I have around 30 bright , blood red dots ALL OVER my face now , it burns terribly , and no clue of what to do about it .

Acne and problem skin , however , require special solutions . The two types of skin that suffer the most acne problems are very fair and very dark . <h> Summary : <p> People who are endowed with naturally dry skin often have to deal with recurring bouts of skin inflammation and acne . <p> People who are endowed with naturally oily skin often have to deal with permanent skin pigmentation after acne outbreaks . <p> Dryness and oiliness are not limited to any particular skin tone ( fair skin can be oily and dark skin can be dry ) , but certain ethnic groups tend to have special skin problems . <p> Certain products are almost always helpful for acne on dry problem skin . <p> Certain practices are almost always harmful for acne on oily problem skin . <h> Acne and Problem-Prone Dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pimple-prone skin often suffer common acne , rosacea , eczema , or even all three skin problems . Dry , sensitive skin can be a source of irritation and embarrassment 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , and 365 days a year . <p> Probably you have heard the expression " Walk a mile in my shoes . " Well , no one who has any other skin type would want to spend a day in your skin . Every moment of every day , dry problem skin can cause never-ending distress . <p> Dealing with dryness the wrong way causes acne on problem-prone fair skin . The skin dries out , revealing a rough layer of red skin . It is only sensible to use a moisturizer to restore the normal color of the skin . The problem with using most moisturizers is that they contain alcohol , herb extracts , essential oils , fragrances , and perfumes that trigger an allergic reaction . The allergic reactions tighten the skin , trapping sebum inside pores , fueling the bacteria that cause acne . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair skin is to moisturize the right way . There is no downside to using a humidifier or a vaporizer if you live in a dry climate , whether the problem is desert heat or winter cold . Simply drinking 5 cups ( 1200 ml ) of water a day is enough to prevent dehydration . But choices in skin care products are not quite as straightforward . <p> Although dry skin problems are more common , say , in northern Sweden than in southern Italy , people of all ethnic origins and all skin colors can have sensitive dry skin . The nuances of your genetic heritage have a lot to do with your optimal choices in skin care products . <p> Hydroquinone peels , often used to remove acne blemishes , can cause permanent black pigmentation of the skin in many dry skin types . <p> So what is the solution for treating acne on dry skin ? More than anything else , effective acne care consists of hydrating , hydrating , and hydrating some more . The best moisturizers are simple products . If you are looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or jojoba oil . Do n't  avoid products that contain cholesterol , which is a natural moisturizer for your skin . Ceramides are helpful , too . <p> If you have dry skin , you need to use moisturizer at least 2 or 3 times a day , or even more . And beware of expensive products that contain fragrances . These can make your skin worse . <p> If you take care of moisture problems , then acne care is a lot easier , but acne care only works in the context of complete dry skin care . <p> After cleansing your skin , spray your skin with facial waters to hydrate . These are products made with water that is free of chlorine , which irritates the skin , and which contains selenium and/or sulfur , which " calms " the skin . Make sure the water does not evaporate before applying your moisturizer , or you wo n't get any benefit from the water spray . <p> Then treat any acne blemishes with a retinol cream . Retinol is a form of vitamin A that stimulates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming tight and trapping acne bacteria inside pores . <h> Acne and Problem-Prone Oily Skin <p> People who have problem-prone oily skin often suffer an endless cycle of blemishes , followed by brown spots , followed by more blemishes . The solution for problem-prone oily skin , however , is not to dry it out . <p> Probably the most bedeviling thing about acne on oily problem-prone skin is that reaching adulthood does not make the acne go away . In fact , it can get worse , especially in women . Taking birth control pills , or getting pregnant , can cause changes in estrogen and progesterone that increase oil production I the skin . <p> Pores get clogged and develop pimples . Pimples clear up but leave brown spots called melasma . The darker the skin tones , the darker the melasma . Products designed to clear up brown spots can leave permanent black spots if applied to the wrong skin types . Getting a grip on acne care , however , can break the cycle of acne , skin discoloration , and more acne . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufferers do n't  know about ? Heat ! Any kind of heat outside the body can cause inflammation inside the body . In acne sufferers who have sensitive , oily skin , body waxing , sunburns , and irritating skin care ingredients can cause brown spots to develop anywhere on the body . Anything that causes redness will cause " brownness " later on , and these brown spots can last longer than the pimples , sunburn , or contact irritants that preceded them . Months , years , or even decades longer , in fact . <p> What do people who have sensitive oily skin need to do to stop the cycle ? Here is a plan for stopping inflammation in oily skin . First , it is important to avoid situations that make acne worse . <p> Do n't  pluck facial hairs with tweezers . This can traumatize pores and cause acne . <p> Do n't  use hair removers , like Nair . This also causes acne and melasma . <p> Razors that deliver a close shave usually trigger acne on sensitive , oily skin . <p> Pomades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can cause inflammation that leads to baldness , in both men and women . <p> Sauna or steam baths can also trigger acne flare-ups . <p> Then it is important to treat acne-affected skin each every day . <p> Every morning , use a cleanser containing salicylic acid , which keeps pores open and clears up inflammation , the red spots that become brown spots . Use benzoyl peroxide rather than tea tree oil to treat active pimples . Tea tree oil contains essential oils that usually are helpful , but not for oily , sensitive skin . <p> Apply a moisturizer if you have " combination skin , " that is , if your ordinarily oily skin has been dried out by sun or heat . <p> Apply a sunscreen before you go outdoors . If you never get any sun without wearing sunblock , be sure to take vitamin D. <p> Some cleansers that contain salicylic acid include : <p> Burts Bees Natural Acne Care Purifying Gel Cleanser <p> Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Anti-Blemish Cleanser <p> Clear &amp; Clean Advantage Acne Cleanser <p> Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat them right away with a product like Eucerin Gentle Hydrating Cleanser or Topix Citrix Antioxidant Cleanser . And if you skin feels oily , try a toner like Josie Maran Argan Bear Naked Wipes or Paulas Choice Healthy Skin Refreshing Toner . <p> What should people with oily sensitive skin do about pimples ? Never , ever treat a pimple with a hot washcloth ! Ice cubes do n't  help , either . Its better to apply benzoyl peroxide and/or salicylic acid and just leave the pimple alone until it heals . The less the pimple is inflamed , the less brown pigmentation it will leave behind . <p> i used Retino-A 0.025% for 6 weeks at 1st with Clindamycin phosphate 0.1% and my acne were disappeared but soon after 2-3 mnths , the acne were back.again i used those drugs .

This method is expensive , is not covered by insurance , and cause permanent damage to your skin if you get an injection in the same pore a second time . <p> Pimples can be concealed with makeup " but if you are doing your own makeup , be sure you have practiced using concealer before prom night . <p> Benzoyl peroxide and tea tree oil can kill acne bacteria and get rid of redness and swelling of pimples , but you have to start them at least a week before your prom . <p> Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergencies before they start . <h> What Your Dermatologist Can Do for Prom Night <p> Dermatologists can inject a steroid directly into a pimple to shrink it for prom night . The needle is thinner than a pin you 'd in new clothes , and the injection does n't  hurt much at all . The steroid shrinks the pimple down to the contour of your skin and takes the red out . Youd still need to use concealer ( more about that in minute ) to make the pimple invisible , but the steroid injection can make hiding the pimple a lot easier . <p> There are two major downsides to this kind of emergency pimple treatment . One is that it is expensive . Each injection will probably cost US $60 to $125 . Because the injection is a cosmetic procedure , it will not be covered by insurance . You or your parents will have to pay cash . <p> The other downside to steroid shots for pimples is that it is a one-time fix . A second or third injection at the same site can cause permanent thinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spider veins . And when the skin heals , it may be pale compared to the rest of the skin on your face . Still , for a once-in-a-lifetime event , this might be a good option . Be sure to make arrangements at least a week in advance . <h> Using Concealer for Prom Night <p> Another pimple emergency tactic , that is a lot less expensive , is hiding your pimples with concealer . For this you will need at the very least a bottle of foundation makeup , yellow if you have fair skin or brown if you have darker skin . If you have fair , brown , or Asian skin , may also need a bottle of green concealer for your base . <p> Green does a great job of making the red of a pimple invisible on lighter skin . The problem with using green concealer is that you create green spots where you had red spots , and you need to conceal the concealer . You do this with one ( and only one ) layer of yellow or brown foundation makeup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup that they start to clump ( if you have dry skin ) or run ( if you have oily skin ) . You want just enough makeup to cover the pimple and no more . <p> The best way to make sure you are not using too much makeup is to apply it with a feather brush ( your own , not someone elses ) . Place a small lump of concealer on the back of your recently washed hand , and use your other hand to coat your feather brush with the product . Then use the brush to apply just a tiny amount of concealer over your pimple . Use your thumbs to spread the concealer evenly around your pimple , but be sure you do n't  squeeze the pimple . Then you would have an even bigger cosmetic problem to cover up . <p> It is best to practice using concealer before you are getting ready for the prom . Try wearing concealer all day to make sure you are using the right amount . And make sure you have the brown or yellow shade that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the prom . The only way to make the right choice of shade is to test several products and see how they work on your skin . You cant do this the afternoon before your prom . Plan ahead . <h> Spot Treatments for Pimples <p> Another tried and true method of treating pimple emergencies is with benzoyl peroxide gel used for spot treatments . Benzoyl peroxide kills acne bacteria in about 48 hours . Your skin then stops generating inflammation to kill the acne , and the pimple heals in about a week . The problem with benzoyl peroxide is that it is easy to use too much . <p> Benzoyl peroxide gels come in different strengths . A 2.5% gel wont irritate your skin , but it is not going to get rid of acne bacteria as fast as a 5% to 10% benzoyl peroxide gel . When the concentration of benzoyl peroxide is 5% or higher , however , there can be stinging , burning , itching , and peeling of your skin . So how can you be sure you get rid of your pimples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clearasil ( the cream that is n't tinted peach ) or Persa-Gel will knock out acne fast but they can cause irritation of your skin . If you have never used these products before , test just a small dot of the product on the skin of your forearm , leaving it there for at least 12 hours without washing . If that does n't  cause irritation , try the product on just one pimple . If that does n't  cause irritation , then the next day use it on all your pimples , but never spread it all over your face . <p> You have to start using these products about two weeks before the prom for them to remove most of your pimples . If you have a week or less , try Clearz-It Nano Hydra+ On-the-Spot Treatment Acne Medication . The advantage of this product is that it contains both benzoyl peroxide and tea tree oil . <p> Benzoyl peroxide just kills bacteria . Tea tree oil removes inflammation and redness . The combination of ingredients makes the product about twice as expensive , but it also improves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hints for prom night complexion care : <p> Do n't  rely on last-minute treatment with " zappers " that heat your skin . They may shrink a pimple , or they may enlarge it . You do n't  want to find out how the treatment turned out on the way to the prom . <p> Prom night might be one time to use Biore Deep Cleansing Strips , but do n't  pull the strip hard . These strips only remove the " black " in a blackhead , and only for a few days . They can cause as many problems as they solve , but they might be OK in an emergency . <p> Never use Biore Deep Cleansing Strips on a pimple . <p> At least a month before your prom , start using Exposed Skin Care . Over 98% of users report that it clears up their skin in 30 days or less , and all products come with a money-back guarantee . 19923 @qwx879923

Getting too much vitamin B6 , however , can actually make acne worse . <h> Summary : <p> Vitamin B6 is a vitamin you need every day . <p> It only takes a small amount of vitamin B6 every day to prevent acne , just 1.9 mg a day for women and 2.4 mg a day for men . <p> If you eat three servings of foods made with vitamin-fortified white flour , you get your daily recommended intake of of B6 . <p> If you live outside of North America , you probably do not get vitamins from white flour . For you , five servings of fruits or vegetables or regular consumption of organ meats is probably necessary . <p> Larger amounts of vitamin B6 can help treat premenstrual acne , especially in women who have short periods . Males and women who have passed menopause do not enjoy acne benefits from taking vitamin B6 . <h> What Is Vitamin B6 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of getting enough vitamin B6 ( also known as pyridoxine ) is preventing production of excess sebum . Vitamin B6 deficiency is relatively rare in North America , but when it happens , the skin can be literally coated with yellow , gooey , mucus-like sebum .

You do not maintain the benefits of vitamin B6 for preventing and treating acne unless you get some vitamin B6 in your diet every day . Because B6 is a water-soluble vitamin , you body can absorb a lot more B6 than it needs when you take high doses of supplements . The excess , however , is excreted into stool , saliva , and urine just two to four hours after you take it . Within 24 hours , almost nothing is left of the B6 ingested the previous day and it is necessary to take more . <p> In the United States and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make cereals and bread .

If oily skin is a problem , vitamin B6 supplementation is a good place to start . <h> How to Get Enough B6 to Keep Your Skin Healthy <p> When millers make white flour from whole grains , they take most of the vitamin B6 out of the grain along with the wheat germ . American flour makers put the B6 back in . Eating just two to three servings of store-bought baked goods every day helps North Americans avoid the deficiency that can cause oily skin acne , seborrhea , dandruff , intertrigo ( rashes in the folds of the skin ) , chapped lips , and conjunctivitis ( itching and inflammation under the eye lids ) . <p> If you have acne and you do n't  live in the United States or Canada , you best bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily easy to do this .

But if you are a picky eater , and you do n't  get vitamin B6 from fortified flour , it is not unusual for deficiency to occur . Even in the European Union , however , you can still get the low-dose vitamin B6 needed to help keep your skin clear . <h> Vitamin B6 Is Essential for Other B Vitamins to Work for Your Skin <p> Most of the B vitamins , including vitamin B6 , act as co-factors for enzymes .

You need about 100 mg a day if you are using B6 as part of your program for preventing kidney stones . You need 75 mg a day if you trying to boost brain function .

If you are , there is a relatively new technique for filling in scars ( as well as wrinkles ) your doctor can do for you known as revolumizing . But its not for everyone or every acne scar . Its best used when its used to correct the " problem behind the problem " we see as an acne scar . <h> What Is Revolumizing ? <p> The new " revolumizing " technique is nothing more than the injection of a called hyaluronic acid underneath acne scars . Hyaluronic acid is a building block of connective tissue throughout the body . Its the only chemical the body uses to make connective tissue that has to be formed outside cells . The molecule is so large that a cell ca n't make it inside and secrete it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only building block of connective tissue that is such a large molecule that it cant circulate through the bloodstream to other parts of the body where it is needed . This property makes it safe for injection into the skin . In the skin , hyaluronic acid modifies inflammation " allowing just enough inflammation for the skin to destroy bacteria and remove dead tissue . It also makes the skin more flexible and helps skin-building keratinocytes migrate underneath the skin to fill in thin or scarred- tissue . <p> You can find many high-end acne care products and skin care products that advertise hyaluronic acid as an ingredient . Do n't  buy them . Putting hyaluronic acid on your skin does attract humidity from the atmosphere and makes the skin look moist , but only until the next time you wash your face . Hyaluronic acid has to be injected , by a dermatologist , to correct acne scars permanently . <h> Using Hyaluronic Acid to Correct the Problem Behind the Problem <p> Its tempting for acne sufferers and their dermatologists alike to think of revolumizing as a technique similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a hole in the skin , and you fill it . The best results from revolumizing treatments , however , take into account that a scar does not have to be eliminated to become invisible . <p> For instance , suppose you have a nasty acne scar right at the fold between your nose and your cheek . It might seem like a good idea to zap the depression with a shot of Juvederm or some other hyaluronic preparation to plump out the skin . But your doctor might realize that injecting a smaller amount of hyaluronic acid in the cheek to the side of the scar might stretch out the skin so the scar is less visible . The doctor might make a similar injection on the other side of the face to restore the natural " upside down triangle " appearance of a smile at the same time as making the acne scar disappear , without injecting anything into the scar itself . <p> Another example of needing to correcting the problem behind the problem to make an acne scar invisible is a scar on the forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product into your forehead , you might find that tear troughs at your eyes or your upper cheeks are more noticeably wrinkled , even though the skin in those areas is not affected by the injection . Before filling in a scar on the forehead or temple , the dermatologist may need to strengthen the skin around the eyes or across the cheeks , even if there are no acne scars around the eyes or on the cheeks . <h> Do n't  Let Your Dermatologist Give You Lip <p> One area that dermatologists are often asked to enhance in acne patients is the lips . Many people have the idea that if they just get some additional volume in their lips , especially their upper lip , then any other imperfections in their faces will be less noticeable . That 's true , but you do n't  want your friends making comments behind your back that include references to your reminding them of the cartoon character Daffy Duck . <p> Its important that your dermatologist not give you so much filler that the lines in your lips disappear . That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back for more filler , but you cant have excess filler taken out . <h> Better Scar Care Can Be the Enemy of Good Scar Care <p> While treating acne scars around your nose often involves reinforcing the skin on your cheeks and nose , there are other areas of your face that the dermatologist will usually treat more directly . Acne scars on the sides of your face , for example , are usually treated directly , without attempts to alter the skin around them . And the rare acne scar on the nose itself can be a very delicate matter . <p> The dermatologist has to fill in a scar without making the slope of your nose unattractive . If you have a scar at the bridge of your nose , the dermatologist can only use a tiny amount of filler . An attractive nose begins to slope outward at about the same level as the upper eyelashes .

And the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal to do with whether you could have vascular complications , interfering with the flow of blood to your nose . Nobody wants to be a real-life " blue nose . " <h> You Do n't  Want Any Surprises at the Dermatologists Office <p> While many of us have been trained to accept whatever our doctors tell us , it is a good idea to ask questions at your dermatologists office . Know where you are getting injections before the doctor gives them to you . Make sure you understand why the doctor is injecting revolumizing filler where the doctor is injecting revolumizing filler . And be especially careful to ask about procedures involving your nose . <p> More is not necessarily better when it comes to filling in acne scars .

Cocoa in powder form can also act as a bit of an exfoliator and scrub away dead skin cells to smooth the skin . <p> Processing <p> When cocoa is in its rawest form , its at its highest level of potency . Processing cocoa into cocoa powder and chocolate can lessen the efficacy of this amazing little bean , but if done properly , there is still plenty of power left to greatly and positively affect the skin of both acne sufferers and clear skinned individuals alike . <p> Alternatively , when cocoa is not processed correctly , is over processed or is filled with ingredients such as milk fat or sugar to change the taste , cocoa can become quite benign .

But certain practices at your dermatologists office spell trouble . Here are five signs that your relationship with your dermatologist may turn into a rocky road and you may want to find another healthcare provider . <h> 1 . " Many of my patients have been coming to me for years . " <p> Back of the age of the kindly general practitioner , it was considered a mark of good medicine to have loyal patients who kept coming back to the same doctor whenever they needed any kind of medical treatment . But if you keep going to the same dermatologist for the same problem for years on end , it is probably worth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some kinds of skin conditions tend to recur .

If you have psoriasis , Sj+grens syndrome , or hand eczema , chances are that you will need to see your dermatologist for treatment from time to time for most of your life . <p> Acne , however , is almost never a life-long condition . Most teens eventually overcome mild to moderate common acne even if they do n't  get any treatment at all . Even the more difficult kinds of acne , such as psoriatic acne , acne conglobata , and acne keloidalis nuchae do n't  keep causing problems throughout the lifespan . If you have been going to your dermatologist for acne treatment for 10 , 20 , or 30 years , be sure you know why your condition is n't curable. <h> 2 . Your dermatologist is known for low-price procedures . <p> Nearly everyone is on the lookout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually does not pay for treatment of scars and skin discoloration caused by acne , it is sometimes tempting to go to the dermatologist you have heard offers the lowest prices . <p> Unless you are taking a trip to some cosmetic surgery vacation destination like Buenos Aires in Argentina or San Jose in Costa Rica , it is usually not a good idea to choose your doctor on the basis of price alone . Sometimes the best doctor for your needs charges more , and sometimes less . The important thing is to know what to expect from a procedure and to get the assurances you need that it has the greatest possible chances of working . <p> Then make a decision on whether you can find room in your budget for the doctors fees . If you cant , do n't  try to bargain with the doctor ( and absolutely do not make appointments for procedures you ca n't pay for ) . There will be some doctor somewhere who has the professional skills you need who charges a price you can afford . Just look for quality care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your dermatologist does n't  give you any " face time . " <p> Doctors who work for HMOs or who depend on Medicare , Medicaid , or insurance reimbursement are under incredibly pressure to see as many patients as possible . If your doctor only has five minutes to see you , its usually not because he or she does n't  care . Its because there are a certain number of patients that must be seen each and every day for the clinic to keep the lights on . <p> Dermatology , however , is a different kind of practice . At least in the United States , most dermatologists earn their income from fees they collect directly from their patients . Your dermatologist is not under as much time pressure as your general practitioner . And you do n't  want your cosmetic procedure to be rushed ! <p> Do n't  wear out your welcome with your dermatologist .

And suppose that you went to see a dermatologist about that scar and you were given an injection of a cosmetic filler . You were happy with the results , but you kept an appointment a year later for follow up . <p> If the dermatologist offers treatments for other cosmetic concerns , consider them . But if in this example you were told that maybe a little more filler to change the slope of your nose or some filler on the sides of your temples would make you look even better , exercise caution . Know the difference between offering other desirable services that perhaps now you can afford and pumping you for major bucks every time you walk in the door . <h> 5 . You just do n't  have a good feeling about your doctor . <p> Dermatology is not like some other medical specialties , for instance , brain surgery .

A strictly clinical description of tests , procedures , and results may indicate that the doctor does not understand the quirks and preferences that distinguish you from a " standard " patient " and is n't the whole point of cosmetic dermatology to bring out your unique good looks , not to make you look like a poor imitation of one of the " beautiful people .

How can you get rid of it in time ? Pimple emergencies happen to everyone who has acne . There are easier ways and harder ways to get rid of , or at least cover up , pimples before an important occasion . Let 's talk about the easier ways first . <h> Summary : <p> If a pimple pops up just before a big date , do n't  panic , but make sure you have the products on hand you need to cover it up . <p> Foundation makeup ( which guys can use , too ) covers a pimple in natural skin tones . A single layer of foundation is best if you have very oily or very dry skin . <p> Green makeup cancels out the redness of a pimple . Unless you want to go on your date with a green spot ( or spots ) on your face , however , you need a second layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can streak or clump . <p> Steroid injections from your dermatologist can take the red out of a pimple and shrink it fast .

Tea tree oil will , but the only kind of tea tree oil that will work overnight is pure tea tree oil dabbed on a pimple with a clean cotton swab . <h> Cosmetic Cover Ups <p> One of the easiest of all pimple emergency tactics before a date is a cosmetic cover up . You do n't  get rid of the pimple , but you make it invisible through the strategic use of makeup . <p> Pimples are red , and to disguise a pimple , you need both to hide the red color and to replace the red color with your natural skin tones . We see our skins as black , brown , red , yellow , or white , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or yellow . <p> Gray does n't  really look good on your skin . For that reason , the top layer of your emergency pimple cover up should be brownish or yellowish , but compatible with your unblemished skin . You will need to have bought foundation makeup in a tone that you can use all over your face before you start your emergency pimple coverup " so plan ahead . <p> And to cancel out the red of a pimple , many aestheticians will recommend green makeup . Unless you want to wear green spots on your date , you cover up your pimple with green makeup before you cover up the green with foundation makeup . But if you have oily skin , the green make streak , and if you have dry skin , the top layer may clump . That 's why its usually best to cover up your pimple with just a single layer of brownish or yellowish foundation makeup . Some people look OK when they where peach ( the color of Clearasil ) , but most will look better with just a single layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunk of makeup sitting on top of a zit . The best way to apply foundation makeup to coverup a pimple is with a clean feather brush . You put a pea-sized chunk of makeup on the back of your non-dominant hand ( your left hand if you are right-handed , or your right hand if you are left-handed ) , and then run the brush through the makeup lightly over and over again until it is just coated . <p> Then dot the makeup on the pimple to cover it . Spread makeup with clean fingers around the pimple so the edges are even . If you do n't  have a feather brush , you can apply makeup with your fingers directly to the pimple , but resist the temptation to squeeze . That 's all there is to it " but if you have never done a coverup before , you may want to practice the day before your big date . <p> A pimple coverup , or even several pimple coverups , wo n't cost you more than US $20 .

There is another , even easier way to deal with pimples before a big date . <h> Steroid Injections for Pimples <p> You can " let the air out " of a bulging pimple with steroid injections . These are legal steroid injections ( do n't  even think about using locker room steroids for treating acne since they will actually make acne much worse ) given to you by a dermatologist . The doctor injects a small amount of hydrocortisone or prednisolone into a pimple the day before your big event . The pimple flattens and fades , although you will still need to cover up the color with foundation makeup if you want to keep the pimple invisible . <p> The advantage of getting a shot for zit is that it is very quick and nearly painless . Its the only way to shrink a pimple quickly . But the downside is that each injection will costs $50 to $125 and doctors do n't  take insurance for this kind of treatment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zappers ? <p> Cosmetic coverups and steroid injections are the two reliable methods of emergency pimple treatment before a big date , but they are n't  the only methods around . <p> Various kinds of acne heat treatments are very popular for shrinking pimples . These " zit zappers " work by heating a pimple with a hot metal point or a jolt of electricity . The heat or electricity is enough to kill bacteria but not enough to injure the skin ( usually ) . <p> This method just might work if you have a week before your date . But if you need to look your best in 24 hours or less , you need to know that heat treatment devices may either shrink pimples or make them larger . You can wind up looking worse instead of better , and the $50 to $200 expense of the heat treatment unit is a big dent in most peoples entertainment budgets . <h> What About Spot Treatments ? <p> Another approach to managing pimples is spot treatment " but benzoyl peroxide wont work . The kind of spot treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 10% tea tree oil . It kills bacteria on contact and also stops the inflammatory process that enlarges a pimple and makes it look read .

It sometimes produces blisters that look like pimples , but its not caused by infection . Instead , phemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune condition that can result for hyperactivity of the immune system after dealing with a serious infection " including acne . Treatments that work for acne , however , wo n't work for pemphigus vulgaris . <h> What Is Pemphigus Vulgaris ? <p> Pemphigus vulgaris gets its name from the Greek word pimphex , meaning blister . It is an autoimmune disease that almost exclusively affects middle-aged people . Jews of German origin ( most Jews in the United States ) are much more likely than other groups to develop this skin condition than other groups . It is also relatively more frequent in people of Mediterranean descent . <p> Pemphigus vulgaris is almost unheard of children and teens and it is uncommon in the elderly . This condition usually occurs after some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medications in the angiotension receptor inhibitor ( ACE-inhibitor ) class , usually medications with names that end in -il , such as lisinopril or ramipril .

They tend to ooze and peel . They are easily detached . They can be as dangerous to health as severe burns , and 5 to 15% of people who develop pemphigus vulgaris die of the disease . <h> The Difference Between Pemphigus Vulgaris and Severe Acne <p> The blistering of the skin in the second stage of pemphigus vulgaris is sometimes mistaken for severe acne . Acne , however , never begins with mouth sores . Also , acne usually involves hardened plugs of dried sebum that clog pores . They are hard to remove . Pemphigus vulgaris is not limited to pores .

The most important therapies are designed to stop the immune systems attack on the skin . <h> Treatments for Pemphigus Vulgaris <p> The way pemphigus vulgaris destroys the skin is by releasing a specialized antibody . Instead of attacking a germ , this antibody attacks adhesion molecules . These molecules serve as the " glue " that keeps the keratinocytes that make collagen attached to the rest of the skin . Breaking down the naturally occurring adhesive that keeps these cells in place not only loosens the skin , it also deprives the skin of the collagen it needs to repair itself . <p> The way doctors fight this kind of antibody reaction is to try to shut the whole immune system down . They used to give pemphigus vulgaris patients chemotherapy drugs or gold treatments . They attempted to control the inflammation with steroids . Some doctors still use steroids , but people who have pemphigus vulgaris are more likely to be treated with a drug called dapsone ( which is also used in some cases of celiac disease ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antibody that causes skin tissue to break down . Dapsone costs about $5 a dose . Rituximab costs up to $500 a dose . However , even in the USA , both drugs are covered by insurance . <h> Supportive Therapies for Pemphigus Vulgaris <p> Natural medicine is never enough for recovery from pemphigus vulgaris , and the wrong natural treatments can do more harm than good . <p> Its especially important to avoid any herbal therapies that increase the bodys production of antibodies . People who have pemphigus vulgaris should never take echinacea , wild indigo ( baptisia ) , or any other immune stimulant herb . They also need to avoid any kind of treatment that breaks up the outermost layer of the skin . <p> Time and time again on this website we recommend the use of alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids , such as glycolic acid and salicylic acid , to break up dead skin and to stimulate the growth of collagen underneath the skin .

Is pemphigus vulgaris always fatal ? A. No , from 80 to 95% of people who get the disease recover from it . <p> Q. How long does it take to get over pemphigus vulgaris ? A. It usually takes about six months for your doctor to figure out the right combination of medications to control the blistering , and it usually takes about two years for the blisters to stop returning . <p> Q. Can I ever stop taking my medications on my own ? A. Absolutely not . Your meds may be keeping you in remission . Stopping them make cause blistering to resume very quickly . <p> Q. What can I do about the nausea the medications make me feel ? A. Try acupressure . Grab the webbing of the skin between your thumb and index finger and gently squeeze ( assuming its not blistered ) .

Tea tree oil has to be at least 10% strength to work . <p> Benzoyl peroxide kills acne in pimples , although it can temporarily make pimples even more noticeable .

Rubbing or isopropyl alcohol is great for dissolving fats in the skin , but the problem is , isopropyl alcohol is too good at removing fats from the skin . <p> A spot treatment that contains 45% alcohol will both break up hardened sebum and kill acne bacteria , but it will not open pores . That is because alcohol irritates the skin , and the skin repairs itself by producing even more sebum .

Tea tree oil has a number of advantages over other spot treatments . <p> Tea tree oil fights a range of bacteria that benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics do not , especially staph bacteria .

Just the scent of tea tree oil is not enough to do any good . The product has to be at least 10% tea tree oil to have any effect on acne bacteria . Even Australian-made tea tree oil products usually do n't  contain enough of the product to fight bacteria , although they may control redness . <p> That 's why pure tea tree oil is best . Dab a clean cotton swab that you use only once in tea tree oil , applying it directly to pimples twice a day .

It kills bacteria fast , and helps open pores . The problem with benzoyl peroxide is that most people experience inflammation , redness , peeling , or itching when they use a concentration of the product greater than 2.5% , and it takes about 10% benzoyl peroxide to zap acne bacteria on contact . <p> The solution is to use benzoyl peroxide gel just on pimples , not on the rest of your face . This way you can use a stronger product and get faster results . You need to be careful not to get the benzoyl peroxide gel in your hair . One of the byproducts of benzoyl peroxide is hydrogen peroxide , the same chemical that is used to bleach the hair . And you should not get benzoyl peroxide on your clothes , either .

BHA , or salicylic acid , is used to treat other acne blemishes , such as whiteheads and blackheads , especially on oily skin or dark-toned , black , brown , or Asian skin . BHA stands for beta-hydroxy acid . The only beta-hydroxy acid used in skin care is salicylic acid . <p> BHA helps break up dead skin that can clog pores , both in the pore and around it . It also helps break up sebum . AHAs ( alpha-hydroxy acids ) do the same thing , but BHA has an advantage in acne care that they do not . The BHA salicylic acid , which is chemically similar to aspirin , is a natural anti-inflammatory . BHA is much less likely to inflame the skin , because it soothes while it peels dead skin off the top layer of blemishes .

You will always need to be careful with any BHA product that actually works , especially around your eyes . <p> Some products contain both BHA and benzoyl peroxide .

The worst thing that can happen in the wake of a whitehead or blackhead is an enlarged pore , most of us have been taught . But new research finds that skin-scarring lesions can arise from non-inflammatory acne and even from clear skin . <p> Pimples and other forms of inflammatory acne play a major role in skin scarring , but a recent study concludes that a majority of acne scars do not arise from inflamed skin . <p> Dr. Sewon Kang , a research dermatologist and chairman of the department of dermatology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore whose work is partially funded by the skincare product make Galderma , made a 12-week study of the natural history of acne in 25 volunteers . He used computer-assisted spatial alignment and high-definition digital photographs to track acne outbreaks and skin damage leading to scarring . <p> Kangs 25 subjects collectively had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the help of the serial tracking system , Kang determined that 41% of pimples started as blackheads or whiteheads .

A little under 70% of scars were ice pick or indented scars , a little under 30% of scars were outward-protruding scars , and 2% of scars were what dermatologists call rolling scars . About 2/3 of the scars observed at the end of the study were not present at the beginning of the study , which suggests either that photographing the face causes acne scars ( which is not very likely ) or that many scars develop very quickly and resolve very quickly , in just matter of weeks . <p> Even smooth skin , however , can quickly become scarred . Dr. Kang suggests that this is a reason for very aggressive treatment of acne . <h> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth skin can become scarred by acne in just a matter of weeks , it may be a good idea to be very aggressive in keeping acne in check . Dr. Kang prescribes a combination of benzoyl peroxide to fight acne bacteria , antibiotics to get rid of the bacteria benzoyl peroxide does not kill , plus a retinoid like tretinoin topical to stimulate the production of collagen beneath the skin and to keep pores open . A combination of prescription medications , however , is not the only way to go . <p> We often recommend Exposed Skin Care products for the majority of cases of mild to moderate common acne . If you were to go with Exposed Skin Care or a system like it , here is what you would do : <p> You would keep your pores open with a clearing tonic , preferably one that contains green tea extract .

The cloth contains polyethylene fibers that wear away dead skin that clogs pores and keeps new skin from emerging between pores . The microdermabrasion scrub contains corundum crystals with just enough sharpness to lift dead skin from the surface to give the skin below more " give .

Vastly larger percentages of adults smoke in other countries where people are n't  exposed to anti-smoking rules and regulations each and every day every time they- go out in public . About 20% of American adults have acne " but they are n't  always the same people who smoke . And some countries that have high rates of smoking do n't  have high rates of smoking . <p> So , is it really possible that smoking causes acne ? Could quitting smoking put an end to acne ? Nothing in this article is intended to encourage you to smoke or to discourage from stopping smoking . We just want to provide a fair and balanced overview of the relationship between smoking and the worlds most common skin problem . <h> A Typical Pitch for Acne Products for Smokers <p> A typical pitch for a program for treating acne in smokers begins with the undisputed fact that many adults like to smoke . Cigarette smoke contains carbon dioxide , carbon monoxide , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of substances that are toxic to tissues all over the body . Menthol cigarettes are even more irritating than non-menthylated tobacco products . <p> Inhaling cigarette smoke creates a swoosh of toxic chemicals and tar that adhere to your lungs , your mouth , your nose , and your throat . The heart beats harder to force blood through blood vessels that tighten up in response to nicotine . Blood flow is redirected to the vital organs at the bodys core and away from the skin . Blood vessels in the skin are less able to deliver oxygen and nutrients and less able to remove skin irritants " so should n't this all cause acne ? <h> The Truth About Smoking and Acne <p> Oddly enough , reducing circulation to the skin , while its not a good thing , does not necessarily make acne worse . Acne is not caused by a deficiency of nutrients of oxygen . Non-inflammatory acne such as blackheads and whiteheads is caused by an accumulation and hardening of sebum in the neck of pores . Inflammatory acne is caused by the skins misdirected attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemicals known as chemotaxins that cause the inflammation triggers to attack healthy skin cells instead . Arguably , since most of the worst aspects of acne are the result of the skins hyperactivity , depriving the skin of oxygen and nutrients might , ironically , reduce the severity of acne . <p> Various studies have found that acne is more common among smokers than among non-smokers , especially among teens and young adults , but that hardly means that smoking causes acne . After all , 100% of smokers do n't  get acne . There is a known relationship , however , between smoking and a form of acne known as acne inversa . <h> What Is Acne Inversa ? <p> Acne inversa is a form of the disease we have n't discussed on the site before . This form of acne is called " inversa " because the blockage of the pore occurs from the top down rather than from the bottom up . The underlying cause of acne inversa is the too-rapid growth of skin at the very top of a hair follicle . The skin grows so fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pore . The sebum inside is not exposed to the air so it does not harden and it does oxidize and turn black , forming a blackhead . Pores may become inflamed and cause pimples , but they do not usually form cysts . <p> Also , acne inversa forms on what dermatologists call intertriginous skin , where two patches of skin touch each other . This kind of acne breaks out under the arms and between the cheeks of the buttocks and in personal areas one usually does not associate with acne , such as under the foreskin in men and in the vagina of women . <h> Who Gets Acne Inversa ? <p> In most of the world , from 0.3% to 4% of the population has acne inversa . It can start as as early as age 12 and continue throughout life . Its about 2-1/2 times more common in women than in men , and it is far more common in smokers and in people who are obese ( and whose folds of skin are more difficult to keep clean ) . Men who get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who get acne inversa usually get it in the armpits . The one thing that most people who have acne inversa have in common is a history of smoking . <h> Smoking and Acne Inversa <p> German researchers found that 87% of people who had acne inversa , at least in their study of 100 people , smoked cigarettes . Most of these smokers smoked about a pack ( 20 cigarettes ) a day , men on average 24 cigarettes a day , women on average 21 cigarettes a day . Most of them started smoking before they developed acne inversa , on average 12 years before the onset of the disease . <p> Acne bacteria were present in the pimples and whiteheads caused by acne inversa , but only in small numbers . Researchers conclude that acne inversa does not result from an infection , and that plug of sebum at the top of the pore in acne inversa only traps the small number of bacteria that are normally present in a pore . <p> Acne inversa , however , turns out to be the only form of acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicotine stimulates certain skin cells in much the same way that it stimulates the brain , and it helps those skin cells avoid a process known as apoptosis , or cellular suicide . Smoking may kill tissues in the lungs , but it makes certain skin cells in the buttocks , arm pits , and genitals essentially immortal " clogging pores in inconvenient places until the constant stimulation with nicotine is stopped . <p> If you have the everyday form of acne known as acne vulgaris or even if you have rosacea , keloidal acne , or acne fulminans , stopping smoking may not make a big difference in your complexion . But if you have acne inversa , stopping smoking may be what you need to do to get rid of the condition for good . 19923 @qwx879923

@@98778629 @2978629/ <h> Treating Acne in Dark-Skinned People 19922 @qwx879922 <p> People with darker skin tones experience discoloration , since the skin produces more melanin as it heals , in order to fight inflammation . <p> If there is anything that can be said about most acne treatments , it is that they are designed for people with fair dry skin who have more of a problem with pimples than with whiteheads , blackheads , cysts , or rosacea . In other words , most acne treatments are designed for white people . Dermatologists in the United States and Canada , however , are becoming increasingly sensitive to the special needs for skin care designed for people of color . <h> What 's Different About Dark Skin ? <p> The most common skin condition for people of all races and all skin tones is acne . The results of acne are very different on darker skin . Most people who have fair skin are more concerned with pimples that may remain on the skin for a few days to a few weeks . Most people who more richly toned skin are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can last for a few months to a few years . <p> The reason dark skin gets darker when pimples heal is the way the skin responds to inflammation . The process of inflammation is activated by free radicals of oxygen . The melanin pigment in skin absorbs free radicals of oxygen .

Their skins may heal faster , but they also produce spots that are much more noticeably darker than surrounding skin . Fighting acne inflammation with products that use inflammation to kill bacteria can cause long-term problems on dark skin . <h> When Skin Lighteners Darken the Skin <p> People who have deep golden skin tones associated with Asian skin , especially people of East Asian descent , have other skin issues . Some East Asians lack a gene that codes the protein that creates an enzyme that recycles the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine in the skin and connective tissue .

Some of the environmental pollutants that cause some of the worst problems are benzene and phenol . Cosmetic disasters are most likely to occur when people who have Asian skin tones and who lack the genes for the enzyme use hydroquinone to remove brown spots and then are exposed to vapors from oil refineries . The combination of genetics and chemical exposure can be extremely difficult to correct . <h> Other Problems with Dark Skin <p> People of Asian , African , Middle Eastern , Native American , Pacific Islander , and Latin American descent are prone to other skin issues . Sometimes the problem is diagnosis . The textbook image or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackhead , pimple , papule , pustule , or cyst on white skin may not be very helpful in recognizing the same kind of blemish on colored skin . <p> Other times the problem is choice of treatment .

Techniques that are safe on fair skin can make beauty issues on darker skin . <p> And another issue is that scarring does not always take place in the same way on different types of skin . People who have fair , white skin tend to develop long-lasting scars after they have pimples . Even scars can develop new scars on fair skin . <p> People who have darker skin sometimes develop acne scars where acne was not visible at all . Blackheads , whiteheads , and unblemished skin can all be followed by acne scars , but these scars may resolve themselves more quickly than on fair skin . <h> Dark Skin Dermatology in the USA <p> Some states of the USA , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other states , such as California and Hawaii , will be non-white by 2020 .

If you have fair skin , do n't  worry about being left out just yet . The overwhelming majority of acne products are still designed to work best on pimples on white skin .

Acne does n't  just come at very time parents want their newborn to be at his or her most photogenic , it also comes at about the same time that baby becomes colicky , gassy , fussy , and keeps them up all night . But at least infant acne is not a sign of a more serious health issue for the child . <h> What Is Baby Acne ? <p> Baby acne usually causes whiteheads and pimples on the childs forehead and chin .

Baby acne occurs in all races and on all skin types . Acne in infants is more common for certain skin types than others . If you have one child who has acne as an infant , there 's a good chance your next child will develop acne as an infant , too . This does not mean , however , that they will have more severe acne ( or less severe acne ) when they are teenagers . <h> What Can You Do About Baby Acne ? <p> When it comes to skin care , babies are not smaller versions of teens and adults .

This means making sure you wipe your childs face after feeding , and you give your baby a regular bath . And since most new parents are n't  quite sure what to do when they have their first child , here is the knowledge you need to give your baby an anti-acne bath ( which is the same technique you would use if your child does not have acne ) . <h> Bathing Baby <p> Babys bodies do n't  generate a lot of heat , and they are too small to hold a lot of heat .

Then lay out everything you will need for your babys bath . You need to a basin to hold baby and bath water , preferably with back support for the child . You will need warm water , at about room temperature . Baby will need a fresh diaper , fresh clothes . Anything you need for a diaper change you will also need for the bath . <p> The wash cloth should be soft , not rough .

If somehow your baby managed to get genuinely dirty , then you might consider Burts Bees Baby Bee Buttermilk Soap or maybe- Free and Clear Liquid Cleanser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product that is abrasive , sudsy ( large bubbles damage delicate skin ) , or scented . Remove babys clothing but not the diaper . <h> Safety for Babys Bath <p> Bathing your baby requires two hands .

Its important to wash little girls in a motion from front to back to prevent bladder infections . Do n't  worry about vaginal discharge in girls and circumcision scabs in boys . Leave them alone and allow them to fall off naturally . When the bath is done , take the baby out and get ready to dry off . <p> Probably you know the rhyme , " Pat a cake , pat a cake , bakers man .

@@98778632 @2978632/ <h> What You Can Do About Cystic Acne 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Cystic acne is the kind of acne that forms large bumpy knots that lodge deep in the skin . In cystic acne , an inflamed pore becomes completely covered by tough pink skin so that it can not drain , but instead grows larger and larger until it is eventually opened by lancing , surgery , or medical treatment of the skin . <h> Summary : <p> Cystic acne encapsulates infection inside the skin . <p> Cystic acne is most common in young adults , aged 20 to 22 , who did not have serious acne as teenagers . <p> Cystic acne is most common on brown skin . <p> Cystic acne is a really bad form of acne vulgaris , also known as common acne . Acne keloidalis nuchae involves cysts that form over ingrown hairs , usually on the scalp and neck , and acne conglobata is characterized by pimples that seem to burrow together . Cystic acne does not involve either phenomenon . <p> Its better to prevent cystic acne than to treat it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that contain polyethylene beads or salicylic acid . <p> You can try to treat cystic acne with tretinoin topical on your own , but you will probably get better and faster results from medical treatment . <h> How Cystic Acne Develops <p> Why do some people get pimples while others get cysts ? The answer seems to be that people who have the healthiest growing skin are actually more likely to get cysts instead of pimples . <p> Many teens have skin that grows so dynamically that pores never get clogged . The skin stays flexible and soft so that dead skin cells do n't  accumulate at the top of pores trapping sebum and bacteria beneath them " until they reach the age of 20 or 22 . <p> In early adulthood , skin growth begins to slow down . The skin does not naturally keep pores open , so tiny flakes of dry dead skin can begin to accumulate in pores . This creates a pool of sebum and acne bacteria underneath a cap of matted dead skin , too small to see with the naked eye . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing fast enough to keep a pore open , but it is growing fast enough to close over the pore . The pore becomes a cyst . The immune system detects the bacteria in the cyst and releases substances known as defensins to initiate a series of events that would destroy them with inflammation . The bacteria , however , release chemotactins that redirect inflammation away from them to the encapsulated skin tissue surrounding them . <p> The mass of inflamed tissue around the bacteria in effect protects them from competition from the other microorganisms they would normally encounter on the skin . Cysts grow larger and larger as the immune system releases more and more inflammatory chemicals , always fighting the bacteria but never removing them from the skin . <h> Who Is Most Likely to Get Cystic Acne ? <p> People who have brown skin are more likely to get cystic acne than people who have white , black , or Asian skin . They may have hormone imbalances or they may undergo stress , but hormonal fluctuation and stress have less to do with cystic acne than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cystic acne usually does not involve follicles that support the growth of visible hairs . There is a condition more common in men ( primarily ) and women ( occasionally ) who have black skin known as acne keloidalis nuchae , in which tough pink skin grows over an ingrown hair . <p> Cystic acne is a different problem with different treatment . Its a condition that is most likely to strike people who have brown skin when their facial features stop growing and their skin stops growing as fast . It is primarily a problem on facial skin , but it can also form on the back , shoulders , and chest in people who do vigorous physical labor or sweaty exercise . <h> Preventing Cystic Acne <p> Cystic acne is not caused by oily skin . It is caused by drying of the skin inside pores . People who are very careful to use soap and showers to remove excess oil from the skin can get cystic acne because they cleanse their faces and bathe their bodies too frequently with drying soaps and cleansers . <p> Cystic acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own soap from wood ashes and lard . Anything abrasive or caustic in a soap can dry the skin so that it clogs pores leaving them vulnerable to infection and formation of cysts . And unless you have visible dirt or grease on your skin , you should not rub it with a wash cloth , and then only gently . <p> The kinds of cleansers that work best on brown skin prone to cystic acne are those that contain a combination of cleanser and salicylic acid or polyethylene beads that lift and separate dead skin from the lining of pores before they are clogged . Some easy-to-find products that work include : <p> Olay Definity Pore Redefining Scrub , US $10.49 for 5 fluid ounces/150 ml . This product contains tiny polyethylene beads that bounce around in the bubbles made by the foam .

Use the 1% lotion if you have sensitive skin or if you have never tried the product before , and graduate to the 2% lotion if you do n't  have any negative reactions to the 1% product . This product also stimulates the growth of new skin so that your pores are more likely to stay open even on the days you do n't  use the product .

They do n't  do anything to treat existing cysts . <h> What Can You Do About Existing Cystic Acne ? <p> Until recently , there was not a lot you could do on your own to treat cystic acne . It has recently become possible to buy topical tretinoin ( Retin-A ) creams and gels over the counter . These products stimulate the growth of the skin so that the skin opens up over a cyst and let 's it drain , without lancing or surgery .

This is also the chemical that you get in high-dose vitamin D in the United States . <p> The human body can use vitamin D2 , but it makes yet another chemical , cholecalciferol , which is known as vitamin D3 . Vitamin D3 is the form of vitamin D ready-made for use in the body . And the human body makes vitamin D3 out of cholesterol . If you do n't  have enough cholesterol , your body ca n't make enough vitamin D3 . <p> Cholesterol is essential for the health of absolutely every cell in the human body . Cells use cholesterol in the process making the outer membrane that prevents their dissolving into the watery plasma of the bloodstream . The basal cell layer of the skin , which generates new skin , converts cholesterol into 7-dehydrocholesterol . When UV-B rays of sunlight ( which are the same rays that cause skin cancer ) fall on 7-dehydrocholesterol , the skin converts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes actual vitamin D3 after it is attached to a carrier protein and sent to the liver . The liver assembles chunks of the vitamin D3 molecule from the molecules of the pre-vitamin and sends them all over the body on another carrier molecule . Some of the pre-vitamin D3 made in the skin returns to the skin . <p> Ironically , UV light stimulates the production of vitamin D in the skin and vitamin D returning to the skin from the liver protects the skin from cancer development . Vitamin D helps regulate the process through which skin cells multiply and slows down the growth of skin cancer long enough for the immune system to keep it in check . And vitamin D also helps fight skin infection . <h> Vitamin D and Infections of the Skin <p> Vitamin D activates a kind of white blood cells known as the macrophages . These white blood cells are unusually large cells that are so large that they sometimes have multiple nuclei with multiple copies of the DNA needed to code the proteins that keep the cell going . They crawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells , excessive cholesterol , and infectious microorganisms . When they encounter cellular debris , cholesterol deposits , or germs , they flow around the harmful matter and engulf it , digesting it and transforming it back into nutrients that actually feed the body . <p> Macrophages are stimulated by vitamin D. In the skin , this means they get " hungrier " for acne bacteria , which they attack directly rather than by sending out inflammatory chemicals . This is a very useful characteristic for fighting acne bacteria . Other white blood cells attempt to kill acne bacteria by generating inflammation . The bacteria can release decoy proteins that cause the inflammation actually to destroy the skin itself . That is what causes the redness and inflammation of pimples . Macrophages activated by vitamin do n't  send out inflammatory chemicals . Instead , they attack the bacteria head on and wipe them out without a trace , whether or not the bacteria send out decoy chemicals . <p> For hundreds of years , folk healers assumed that the sun could " dry out " acne and that more sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin actually makes acne worse and that excessive exposure to sunlight can cause skin cancer . Its still important , however , to get some sun exposure to make the vitamin D that helps keep acne bacteria in check . <p> When you are getting sun so your skin can make vitamin D , its absolutely essential not to use sun screen . Even SPF 8 sunblock can eliminate 98% of the vitamin D production of your skin . You have to get some exposure to UV-B rays for your skin to make the vitamin , but not so much exposure that you burn your skin and set up a series of reactions that can lead to actinic keratosis , basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , or melanoma . <p> That is why it is best to : <p> Get your sun exposure in the morning before 10 am . <p> Limit sun exposure to 20 minutes , and , once again , <p> Be sure not to use sun block or sunscreen while sunning for vitamin D. <p> The more skin that is exposed , the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you only get sun on your face and hands , you need sun every day . If you sun au naturel , once a week is sufficient . <p> Not everyone , of course , can always get sunshine for making vitamin D. If that is your situation , you can take vitamin D supplements . Vitamin D3 is preferable . At least 1000 IU per day and up to 5000 IU per day of vitamin D3 is useful . It is possible to take so much vitamin D that your skin becomes sensitive to sun " but that almost never occurs unless someone has been taking 50,000 IU per day for longer than 4 weeks . Do n't  overdo it . <p> Its hard to get vitamin D from food . Cod liver oil is a great source of vitamin D , but its easy to get too much vitamin A from cod liver oil . Never take more than 1 tablespoon ( 15 ml ) per day . Mushrooms and leafy greens contain small amounts of vitamin D , but to get even 1000 IU per day you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like spinach . They are fine for other nutrients , but get your vitamin D from sun or supplements . <p> Im have acne problem in my skin on my face about 3 months but i 'm not good until now The result of my test ( 25-OH-VITAMIN D ) is 6.5 ng/ml please help me and tack me usefull advise for my problem . i want use Roaccutane but i afraid of inside effect of use . 19923 @qwx879923

Here are ten homemade acne remedies that you probably have never tried before " and they are all safe and soothing for your skin . <p> Diet drinks do n't  have calories or sugar , but they can play havoc with the probiotic bacteria in the colon . These friendly bugs are useful in managing acne by virtue of their role in " training " the immune system . The immune system learns that bacteria in the colon do n't  have to be attacked with inflammation , and transfers that lesson to the skin , where it responds to acne bacteria with less inflammation . Sugar-free soft drinks raise the pH of the intestines and make the environment less friendly to friendly bacteria , and they also have to be detoxified with liver enzymes that activate some acne medications. <h> 2 . Take probiotics , especially if you take antibiotics . <p> Antibiotics do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibiotic bacteria . You can restore probiotic bacteria by eating yogurt with active cultures ( in the USA , Activia , Stonyfield Farms , or Yakut ) , but its better to take a probiotic supplement . Probiotic supplements are encapsulated to protect the bacteria from passage through the digestive tract . There is a good probiotic product from Exposed Skin Care , or you may want to take Culturelle or Florastor. <h> 3 . Try J. R. Watkins Red Clover Salve for rosacea . <p> Red clover contains natural coumadins that slightly increase circulation in the skin . Red clover salve applied to rosacea-prone skin keeps circulation moving through the skin so that changes in temperature do not cause big changes in circulation . This makes capillaries just under the skin less likely to break or leak , so that there is less redness and fewer purple broken veins on the face . J. R. Watkins Red Clover Salve is available online . <h> 4 . If you have a problem with discoloration of the skin after pimples heal , try soy . <p> When skin heals after acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dissolve packets of pigment in the skin . The melanin pigment in these melanosomes relieves inflammation and helps the skin begin the process of healing . It also leaves the skin darker . <p> Soy contains a protease inhibitor that blocks the enzyme that breaks up the packets of pigment . Eating soy while acne is healing will reduce discoloration and spotting later . It only takes a small amount of soy each day to make a difference " as little as 1/2 oz ( 14 grams ) of tofu or a dozen edamame a day is enough . <h> 5 . If you have trouble getting up in the morning , drink Earl Grey tea . <p> The distinctive flavor and aroma of Earl Grey tea comes from bergamot , a kind of dried citrus added to the tea . Bergamot oil in cosmetics and acne care treatments can irritate your skin , but bergamot in Earl Grey tea can help calm your skin " if you drink it in the morning . Drinking Earl Grey tea in the afternoon or evening does not have this effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for school or work may feel better and look better if they drink Earl Grey tea . <h> 6 . Make you own facial mask with pure bentonite clay . <p> You can buy ready-made facial masks for as much as US $79.99 . You can buy a package of bentonite clay for as little as US $3.99 . Add warm water to bentonite until you have a slightly slippery consistency of clay . Apply the clay to your face and let it dry . Then take a warm shower , removing the clay mask with the help of a soft washcloth . Using just the clay with no additional ingredients may actually do more for your skin than using a prepared facial mask that contains alcohol , menthol , or witch hazel extract , all of which can irritate and dry your skin . <h> 7 . Use essential oil of chamomile in aromatherapy . <p> Chamomile soothes inflammation . It stops allergies . You can get these benefits by drinking chamomile tea .

Hold your face over the bowl with towels draped over your head to capture the vapor . As you feel relaxed , your skin will be more relaxed , and less likely to break out . <h> 8 . Treat itchy acne with camphor or Campho-Phenique . <p> Camphor is a herbal skin remedy that acts as a counter-irritant . It causes just a little burning so you do n't  notice itching . Of course , overdoing camphor can cause problems of its own . <p> Camphor is not a good idea for everyday skin care .

These healthy juices also take the pain out of acne or impetigo " although you will need to use other treatments to help your skin heal . If you do n't  care for the juices , try holding a damp tea bag to affected skin , and then throw the tea bag away . <h> 10 . Stay out of the sun . <p> You cant dry up acne by spending time in the sun , but you can dry up your skin . The linings of pores shed tiny flakes of skin over sebaceous oil and bacteria . Getting a suntan or , worse , a sunburn , can cause even worse acne 2 to 4 weeks after you spend time in the sun . Staying out of the sun , or using sunscreen , can reduce your problems with acne. 19923 @qwx879923

Your dermatologist , however , may have a different perspective on the subject . Chances are that your skin doctor will regard the task of treating acne scars as a matter of concealing a scar that will always be there , making it invisible but not even trying to remove it . <p> Understanding the doctors perspective on scar treatment helps you establish reasonable expectations of acne scar treatment . And if you have a good grip on the likely outcomes of a medical procedure , you can make an informed choice between medical treatments , cosmetic coverups , or even accepting acne scars as part of your faces life story . <h> Skin That Heals Easily and Skin That Does Not <p> Acne scars heal in different ways in different places on the body . In the unlikely event you were to get a pimple right on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably be very uncomfortable until it healed but you are not likely to have a lasting scar . On the other hand , acne on the chest often leaves scars , as do skin infections on the lower legs . <p> There are also skin types that tend to form noticeable , raised , pink hypertrophic scars as acne heals . The ethnic group most commonly afflicted with this unfavorable genetics of scarring is Irish . Men of African or Hispanic descent often develop this kind of scar when they have acne keloidalis nuchae , which forms around ingrown hairs . <h> Favorable Scars and Unfavorable Scars <p> Doctors also assess the potential for a good cosmetic result from dermabrasion or laser ablation on the basis of favorability and unfavorability of scars . What makes a scar favorable or unfavorable ? <p> Flat scars are more easily concealed with makeup and are considered to be favorable . Raised scars leave a shadow even when they are covered by makeup and are considered to be unfavorable . <p> Scars in the lines and creases between facial features are easier to conceal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks and forehead are readily visible and are considered to be unfavorable . <p> Scars are less visible on loose or relaxed skin . Scars are more visible on tight skin . <p> Irregular scars are less visible than regular scars . The rounder the acne scar , the more unfavorable it is for treatment . <p> Older scars are less visible than newer scars . Redness fades with time , unless excessive sun exposure and sunburn keep reactivating the inflammatory process . Older scars are more favorable for revision than newer scars . <p> The more favorable characteristics the dermatologist can see in the scar , the more likely you are to receive a recommendation for treatment . But do n't  just take your dermatologists word on whether an acne scar is easily or not-so-easily healed . It can take up to a year to recover form the procedures doctors use to treat acne scars . If you know you have a wedding or another important event coming up , you will want to let your dermatologist know so you and your doctor can assess whether acne scar treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look your best . The doctor usually can change a scar from " less favorable " to " more favorable " but that requires scalpel-and-suture surgery , not laser ablation or dermabrasion or a chemical peel . <h> Getting Good Results from Surgery on Acne Scars <p> Surgery can work wonders on acne scars , but the dermatologists work can be wasted if you are not extremely careful with follow-up care at home . When the doctor cuts out a scar and stitches your skin shut , the sutures will be placed below the skin to keep the wound shut . Any visible stitches are there to hold your skin together so it can grow evenly , not to keep the wound from opening . And to encourage the skin to grow back together , it is your job to follow your doctors directions and apply layered , tensionless bandages over the area of treated skin . <p> Basically , its very , very important to change bandages just as often as you are instructed , and to place them in right spot each and every time . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little farther away from the treated scar , you create pressure on healing skin . Wounds that are kept under pressure develop new scar tissue " usually an outward facing pink scar where you have an indented , colorless acne scar . To prevent this result , you absolutely , positively must be meticulous about taking care of your surgical wound after you are sent home from the dermatologists office . <p> After the surgical wound begins to heal , your doctor may ask you to use silicone sheets or silicone gels to keep an outward-facing , pink scar from developing where you had the acne scar removed . Silicone sheets can be worn 24 hours a day or just at night . Silicone gel is applied to the skin and allied to dry to " pucker " over the scar and keep scar tissue from rising . It may be necessary to use silicone sheets or silicone gel for several months to keep scars from rising . <p> And just because you get surgery does n't  mean your dermatologist wont also want to use laser acne scar treatment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scars . Non-ablative lasers , that is , lasers that do not remove layers of skin , such as Fraxel , are used to smooth out the edges of scars to make them less noticeable .

@@98778637 @2978637/ <h> Noxzema Acne Treatments Reviewed 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Unfortunately none of Noxemas acne products deliver what they promise . <p> Along with the makers of Clearasil , the makers of Noxzema ( sometimes misspelled Noxema ) skin care products are the dominant forces in low-cost acne skin care . The problem with Noxzema is that its acne products just do n't  work for any but the oiliest allergy-free skin . <h> Summary : <p> The distinctive pleasant smell of Noxzema products is from a mixture of camphor , eucalyptus oil , and menthol , antibacterial ingredients that can irritate the skin . <p> No Noxzema product offers sun protection . <p> Unfortunately , none of the Noxzema acne or blackhead products work as advertised . <h> What 's Wrong with Noxzema ? <p> Almost all Noxzema products contain camphor , eucalyptus oil , and menthol . These ingredients are practically a trademark for the company . You open the jar or squeeze the tube and you instantly know its Noxzema . <p> The problem with these ingredients is that they irritate the skin . Camphor is an aromatic substance made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cinnamon . Applied to the skin , it dilates blood vessels and produces a cooling effect . The additional blood flow to the skin , however , makes pimples redder and can trigger rosacea attacks in people who have this form of acne . <p> Eucalyptus oil is the ingredient in Halls Eucalyptus Cough Drops . Its used in vaporizers when babies get colds . Extracted from the bark of eucalyptus trees , this oil can stimulate the skin to produce ceramides , the fat-like compounds that protect it from moisture . Of course , if you are trying to get rid of fat-like oils from your pores , you really do n't  want to apply a product that stimulates your skin to produce other fat-like oils and seals them in . In rare cases , a strong odor of eucalyptus oil has been known to induce seizures . <p> Menthol cools the skin . It also dissolves salicylic acid , the active ingredient in aspirin , and a compound that breaks up plugs of hardened skin oils in pores on oily skin . Used without salicylic acid ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration and at the right pH to do any good ) , however , menthol just creates a tingle in the skin that turns into a itch in the skin , as it kills healthy cells around pores . Like the other Noxzema ingredients , menthol used in the wrong way only makes skin problems worse . Now let 's look at the bestselling Noxzema acne products one by one . <h> Noxzema Anti-Bacterial Foaming Cleanser <p> This skin cleanser could be fairly rated " not all that bad " for very oily skin . It fights bacterial infection with the ingredient triclosan , and it contains a potassium hydroxide cleanser that can help break up plugs of sebum hardened in pores . The problem with this cleanser is that it contains so much potassium hydroxide that it can dry out and tighten all but the oiliest skin , creating about as many whiteheads as it removes . Of course , from a marketing standpoint , this is a great characteristic " it keeps customers coming back for more ! <h> Noxzema Anti-Blemish Astringent <p> This toner tightens the skin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It leaves the skin feeling fresh and cool . It fights acne-causing bacteria . <p> So what 's not to love about Noxzema Anti-Blemish Astringent ? The alcohol in this product can actually cause more blemishes ! When you dry out your skin with alcohol , it protects itself by producing more oil . <h> Noxzema Anti-Blemish Pads <p> The box of Noxzema Anti-Blemish Pads looks like a real bargain . At a Dollar Store , you might get a box of 65 pads for as little as US $2.99 . Even at regular retailers , the suggested retail price is just $4.49 , or less than $0.07 a pad . <p> The problem with these pads is the same as with the Anti-Blemish Astringent . The pads contain a mixture of alcohol , camphor , eucalyptus oil , and menthol . The alcohol both removes oil from the skin and stimulates the skin to create more , ensuring that you always need to use the pads . <h> Noxzema Blackhead Cleanser <p> This blackhead cleanser may actually help remove blackheads on loose , oily skin . It contains tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and it contains 2% salicylic acid , which helps strip away the fats that hold dead skin cells to the surface and that plug pores . The problem with this and many similar cleansers is that you rinse away the helpful ingredients almost as soon as you put them on your face . As a cleanser , this product does not stay in contact with the skin long enough to break up blackheads . <h> Noxzema Original Deep Cleansing Cream <p> If you are an American over the age of 50 , you probably can remember a time when the blue jar of Noxzema cleansing cream was the only product many stores carried for acne treatment . Now also available in a jar with a pump , this product was the mainstay of anti-acne skin care . The cream used to be made with lye , just to make sure it got all the dirt off your face . Phenol was added to make sure it stayed fresh " and you could be sure the bacteria off your fingers met sudden death when you dipped your fingers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lye or phenol . You cant use it to strip wax off your floors , or to prime outdoor surfaces for painting . However , the eucalyptus , menthol , and camphor that cause problems with almost all Noxzema products are still in the cleansing cream , and if you have sensitive skin , you really should avoid it . People who have especially resistant ( non-sensitive ) oily skin may be OK after using Noxzema , but there are better options . <p> The appeal of Noxzema skin care products is that they smell good and they do n't  cost very much . If you can spend just a few dollars more , however , you can treat your acne with a complete skin care system like Exposed Skin Care . You may spend a few more dollars upfront , but you wont be perpetuating your acne care problems . You just might get rid of acne for good with Exposed Skin Care .

A recent survey of American skin care product consumers commissioned by Prevention magazine came up with some numbers .

Only 16% said they stopped using any skin care products at all . <p> When it comes to acne skin repair , American women report they want to get rid of acne blemishes and discolored skin and they want to get rid of them now . Most women in the survey say they would prefer to get instant results from one-time use of a product " and who would n't ?

Age Reverse is a combination of antioxidants , retinol ( vitamin A ) , peptides , polyhydroxy acids , and proprietary ingredient the company calls Neoglucosamine , designed to rejuvenate aging and acne-prone skin . <p> Neostrata recommends that women use Age Reverse twice a day . After the companys clinical trials of the formula , researchers announced that 100% of women using the product " improved appearance " after 12 weeks . In the company-sponsored study , 96% of users reporter plumper skin , 94% reported firmer skin , and 92% reported fading of acne-related and sun-related age spots . <p> Can we believe the claims ? <p> At US $60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reverse products are a little pricey , but they actually do work . The polyhydroxy acids and glycolic acid are in the right amounts and at the right pH to remove dead and brown skin . This lightens and smooths the complexion and removes acne spots . It may even cause small acne scars to fade . The biggest drawback to this product is that there are products for as little as $7.49 , such as Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Facial Cleanser , that work just as well for women who have adult acne . <h> Neocutis Biocream <p> For a lot more money , women who want to restore acne-damaged skin could try Neocutis Biocream , which usually retails for about US $135 for 1.69 fluid ounces/50 ml . This skin restorer is made with PSP , which is the manufacturers proprietary " processed skin cell proteins " taken from aborted human fetuses . <p> That is , glycolic acid and salicylic acid rejuvenate the skin when they are at the right pH .

But the ingredients in this product that actually work on your skin are available in several dozen other products that cost just $10 to $20 in more generously sized containers . <h> Sirtuins for Stopping Skin Aging <p> Chances are that you have heard of the antioxidant resveratrol . Its found in red grapes and in red wine in very small amounts , but most of the resveratrol used to make supplements is actually extracted from a plant known as Chinese polygonum , or knotweed . <p> In laboratory tests , resveratrol promises to be a cure-all for diseases ranging from acne to cancer .

Dior Capture Total advertises its resveratrol products as sirtuins , chemicals that activate genes in the skin . Sirtuins in fact do activate genes in the skin , but there 's no evidence that the resveratrol in Dior products can be absorbed through the skin . And at $135 per fluid ounce/30 ml , one might want to have at least a little proof that Capture Totale Multi-Perfection Concentrated Serum really works in a spectacular way . <p> Instead , this product works in an OK way . It contains enough silicones to make your skin feel smooth . But so do Olay and Neutrogena for about $125 less . <p> If you want to rejuvenate your skin after acne , the best you can say about these products is that they certainly wont harm it . But you can get much better results from the microdermabrasion creams available from Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923

The two largest sub-sections of the skin care industry are the anti aging industry and the anti acne industry . While these two types of treatments have existed for years now , it is some of the latest wrinkle cream treatment breakthroughs that have led to major advancements in removal of acne scars . Despite the obvious differences in these skin conditions and even the people who use them , the treatment of one seems to be beneficial to the other , as both are essentially wounds to the skin . <p> There are so many skin problems out there , but zits ( which is just another word for acne ) are one of the most common types . Acne can affect anybody no matter your age . However , zits do seem to affect teenagers a bit more than adults . Some folks do n't  call them zits instead they call them acne or pimples . It does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a zit will always be a zit . Acne is an inflammation of the skin and it usually does appear on the face or chest . In this article , you will get to know some fast acting zit remedies in order get rid of acne . <p> So many things can cause this outbreak , but it is usually a result of a hormonal disturbance , though other things like an oily skin texture and the diet can affect it too . Most people feel really uncomfortable with those pimples on their face . For them , its important to search for the best treatments for acne elimination . The good news is that there are some proven home remedies for getting rid of zits fast which you will discover from this article if you keep reading . This article is long , but I am sure it will help if you can read it to the end . <p> Home Remedies for Acne and Acne Scarring <p> Home remedies have often been passed down from the last generation to the next , and incorporate a range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin , and can help reduce the intensity of acne scars . Its no good being impatient though they take time to work . Often it takes between 3 and 6 months before you 'll notice that your acne or scars are markedly reduced or have even vanished completely . Sometimes a remedy might work perfectly for you , but be totally ineffective on someone else . Do n't  give up you can always try another remedy , until you find one that works for you . <p> First , the right diet can make your skin stay at a normal level , while a bad diet can only increase the risks of problems . But one fact remains clear : eating healthy wont make your skin perfect . It is true that it might have a reasonable effect , but you wont be able to prevent a condition such as acne just because you eat the right foods . <p> The number one " home remedy , " though , is to reduce your stress . Acne is a condition for people that have a lot of stress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creams , many doctors also recommend learning to deal with stressful situations so your body does n't  release an overabundance of hormones that could cause acne outbreaks . <p> Rosehip oil has been tested on old scars and improvement was noted in all cases . These old and new scars were caused by acne and otherwise . We 've heard lots of good experiences about scar removal using these luscious oils , but suffice it to say you can be the next living testimonial about healthy beautiful skin with faded acne scars ( and in many cases , elimination of scars altogether ) . <p> If you can follow the above tips then you will probably get some good results from these remedies , and combat thepimples that have bothered you so much . Home acne treatments are cheap and by far the most effective treatments that has been invented by mankind . <p> By this point in your search for a remedy for acne removal you may have concluded , as I did , that most acne cure products never measure up to their claims . Which is exactly why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will really work . Well rest assured there are both homemade remedies like the ones above that can assist in acne removal and also advanced acne cures for quick and permanent acne removal that drug companies do n't  what you to know about because they work . <p> Conventional Acne TreatmentsFirst and foremost , wash your face two or a maximum three times per day . Choose your cleanser wisely . Get one that suits your skin type and make sure it is gentle and does not cause any dryness to your skin . Drying and irritating cleansers can often cause inflammations that damage the skin and causes your acne to get worse . <p> Second , moisturize . There are $10 ( or less ) brands of moisturizers available at your local drug store , but many of them are simply not effective enough for most users . On the other end of the spectrum , there are products like La Mer , which can cost up to $2,000 . Despite the high price tag , not all users of La Mer report being satisfied with the product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a measure of how effective a product is . It is in your best interest to try different products until you find the one that most perfectly suits your own needs and skin type . A cheap moisturizer is not necessarily cheap , and an expensive brand is not necessarily the best ! <p> Next , try using benzoyl peroxide . But remember that increased concentrations of benzoyl peroxide , whilst reducing or curing acne do also however appear to raise the likelihood of some adverse reactions , such as skin dryness or redness and occasional peeling or flaking of the skin . Be conservative when you apply benzoyl peroxide . <p> Fortunately , there are many products on the market that combine the above steps into a kit . Some are the basic treatments of acne , which can be bought or applied by professionals individually as needed . An example of this is benzoyl peroxide , which I mentioned above . It is a low-risk , high-reward formula that does not create bacterial resistance and is considered to be one of the best acne treatments available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creating resistance , are reserved only for dire and severe cases . Steroids of all sorts are also used , depending on the kind of acne and the severity of the case . <p> Something else your doctor may suggest is birth control pills . Many young women who suffer from normal outbreaks of facial acne during puberty often discover the condition ceases to exist when they go through their first pregnancy , which mimics the hormonal state caused by The Pill . The alteration in the bodys chemistry seems to be enough to make the acne disappear . <p> On the other end of the spectrum is Accutane , which should not be taken by women while pregnant or who may become pregnant . Currently , the law demands females using Accutane to enroll in a national database and subsequently be tested for pregnancy every other 30 days . The fact is that its important to make sure a pregnant woman is kept off any such treatment that can hurt the unborn baby . <p> Vitamin A is another good treatment . In fact , studies have shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vitamin A is needed for maintaining acne free skin . That 's because Vitamin A reduces oil production and helps strengthen the protective tissue of the skin . If you have acne , the recommended dose is 10,000 iu ( International Unit ) , however pregnant women should contact their doctor before taking anything over 5000 iu daily . <p> Spa treatments including facials , wax , sauna and steam can sometimes worsen an acne problem . However , some dermatological procedures can effectively help you remove redness on your face . IPL ( Intense Pulsed Light ) as well as vascular laser treatments , for example , can eliminate the broken blood vessels caused by severe acne . <p> Finally , when it comes to prevention and treatment of acne , remember not to spend too much time in the sun . Some is OK , but the sun does play a decisive role in depleting levels of collagen . Together with elastin , the fibers start to break down and flatten out , they are less flexible , and they become harder . Result ? Lots of sagging skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a road map . <p> If you must get tan , try self tanning lotion . You can also try a quick spray tan , giving you a warm bronzing glow that will make any scars less visible . Or you can try a gentle bronzing powder or self tanning foundation to give you that tanned look . <p> While were on the topic of makeup , I have found the Bare Escentuals bareMinerals line to be the best in combining quality and value . If you are not familiar with it , it is also often referred to as bare essentials or bare minerals . The quality is excellent in terms of application , finish , and ingredients . The price is also reasonable compared to other high quality brands . In addition , they have a full line of colors , finishing powders , eye shadows , blushes , bronzers , lipsticks , eyeliners , brow colors , skin care , and many more . If you have never used mineral makeup before , start with a Get Started Kit . Even if you do not use every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to buying the individual items . If you are very oily and sensitive , go for their new bareMinerals matte foundation along with the kit . It is still a great value . <p> Whether you have dry , oily , or combination skin , it can be tricky to deal with , but it can also be beautiful , healthy , vibrant , and acne free . Do your homework , and you will find the right skin care routine for your skin . <p> Scar Removal <p> Acne is something almost everyone has to deal with once in their life , either as a teenager or believe it or not as an adult . For the millions of acne sufferers across the globe , clear skin is the ultimate goal . Unfortunately , however , clear skin is not always perfect skin ; acne often leaves behind visible scarring . Acne scars form when the deep connective tissue layer of the skin , called the dermis , is injured or damaged in some way . This damage triggers the body to start producing collagen , a tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it heals . Sometimes collagen is overproduced , creating a hypertrophic scar , or not properly taken apart once the wound has healed , creating a depressed-type scar . Both types of acne scars can be more obvious than one might like , mainly because they are n't  at the same level as the surrounding skin , either too high or too low . <p> The most horrible thing about acne is that it can leave your skin with different types of scarring as mentioned . Boxcar , ice pick , hypertrophic and keloid scars are some of the specific types of scars left behind by acne . <p> Many people suffering from acne scars resort to the usage of products like makeup and concealer , which help them in hiding their scars . But they should also understand that this is only a temporary solution and this will not take care of the problem in all respects . Laser treatment , chemical peels , Dermabrasion , acne scar removal creams and lotions and application of Vitamin E to the skin are some of the most common methods of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help in the healing of the skin tissues . <p> Trying to find an acne scar removal cream can be a really hard task . Not only that , it can also be quite expensive . Another issue many face is that most creams out there contain harsh chemicals that can be quite harmful and have several side effects on an already troubled complexion . <p> There is another kind of help available for those who suffer from persistent and stubborn acne scars . It is possible to remove these acne scars and there are two main options available to do it . Both of these options involve removing the top layer of the skin : laser removal and microdermabrasion . <p> The absolute best way to treat acne scars is by means of laser surgery . The main concern regarding laser surgery is that most insurance will not pay for this operation , which means that you will have to pay for it with your own money . Another apprehension is the high cost . This decision should be made carefully . <p> Before we jump into some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much do you think microdermabrasion costs ? Not those home remedy kits ( which do n't  work ) or a trip to the local salon , I mean microdermabrasion for acne scars done by a qualified doctor . You can expect to pay somewhere around $750 a treatment . <p> Micro Dermabrasion is n't a very painful process , unlike a similar treatment , Dermabrasion , which can cause quite a lot of discomfort . You can expect the area to be red and swollen directly after treatment but generally these side effects disappear within a day . <p> The most difficult scars to treat are sunken-in and pitted . These scars occur when part of the skin structure is lost , a common result of cystic acne . Depending on the depth and severity , laser treatments can effectively remove 60% of the damage ( on average ) with several laser treatments . Injectable fillers can also provide an instant , yet temporary plumping effect in the pitted scar to effectively smooth the skin surface . <p> I hope this article has been useful and you have enjoyed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try some of these products for yourself and get rid of those acne spots for good . Thanks for reading . <p> SIDE BAR <p> If you have had laser hair removal , one common side effect of laser hair removal is acne . Many people do not realize the role body hair plays in protecting our skin from bacteria , as it keeps sebaceous glands clear of buildup and clogging . This helps to prevent acne in most parts of the body where hair is present . After laser hair removal , bacteria may begin to show up around areas of the body previously protected by body hair . Patients may experience acne in places they have never experienced it before such as the back , genital regions or under the arms . Again , patients concerned with this possible side effect can get more detailed information from their doctor . 19923 @qwx879923

In one small study , 100% of people who have ocular rosacea ( which can cause red and puffy eyelids , a feeling of grittiness in the eyes , eye pain , and sensitivity to light ) have the predisposing condition . <h> What Is Bacterial Overgrowth ? <p> Bacteria overgrowth is a condition that occurs when a surface inside the body that normally hosts only a small number of bacteria becomes covered with a film of non-disease causing bacteria or when it is overtaken by pathogenic microorganisms . <p> The small intestine was once thought to be a nearly sterile environment . Since the small intestine is just below the stomach , scientists reasoned that most of the bacteria and other microbes in food and drink were probably killed as they passed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bacteria are present in this uppermost part of the lower digestive tract even at birth . Relatively harmless strep bacteria and symbiotic Lactobacillus bacteria exist in small numbers in the small intestine . A milliliter ( 1/5 of a teaspoon ) of fluid in the small intestine usually contains about 10,000 bacteria . That compares to 100,000,000,000 bacteria in a single milliliter of fluid in the colon . <p> When the bacteria count in the small intestine climbs from 10,000 to 100,000,000,000 bacteria per milliliter , a condition of overgrowth is said to exist . This can occur when the stomach fails to secrete enough acid , or when the peristaltic action that propels digested food through the intestines becomes sluggish , when the pH of digested food becomes less acidic ( acidity being a good thing in this case ) , or when excesses of certain minerals in the diet trigger sudden growth of disease-causing bacteria . It can occur when the ileocecal valve between the small intestine and the colon fails to keep colon bacteria from migrating up into the small bowel , or when pouches form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can grow . <p> Bacterial overgrowth often causes diarrhea , because the slimy film of bacteria coating the small intestine interferes with the absorption of fat . Unabsorbed fat causes especially smelly diarrhea with stools that float . <p> There may be abdominal pain , bloating , and flatulence , as well as deficiency symptoms caused by the inability to absorb fat-soluble vitamins such as A and K as well as the inability to absorb calcium . There can be skin irritation and brittle nails because of selenium deficiency . <p> But SIBO can also aggravate acne . Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine , it turns out , can also increase the severity and frequency of rosacea outbreaks on the face . <h> The Digestive Connection to Rosacea <p> About 40 years ago a team of pathologists at the Royal Victoria Infirmary at Newcastle on Tyne in England performed a series of autopsies on rosacea patients who had willed their bodies to science . They found that about 1 in 3 of these patients had " multiple convolutions " in the lining of the small intestine . These tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bacteria then , the researchers reasoned , emit some kind of toxin that gets carried to the bloodstream that causes rosacea to break out . <p> Later researchers theorized that perhaps these tiny pouches are caused by celiac disease that is not severe enough to cause full-blown symptoms . Celiac disease is a sensitivity to gluten , more specifically to a component of gluten called gliadin , that is found in wheat , barley , rye , and oats . In clinically diagnosed cases , it causes severe damage to the lining of the small intestine that results in obvious symptoms . It may be that in milder cases it just stimulates the growth of the lining of the small intestine so that bacteria can accumulate . <p> These bacteria reach the small intestine when there is n't enough acid in stomach , perhaps after taking an antacid or a medication for gastroesophageal reflux disease . Or maybe severe constipation causes them to accumulate . There would have to be a combination of mild celiac disease plus something that transports bacteria to the small bowel for rosacea flares to occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  know for sure that wheat sensitivity usually causes rosacea . Only about 35% of people who had rosacea had obvious changes in the small intestine . <h> Using Antibiotics to Treat Rosacea <p> Its not necessary to snip a piece of small bowel and look at it under a microscope , however , to diagnose small intestine bacterial overgrowth ( SIBO ) . Nowadays , that can also be done with a breath test . In 2008 , Italian researchers recruited rosacea patients whose breath tests indicated that they had SIBO and gave them antibiotics to kill the excess growth of bacteria in the small intestine . <p> The researchers were astounded by the results . In 70% of patients who had both rosacea and SIBO , treating the overgrowth eliminated rosacea outbreaks . In the other 30% , symptoms were greatly improved . One round of antibiotics for the bowel " not for the skin " eliminated rosacea on average for nine months . <p> These results do n't  suggest that absolutely everyone who has rosacea would benefit from antibiotic treatment , since not everyone who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and SIBO , however , medically directed antibiotic treatment may make a huge difference in the severity of rosacea . <p> These results also do n't  suggest that everyone who has rosacea needs to go on a wheat-free diet . Sometimes it may help . But controlling the overgrowth of bacteria is what resulted in controlling rosacea , not eliminating wheat-flour bread and pasta from the Italian diet . <p> Its also important to remember that the antibiotics that cured rosacea were not used to treat acne bacteria . Rosacea usually does not involve bacterial infection of the skin . Rosacea occurs when small blood vessels beneath the skin are inflamed and break , leaking blood beneath the skin . <p> But a rosacea treatment that is this simple and this expensive is definitely worth discussing with your dermatologist . Ask if there is a possibility you might have SIBO and whether antibiotics might be appropriate for you . <p> BiON for Treating Acne BiON is an American manufacturer of professional skin care products for use by aestheticians , dermatologists , and plastic surgeons .

Strictly speaking , Propionibacterium acnes does not cause any kind of swelling , inflammation , or redness that we see as pimples .

But its almost unheard of for these infections to get into the body on their own . <h> Acne Bacteria in the Prostate <p> Scientists noted that men who had acne as teenagers tend to develop prostate cancer later in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prostate cancer , however , has been difficult to determine . Some men get acne and do n't  get prostate cancer , and a few men get prostate cancer but never had acne . <p> Of the four large-scale studies of the relationship of acne and prostate cancer , two found a connection , and two did not . Researchers at first thought the relationship might really be between testosterone levels during adolescence , believed to be higher in men who had acne as teenagers , and prostate cancer later in life , but the evidence for this relationship did not pan out . <p> Australian researchers who did detailed biopsies of prostate tissue removed during prostate cancer surgery , however , noted that when the prostate was inflamed , it often was infected with acne bacteria . But they did n't  believe that acne bacteria caused prostate cancer . They theorized that once prostate cancer occurred , acne bacteria could make it much worse . <p> How could that be ? <p> Not surprisingly , cancer makes the immune system much more active as it tries to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed by the immune system . Instead , they redirect inflammation to nearby tissues . Acne bacteria increase inflammation in the prostate , which in turn gives the cancer more ways to connect to the bloodstream and more ways to spread to the rest of the body . <p> Also , the kinds of treatments used in most cases of prostate cancer accelerate the growth of acne bacteria . Men being treated for prostate cancer are usually given chemicals that make testosterone less abundant in their bloodstreams and estrogen more abundant in their bloodstreams . During adolescence , higher levels of testosterone are associated with more acne blemishes , but this is not due to any effect testosterone has on the acne bacteria themselves . Testosterone just causes the skin to grow faster so that more oil is produced and more pores narrow with over-production of new skin . Testosterone works on the skin itself . <p> Estrogen , on the other hand , stimulates bacteria . In the body , this means that more acne bacteria can release more decoy chemicals that cause more inflammation that cause greater damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white blood cells known as Th1 cells , which cause delayed responses to infection , they can do far greater damage than if the inflammatory response were immediate , possibly causing men to get faster treatment . But how does acne bacteria find its way into the prostate ? <h> Surgical Infections and Acne Bacteria <p> While acne bacteria can infect a mans body during prostatectomy , the surgical removal of the prostate , they are more likely to enter the prostate either ( 1 ) on a catheter inserted into the mans urethra to drain urine backed up behind a swollen prostate or ( 2 ) on the biopsy needles inserted up the rectum that are used to take 8 to 15 samples of prostate tissue to confirm a cancer diagnosis . This means that it is really , really important not to reuse catheters that have not been sterilized , and its important not to tug on a catheter to reinsert it . There 's not a lot you can do to achieve a sterile surgical field when you are the patient having a prostate exam , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budgetary crisis ( and that may cut back on cleaning costs ) and you can share your concerns with your physician . <p> There are two other ways that acne bacteria can enter the skin , and one of them is through boils and abscesses in the skin . Even if the skin lesion itself was not caused by acne bacteria , acne bacteria can travel through the break in the skin and cause infection almost anywhere in the body . Also , acne bacteria can enter the body through the gums , usually on infected dental instruments . <p> Although acne bacteria accelerate the progression of prostate cancer , they actually protect the body against cancers that " break out " of tumors with the help of a different kind of white blood cell , the Th2 cell . Acne infections inside the body actually reduce the severity of melanoma and certain kinds of leukemia and lymphoma . <p> The Effect of Steroids on Acne Steroid abuse can cause an especially dangerous , even life-threatening , form of acne known as acne fulminans . The relationship of acne and steroids is something everyone ... 19923 @qwx879923

The development of techniques that use an adults own stem cells , however , have opened up new possibilities for stem cell therapies for an astonishing range and number of diseases . Stem cells can even be used as a filler for acne scars . <h> Embryonic Stem Cells <p> The kind of stem cells that has been at the center of controversy in the United States is embryonic stem cells , harvested from the inner wall of the blastocyst , a structure similar to a balloon that appears in the earliest stages of human embryonic development .

The human body continues making stem cells that can turn into bone , blood , or fat . As you might imagine , the overwhelming majority of adults in the United States have their own supplies of stem cells in fatty tissue .

Since the invention of the procedure by a German dermatologist named Dr. Neuber in 1893 , dermatologists have harvested belly fat or buttocks fat by liposuction and then injected the fat underneath the skin where it needs filling in to conceal a scar . <p> The downside of the procedure is that transplanted fat cells tend to be absorbed into surrounding tissues and the scar treatment only lasts a few months .

Most of the pioneering clinical work for this procedure is taking place in Japan . <p> Stem cells are harvested not from the fat in the belly or buttocks but from the connective tissue underneath the belly fat . They are incubated in the lab so that they multiply to numbers sufficient to inject underneath the skin . As stem cells , they would ordinarily travel through the bloodstream to their destination , building connections with surrounding cells to form fatty tissues . <p> Japanese researchers , however , have developed a method of stabilizing stem cells in a compound called hyaluronic acid .

The problem with the glycemic index has always been that it measures the speed of digestion of single foods , and people do n't  actually eat single foods . The authors of glycemic index diets , however , act as if they did , and tell people who have acne that filling up on low glycemic index foods like raw carrots and raw cabbage will help clear up their faces . <p> And usually low glycemic index foods do n't  work , or people do n't  manage to stay on the diet . <p> However , there is a different way to use the glycemic index to guide an anti-acne diet .

Now we would like to tell you about a specific kind of zinc that works about 50 times better than any other . But first let 's review why zinc works for fighting acne . <h> Zinc for Fighting Inflammation <p> The value of using skin care products that contain zinc and supplements that contain zinc is reducing inflammation . In acne , its really not acne bacteria that cause the redness and swelling and itching and pain we associate with inflammation . ( In some other skin infections , like impetigo , it really is the bacteria that do the damage . ) In acne , the bacteria release chemicals called chemotaxins that redirect inflammation to healthy skin so the bacteria can escape . <p> The immune system can generate inflammation aimed at these chemotaxins even after acne bacteria are already dead . Its as if the immune system does n't  know that its really destroying healthy skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on the principle of reducing the immune systems inflammatory response by exposing it to chemotaxins over and over again . <p> You do n't  have to take a vaccine to reduce the inflammation your own white blood cells release to fight vaccine . You can take zinc . The way zinc tones down the reactivity of the immune system is by reducing the production of a stress hormone called corticotrophin releasing factor CRF . This helps clear up acne in a number of ways . <p> Zinc makes your skin less likely to break out when you are stressed because it is not making as much of the stress hormone CRF . <p> Zinc also stops growth signals that thicken the lining of pores and trap oil inside . <p> Zinc reduces the production of oil at the base of pores . <p> Zinc slows the release of histamine , which can inflame pores the same way it inflames your nose and throat when you have allergies . <p> All of these effects help clear up acne . And it turns out one form of zinc is a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acne <p> The most effective form of zinc for fighting acne , it turns out , is a compound known as zinc ascorbate . The " ascorbate " part of the zinc ascorbate molecule is a high-pH form of ascorbic acid , better known as vitamin C. <p> Vitamin C absorbs free radicals of oxygen and keeps them from damaging tissues . In the skin , one of the most important jobs of vitamin C is to quench the free radicals of oxygen released when the skin is exposed to UV-B radiation from the sun . By absorbing these oxidizing agents it prevents inflammation of the skin . Its not essential to use a sunblock that contains vitamin C because your diet should provide you enough C to avoid being especially prone to sunburn . But having enough vitamin C in your diet or at least on your skin helps stop sunburns before they start . <p> Vitamin C also absorbs some of the free radicals of oxygen that trigger the inflammatory reactions of acne .

It keeps white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can destroy cells in the skin . <p> The kind of vitamin C that literally sticks to your skin is ascorbyl palmitate .

You need about 5% ascorbyl palmitate in a skin cream ( that you squeeze out of a tube rather than dip out of a jar , because the ascorbyl palmitate reacts with air ) to get noticeable effects on acne . <p> The kind of zinc that is usually used in skin care products is zinc oxide .

Sudden discontinuation of antibiotics makes acne worse . Usually it is best to taper off your use of antibiotic over two or three weeks while you start using other methods of acne control . And it is always best to use multiple methods of fighting acne such as are provided by Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923

Tanning acne-prone skin , however , can cause more problems than it solves . <h> Summary : <p> Many people who have blemishes attempt to hide them with a tan . <p> Getting a sun tan to hide acne never works . If you have fair skin , it will burn or freckle . <p> If you have darker but not extremely dark skin , pimpled skin will get a darker tan than healthy skin . <p> And if you have black skin , your time in the sun will have no effect " or cause black spots if you are using benzoyl peroxide or topical tretinoin . <p> Bronzers are cosmetics you rub across the skin .

If you use a product that contains erythrulose , you wo n't know for several days whether your skin is going to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hide acne scars , or make them more prominent . <p> The best way to hide acne is with concealer and foundation makeup . <p> Even better , prevent acne from ever occurring with Exposed Skin Care . <h> Sun Tans to Conceal Acne and Your Skin Type <p> Not everyone can get a natural tan by spending time in the sun . If you have very dark skin , a few hours in the sun will never give you a tan and never cause a burn . If you have very fair skin , a few hours in the sun probably will not give you tan , but you will almost certainly get a sunburn . Tanning is only possible on skin that has some brown pigments " but neither too little nor too much . <p> Even you do n't  tan , however , you may get sun spots and freckles . On all put the darkest skin types , the UV-A rays of sunlight cause damage to the skin that releases free radicals of oxygen . The melanin pigment that is already in the skin turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin from DNA damage . The more brown pigment you already have in your skin , the more UV-A radiation will give you a tan . UV-A radiation causes an immediate change in the color of your skin , and longer-term damage of your skin . <p> Sunlight also produces UV-B rays . UV-B radiation causes immediate damage to the skin . These rays do not have an immediate effect on the color of the skin , but they cause the skin to manufacture new melanin . If you have darker white skin , brown skin , or Asian skin , your tan will just be a deeper a few days after you spend time in the sun . If you have very fair skin , however , your skin will have so few pigment-producing cells that the additional melanin will look like freckles or spots on your skin . <p> If you tan to hide acne on fair skin , time in the sun will just result in both freckles and acne . If you tan to hide acne on black skin , nothing will be different ( unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which case exposure to the sun may cause the formation of black spots on your skin , in addition to any blemishes that may be on your skin ) . - However , if you tan to hide acne on darker white or lighter brown or Asian skin , you may be able to obscure whiteheads , blackheads , and pimples . But you risk permanent skin damage if you do . <h> What About Using Bronzers and Tanning Sprays ? <p> Using a tanning bed causes the same kinds of changes to your skin as time in the sun . Bronzers and tanning sprays , however , do not . <p> Bronzers are cosmetics that are used to spread color over the skin . They rinse away the first time the skin is cleansed . <p> Tanning sprays change the color of the dead skin cells lying on the surface of the skin . These products are made with a chemical called dihydroxyacetic acid . When it combines with the proteins in dead skin cells , it causes a reaction similar to the browning you see on apple slices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead skin that comes in contact with the tanning spray , the darker the skin . <p> This means that if you have relatively large amounts of dead skin on parts of your face , tanning spray and tanning lotions will make that part of your face darker . Usually you have more dead skin around a pimple . If you apply tanning spray or tanning lotion to your skin without doing exfoliation first , you will have lighter areas of clear skin and darker areas around pimples " making them more noticeable , not less . Or if you treat pimples with any product that contains petrolatum or mineral oil , or you use too much moisturizer , the tanning lotion wont stick and your pimple will be pinker while the surrounding skin is darker . If you happen to use one of the few products that contains both dihydroxyacetone and another compound called erythrulose , the effect of the product will build up over several days " which means you may not know you have used too much until it is too late . <p> There are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or burn " faster .

Darker skin makes the shadow less noticeable . But you do n't  have to risk damaging you skin to get the effect you want " just exfoliate excess dead skin , and then apply a sun-less tanning lotion made with dihydroxyacetone in an even layer over your face . Its best to try to " tan " less at first and make sure you get even color over your skin .

Going out into the sun and using a tanning bed produce the same problems . <p> Using a bronzer is a temporary fix . A liquid bronzer is best on normal or oily skin , so it wont streak . A dry bronzer is best on dry skin , so it wont clump . But almost all bronzers tend to make your skin orange . <p> Sun-less tanning lotions dye dead skin . If you need to do exfoliation , using a tanning lotion is a sure-fire , cosmetically embarrassing way to find out .

About 20 to 25% of people who have common acne as teenagers continue to have to deal with it in adulthood , but other kinds of acne do not appear until maturity . <p> The challenge of treating adult acne is that the skin does not grow as fast as it once did . Teens who use harsh acne treatments on their skin tend to get better despite their mistakes .

The International Dermal Institute says that up to 55% of women between the ages of 20 and 40 have persistent mild acne and oily skin . This unfortunately coincides with the time when women begin noticing wrinkles , age spots and other skin problems , too . Over half of all women above the age of 25 have acne in some shape or form .

And it does n't  matter what causes the fluctuations in hormone levels . It could simply be hereditary or brought on by pregnancy , lifestyle ( think drastic diet changes or stress levels ) , peri-menopause or menopause , PMS or starting/stopping the use of birth control pills . <p> Stress <p> When- under stress , your body is likely to produce androgens , which are a type of hormone . This can result in the development of or increase in acne , as they stimulate both the hair follicles and oil glands in the skin .

A daily walk , or even making sure you get enough sleep at night so skin has a chance to regenerate can make a difference . <p> Beauty Products <p> Adults with acne prone skin should be especially careful in choosing skin and even hair care products . Check the labels to ensure that they contain one of these phrases : non-comedogenic , non-acnegenic , oil free or statements that it wont clog pores . <p> Medication <p> Acne sometimes comes as a side effect to medications .

Its not just the dirt and grit of the outdoors , but today there 's also the toxins , smog and chemicals , depending on where you live . You cant very well lock yourself up in a clean , air filtrated room for the rest of your life , but be mindful about it and do a quick wash when you come back in from a long walk or day in town . <p> Diet <p> Is chocolate causing your breakouts ?

Getting enough water is key in helping skin to stay hydrated , water-down any secretions and help prevent unwanted congestion in the pores . <p> Salt- " Some doctors believe that salt can make acne breakouts worse due to the iodine found in your typical table salt . Minimize the amount of salt you use ( less than 1500 mg daily ) and with pre-packed foods , always try to find the low-sodium versions . <p> Dairy- " Dairy products may be your enemy .

The spike in blood sugar and insulin can increase male hormones that often result in a breakout . Keep hormones in check with plenty of veggies and whole grain foods . The same thing can happened with high sugar foods . <p> Sugar- " Again , lots of sugar will raise insulin levels , leading to a rise in oil-boosting male hormone production that can worsen any acne problems . <h> What to Do When Teenage Acne Just Wont Go Away <p> Sometimes teenage acne just never seems to go away .

If you use detergent soaps , stop . Any kind of cleanser that makes big foaming bubbles on your skin or that leaves the skin feeling cool or tingly triggers stress hormones . Most botanical ingredients in skin care products , especially cinnamon oil and menthol , do the same thing . <p> It is also important to avoid overheating the skin ( steam treatments and saunas ) , shocking the skin ( zit zappers like the hand held electrical device made by Zeno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing daily cleansing and weekly exfoliation of the skin , gradually bring this form of adult acne under control . <h> Treating Adult Acne <p> There are a number of birth control options and medication that may help . <p> Birth Control Pills &amp; Medication <p> There are a number of birth control options and medication that may help. - As we talked about earlier , adult acne cases in women in their 20s , 30s and 40s is very much on the rise . So it only makes sense to assume there 's a good chance that you 're a woman . And in that case , its very possible your acne flare ups are related to hormones . If your breakouts seem to show up around specific times of the month , then there are a number of- birth control pills- your doctor may want to prescribe , including Yaz , Beyaz , Estrostep and Yasmin . Many of these are approved for the use in treating acne by the FDA . They may also help if you suffer from PCOS . <p> Another option may be Spironolactone , originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of hormones that prompt skin glands to boost sebum production , which often results in acne . Spironolactone works by blocking the receptors for androgens , as well as helping get rid of any extra testosterone buildup . Its been shown to work particularly well for women with PCOS or those dealing with hormonal acne that may be extra sensitive to even normal levels of androgens , though it normally takes months to see results . Note that its used off-label , meaning the FDA has n't  specifically cleared its use for acne . <p> Note : In most cases benzoyl peroxide should be used sparingly and occasionally because it can be very drying . If you 're going to use it , start with the lowest concentration possible and work your way up if needed , if your skin is n't too sensitive to it . <p> Exfoliation <p> In addition to cleansing your skin daily , exfoliation should also be done regularly to both prevent and treat acne . Using glycolic acid is often recommended , but not necessarily in a cleanser that gets washed off immediately . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the glycolic acid to really absorb into the skin . <p> Spot Treating <p> Sometimes you just need to get rid of a stubborn pimple fast . Benzoyl peroxide may be the answer here . Yes , we said its best used occasionally , so the occasional pimple emergency is a good example . Dab a little bit of a benzoyl peroxide dirctly , and only to the little trouble spot and let it get to work on that bacteria . The problem is some skin may experience redness , itching , peeling or inflammation when using a product strong enough to kill acne bacteria on contact , which would contain 10% benzoyl peroxide . <p> If its not an emergency though and you want a gentler way to treat a pesky pimple then consider tea tree oil . Its been shown to be just as effective at killing acne bacteria as benzoyl peroxide , but it takes longer to work . Plus , its better for fighting inflammation . <h> What to Do About Rosacea <p> Rosacea is a form of acne that usually does not show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which results from clogged pores , rosacea is caused by weak blood vessels just below the surface of the skin . When these blood vessels leak , the skin turns red . Larger leaks cause small , pimple-like red spots to break out on the face , and scar tissue can cause lumps and bumps to form under the skin , especially on the nose . <p> The way to keep capillaries from leaking blood is to make sure they are not subjected to more pressure than they can handle . When you move from the cold to a warm room , for example , circulation suddenly increases in the skin of your face . This change in blood pressure in the capillaries can cause immediate redness of the skin . The solution is to keep covered up when you are outside , or to keep indoor room temperature to a minimum to avoid stress on the skin . <p> Similarly , it is important to avoid other rosacea triggers , such as hot drinks , alcohol , spicy foods , perfumes , after shave , and any treatment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin with products that contain azelaic acid " used strictly as directed " can resolve both rosacea and any problem with whiteheads and blackheads on the skin . <h> What to Do About Cystic Acne <p> Cystic acne usually strikes in early adulthood , and the young adults who get cystic acne typically were free of common acne as teenagers . In cystic acne , the skin grows over pores containing acne infection . They are not able to drain , so the cyst only grows larger and larger and more and more inflamed . <p> It is never a good idea to pick at , poke , probe , lance , or cut an acne cyst . The only way to deal with cysts ( aside from going to a plastic surgeon ) is to treat them with retinoids that stimulate the growth of the skin . It may be possible to do this with an over the counter form of Retin-A called topical tretinoin , or you may need to get a stronger retinoid drug that has to be used under the supervision of a dermatologist . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively easy to treat . <h> What to Do About Sports Acne <p> Active adults often get sports acne , which is also known as acne mechanica . This form of acne occurs when sweat gets trapped under straps , bands , or elastic clothing . The sweat shrivels skin the same way that spending too much time in the tub or shower can shrivel skin . The shriveling traps acne bacteria in pores and acne follows . <p> The solution to excess sweat begins with making sure to take a shower after activities that involve sweating under restrictive clothing . Showering removes excess oil and dead skin . Then it also helps to use softer padding or looser straps to prevent future problems . <p> People of African descent are especially sensitive to sweat-induced acne . People of Japanese descent are especially sensitive to acne triggered by allergies to the elastic used in straps . <h> What to Do About Senile Acne <p> Sometimes older adults get blackheads that just wont go away , especially where the skin is tough , such as on the back . Picking or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injures the surrounding skin . <p> When blackheads resist other forms of treatment , try exfoliation with a product containing salicylic acid , which may be labeled as " beta-hydroxy acid . " These kinds of products loosen the hardened sebum that holds a blackhead in place , while reducing inflammation to surrounding skin . It may take more than one application of a salicylic acid exfoliant to get rid of senile blemishes , but there is no danger of inflammation or infection of the skin . <h> Dealing with Spots and Scars <p> Some people will deal with reddish spots of skin where pimples were for months or even years after acne is long gone . Though its believed to be genetic , picking at them and squeezing them is only going to make matters worse . Early treatment is key . The best way to deal with leftover spots ( hyperpigmentation ) , and this is good for all skin types , are skin peels carried out by an aesthetician that use glycolic acid or salicylic acid . See our- article on hyperpigmentation- for more information . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . There 's a difference between scars and hyperpigmentation ( spots ) . While skin peels , exfoliation and microdermabrasion may help for leftover spots and minor scars , indented scars will likely need the help of a professional in the form of steroid injections , surgery , laser ablation and radiofrequency ablation . For more about serious scarring , - see here . <p> But again , if its merely spots that are left behind , you can probably get rid of them with a little bit of time and dedication . Acne kits like Exposed Skin Care or even Proactiv may make it easier ( and cheaper ) to manage acne long term . 19923 @qwx879923

Its based on azelaic acid , a product that sometimes gets good results in treating rosacea and sometimes does n't  . The new foaming formula , however , may be exactly what is needed to make azelaic acid more effective for more people who have rosacea . <p> Other names for azelaic acid include Heptanedicarboxylic acid and Lepargylic acid . It is also known by the brand names Azelex- Cream and Finacea- Gel . Other skin creams that have azelaic acid as part of their active ingredient include Azelex , Skinoren and AcneDerm . <h> What Is Azelaic Acid ? <p> In plants , azelaic acid is a kind of distress signal that tells the plant to accumulate salicylic acid , the chemical that stops inflammation . In human skin , azelaic acid is a byproduct of a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pityrosporum ovale ) that in large numbers can cause greasy seborrhea but that in small numbers actually protects the skin . <h> What Does Azelaic Acid Do for the Skin ? <p> Azelaic acid is also an anti-inflammatory for the skin . It is especially helpful in reversing the reactions that form spots of excessive pigmentation as acne heals . It only targets the discolored areas on the skin , which makes it effective for dark skinned patients whose acne has left brown marks on their skin or for those who have melasma . Some products are made using 20 percent azelaic acid and 2 percent glycolic acid . This combination helps to exfoliate discolored skin cells , while decreasing melanin production on the skin . This helps to reduce hyperpigmentation faster . - Its effectiveness can be compared to using to using 4 percent of hydroquinone , which has been the primary FDA approved method for treating skin discoloration since 1982 . <p> Many products designed for safe lightening of Asian skin use azelaic acid instead of hydroquinone , the skin lightener that sometimes leaves Asian skin black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for male pattern baldness and hair loss caused by polycystic ovarian disease ( PCOS ) . Along with zinc and vitamin B6 , it stops the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone , the form of testosterone that interferes with new hair production . There are no scientific studies specifically confirming the usefulness of azelaic acid for hair restoration , but there are widely accepted reports that azelaic acid can cause growth of unwanted hairs on skin that normally does not host hair . <h> What Does Azelaic Acid Do for Rosacea ? <p> Until 2009 , scientists knew that azelaic acid relieves rosacea without having a good idea of why it relieves rosacea . The traditional view of rosacea was that it is primarily a vascular disorder , reddening and thickening of the skin as the result of ruptures in tiny blood vessels in the skin . Researchers now understand that rosacea is also an immune system disorder , in which a group of white blood cells known as neutrophils is responsible for changes in the blood vessels in the skin that are observed as having rosacea . <p> Neutrophils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as proteases that dissolve collagen in the walls of blood vessels . This makes it easier for other white blood cells to reach infectious microorganisms in tissues surrounded by these blood vessels , but it also makes the skin above the blood vessels red and bumpy . If the immune system only dissolves capillary walls but does not send other white blood cells to remove the the dissolved proteins , they will coalesce into bumps that are seen when rosacea causes rhinophyma or " bumpy " nose . <p> Rosacea triggered by moderate sunlight can benefit from azelaic acid . <p> Azelaic acid is an antioxidant . Free radicals of oxygen are needed to activate the neutrophils that dissolve the proteins in the lining of capillaries that cause the redness and bumpiness associated with rosacea . Azelaic acid neutralizes these free radicals of oxygen , - which essentially helps to reduce inflammation . It also neutralizes free radicals released when the skin is exposed to enough UV rays of sunlight to trigger rosacea but not enough UV rays to cause sunburn . It compensates for the skins inability to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems caused by a shortage of healthy fatty acids in the skin . And it reduces the reactivity of the skin to the presence of other organisms such as the Demodex mites that can infest the skin . <p> Azelaic acid does many of the things that antibiotics do without actually attacking bacteria . Some antibiotics like tetracycline actually work by stopping the release of free radicals of oxygen that enable bacteria to release inflammation to attack the skin . These antibiotics " shut down " most bacteria but not all of them , leaving a few super-bugs behind to multiply . Azelaic acid leaves bacteria alone and instead focuses on the immune system itself , not creating super-bugs . <p> It falls under dircabolyxic acids , treating- rosacea by killing the bacteria that infects pores and minimizing the growth of bacteria in the follicle. - It also reduces the formation of keratin , which is usually responsible for causing acne . It is quite effective for treating comedonal acne and inflammatory acne . This acid is also Keratolytic and comedolytic , which means that it causes the disordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Azelaic acid is usually delivered to the skin in a cream . It can also be taken in a capsule form , but it is faster or more effective to use a cream . The problem until recently has been that creams of azelaic acid were not as effective as they could be . Today , it is sometimes- combined together with hormonal therapy and oral antibiotics . <h> Azelaic Acid and Acidity on the Skin <p> Most skin treatments work better at lower pH . Alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids , for instance , really cant do their job unless they are delivered to the skin in a form that keeps them at a pH of 3.0 to 3.9 , sufficiently acidic to cause a little sting . <p> Most azelaic acid products also have been formulated to keep the cream acidic while it on the skin . But as anyone who has rosacea knows , stinging itself can trigger rosacea attacks . It turns out that making azelaic acids less acidic makes them more effective . <h> Azelaic Acid Foams Better for Controlling Rosacea <p> Dr. Blanka Havlickova , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the effects of using a lower , 15% concentration of azelaic acid in the form of a foam for treating rosacea . The foam is gentler on the skin . <p> And as Dr. Havlickova reports , its not a miracle cure for rosacea . However , its about 25% more likely to cure rosacea than other more traditional forms of the chemical . <p> Azelaic acid is most effective for the papulopustular form of rosacea , the kind that causes blotches across the cheeks and nose . About 30% of people who have any kind of rosacea get clear skin after using traditional azelaic acid treatment . About 40% of people who have any kind of rosacea get clear skin after using the foam . <p> But if you are in that 10% , foaming azelaic acid might be a welcome relief . <p> The bottom line of Bayers rosacea trials is that on average , foaming azelaic acid gets rid of 3 more red spots than regular azelaic acid . The averages , however , are misleading . In a few people , using foaming azelaic acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimal when the treatment did not work . <p> Bayer continued clinical testing of the product since 2012 and in 2015 the Food , Administration and Drugs ( FDA ) approved the use of Bayer HealthCares Finacea ( azelaic acid ) Foam , 15 percent as treatment for mild to moderate rosacea . This was after Bayer carried out 12 week clinical trials on over 1 , 300 people , between 19 and- 92 years old . Of all the participants , 6.2 percent of the patients reported localized pain after using azelaic acid to treat rosacea , 2.5 percent experienced itchiness , 0.7 percent noticed dryness and 0.7 percent got redness of the skin . When using the product , the itchiness and redness eventually disappears once your skin gets used to the product , which can happen in as little as- one week . <p> One of the rare but serious side symptoms that you may notice after using azelaic acid is a rash . If you notice a rash , go see a doctor immediately .

This will help you to understand more about what to expect and the side effects to be on the lookout for . Use the cream two times in a day , in the morning and in the evenings . However , if you have sensitive skin , start by applying it once a day and eventually increase this to two times a day after a few days of using the cream . <p> Before applying it on your skin , wash your face with soap and water and then pat your skin dry using a towel . Wait for 20 minutes and then gently rub in the cream all over your face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the nose , mouth , eye and any open wounds . Applying too much cream on your face can result in skin irritation . Applying the cream on dry skin helps to reduce the redness and itchiness that may be experienced by some people . <p> To make the most of your treatment , use it on a consistent basis , for at least one month before giving up on it . If you stop too early , you may not notice any positive effects . You will most likely observe a noticeable improvement on your skin after about two months of use . If you want to moisturize your face , wait until 20 minutes after you have applied the cream before you apply the moisturizer , to give the azelaic acid time to absorb into your skin . When you are wearing it during the day , you can wear it under sunscreen since the acid makes could- skin more sensitive to sunlight . This product is a good option for people who can not use retinoids or for people who want something stronger than retinoids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pure azelaic acid is only available as a prescription but it is can be bought over the counter in other countries . However , there are many products that contain this ingredient , along with others that work well together , such as Exposed Skin Cares product line . <h> Who Should Not Use Azelaic Acid ? <p> Before using Azelaic acid , you should let your doctor know whether you are using any other skin treatment medicines or products . This includes any over the counter medications , prescription medications and herbal or other complementary medicines . It is also important that you inform your doctor whether you have had any allergic reactions before to any product or medicines , or if you have asthma , recurring cold sores , oral herpes , and if you are pregnant or breastfeeding . Even though this product is considered safe to use when pregnant , it should only- be used when and if needed .

They are reasonably priced and available in drugstores and discount stores everywhere . The problem with the Neutrogena line is that some Neutrogena products are superb for treating acne , but- some will actually make acne worse . This article will help you find the products that actually work for your skin . <h> Summary : <p> Neutrogena products are reasonably priced and available everywhere . The problem is that some work really well , and others would work really well except they come with misleading instructions or with ingredients that should not have been included . Hopefully these reviews will help you identify which are which . <p> Neutrogenas at-home microdermabrasion kit is hundreds of dollars cheaper than a visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Some of Neutrogenas facial peels are formulated with the right ingredients at the right concentration and the right pH to remove discolored , brown skin , but if you follow the instructions you will just rinse the benefits right down the drain .

These ingredients do not clean , and they do injure skin . <h> What Neutrogena Does Well <p> Neutrogena produces a great line of at-home microdermabrasion products and skin scrubs . These are not products you use to scrub your face . These are products that do all the work of cleansing your skin when you apply them to your face . You do n't  have to rub them in or do any extra work for maximum effectiveness . <p> Neutrogena also has retinol products for treating acne that have one thing going for them that most brands do not " they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh and active . Any kind of vitamin you dip out of jar will go bad almost as soon as you open the container due to oxidation . Vitamin products you squeeze out of a tube will stay fresh for several years . <h> What Neutrogena Does Not Do Very Well <p> Most of the products Neutrogena makes for its Deep Clean not only do n't  clean , they can make your skin itch and peel . Their lip balm does not protect the lip against sunburn , and many of the sunscreens are made with alcohol . Adding alcohol to a sunscreen makes your skin feel cool , but it also dries it out and leaves it even more vulnerable to sunburn . <h> Neutrogena Advanced Solutions At Home Microdermabrasion System <p> Dermabrasion at the spa , by an aesthetician , or at the dermatologists office can cost several hundred dollars per visit .

The tiny particles of silica , similar to those to make certain brands of sandpaper , leave your skin with an even tone and feel and probably a healthy glow . The downside to using this product is that it does not have the suction wand used at the spa or doctors office that vacuums the crystals off the face . Your skin can feel gritty for hours after you do the routine . <p> And that 's where users of this system need to be careful . The aluminum oxide crystals can build up in the skin and cause irritation if the system is used too often .

That 's not long enough for it to work . If you follow the instructions , you 'll just rinse any benefits right down the drain . And its not a good idea to make up your own instructions as to how long you can keep any product on your skin without burning , especially if you have brown or black skin that can become permanently discolored " after improper use of a product to remove discoloration ! <h> The Neutrogena Facial Peel That Really Works <p> For about US $10 more ( $24.99 per bottle ) , Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Facial Peel removes discolored , dead skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rub the skin away .

Its not the product you should use at night to take off makeup . <h> Neutrogena Deep Clean Products <p> Neutrogena Deep Clean Products would be terrific , except that most of them include extra ingredients intended to make them " feel " like they are working , and these ingredients redden or dry out the skin . Almost all the Neutrogena Deep Clean product line contains menthol . This chemical from the mint plant makes your skin feel tingly , like its getting cleaner . Unfortunately , that tingle is just mild skin irritation , which is exactly what you do n't  need when you have acne . <p> If you have no allergies and no chemical sensitivities and nothing ever makes you break out suddenly , then Neutrogena Deep Clean Invigorating Foam Cleanser ( US $6.99 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it would be a shame if the menthol in it made your skin red . <h> Neutrogena On the Spot Acne Treatment Vanishing Cream Formula <p> On the Spot Acne Treatment works by penetrating - pores under the skin to kill bacteria that is responsible for causing acne . This helps stop new pimples from being formed . It- is a strong product that can work without leaving your skin dry . With 2.5 percent Benzoyl peroxide , this product is 70 percent as effective as medical acne treatments that have higher doses of Benzoyl peroxide . This makes it quite effective without irritating the skin . Benzoyl peroxide dries up excess oil from the skin , while reducing the size of blemishes . <p> It is oil free and is non-comedogenic , which means that it wont clog your skin pores .

This is n't a bad system- since it takes advantage of multiple ingredients that target to treat the multiple causes of acne . You are required to cleanse and treat your skin two times a day using all the products in the kit . Use the system consistently if you want to see results . <p> Step 1 Skin Polishing Acne Cleanser This is a cleansing scrub with 0.5 percent salicylic acid and micro fine beads .

It also prevents pimples and helps in treating pimples , blackheads and whiteheads . It is best applied topically as a scrub . Avoid scrubbing it over raised blemishes and in areas which have reddened . <p> May be of interest : The plastic beads used in cosmetic products have been the subject of controversy . Research published in December 2013 in a research journal , the Marine Pollution Bulletin , which is a peer reviewed journal , showed that the beads are not toxic to humans but they do not get filtered during sewage treatment . This means that they are building up in sewage systems and could potentially have a negative effect on marine life that eat them . This is given the fact that these beads absorb pollutants while they are in waterways . However , this research was not conclusive , given that the water used for the research was not obtained from actual waterways . <p> Step 2- Acne Control Lotion This is an overnight lotion which disinfects the skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acne .

It has SPF 15 proprietary botanical complex in addition to DermaNaturals . This helps to safeguard the skin from harmful UV rays , while stimulating the development of new and natural healthy skin . This lotion has zinc oxide , which is a broad spectrum sunscreen . However , zinc oxide is not very good when applied on blemishes since it can cause pores to further clog . It also has scented extracts , which can cause irritation on the skin . <p> Even though this is a three step system it does not mean that it is a one stop shop for acne treatment . You can still experiment and see what works for you . This is given the fact that this blend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lotion that could potentially lead to skin irritation on some people . Moreover , it does n't  provide a leave on product with salicylic acid , which can be effective for combating acne . <h> Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash Foam Cleanser <p> Green tea offers many benefits for treating acne , but the menthol is just asking for skin irritation . <p> Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash Foam Cleanser is a creamy product that cleanses the skin . One of the things that has been praised- is the inclusion of neem as one of its ingredients . Neem is an anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory product that fights Staphylococcus epidermidis , which is the bacteria that is responsible for causing many cases- of acne . It also treats Propionibacterium acne . Neem does not irritate the skin . However , the inclusion of menthol as one of the ingredients means- this product can be- irritating to most types of skins . Menthol stimulates the production of excess oil on the pores of the skin , which can result in oily skin becoming oilier . Even though this product has salicylic acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin long enough to have any major positive impact on it . <h> Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control Power Clear Scrub <p> If you have acne , it might be quite tempting to just want to scrub it all the time to get rid of- all the blemishes . But with the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control Power Clear Scrub , you baby your skin with this gentle but exfoliating scrub , whose ingredients provides a mix that helps to soothe the skin . This product has salicylic acid , as well as cucumber and green tea , which is an anti-inflammatory . It also has 2 percent Benzoyl peroxide . It also contains salicylic acid , but since- the product is washed off the face , it does not stay on the skin long enough to have an effect on blemishes . Unfortunately , this scrub also has menthol , which can cause irritation on most skin types . <h> Neutrogena Rapid Clear Oil Control Foam Cleanser <p> The main ingredient in this product is Potassium Stearate . This ingredient is very drying to the skin like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite oily , drying it out is not the solution , since this does n't  help to stop the production of oil . In fact , this may make your acne worse . <h> Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion <p> This lotion has cinnamon extract , otherwise known as cinnamomum zeylancium bark extract , which helps fight Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acne , just the same way neem does . The antibacterial properties in this oil may even work- better than those found in many other antibacterial oils , including- rosemary oil . It- also has 2 percent salicylic acid , which helps to clear skin pores and with a pH of 3.6 , it helps to exfoliate the skin and remove blackheads . Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion has a moisturizing base that makes it quite suitable for normal to dry skin with blemishes . The product contains scented extracts , cinnamon and cedar , that may not cause irritation on the skin given that they are in low quantities . <h> Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash Pink Grapefruit Facial Cleanser <p> This cleanser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What sets them apart is the fact that this product has a grapefruit extract and grapefruit scent . This product may not be very suitable for treating acne , since the 2 percent salicylic acid that the product contains is rinsed off the skin before it has had a chance to have any effect on the skin . The cleansing agent in this product leaves the skin feeling tight and dry . Its a gritty scrub and that combined with the fragrance used may cause skin irritation for many people . <p> Are you looking for an acne care system that contains only reliable products offered with a money-back guarantee ?

@@98778654 @2978654/ <h> Should You Be Taking Acne Supplements ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Vitamin C and E can help prevent dark spots from forming when applied directly to the skin . <p> Scores of nutrition experts recommend taking supplements for fighting acne . But are the recommendations for acne supplements honest and unbiased ? Let 's look at the most popular acne supplements one by one . <h> Summary : <p> The right supplements in the right form can be very helpful in fighting acne . <p> Up to 5,000 IU of vitamin A a day helps rejuvenate the skin and open pores . <p> Vitamin B12 supplements are important if you take Accutane , Retin-A , Tazorac , or Differin . But do n't  take too much . Excessive vitamin B12 itself can also make your skin break out . <p> Vitamin C and vitamin E applied directly to the skin can stop the formation of brown spots as acne heals . <p> Selenium and zinc help " calm " the skin . But do n't  take too much . <p> Probiotics train the immune system to react to bacteria with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered by Exposed Skin Care , are the most reliable way to get the probiotic bacteria you need . <h> Vitamin A Is a Useful Supplement for Acne <p> Vitamin A is the one of the most useful nutritional supplements for acne . Vitamin A in its various forms activate strands of DNA coded to produce proteins that help skin cells mature . Skin cells that live out their normal life cycle constantly migrate to the surface of the skin , where they complete their life cycle and die . Skin cells that are n't  stimulated to mature congregate in the lower layers of the epidermis , keeping the skin tight and bottling up sebum inside pores . <p> The major downside in taking vitamin A is that it is easy to take too much . About 5,000 IU of vitamin A day has optimal benefits for the skin . More than about 50,000 IU of vitamin A sometimes makes the skin grow so fast that it reddens and flakes . Single doses of vitamin A in excess of 50,000 IU have the potential to cause birth defects , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to limit their consumption of the vitamin strictly to 5,000 IU a day and no more . <p> Any kind of vitamin A supplement has to be encapsulated to protect it from oxidation . If you choose to use retinol ( another form of vitamin A ) creams , they only stay fresh if they are in squeeze tubes . Retinol in products in jars oxidizes as soon as you open the container the first time . <h> You May Need Vitamin B Supplements , But They Wont Help Acne <p> If you use Accutane , Retin-A , Tazorac , or Differin , your body may have problems using vitamin B12 . The enzymes that these medications interfere with will work properly if you take supplemental vitamin B12 " but you do n't  want to take large amounts of vitamin B12 you do n't  need . Excess vitamin B12 can make your skin breakout . <p> Do n't  take a stand-alone vitamin B12 or methylcobalamin ( the scientific name for vitamin B12 ) supplement . Vitamin B12 will not work without enough vitamin B6 and folate . Take a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Recommended Daily Intake of any B vitamin . The reason to take a complete B vitamin supplement is that the body uses B vitamins in pairs or triplets , and to use one B vitamin , you always have to have all the others . <h> Vitamin C Is Great for Preventing Brown Spots on the Skin <p> Vitamin C is a nutrient you use on your skin . It is not especially helpful for acne care if you take it as an oral supplement , although you may have other health concerns that benefit from oral vitamin C. <p> The form of this vitamin known as ascorbyl palmitate applied directly to the skin helps prevent the brown spotting that occurs as acne heals , especially on Asian skin . Vitamin C products will not do much for pimples ( they do n't  affect the aspects of the immune system that are active in pimples ) but they will prevent lasting skin damage after acne heals . Be sure to use a product that is squeezed from a tube . Ascorbyl palmitate in a product in a jar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Vitamin D Supplements Are Necessary If You Use Sun Screen <p> In the early 1990s , the Australian national health service waged a campaign on skin cancer . They urged all Australians to slather themselves with sun block every time they went out the door , and it worked . Australians eagerly complied . And skin cancer rates went up , not down . <p> It turns out that vitamin D protects against many forms of cancer , including skin cancer . The skin makes vitamin D when it is exposed to sunlight . If you always use sunscreen , take at least 1,000 IU of vitamin D every day for your general health . Taking supplemental vitamin D is also a good idea during winter . <h> Vitamin E Supplements Are Also Best Directly Applied to the Skin <p> Vitamin E supplements you take by mouth recharge your bodys vitamin C. They also enter into hundreds of cell-protective processes , especially if you have heart disease or diabetes . But to heal your skin after acne , you need vitamin E applied directly to the skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown spots on Asian and naturally brown skin as acne heals . <p> Like vitamin C , vitamin E for skin protection is only useful if it comes in a squeeze tube . Any kind of vitamin E you dip out of a jar will go bad as soon as the container is opened . Look for tocopheryl acetate in the list of ingredients . <h> Go Nuts for Selenium <p> Up to 100 micrograms of selenium per day helps to calm acne-prone skin . This trace mineral is used in the making of dozens of different antioxidant compounds in the human body , many of which reduce inflammation in the skin . <p> You do n't  have to take a selenium supplement . If you are not allergic to tree nuts , you can also eat two or three Brazil nuts a day . They will provide your skin with all the selenium it needs to fight acne , along with healthy essential fatty acids that reduce the production of inflammation . <h> Zinc for Immune Balance <p> Zinc is another mineral element that is important to the health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulant . It is actually an immune modulator . The body uses it to make the regulatory hormones that keep inflammation from destroying acne-prone skin . <p> Zinc is a nutrient you take by mouth . As little as 15 mg a day of any kind of zinc supplement can make a noticeable difference . More , however , is not better . You should never take more than 75 mg of zinc a day for more than 2 days ( when you are fighting a cold ) , and you should not take more than 30 mg of zinc a day on an ongoing basis unless you also take 1 to 3 milligrams of copper per day . <p> The lozenges you use to fight colds wo n't help with acne . Zinc lozenges generate zinc to be spread over the throat with saliva . You need a pill of capsule that your swallow to get zinc into your bloodstream for the health of your skin . <h> Probiotics Train the Immune System <p> The probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilous plays a unique role in fighting acne . Living in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune system to teach it that bacteria are n't  always bad " and it carries this information to the skin where it releases less inflammation against otherwise-harmless acne bacteria . <p> The most reliable way to get probiotics in your colon is using encapsulated supplements .

A foaming , peach acne cream squeezed out of a tube , Clearasil was the most popular acne care product for tens of millions of Americans in the 1950s , 1960s , and 1970s . In fact , for most Americans , it was the only acne care product for decades before other treatments reached the market . <p> Clearasil produces inexpensive acne treatments , but are they really effective acne treatments ? As is the case with many other product lines for getting rid of pimples , the most serious problem with pimple cream is that it uses too many- skin care ingredients that sometimes cause stinging , burning , itching , peeling and new non-inflammatory skin blemishes . But Clearasil makes some inexpensive and effective creams and washes . Let 's look at the leading Clearasil products that work well , some that work well but do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few that do n't  work at all . <h> Summary : <p> Clearasil is one of the best known names in acne care . <p> Clearasil products are inexpensive , and sometimes effective . <p> If you do n't  get stinging , burning , peeling , or itching after using benzoyl peroxide , the acne treatment cream is a great choice for killing bacteria in pimples . <p> The new Clearasil product line includes acne cream that is not tinted in the familiar peach shade . <p> The products in the acne treatment solution contain dangerously acidic skin peels that can and do burn sensitive skin . <p> For just a little more , you can buy safe and effective acne care products from Exposed Skin Care . <h> Clearasil DailyClear Tinted Acne Treatment Cream <p> The most familiar Clearasil product for acne is also the best .

This Clearasil product offers 10% benzoyl peroxide for killing acne bacteria fast , without the familiar peach tint . Its great for killing acne bacteria fast , but like the tinted version of Clearasil , it can also cause itching , peeling , burning , and stinging if it is applied to unblemished skin .

Do n't  expect full resolution of blemishes in less than a week , however . Like the other popular Clearasil products , it is too strong to use all over your face . <h> Clearasil Ultra Overnight Wash <p> Here is a product that is advertised as " dermatologist tested and clinically tested to help visibly reduce redness and pimple size by morning to give visibly clearer skin . " While it certainly will get dirt , grease , makeup off your skin , the salicylic acid that reduces redness and pimple size get washed down the drain just a few seconds after you apply them to your face .

If you have sensitive skin , you wont have any problems with either Ultra Overnight Wash or Daily Clear Daily Face Wash for Sensitive Skin , but why not buy the latter , since it sells for just US $5.29 ? Both products will get your skin clean , but neither product will clear up blackheads or pimples . <h> Clearasil Pore Cleansing Pads <p> These pore cleansing pads are supposed to remove dirt and makeup with a small amount of sodium hydroxide , which is also known as lye . They are supposed to open pores with salicylic acid , and the pads include the right amount of salicylic acid to do the job .

Even at the bargain price of US $5.49 for 90 pads , Clearasil Pore Cleansing Pads ca n't be recommended . <p> This daily face wash certainly has an attractive price , just US $4.99 for 6.5 fluid oz/195 ml . It is great for getting rid of makeup without the need for using cold cream .

A squeeze bulb or squeeze bag filled with liquid is attached to a hose that ends with a syringe , and the syringe is inserted into the anus . In North America and Europe , the syringe is usually lubricated , but in Latin America and Asia , it usually is not . Liquid is squeezed from the bulb or bag into the rectum , and the user clinches butt cheeks while getting in position over the toilet . When pressure on the anus is released , the enema fluid and fecal matter are expelled . <p> There are several reasons enemas are used as a legitimate medical procedure . One is to loosen the stool so it is easier to have a bowel movement . This requires " holding time , " so the enema fluid can loosen and soften the stool . The cheeks of the buttocks have to be held tight for up to an hour while the stool is liquified . The net effect of this procedure is similar to using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another reason to use an enema is to stimulate the bowels . This used to be done by adding castille soap to the enema solution , but the problem with adding soap to the enema solution is that it not only stimulates bowel movement , it inflames the colon . Adding mineral oil to the enema also stimulates bowel movement , but can cause griping , ejection of small amounts of feces that can stain the users undergarments for up to 36 to 48 hours after the enema . <p> Enemas used to be used as preparation for colonoscopy or colon surgery , but this use has fallen out of favor with most gastroenterologists . The reason doctors do n't  order enemas as often as they once did has to do with the anatomy of the colon . <p> The colon twists and turns as it descends to the anus . Because of the colons shape inside the human body , enemas remove far more fecal matter from the right side of the colon than from the left side of the colon . When the gastroenterologist needs to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the colon , or to perform surgery on the left side of the colon , removal of fecal matter is usually accomplished from the top down , by drinking large amounts ( up to several gallons , that is , 10-12 liters ) of laxative solution over a period of up to 48 hours . Often , preparation for colonoscopy or bowel procedures does not involve enemas at all . <h> What Benefit Could Enemas Have for Acne ? <p> Enemas for acne have usually been justified by the claim that acne is a result of toxins , and enemas remove toxins . Ironically , some of the solutions used to " detoxify " the colon , such as hydrogen peroxide , can cause severe skin reactions on the face , and coffee enemas have even resulted in deaths . <p> The theory behind the use of enemas in fighting acne is a nineteenth-century idea called auto-intoxication . In the era before the colon could be directly observed in living people , a Russian physician named Ilya Illich Mechnikov popularized the idea that food could rot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Colonic irrigation " with enemas became ( and remains ) popular as an easy treatment for the alleged disease . But as early as 1919 , doctors already knew that food does not rot in the colon the same way it might rot in the garbage can , even when constipation is severe . <p> The idea that food rotting in the colon could cause outbreaks in the skin also turned out to be false , but that did not mean that there is no relationship between colon health and fighting acne . Instead , the connection turned out to be that what you add to your colon fights inflammation in your skin , not what you flush away from your colon . <h> Probiotic Bacteria and Acne <p> In the 1930s , two American doctors , John H. Stokes and Donald M. Pillsbury , discovered a relationship between healthy , probiotic bacteria in the colon and both acne and depression . During the 1920s , American doctors had started noticing that depression and acne occur at the same time . This probably should not have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors also noted that probiotics they were trying as a treatment for depression also cleared up acne . Brewers yeast , as hard as it may be for some people in the twenty-first century to believe , became a common prescription for acne , and it worked . Yogurt , which contains Lactobacillus bacteria , was not commonly available during that era , but it worked even better . <p> It was over 70 years before American physician Whitney P. Bowe and Canadian dermatologist Alan C. Logan explained why probiotic bacteria in the colon have such a beneficial effect on the skin . In acne , it turns out , inflammation is not caused by acne bacteria . Redness , itchiness , and swelling are actually caused by the action of the immune system on the skin , as it tries to reduce the number of bacteria in a pore . <p> The immune system also tries to get rid of brewers yeast bacteria and Lactobacillus bacteria from yogurt when they arrive in the colon , but it quickly learns that inflammation is not necessary to keep the colon healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred to the immune system in the skin , and pimples are n't  quite as red , or itchy , or inflamed , and there is less hardening of sebum to trap acne bacteria in whiteheads or blackheads . <p> Maintaining healthy , probiotic bacteria in the colon clears up the skin . Flushing them away as if they were toxins , however , harms the skin . <h> How to Use Probiotics to Clear Up Acne <p> The most effective way to take probiotics is by taking a product like Alive ! , mixed with juice and taken once a day , or by taking probiotic capsules between meals . These supplements contain large numbers of helpful bacteria that survive passage through stomach acid . More helpful bacteria reach the colon when you take supplements than when you eat yogurt . <p> But if you would prefer to eat yogurt , eat it with meals , but not when the meal includes soup , which lengthens the time food stays in the stomach , or when you have eaten bitter foods , which increase the production of stomach acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than a cup of yogurt eaten in one serving . <p> You can , if you wish , also eat cakes of brewers yeast , available in your grocers dairy case . They are more palatable when added to smoothies . <p> Probiotics wont clear up your skin overnight , but you should see results in one to two weeks .

The fact is , some of the things well-intentioned experts recommend for treating acne actually make it worse . Knowing what causes your breakouts is essential to stopping them . <h> Summary : <p> A splash of alcohol on your face to disinfect acne may actually increase the production of skin oils . <p> Eating dark chocolate can cause acne breakouts of 4 to 80 pimples in less than a week . <p> Health conditions that increase testosterone production in women can trigger acne . <p> Testosterone injections in men can trigger a serious form of acne known as acne fulminans . <p> Sudden changes in temperature can trigger rosacea . <p> Oral antibiotics can trigger acne by killing bacteria in the colon that help keep inflammation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin ( which is not the same thing as using a skin scrub ) can trigger acne. <h> 1 . Acne breakouts can be triggered by rubbing alcohol . <p> Rubbing alcohol , also known by its chemical name , isopropyl alcohol , is not unusual in many acne products . It cools the skin as it evaporates , and it leaves the skin feeling tingly . Many acne care products add alcohol to make it feel as if they cause a " skin healing action , " but the action of alcohol on the skin is usually anything but healing . <p> Alcohol dries out the skin and kills skin cells in the delicate linings of pores . When the skin senses destruction of healthy tissue , it protects itself " by making more sebum . This can set off a cycle of cleansing and excess oil production .

As many as 80 pimples can break out after eating just three dark chocolate bars . The offending ingredient seems to be theobromine , which is also the constituent of chocolate that makes it , well , yummy . Dark chocolate is more of a problem than milk chocolate . <h> 3 . Acne breakouts can be triggered by hormonal changes , especially those related to testosterone . <p> Millions of women have a condition known as polycystic ovarian syndrome , or PCOS . This health issue may or may not involve cysts in the ovaries but it always involves a hormonal imbalance involving over-production of testosterone by the ovaries . Excess testosterone makes the skin more sensitive to stress chemicals , which in turn increase skin oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no allergen to activate the allergy . <p> In men , testosterone injections sometimes cause a dangerous condition called acne fulminans , involving not just the skin but also joints . In both cases , however , the secret to controlling acne is lowering testosterone . Usually women with PCOS respond to low-calorie diets , and men with acne fulminans begin to recover when they stop using steroids and testosterone . <h> 4 . Acne breakouts can be triggered by sudden changes in temperature . <p> Rosacea is a form of acne that comes on suddenly after changes in temperature . When the skin cools , blood vessels dilate . They take in more blood to bring it close to the skin so the bloodstream can bring the skin back down to the same temperature as the rest of the body . In rosacea , the linings of tiny capillaries in the skin over the cheeks and nose leaks , causing redness , or break , causing purple streaks .

Acne breakouts can occur after physically scrubbing the skin . <p> The kind of " scrub " that is used to treat acne does not involve mechanically rubbing or scrubbing the skin . An acne scrub refers to the use of a product that removes dead skin or particles of hardened oil from the skin by a very mild abrasive action " usually without the helping of working the product into the skin . <p> The reason not to scrub the skin with a washcloth , or , even worse , a brush , is that the skin protects itself by creating more sebum , and in turn the newly created sebum clogs pores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 6 . Acne breakouts can occur after stress . <p> When we experience physical or emotional stress , the brain releases corticotrophin stimulating hormone , which instructs the adrenal glands to make adrenalin . The skin can also release corticotrophin stimulating hormone , causing it to release histamine , the same chemical released in an allergy attack . This reddens and irritates the skin , highlighting existing pimples , and blocking previously open pores . <h> 7 . Acne breakouts can be triggered by yeast infections . <p> Yeast infections sensitize the immune system . Sometimes the immune system is activated by a yeast infection to attack skin on the back , chest , and shoulder with tiny red blotches of psoriatic acne , also known as guttate psoriasis . Acne bacteria are not involved in the formation of these pimples . They are solely due to the action of the immune system in the skin .

This article answers the most frequently asked questions about acne prevention and care in a womans life , beginning with the most important questions about acne in girls . <h> Summary : <p> Throughout the lives , girls and women need special acne care . <p> Acne in girls who have not yet had their first period is usually due to stress . <p> Premenstrual acne is caused by progesterone and relieved by estrogen . <p> Birth control pills that are relatively high in estrogen often clear up blemishes . <p> Women who have PCOS ( polycystic ovarian syndrome ) sometimes can clear up acne by low-calorie dieting . <p> Tretinoin treatments can relieve both blemishes and wrinkles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on brown skin . <p> Certain ingredients in cosmetics can cause breakouts at any time of life . <p> Isopropyl alcohol often makes the skin oilier . <p> The easiest way to deal with acne is to use an acne treatment system , such as Exposed Skin Care . <p> Q. When little girls get acne , is it a sign of early puberty ? A. Although early puberty in girls can trigger early acne , even as young as age six , more often than not girls get acne due " adrenarche , " maturation of the adrenal glands , rather than menarche , maturation of the ovaries . When the adrenal glands begin making large amounts of a substance known as DHEA , the skin can start using this substance to make its own stress hormones . <p> Acne that girls suffer before puberty is aggravated by stress hormones , rather than by sex hormones . Reducing stress in the environment and stress on the skin ( ill-advised experiments with cosmetics , harsh soaps in the washroom and gym at school , and mite-filled classrooms , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do girls get acne about the same time they get their periods ? A. Right after puberty , the ovaries produce unusually large amounts of not just estrogen but also testosterone ( although girl produce much less total testosterone than boys ) . Testosterone stimulates the production of sebocytes , the skin cells that make sebum . Maturing sebocytes , in turn , are especially sensitive to the skins stress hormones . It is a combination of sexual maturity and stress that causes acne-prone skin in both girls and boys as they mature sexually . <p> Q. What causes premenstrual acne ? A. In the first half of a womans period , her body produces more estrogen than progesterone . Estrogen tends to " calm " the skin and also to lower core body temperature . In the second half of a womans period , her body produces more progesterone than estrogen . Progesterone hardens the lining of the uterus so it can either receive a fertilized egg or slough off at the next menstruation .

A. Birth control pills are usually a combination of estrogen and a synthetic form of progesterone known as progestin . Estrogen is the component of the Pill that stops acne . But estrogen also stimulates growth of certain cancers and increases the risk of blood clots . Too much estrogen can also cause outbreaks of acne . <p> Most women and their doctors can find a brand of the Pill that is safe for them and that reduces premenstrual acne outbreaks . The Pill itself , however , will not eliminate acne . Usually there is a reduction of in the number of blemishes , up to about 60% . <p> Q. I have PCOS . What can I do about acne other than the usual acne care ? A. About 50% of women who have acne caused by PCOS begin to see clearing in their skin when they go on reduced-calorie diets that result in weight loss . It only takes a little weight loss to see a major change in symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually no more than 3 pounds/1-1/2 kilos . <p> The reason weight loss helps clear up acne caused by PCOS is that symptoms are caused by excessive production of testosterone . Usually women who have PCOS also have a condition known as insulin resistance . Many tissues in their body shut down receptors for insulin , leaving more sugar in the bloodstream . <p> The ovaries , however , can not turn off insulin receptors . They are flooded with sugar that they have to " burn " to prevent free radical damage to the eggs within . The ovaries use the extra energy to make more estrogen and more testosterone , which causes mood swings , hair growth , and acne . When women diet , they remove just enough sugar from circulation to bring testosterone levels back to more nearly normal levels . The skin clears up , unwanted hair growth often stops , and fertility may also return . <p> Q. Why would a woman who never had acne before suddenly develop acne during menopause ? A.

Sometimes a new cosmetic makes me break out . Is there any way I can learn what not to buy to avoid breakouts ? A. Throughout a womans life , the skin repairs itself with the help of sebum .

It may be the better blood flow that does that . But it seems to reduce the formation of tiny blue and purple veins in the skin . <p> What does an aloe moisturizer do for the skin ? At first it would seem that the answer would be " not much , " since rosacea is not caused by drying of the skin and does not dry the skin out .

@@98778663 @2978663/ <h> Treating Acne and Scars with Fractional Radiofrequency Microneedling 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Laser treatments are popular in treating many skin conditions . Yet , the traditional ablative laser technology has many problems . These lasers can easily damage the uppermost layer of skin called the epidermis . Its also very difficult to control the depth to which these lasers penetrate the skin . But the modern fractional technology overcomes these disadvantages of the ablative lasers . The latest fractional radiofrequency microneedle devices are much less invasive , less damaging and offer greater selectivity in treatment . <p> Microneedles are very small , microscopic needles that can penetrate only to a certain depth in the skin . The latest fractional radiofrequency devices use insulated microneedles and radiofrequency to deliver energy to heat up a very specific area within the dermis of the skin . The use of radiofrequency and microneedles allow the delivery of energy at a very specific point , so it dramatically reduces the risk of harming the epidermis at all . This technology has been very successfully used in the treatment of wrinkles , atrophic scars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study regarding the effects and actions of non-ablative radiofrequency treatment was done by scientists from the Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine .

But its not necessarily the best . This article takes a look at what goes into a good online store and what Exposed Skin Care is doing to model the best online acne stores . <h> Summary : <p> Online shopping gives you more product choices and 24-hour convenience . <p> Amazon is the worlds largest retailer of acne care products , but they are not necessarily the best . <p> Amazon encourages you to keep trying new products , rather than offering you the lowest prices on products you know will work . <p> An acne online store can be a better option than Amazon . <p> The best online acne product stores offer a variety of acne products for a variety of skin types , but they specialize in acne and know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores believe in what they sell , and back up their claims with a money-back guarantee . <h> Why Not Get All Your Acne Products from Amazon ? <p> There is a lot to said for online shopping at Amazon .

Products that are fulfilled by Amazon sometimes are shipped without delivery charges , and if you live in the United States , you wont have to pay sales tax ( at least not yet ) . <p> But there are good reasons Amazon is not the ideal acne online store . <p> Amazon is not in the business of giving you products that will clear up your skin . Amazon is in the business of getting you to buy products " and the more products , the better . After you buy one acne care product and you are beginning to see benefits , Amazon will probably suggest that " since you bought " the first product , maybe you should try a second . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep using it long to know for sure whether it works , you may never find the acne care products you need . <p> Amazon also is not in the business of establishing long-term customer relationships for the manufacturers whose goods they sell .

From time to time Exposed Acne Care , for instance , offers all of its products for 40% off . This does n't  happen on Amazon . <p> And if you buy from Amazon , you will pay more . The manufacturer has to give Amazon a percentage of each sale " and you pay it . <h> What to Look for in a Good Acne Online Store <p> The best sites for buying acne products are sites that only sell acne products . You are more likely to be getting products that are specifically made for treating acne . If you contact customer service at Amazon , they can give you information on shipping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you contact customer service for a vendor of acne products , they can talk with you about acne . <p> Most online stores that sell acne products and only acne products give you better products at a better price than Amazon . But some online acne product stores are better than others . <p> The best online acne product stores offer a variety of products . They do n't  promote any one product as the " acne answer " for everyone . After all , people who have acne have different skin colors , different degrees of skin moisture , different sensitivities to chemicals and botanical ingredients , and , yes , different budgets . Some who has fair dry skin prone to rosacea does not need the same acne care products as someone who has dark oily skin and a problem with blackheads . <p> The product that works for one person who has acne may not work for the next .

If there is the slightest doubt whether a product has worked for you , you can ask for your money back . That is not something you can do with most other online acne stores . <p> The next thing you will notice about Exposed Skin- Care is that it offers a variety of acne care products . Maybe you already have a cleanser you are happy with but you need to do something about sensitive skin .

Not everyone who has acne needs every product . <p> On the other hand , it you are just beginning to get acne under control , chances are that you need multiple skin care products . A good online acne store like Exposed Skin Care offers bundles of products at a discount " and you will know that they are all compatible . There should be different options for different skin care needs , more products for people who are just beginning to treat acne , and fewer products for people who need clear skin maintenance . <p> Finally , a good online acne products store should be owned by people who believe in their products . Claims that product will get rid of blemishes in 24 hours or in 3 days should be met with skepticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer your month back if it does n't  work for you . But if a site claims that 98% of users of their products get clear skin in 30 days , and then backs up the claim with one-year money-back guarantee , you can have a lot more confidence in their claims . <p> There are certain kinds of acne no one should try to treat on their own at home . Cystic acne nearly always need prescription retinoids ( although you might get some benefit from tretinoin topical ) . Acne conglobata ca n't be controlled by any product , either over-the-counter or prescription-only , that you put on your skin . And steroid acne requires immediate changes in steroid use , not acne products . <p> But if you have mild to moderate common acne you can get the products you need from an acne store online . Just be sure to stick with the store with the best prices and the best service . 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778665 @2978665/ <h> Will a Chemical Peel Cure Your Acne and Scars ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Chemical peels work by stripping off the dead skin cells , allowing for newer cells to take their place . <p> Using chemicals to strip off dead cells from the surface of the skin is a highly effective , if somewhat risky , way to accelerate the healing of active acne and old scars . There are products you can only get at a doctors office or a spa , and there are products you can use at home . Not everybody , however , should treat every kind of acne with a chemical peel . <h> Summary : <p> At-home acne chemical peels loosen the " glue " that holds dead skins on the surface of the skin . <p> Removing dead skin cells allows newer , more naturally colored skin cells to move to the surface , and opens up pores . <p> The most commonly used over-the-counter chemical peels for acne are AHAs and BHAs . AHAs are used on skin types that do n't  form permanent brown coloration after they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin to prevent and remove black spots on the skin . <p> At-home chemical peels are OK as often as every other day if you do not use scrubs or exfoliants . <p> A chemical peel almost never gets rid of existing brown spots without the help of whitening agent , but you need to be sure to use the right whitening agent for your skin type . <p> A complete acne treatment system like Exposed Skin Care will minimize your need for peels . <h> How Chemical Peels Heal Acne-Prone Skin <p> Beauty experts have been using chemical peels to heal the skin for thousands of years , although the ancient beauties of legend probably did not realize that they were using acids to strip away dead cells from the epidermis of the skin . The famed Egyptian queen Cleopatra was known to bathe in tubs of milk . Milk contains lactic acid , which is even in the twenty-first century still used as a chemical peel for acne . The nineteenth century starlet Lily Langtry was said to bathe her face in apple cider vinegar to fight the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American West . Vinegar is a form of acetic acid , which is still used in homemade acne chemical peels . <p> Chemical peels lift dead skin off the surface of the skin . This makes room for more skin cells to migrate upward to the surface of the skin from the basal layers below . These younger skin cells have more natural skin tones than the dead skin cells they replace . They are smaller , so the skin is not as tight . This gives pores more room to drain so they do n't  clog with dead skin cells and sebum . And the act of using a chemical peel on the skin stimulates the production of collagen beneath the skin . This fills in pitted scars and makes the skin both strong and flexible . <h> Choosing the Right Chemical Peel for Your Skin <p> Every skin peel , however , does not work for every case of acne . Some products work well on some kinds of skin and do n't  work at all on others . <p> Alpha-hydroxy acids , also known as AHAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of the skin . All over-the-counter acne chemical peels are alpha-hydroxy acids except salicylic acid . <p> Beta-hydroxy acids , also known as BHAs , also loosen dead skin cells on the surface of the skin , but they are generally milder than beta-hydroxy acids . Salicylic acid is the only beta-hydroxy acid used in skin care . One of the byproducts of sebum broken down by acne bacteria , propanoic acid , is also a beta-hydroxy acid . <p> Omega-hydroxy acids , which are so seldom discussed that they do n't  have a commonly used abbreviation , are the acids that break up the waxy surface of leaves and stems of plants . If you come across a skin care product advertising omega-hydroxy acids , do n't  use it . These chemicals have no benefit for human skin . <p> Glycolic acid is the most commonly used chemical peel for acne-prone skin . It is typically use to open the skin rather than to remove brown spots . It is more often used on dry and tight skin rather than on oily and loose skin . Glycolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 10% in over-the-counter products , and up to 30% in products used under medical supervision . <p> Lactic acid is the acid found in milk . It is especially useful for removing brown spots on tight , oily skin . It is a product you would use " with caution " on brown spots around the eyes . <p> Salicyclic acid is used on dark skin . It is both a peel and an anti-inflammatory . Salicylic acid is used in much lower concentrations ( never more than 3% ) than glycolic acid . <h> How to Use Acne Chemical Peels <p> Chemical peels produce immediate color in the skin . It is tempting to use them every day . If you use retinol , Retin-A , tretinoin topical , or any skin care product labeled as containing either alpha-hydroxy acids or beta-hydroxy acids , however , you should use peels no more often than once a week . <p> You should not use both a scrub and a peel . Pick one or the other . Using both products can leave skin red and irritated . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin , you can use a chemical peel as often as every other day as long as you do not experience redness or irritation . If you have dark brown or black skin , you should use a BHA product , not AHAs , and you should start with the lowest possible concentration to make sure you do n't  irritate your skin . If salicylic acid causes irritation , you will need to rely on scrubs and skin lighteners . <p> On the other hand , if your objective is to remove spots after acne , you need both a peel and a lightener . Hydroquinone usually is OK for fair skin , but it can be disastrous on Asian and African skin types , sometimes causing permanent black and blue discoloration of the skin . Arbutin , azelaic acid , kojic acid are safe for all skin types , but you should rotate products every time you finish a jar of the skin lightener . This keeps you from reinforcing any undesirable changes that make occur as an unexpected " quirk " of your skin . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will probably be treated with a much stronger product . The AHAs you get in over-the-counter products are only strong enough to dissolve the " glue " that holds dead skin cells to your face . The AHAs you get at the doctors office have a pH so low that they send healthy skin cells into shock and they die . This does help remove excess layers of skin that may be keeping pores tight , but it also causes much more irritation to your skin . Used skillfully , however , AHAs may make the skin clear and plump . <p> Dermatologists also do treatments with phenol and trichloroacetic acid to remove more layers of skin . These toxic skin peels may be mixed with croton oil or septisol to make them penetrate even deeper into the skin . <p> These potentially dangerous skin peels have been largely replaced by laser resurfacing . The only time a chemical peel is likely to be used at the doctors office is when treatment of acne or acne scars with laser would leave a noticeable line on the skin . 19923 @qwx879923

While both dryness and sun are enemies of healthy skin , it turns out the old advice to expose acne to the light of day was partially correct . Visible blue light , it turns out , can kill acne . <h> Summary : <p> Visible blue light kills acne bacteria . <p> Three blue light treatments kill about 99.99% of acne bacteria that the light reaches , although some acne bacteria live deep in pores . <p> Red light therapy can help shrink the sebaceous glands that produce the oil that clogs pores . <p> Light treatment alone , however , only treats blemishes and pimples after the fact . <p> A complete acne care system is always needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light treatment helps you get control over acne , but a complete acne care system helps you keep control over acne . <h> How Killing Bacteria Heals Acne <p> Before getting into how blue light kills acne bacteria , it is helpful to review how killing acne bacteria cures acne . Many people suppose that if they just kill acne bacteria , all their acne problems are over . The fact is , bacterial infection is just part of the problem of acne . <p> Skin pores sit on top of oil-producing sebaceous glands . The sebum produced by these glands keeps the skin flexible , and also helps transport dead skin cells from the bottom and the lining of the pore up to the surface of the skin where they can be rinsed away . <p> Sometimes dead skin cells clump together and clog the pore . Or inflammation of the skin triggers production of excessive amounts of skin oil . When this happens , acne bacteria can be locked inside . The bacteria attempt to " break out " so they can move on to another pore first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into essential fatty acids that are beneficial to them but harmful to the bacteria . This can keep them in check . But if the problem is the pore is clogged with dead skin , then the bacteria have another way out . <p> Bacteria release chemicals sensitizing surrounding skin cells to inflammatory chemicals released by the human immune system . The immune system releases histamine and interleukin-8 to attack the bacteria , but winds up attacking the skin . A pimple pops up and provides the bacteria an escape route . Many bacteria are killed by the immune system , but many survive to colonize another pore . <p> Killing bacteria stops them from making skin sensitive to inflammation . But just killing bacteria does nothing to stop production of excess skin oil or to repair the skin . Killing bacteria is always just part of acne skin care . Its also necessary to follow a skin care routine to keep the skin in balance . <h> How Blue Light Kills Acne Bacteria <p> Acne bacteria are killed by visible blue light , that is , light you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 420 nanometers . The bacteria have pigments in their protective cell membranes that resonate at those frequencies . These pigments break down the membrane , eventually killing the bacterium . <p> Oddly enough , your immune system plays a big role in the formation of acne . <p> On a Petri dish , three exposures to blue light kill about 99.99% of acne bacteria . In the skin , the kill rate is not as high . That is because blue light can not reach very far into the skin , and acne in deep pores or in cysts beneath skin are unaffected . Even so , many people who use blue light report noticeable results in as little as a day , because killing bacteria stops inflammation " the immune system stops producing inflammatory chemicals to kill bacteria because the bacteria are already dead . <h> Red Light Relieves Inflammation <p> Blue light has an immediate effect on pimples , and a longer-term effect on whiteheads and blackheads . Blue light can keep whiteheads and blackheads from getting worse , although they have to be removed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light to skin treatment , however , treats deeper pores . Red light can travel further into the skin than blue light . It can also generate heat at the level of the sebaceous glands . If red light is not used in excess , it can shrink the glands and reduce sebum production . If so much red light is used that the skin burns , however , the effect is the opposite greater sebum production . <h> Using Light to Treat Acne <p> The best way to use light to treat acne is to use a combination of blue light and red light , but making sure the light is not so intense that the skin burns . It is even better to treat the skin with intense pulsed light , short bursts of multicolored light that can heat and shrink the sebum-producing pores . <p> A red and/or blue home light treatment lamp is not going to cause any kind of damage to the skin if it is used as directed . People who assume that if a little light cures acne slowly a lot of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy . <p> Intense pulse light , however , is riskier . Since it heats glands that lie deeper in the skin , it can cause burns and swelling unless it is used exactly as directed . Never , ever give yourself longer or " extra " light treatments beyond the recommendations of the makers of your lamp . <h> At Home Treatments or- in Office Treatments ? <p> You can choose to either carry out the treatments at home or you can visit a dermatologist- to- to have it done in-office . <p> At home treatments are best used to deal with pustules and papules , which are common everyday zits- that many people face . Studies show that its decently effective at helping clear inflammatory acne and its generally safe to use in addition to other treatments . However , more severe cases of acne often wo n't respond very well with- at home treatments . This includes whiteheads , blackheads , nodules and cysts . <p> Note : Avoid using light therapy together with isotretinoin ( Accutane ) . <p> The advantages of at home treatments include the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as your skin peeling or drying , which can often occur with the use of- topical prescription products .

Pick a device that is easy to use , has been well designed and uses advanced technology . Use reviews and before and after photos to your advantage , but do n't  completely rely on what you read online either . Ask around and see if you can find personal recommendations or see if your doctor can recommend one . <p> The downside to only carrying out at home treatments though , is you probably will not get the best- results .

Its also been shown that using blue light therapy along with red light can have better results than blue light alone . <p> The disadvantage of in office treatments is that you will need several sessions if you are to see any noticeable difference . Given that you have to pay for each session , the costs can easily add up and make it quite expensive to get treatment .

@@98778668 @2978668/ <h> Understanding Acne Treatments like Ziana 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Using a combination of clindamycin and tretinoin may reduce acne by up to 80% . <p> Ziana is a prescription medication that combines the antibiotic clindamycin with the exfoliant and skin rejuvenator tretinoin . Combining these two proven acne fighters with tolerability in mind , Ziana only has to be used once a day , and the manufacturer offers assistance with the cost of treatment for people with mild to moderate acne who have low incomes . But Ziana is not the best choice for everyone who has mild to moderate acne . <h> Summary : <p> Ziana is a prescription medication that combines the antibiotic clindamycin with the retinoid skin peeling agent tretinoin topical . <p> Used by itself , clindamycin usually gets rid of just 20% to 25% of blemishes over 10 to 12 weeks , mostly pimples . <p> Used by itself , tretinoin topical usually gets rid of just 30% to 35% of blemishes over 10 to 12 weeks , mostly blackheads and whiteheads . <p> The combination of clindamycin and tretinoin together may get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less , including pimples , blackheads , and whiteheads . <p> Ziana works best on fair skin . <p> A combination of clindamycin and salicylic acid may be more effective on Asian or light brown skin . <p> Once you have used Ziana to get acne under control , keep acne under control with Exposed Skin Care . <p> Since Ziana gel is a topical treatment and not in pill form it is often considered a safer product because it is targeting the skin area directly instead of delivering antibiotics to the entire body . This gel is less aggressive than Doryx and other acne pills and can be prescribed for mild to severe cases . <p> The antibiotic power of Ziana comes from clindamycin . This " kinder , gentler " antibiotic is the treatment of choice for treating acne skin infections in Canada and Europe . American doctors are more likely to prescribe an antibiotic called minocycline , but the advantage of clindamycin is that it not only fights acne bacteria , it also breaks down sebum on the skin . This deprives acne bacteria of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though clindamycin has an effect on skin oils , it still is more beneficial for pimples than for whiteheads and blackheads . <p> Topical tretinoin is a " kinder , gentler " version of the medication known as Retin-A . When it is applied to the skin , it switches off genes in skin cells that make the intercellular " glue " that holds them together . Dead skin cells flake off and can be rinsed away , and younger skin cells have an easier pathway to the surface . Tretinoin is more beneficial for blackheads and whiteheads than for pimples . <p> Clinical tests have found that clindamycin gel used alone eliminates , on average , about 20% of all blemishes on acne-prone skin in 10 to 12 weeks . Tretinoin gel used alone eliminates , on average , about 30% of all blemishes on acne-prone skin in the same time period . The combination of clindamycin and tretinoin topical gel eliminates , on average , 70% to 80% of blemishes on acne-affected skin in 12 weeks or less , and sometimes results in complete clearing of the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pimples caused by mild to moderate acne can make a huge difference in appearance , leaving only those blemishes that are relatively easy to cover up . <p> Unlike other acne prescription treatments , Ziana gel contains retinol , which helps speed up the regeneration cycle of the skin . And since Ziana contains a topical retinoid , as well as an antibiotic agent it can be used to treat different types of this acne , including acne that is related to increased sebum production and clogged pores . Some users have also experienced relief using this gel for hormonal acne but it is generally not prescribed- when hormones are the suspected culprit of the acne . <h> How to Use Ziana <p> Lemon and lime oils , menthol or mint and green tea extract should be avoided . <p> Ziana is applied to skin once every 24 hours , just before going to bed . The skin is cleansed and patted dry , and a lump of Ziana about the size of a pea ( 1-2 grams ) is spread over the face with clean fingertips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mouth , and it is a good idea to sleep on your back to avoid rubbing off Ziana into the pillowcase . Ziana should not be used more than once a day . <p> Ziana exposes new , sensitive skin . It is important to avoid putting anything on the skin that irritates it even more , such as alcohol . The use of an astringent or any product containing witch hazel cancels out the benefits of tretinoin topical . Astringents and witch hazel bind the skin together while tretinoin dissolves the glue that keeps old skin on the surface . Green tea extracts are also incompatible with Ziana , as is any product that contains lemon juice , lemon oil , lime juice , lime oil , mint , or menthol . <p> The makers of Ziana advise that users of their product should wear sunscreen and avoid exposure to wind . Eating spicy foods can activate rosacea , which will be more noticeable if you are using rosacea . <h> Can Anything Go Wrong with Ziana ? <p> If you have rosacea , you should not use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosacea flares even leakier , and increase the severity of outbreaks . Ziana is for mild to moderate acne that is caused by clogged pores . <p> Getting the clindamyin component of Ziana in your mouth sometimes causes severe diarrhea and/or heartburn . On that note , people suffering from Crohns disease , ulcerated colitis or other inflammatory bowel diseases should not use Ziana gel because the ingredient clindamycin may worsen the symptoms of diarrhea . Ziana gel should also not be used by women that are pregnant or breast-feeding. - Swallowing an overdose of Ziana can kill most of the bacteria in the colon except Clostridium difficile . These bacteria can then grow into a membrane over the colon that prevents the absorption of water and food , with life-threatening consequences . These complications are unheard of in people who use Ziana as directed . <p> Precautions : <p> 1 . Ziana gel should never be applied on broken , cut , ulcerated or dry skin . <p> 2 . Make sure that no medication gets in your eyes , mouth or nose . If any does get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 to 10 minutes . <p> 3 . Other gels , lotions and skin cream should not be put on the facial area a minimum of one hour before applying Ziana . After its application other skin care products should not be applied for at least two hours . <p> 4 . You may find that your skin is more weather-sensitive as a result of the Tretinoin and may need extra protection from both hot and cold temperature extremes as well as from extreme winds . <p> Is It Safe to Take Ziana Gel with Other Medications ? <p> There is only a low risk of a negative interactions when you 're taking other medications since this is a topical treatment and only a low-level of medication is absorbed into the body . As with any medication , however , you should let your doctor know about any other drugs , supplements , vitamins and herbs that you are taking . <h> How Long Will It Take to See Results ? <p> When you first start the treatment process you 'll likely notice that your skin becomes red , starts itching and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a temporary reaction and one that is expected . A small amount of moisturizer may be applied if you 're experiencing moderate itching . In 2 to 4 weeks the acne lesions should begin to disappear and fade and once they are gone the medication will no longer be required . <h> Are There People Who Do Better With a Different Product ? <p> If you have Asian skin , chances are that you will do better with a combination of clindamycin and beta-hydroxy acids ( the only beta-hydroxy acid used in skin care is salicylic acid ) than you will do on Ziana . Tests in Iran found that Ziana eliminated up to 73% of blemishes on Asian-toned skin , but the combination of clindamycin and salicylic acid eliminated up to 88% . <p> If you have fair , tight skin that forms small red pimples , you are likely to get a very good result from Ziana . If you have skin with dark gold or brown tones that moves freely when you smile , then you may get better results from a combination of clindamycin and salicyclic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The MediSAVE program offsets part of the cost of Ziana for patients who have insurance . In the United States , brand-name medications like Ziana can cost up to 100 times more than their generic counterparts . Insurance may refuse to pay for them . If you have insurance , buying Ziana with a MediSAVE may save you from having to shell out up to several hundred dollars for higher co-pays for this " non-formulary " medication . <p> MediSAVE wont compensate for Ziana bought with federally funded health insurance programs such as Medicare and Medicaid . If you do n't  have any insurance at all , MediSAVE wont help you get Ziana , but you may still benefit from asking your doctor to give you a prescription for a clindamycin cream that you use with 0.05% tretinoin topical you buy over-the-counter . <h> Prevention Is Better than Cure <p> Ziana may be exactly what you need to take care of a long-term acne problem .

The truth is that individual foods have very little influence on acne all by themselves , either for making acne better or for making acne worse . Certain foods eaten in excess , however , even healthy foods eaten in excess , can have unexpected and undesirable effects . <p> This article presents- an A to Z review of important foods and their effects on acne . <h> Summary : <p> Foods do n't  have a tremendous influence on acne either for better or for worse . <p> Dark chocolate triggers pimple production in people who already have acne but milk chocolate usually does not . The problem is a chemical called theobromine . This plant chemical " excites " the skin and increases oil production . The problem is not the healthy fats found in chocolate . <p> Cows milk may trigger blemishes , but the problem is the hormones in the milk , not milk fat . Butter and cheese sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vitamin A. <p> Fried foods cause acne because of the combination of high-carb and high-fat in the same meal . Separating fats and carbs into different meals reduces inflammation of the skin . <p> High glycemic index , " sugary " foods aggravate acne . But eating less of a high glycemic index food may have the same effect on your body as eating more of a low glycemic index food . <p> Nuts , especially Brazil nuts , may actually help clear up acne . Brazil nuts are a great source of selenium . Do n't  eat any kind of nuts if you are allergic . <p> Sweet corn and tomatoes sometimes aggravate blemishes in men , but not in women . <h> Chocolate <p> Dark chocolate can make you break out . Milk chocolate usually will not . <p> A study at the University of Miami found that eating just three 2-oz ( approximately 60-gram ) bars of dark chocolate every week can cause breakouts of up to 80 new pimples . If you do n't  already have acne , however , eating chocolate will not usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization Physicians for Responsible Medicine reports two different studies that have found that introducing cows milk in the diets of people who have never consumed it before ( Inuits in Canada and Okinawan Japanese ) increased rates of acne . <p> A study of 47,000 nurses in the United States found that those who consumed the most milk ( 3 or more glasses a week ) as teenagers had the most acne and that those who consumed the least milk ( 1 glass or less ) as teenagers had the least acne . Skim milk caused more acne than whole milk . This suggests that it is the hormones in milk or given to cows to produce milk that cause the skin to break out . <h> Fried Foods <p> The skin acts as a kind of " brick wall " to protect tissues beneath it . The skin cells are like bricks , and fats in the skin are like mortar . <p> Human skin makes the " mortar " between skin cells from saturated fatty acids . These are the kinds of healthy saturated fatty acids that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( They are also found in dark chocolate , but the theobromine in dark chocolate " excites " the skin and increases oil production . ) Saturated fatty acids break down into smaller essential fatty acids that prevent the excess growth of bacteria . Deficiency of saturated fatty acids in the diet decreases the flexibility of the skin . This aggravates acne by allowing bacteria to multiply unchecked inside the pore . The combination of excess bacteria and dead skin cells with excess skin oil clogs the pore . <p> Some fats are great food for bacteria . The unsaturated fatty acids found in shortening , margarine , and the cooking oils used to make potato chips and Fritos are delicious to acne bacteria . These fats feed acne bacteria , but do n't  help keep the skin flexible . They clog pores and tighten the skin at the same time . <p> Researchers have found that the fats that are used to fry foods cause acne but that the saturated fats in whole-milk dairy products prevent it . Bacon and fried foods , unfortunately , tend to make acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> High Glycemic Index Foods <p> The glycemic index measures how fast a food is digested into glucose after it is eaten . Usually 10 volunteers are asked to fast overnight and then come into the measurement laboratory . First they are given a 100-gram serving of a reference food , typically either white bread or pure sugar . Blood sugar levels are taken every 10 minutes for four hours to see how fast the sugar reaches the volunteers bloodstreams . <p> The volunteers are sent home and given a new test date . They are again asked to fast before they come into the lab . Then they are given a 100-gram serving of just one food ( for instance , 100 grams of instant mashed potatoes or 100 grams of pickled beets ) and their blood sugar levels are measured every 10 minutes for four hours . The faster- a food is digested into sugar , the higher its glycemic index . <p> The glycemic index is a workable estimate of the " sugariness " of a food , but there are fundamental problems with the measurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one ever eats that way . We do n't  sit down and make a meal out of just 100 grams of Cheerios or just 100 grams of lettuce . We eat foods in mixtures , and mixtures take longer to digest . <p> Moreover , some tests have found foods that the body turns into sugar faster than it can digest sugar . This seems highly improbable . But the glycemic index is useful as a relative ranking of the " sugariness " of foods . <p> The more " sugary " a food , the more likely it is to make you break out . Studies have found that the body makes more of a substance called a sex hormone binding globulin when the diet is high in sugar and white flour products . This substance transports testosterone to the skin and increases sebum production . More pores are clogged . Excess sugar consumption , however , does not cause breakouts by itself if the skin is cleansed of excess oil " without irritation " on a daily basis . <h> High Protein Foods <p> A high-protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . High-protein diets only work , however , if there are no meals that combine lots of sugar with lots of fat . The body has to make extra insulin to store both sugar from sweets or high-carb foods and fat from fatty foods eaten at the same meal . The extra insulin triggers the production of growth factors that stimulate oil production in the skin . <p> The reason a high-protein diet clears up acne may be that people who eat high-protein diets do n't  eat lots of high-carb foods and high-fat foods at the same time . If you are n't  a meat eater , simply avoiding sweets that are high in fat ( such as cookies , cakes , and whole-milk ice cream ) will also help . <h> Nuts <p> Every acne sufferer used to be warned that nuts can make you break out . But it turns out that sometimes the best advice for improving acne sometimes is to " Go nuts !

Most kinds of liver are also great sources of selenium . <h> Sweet Corn and Tomatoes <p> Sweet corn is a great source of plant chemical called zeaxanthin . Tomatoes are a great source of a plant chemical called in lycopene .

If you have sensitive skin , fragrances , perfumes , and preservatives can cause you problems a lot faster than acne infections , and they are n't  easy to overcome . Some of the most harmful substances are chemicals you probably never imagined appear in skin care products. - Here are the five that are the most likely to cause a skin reaction . <p> 1 . Formaldehyde is n't just used to preserve corpses . It is also used to preserve many skin care products . If you are sensitive to formaldehyde , you are most likely to break out when you get a double whammy of formaldehyde from your skin care product and naturally occurring formaldehyde in food . Cured ham , maple syrup , pickled herring , dried cod , caviar , coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of formaldehyde are released when your body metabolizes aspartame ( Nutrasweet ) . And formaldehyde is also released by the skin care ingredient quaternium-15 . <p> 2 . We warn you about lots of botanical ingredients , ranging from andrographis to zizyphus fruit . The single most irritant botanical ingredient , however , is a pungent herb derivative known as balsam of Tolu , or Tolu balsam . The big problem with this ingredient is that it can trigger cross sensitivites . If you develop an allergy to balsam of Tolu , you will also be allergic to cinnamon oil , lemon oil , orange peel , oil of cloves , benzoin , and propolis . An allergy you develop when you use one product may make you allergic to dozens more . <p> 3 . Millions of people are allergic to nickel . There 's probably no more troublesome trigger for eczema than nickel used in ear clips and the studs for body piercings . Nonetheless , dozens of skin care products use nickel sulfate as a preservative . ( The products we recommend on this site do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as a skin cream . Its also a preservative in some acne care formulas made in China . If you 're allergic to neomycin , you 'll be allergic to the acne skin care product too . <p> 5 . Some seemingly safe ingredients can cause a condition known as protein contact dermatitis . These are usually food ingredients that do n't  cause a food allergy , because they break down during digestion , but do cause a skin reaction . The scratch tests you get at the allergists office wont detect them . Common culprits include soy , peach , tomato powder , chrysanthemum , and natural latex . <p> The problem with these ingredients is that they cause skin reactions that most people and their doctors would naturally assume are caused by anything but a skin care product . Fortunately , all of these skin care product ingredients are easy avoid ( except in products made in China ) if you just know you need to be on the lookout for them . Here are ten signs you may have a problem with fragrances , perfumes , and preservatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clasp is made with 14-karat gold . <p> Sensitivity to earrings , piercings , and clip-on jewelry is a tell-tale sign of nickel allergy . Another sign of nickel allergy is sensitivity to cell phones . The numbers on the cell phone key pad are usually printed in nickel . Hairdressers , cashiers , metal workers , caterers , and housekeepers are especially like to have nickel allergies , due to frequent exposure . If you develop a nickel allergy through repeated exposure to the metal in your work you will be especially sensitive to acne products that use nickel sulfate as a preservative . <p> 2 . Hair dyes and temporary tattoos make you break out . <p> The offending ingredient in hair dyes and temporary tattoos that can cause skin to break out is a chemical known as p-phenylenediamine or PPD . This ingredient occasionally shows up in tinted acne creams ( again , not in any products recommended on this site ) and in makeup used to cover acne . Its kind of unusual to be allergic to PPD . About 4% of people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 6% of people elsewhere in the world . <p> 3 . Aftershave , cologne , deodorants , or soap make you sneeze or break out . <p> With aftershave , cologne , deodorant , and soap , the irritant ingredient is usually a fragrance . Chances are that there is just one fragrance that causes you special problems , but because there are over 4,000 different fragrances that are added to cosmetic products and the US Food and Drug Administration doe not require manufacturers to list them by name on the label , you will never be able to find out exactly which product causes you difficulty . That 's why we usually recommend acne care products that are fragrance-free . Acne care products containing fragrances are most likely to cause problems on recently shaved or broken skin . <p> 4 . You are allergic to gentamicin or tobramycin . <p> If you are allergic to either of the aminoglycoside antibiotics gentamicin or tobramycin , you are probably also allergic to neomycin . You need to avoid any acne care products that contain even traces of neomycin , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandage . <p> 5 . You are allergic to benzocaine . <p> Acne products that promise pain relief sometimes contain benzocaine . If you 're allergic to benzocaine , it may still be safe for the doctor or dentist to give you lidocaine injections for prevention of pain during office procedures , but be sure to let them know . <p> 6 . Eating peppery or highly seasoned foods makes you cry . <p> Foods that contain the chemical capsaicin usually trigger a reaction in the vagus nerve that causes the eyes to tear and the mouth to water . Capsaicin also accelerates digestion , although regular eaters of hot peppers may not be aware of this effect . If you are unusually sensitive to hot peppers , you may also be unusually sensitive to irritant ingredients in skin care products for acne . <p> 7 .

About 20 to 25% of adults , however , continue to have persistent patches of acne-prone skin . These areas are usually not as extensive as they were in childhood , adolescence , and young adulthood , but they can continue to require special handling even as late in life as age 55 or even later . Without getting into the complexities of skin care , this article will tell you the best ways to handle acne by the places on the body where they occur . <h> Summary : <p> Skin all over your face may break out in childhood , adolescence , and early adulthood , but most people over the age of 25 only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best on different locations on the body . <p> Back acne usually causes blackheads . These often respond to topical tretinoin . <p> Acne around the eyes is usually caused by dryness . An application of moisturizer may be all that is needed . <p> Whiteheads and blackheads across the cheeks and on the nose are usually caused by excess oil . <p> Pimples across the cheeks and on the nose may be a sign of rosacea . <p> For people with Asian skin , the brown spots left when acne heals are usually a bigger concern than the acne itself . <p> Certain products are used to keep skin light , and others are used to bleach it . People who have Asian , Hispanic , or African skin types need to avoid some skin lighteners altogether . <p> The best way to keep skin clear after you take care of problem blemishes is a complete acne care system such as Exposed Skin Care . <h> How to Treat Back Acne <p> Blackheads and pimples on the back can be a problem throughout adult life . Even octogenarians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually just a few that last for years and years . <p> The back acne blemishes occur when the skin is tough and tight . The solution is never to try to pop them out . They are usually too firmly imbedded to be squeezed or even lanced . The way to get rid of these back acne blemishes is with topical tretinoin . <p> Topic tretinoin is the non-prescription form of the acne drug Retin-A . It is a form of vitamin A that stimulates the maturation of skin cells so that they live out a 21-day life cycle and die on the surface of the skin . Placing topical tretinoin around a blackhead on the back will stimulate the skin around the pore to grow and open the pore , so that the blackhead falls out on its own . <p> Tretinoin is a skin irritant , but if the skin on your back is so tough that you have blackheads that were there during the Jimmy Carter administration , chances are the preparation will not irritate your skin . Just be sure to use a mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly on the blackhead , and leave uncovered for at least an hour , not lying on your back in bed or leaning your back against the back of a chair , to give the product a chance to be absorbed . Results take about 3 or 4 weeks . <p> Another cause back acne is acne mechanica . Tight shirts , blouses , and brassieres trap sweat on pores , and tiny pimples break out . All you need to do to treat this form of acne is to wear loose clothing , and wait . Acne mechanica usually resolves itself in 3 or 4 weeks when loose-fitting clothes are worn . <h> How to Treat Acne on the Temples and at the Sides of the Face <p> Many people who otherwise have " perfect skin " sometimes get whiteheads or blackheads at the side of the face or on the temples . This is almost always due tightness of the skin , and almost always occurs during the summer or after long-term exposure to dry air . <p> The solution is not to fight the blemish , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , applying just a dot or a dab of an alcohol-free moisturizer around the blemish . Often in as little as 24 hours it will pop out on its own . Blemishes around the eyes and across the forehead are almost always due to dry skin . <h> How to Treat Acne on the Upper Forehead <p> Blemishes on the upper forehead and at the hairline are almost always triggered by hair care products . Shampoo , conditioner , volumizer , mousse , gel , and treatments for split ends get on the skin and clog pores . If you just make sure to rinse hair thoroughly after treatment and keep it off the face , acne on the upper forehead and at the hair line will quickly disappear with minimal treatment . <h> How to Treat Acne Across the Cheeks and on the Nose <p> Blackheads and whiteheads across the cheeks and on the nose are usually very easy to treat . Pimples across the cheeks and on the nose are usually hard to treat . <p> The nose and cheeks are often referred to as the " T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production is highest . If you tend to non-inflammatory blemishes in this part of your face , the problem is probably excess oil . Do n't  try to " dry out " your skin .

Be absolutely sure to remove any makeup on your face before you go to bed . <p> Tiny pimples across the face and on the nose are often a sign of rosacea . This skin condition is not due to clogged pores . Instead , it is caused by broken blood vessels " and treatments to open up the pores not only do n't  help , they usually hurt .

Most people who have Asian or dark skin types are more concerned about the brown or black spots left behind when acne heals . <p> The most important thing to know about after-care of acne-prone skin in these skin types is that lighteners and whiteners that work on white skin can have devastating effects on Asian , brown , and black skin . Hydroquinone , in particular , can cause a skin reaction that turns Asian skins blue and black skins even blacker . But the main thing to know about lightening agents is when to use them . <p> Arbutin , vitamin C , kojic acid , and azelaic acid are used before the skin turns brown to prevent browning of the skin . Alpha-hydroxy acids and salicylic acid are used after the skin turns brown to lighten it . Hydroquinone is OK for fair skin " but people who have fair skin usually do n't  need it .

@@98778673 @2978673/ <h> Is Acnezine What You Need to Fight Acne ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> If you watch the late-night and early-morning television news on CNN , FOX , ABC , CBS , or NBC in the United States , chances are that you have seen an advertisement for the acne-fighting duo of Acnezine ( made by Revitol ) . Offering an antioxidant supplement and a moisturizing cream , Acnezine advertises itself as a complete skin care management system that can clear your skin in just weeks . <h> Summary : <p> In the USA , Acnezine is a heavily advertised acne treatment system . <p> The acne products promoted by Acnezine include a moisturizing cream and an antioxidant supplement . <p> Acnezines antioxidant supplement offers 67% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin E , 83% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin C , 88% of recommended daily intake for vitamin B2 ( riboflavin ) , 100% of recommended daily intake for vitamin B1 ( thiamin ) , 416% of recommended daily intake for vitamin B12 ( cyanocobalamin ) , and 1250% of recommended intake of vitamin B6 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid , 10 mg of CoQ10 , 30 mg of curcumin ( the antioxidant found in turmeric ) , and a small amount of proline from chicken collagen and trace amounts of other herbs and nutrients . <p> The list price for a one-month supply of Acnezine is US $69.99 , but its not hard to find the product for as little as $26.35 on Amazon . What does science tell us about these ingredients ? <h> Do the Ingredients in Acnezine Cream Really Work ? <p> There 's no doubt that a 5% benzoyl peroxide gel or cream will kill acne bacteria . The US Food and Drug Administration specifically authorizes a claim that 5% benzoyl peroxide is generally recognized as safe and effective , or GRASE . A 5% benzoyl peroxide gel will usually get rid of about 20% of blackheads and whiteheads during the first week of use , and another 15% by the end of the first month . It will usually eradicate about 30% of pimples during the first week and another 30% by the end of the first month of use . <p> Tiny microcrystals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than traditional forms of benzoyl peroxide . <p> The problem is that this strength of benzoyl peroxide can also cause dryness , burning , stinging , itching , redness , and peeling . In the old days , almost no one could use 5% benzoyl peroxide for more than a month because the side effects were too bad . Nowadays , there are new formulations of benzoyl peroxide that disperse it as microcrystals ( that do n't  get stuck in the openings of pores so that they just irritate skin without ever reaching the bacteria inside the pore ) and microspheres ( so they release benzoyl peroxide slowly over time ) . <p> The problem with Acnezine is that it does not contain the new low-irritant formulations of benzoyl peroxide . It contains the old high-irritation formulation of benzoyl peroxide . Even worse , many who first begin using Acnezine do n't  see any observable results as quickly as they might like , which often prompts them to apply more amounts ( thus causing further inflammation ) or makes them quit altogether. - You should- start the product slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may be able to use the product twice a day in larger amounts , but you must avoid sun or use at least SPF 15 ( if you have dark skin ) to SPF 70 ( if you have fair skin ) sunblock to prevent sunburn and the formation of freckles and brown spots as acne heals . <p> One ingredient that caught our attention is curcumin and the inclusion of biopiperin , which helps the curcumin absorb better and work better . Curcumin is a powerful , anti-inflammatory active turmeric ingredient that can be beneficial for the irritation and redness that often come with acne . However , there 's only 30mg per capsule . That is probably not enough , considering 500mg is normally what 's recommended . <p> Most of the ingredients in Acnezines antioxidant supplement can have unintended side effects . The main ingredient , Ester C is an ascorbic acid salt used as an alternative to Vitamin C. Vitamin C is too acidic for most people and often isnt- absorbed properly . Too much Vitamin E , like the amounts present in Acnezine , can actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further clogs up your pores . <p> Both lemon peel oil and citrus extracts can be troublesome for skin . <p> Some of the agents are also uneffective as well . Alphy-lipoic acid , even in the small amounts present in Acnezine , can help correct " saging " skin and outward facing acne scars . For cells to use Alpha-lipoic acid , however , they require Vitamin B ( biotin ) which is missing from Acnezine . <p> There are other ingredients in this cream that can cause problems for sensitive skin , especially the allantoin , lemon peel oil , and citrus extract . If you have allergies , if you tend to flush or blush when you are embarrassed or excited , and especially if you have rosacea , you must not use this product . <p> On the other hand , there are also ingredients conspicuously missing . In order to offset the effect of BP , many acne treatment contain necessary ingredients like toner , micro-dermabrasion compounds , exfoliants and even some types of skin cleanser . But Acnezine does n't  appear to have anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Formula Really Work ? <p> Its considered a given that antioxidants are always beneficial for your skin " except they are n't  . Most of the ingredients in Acnezines antioxidant supplement can have unintended side effects . <p> A Dutch study found that the skin of men who consume the highest amounts of vitamin E ( equivalent to taking just 20 IU of vitamin E a day , the amount of vitamin E in Acnezine ) produces up to 30 times more sebum . Vitamin E can contribute to clogged pores . <p> Vitamin B6 in the doses used in this product usually does not cause skin problems " but taking too much vitamin B6 can and does cause a reaction similar to rosacea , with numerous tiny red pimples breaking out on the nose and cheeks . <p> Vitamin B12 in the doses used in this product also usually does not cause skin problems " but taking too much of the product could cause the formation of numerous , identically sized and shaped pimples breaking out all at once . <p> Small amounts of vitamin C are helpful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more from ascorbyl palmitate used in ointments than from ascorbic acid used in nutritional supplements . <p> Alpha-lipoic acid , even in the relatively low dosage included in this formula , can help correct " sagging " skin and outward-facing acne scars . For cells to use alpha-lipoic acid , however , they require the B vitamin biotin , which is not included in this formula . <p> The proline ( " chicken collagen , " which is basically chicken bones turned into Jell-O ) in Acnezine is needed for the synthesis of collagen under the skin . This is helpful in preventing pitted scars on dry skin , although oily skin usually does not need additional proline . At least Acnezine provides collagen in the nutritional supplement rather than in the skin cream " collagen applied on the skin can not be absorbed into the skin . <h> The Bottom Line on Acnezine <p> Could Acnezine help clear up your skin ? The answer is a definite " maybe . " If you look at the reviews for this system , many people have some of their blemishes clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , probably causes as many skin problems as it corrects . <p> A bigger concern with the Acnezine system is that it does not include a cleanser , a toner , an exfoliant , microdermabrasion products , or probiotic supplements that can reduce inflammation . You 're also out of luck if it does n't  work for you , as their so-called money back guarantee says you can only return the product for a refund only if its unopened and unused . For these products , your best bet is a money-back acne treatment system like Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778674 @2978674/ <h> Is There Really Such a Thing as Hispanic Acne Care ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Hispanics often suffer from two of the more serious forms of skin problems , hyperpigmentation and cystic acne . <p> Dr. Vivian Bucay is a cosmetic surgeon in San Antonio , Texas . Over half of her patients come from various locations in Mexico because of her expertise in Hispanic skin care . But is there really such a thing as Hispanic skin , or Hispanic skin acne care ? <h> The Many Shades of Hispanic Skin <p> There is a stereotype of the Hispanic skin type as olive to dark brown , smooth , and maybe just a little oily . Like many stereotypes , this idea of what " Hispanic " skin should be has a connection to truth . <p> In Latin America and southern Europe many people do in fact have olive to dark brown complexions with smooth and oily skin is more common than dry . There is not , however , any single skin type that is shared by absolutely all people who describe themselves as Hispanic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populated by indigenous peoples long before the " discovery " of the New World by the explorer Christopher Columbus . Vast numbers of people North , Central , and South America trace their ancestry in whole or in part to the native Americans , who tend to have an Asian skin type . <p> More Latin Americans than not , however , have both native and European ancestors . There are also large populations of Japanese-Latin Americans in Peru and Brazil and a large number of people who have fair skin , blond hair , and blue eyes throughout both continents . And because both the Spanish and the Portuguese brought slaves to the Americas , many Latin Americans have African ancestors . <p> Latin America has a diverse gene pool . Every kind of acne that can be found anywhere else in the world can be found in Latin America , but the sunny climate of most of Latin America causes a consequence of acne that is not as common in the rest of the world , hyperpigmentation . No matter what their ancestry , Latin Americans from Poughkeepsie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where acne heals . <h> Hyperpigmentation and Hispanic Skin <p> Most of the United States and almost all of Latin America suffer from harsh summer sun . In extreme southern South America , summers tend to be cloudy and cool , but the thinning of the Antarctic ozone layer results in unusually high levels of UV radiation . <p> For people who have acne , lots of sun exposure results in lots of skin pigmentation . As acne heals , the pigment-producing melanocytes in the skin make melanin to serve as an antioxidant to reduce inflammation . The melanin remains in the skin and causes brown spots . In Hispanic women , and occasionally even in Hispanic men , fluctuations in hormones cause the formation of melasma , multiple brown spots that appear in drifts on the face , neck , torso , and hands . <p> In many Hispanics , two factors make hyperpigmentation worse . Especially in Mexico and the United States , many people of Hispanic heritage develop type 2 diabetes at a relatively young age , sometimes even as children . People who have type 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as acne heals . <p> Also , an unusually large number of Hispanics are sensitive to the worlds most commonly prescribed acne treatment , benzoyl peroxide . Even on Hispanic skin , benzoyl peroxide kills acne bacteria . Certain brown and olive skin types , however , are unusually sensitive to benzoyl peroxide . The skin becomes severely irritated , and makes melanin to heal itself . Because the skin is already making relatively large amounts of brown pigment , the brown spots occurring after acne treatment with benzoyl peroxide can be especially dark . <h> Sunblocks Are Tricky , Too <p> Another problem for many Hispanics is choosing the right sunblock . Especially in Chile and Argentina , people of all ethnic origins need protection from the UV-A and UV-B rays of the sun . Products that contain the mineral ingredients zinc oxide and titanium dioxide block UV-A and UV-B without chemicals changes in the skin and without triggering allergies . <p> On brown or black skin , however , both zinc oxide and titanium oxide can leave a whitewash-like tint even when they are washed off . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restriction " can work their way into the lower levels of the skin and form tiny clumps that create white spots on the skin that can not be washed away . <p> Sunblocks are also a problem for Hispanics because of their effects on the bodys ability to make vitamin D. The darker the skin , the more sunlight it needs to make this essential vitamin that protects the body against , among other health problems , skin cancer . Many experts believe that one of the most important reasons skin cancer is on the rise throughout Central and South America is that more and more people are following doctor recommendations to use sunblock , which leads to vitamin D deficiency and increased vulnerability to skin cancer that is not triggered by exposure to sunlight , such as the deadly form of skin cancer known as melanoma . <p> Dr. Bucay usually recommends her Hispanic patients use sunblocks containing zinc oxide and titanium oxide that are ground into micronized particles . Sometimes manufacturers explain the process of making micronized particles as " additional milling . " These are particles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect the delicate acne-prone skin inside them , but large enough that they do not travel into the skin and aggregate into cosmetically objectionable lumps . It is helpful for Hispanics to spend about 20 minutes a day in the sun before putting on sunblock to give the skin to make needed vitamin D , or to take 1,000 IU per day of a vitamin D supplement . <h> Cystic Acne and Hispanics <p> Other dermatologists have noticed that more than any other ethnic group , Hispanics tend to get cystic acne . Many Hispanics who escape teenage acne develop cystic acne in their early 20s , and the condition is very hard to treat without causing the inflammation that can permanently discolor the skin . In cystic acne , healthy but pink skin grows over pockets of bacterial infection that cause constant irritation to the skin but can not be drained because the pore no longer exists . <p> That 's why it is important that Hispanics , both male and female , pay special attention to acne skin care even when they are n't  teenagers any more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When mild to moderate acne is treated promptly with a minimum of irritation " using salicylic acid scrubs and peels and tea tree oil instead of benzoyl peroxide , for instance " the risk of cystic acne is lower and naturally beautiful brown skin may escape scarring and melasma . <p> People with these skin problems should first realize they do have a skin problem .

" The cosmetics industry will try to convince its customers that a $50 cleanser is more effective than a $5 cleanser , and that a $100 cleanser ( such as a famous brand made with blue-green algae gathered by hand from rocks in the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean just steps from the beach on Maui ) is better still . <p> The simple fact is , treatments do n't  have to be a new , expensive drug or a high-priced facial mask from the other end of the world to be effective- and sometimes acne clears up even when people simply cleanse their skin with soap and water right from the comfort of their home . There are ingredients , however , that are useful for getting rid of blemishes " and not necessarily expensive . <h> Summary : <p> Beware buzzwords that market acne cleansers . <p> Line loyalty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Its not as easy as you might think to find an acne cleanser that is better than soap and water , but some products are much , much better than soap and water . <h> Beware Buzzwords About Cleansers <p> It is a reliable rule of thumb for judging acne products to assume that more buzzwords generally belies lower quality . Marketing gurus count on being able to push your buttons with certain marketing terms that sound important but that do n't  really tell you anything . Here are the most overworked examples . <p> Bioidentical . There is an important role for bioidentical hormones in treating many age-related health conditions in both men and women . But do you really want to put a product on your face that is " bioidentical " to some aspect of your skin ? - The only bioidentical ingredients in acne treatment products that actually work are two that people tend to shun . These are cholesterol , which helps keep moisture in the skin , and ceramides ( the polymer made in cooking grease when restaurants make French fries ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin . But you do n't  need any of these ingredients in a cleanser ! <p> Cosmeceutical . A cosmeceutical is a food or a modified food that can be applied to skin . Milk , honey , apple cider vinegar , green tea , and cucumbers are all cosmeceuticals . The ingredients that are used to make " cosmeceutical " products are foodstuffs , which are inexpensive , but the use of the term justifies charging more . Again , there is no need for any " cosmeceutical " in a cleanser . <p> Essential oils . Essential oils are anything but essential . Although aromatherapy with essential oil has valid , scientifically confirmed and scientifically explained applications , slapping essential oil on your zits just makes them itchier . Avoid any and all cleansers that contain essential oils . <p> For mature skin . Babies can get acne . Centenarians can get acne . Teens and tweens and people in their 20s , 30s , 40s , 50s , 60s , 70s and beyond can get acne . Acne does n't  care how old your skin is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ironic problem with " fragrance-free " products is , since there is no official regulation of the term , most of them do contain fragrances that are designed " as odd as it sounds " to make you hungry . In the United States , almost all fast food sauces contain vanilla . If your nose detects vanilla , even if your brain does not know what it is , you will get a craving for fast food . You can also develop a craving for skin care products . <p> Miracle ingredients . An ingredient is a miracle for the manufacturer if the mention of its name results in vastly increased sales . There are almost no ingredients in acne formulas that are independently verified as having an unusual , positive , significant effect on the health of the skin . <p> Natural . Many natural ingredients are really bad for acne-affected skin . Essential oils , even those that have important applications for other skin conditions , such as lavender , can dry and irritate the skin . Fruit essences are a great source of alpha-hydroxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right concentrations at the right pH and not contaminated by competing products , as they often are . Many excellent products are ruined by the addition of skin-irritating ingredients added to the formula just to make it " natural . " <p> Noncomedogenic . A comedo is a blackhead or whitehead . A noncomedogenic product is one that supposedly does not contain oils that can oxidize and plug pores that form blackheads or whiteheads . This is a very basic requirement for any and all acne care products , but it is not one that has a standard definition in the skin care products industry . <p> Doctor-tested . Many dermatologists formulate their own line of products . These are usually fine products . But if the brand just says that a " doctor tested it " and no doctor is willing to claim it , its usually best to try something else . <p> Also , its almost never a good idea to use a cleanser that contains alcohol if you have dry skin . And its very seldom a good idea to use a cleanser that foams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usually a Mistake <p> There are some very good acne cleansers products made by companies that only make acne care products . Exposed Skin Care is a good example . When you find a system that works for you , stick to it ! But its not necessarily a good idea to be loyal to some big-name manufacturers products . They are n't  even loyal to themselves . <h> Expensive Usually Does n't  Mean Better <p> Acne cleansers can cost as much as US $300 per fluid ounce ( 30 ml ) . Although there can always be a first time , the most expensive products have never been the best .

How long does a jar of food in the refrigerator last once you have opened it , before it becomes a moldy mess ? Cleansers that come in jars are magnets for bacterial contamination , exactly what you use them to control . <p> Do n't  use cleansers that make your skin feel tingly . They dry out the skin . Flakes of skin gather around the edges of pore and trap oil inside . <p> Do n't  use cleansers that leave your skin feeling oily .

The most important thing to remember is to let the cleanser do the work . You do n't  have to rub it on , rub it in , or rub it off . Just wash your hands , so you wont put dirt and germs back on your skin , and make a lather of the skin cleanser in your hand ( small bubbles are good , big bubbles are bad ) , and put it on your skin . <p> About 30 seconds later , wash the cleanser off with warm water .

It is not caused by moisture that is in the skin . Moisture in your skin actually helps clear up your skin , because it keeps your skin flexible . Your pores will drain better if there is moisture in your skin , your skin will look brighter , too . This makes zits less noticeable . Dry skin looks gray and makes pimples prominent . <p> The best moisturizer for your skin is water . No matter what you have been told , you do n't  have to hydrate your skin from the inside out .

Coming from a background of poor people who had " nice personalites " on a farm in Texas I was not a natural fit , and I realized I would n't be working there forever . Nonetheless , the time I spent moving invisibly among the rich and famous was really quite enlightening . <p> Of those I 've actually met , the Hollywood glamorati lead intense lives focusing on their careers . When they have wants , they expect heaven and earth to move to meet them , and right now . One person might spend $10,000 on real ( not homeopathic ) growth hormone injections so he wo n't have to spend that extra 20 minutes in the gym every week working on his abs . The entire office had $40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lunch ( except me , on my budget I preferred to dash out and get a tofuburger ) . The storied self-indulgence of the citizenry of Beverly Hills and Marina del Rey is not without a basis in fact . <p> Most of us do n't  live in Beverly Hills or Marin del Rey . And we cant have the aesthetician make an emergency house call in between our private sessions with our personal trainers and looking over the latest diamonds at Cartiers . But here are seven techniques employed by the skin care advisers to the rich and famous and the rich and famous themselves that you can use yourself . And not a single one of them requires a skin care product or a skin care procedure . <h> 1 . Bright light makes you look better . <p> One of the most basic skin " treatments " is good lighting . Even if you have scars or pimples or other imperfections in your skin , they wont be as noticeable in bright light . If you want to look good without doing anything at all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you are being photographed " in bright light rather than low light . Living in the shadows does not make acne look worse . It highlights it . <h> 2 . Knowing your worth makes you more attractive . <p> One of the things about the beautiful people of Beverly Hills that you just ca n't miss is that associating with them does not come cheap . They only pay attention to people to those who have a lot to offer them. - And as a result they are seen as beautiful people even though they may have obvious physical imperfections . <p> I do n't  advise that you adapt a prima donna attitude with your friends . But I do advise that if you find things about yourself that your are proud of and confident in , people will tend not to see your acne. <h> 3 . Framing your face can take attention off your blemishes . <p> No , I do n't  mean you should have a portrait made so you can hang it on the wall . I mean that you should choose clothes that bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , if you have red acne on your cheeks and you just cant conceal it or take the inflammation away , then you can use your choices in clothing to draw attention away from it . <p> Usually this means wearing an article of clothing around your neck that not just complements your skin tones but that is brighter than your blemishes . If you have fair skin and red pimples then you might wear a red scarf . If you have Asian skin and brown spots you might wear a gold scarf . If you have Mediterranean or Middle Eastern or Hispanic skin tones , you might want to wear a textured , brown scarf . And if you have African skin and acne , you may want to wear bright ornamentation around your neck and ears to offset the appearance of acne. <h> 4 . You can disguise skin blemishes with beautiful backdrops . <p> Most people who have acne find that it comes and goes . If there is some setting you can identify where you 'd been noticed for clear and beautiful skin , go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings will associate clear skin with the backdrop , and any transient problems with blemishes will be less noticeable . <h> 5 . An entourage can help you achieve " beautiful people " status . <p> And it actually helps to have people you think look better than you do around you . <p> Hollywood stars tend to cultivate entourage . The presence of fans gives them self-confidence " which makes a difference in how they appear to others . And the presence of fans even changes how people who have never seen them before react to their physical appearance . <p> Scientists have found that in a group of people , the individual perceived as the most attractive has the most " average " looks of the group . This means that you do n't  have to worry about being around people whom you believe to be more attractive than yourself when you go out . You might actually be the most attractive person in the group because you are seen as having the greatest number of shared beauty characteristics in the group . <h> 6 . Looking people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the United States , most of the time its considered just plain good manners to look people in the eyes when interacting with them . ( In confrontational situations , however , different rules apply , and different subcultures in the United States have different norms . ) If you have acne , this has several advantages for you . A smaller portion of your face is in the other persons field of vision , their gaze focused on your eyes . And slightly lowering your forehead , not to " look down " at the other person , but to change the effects of gravity on your face , will press skin around blemishes and make them smaller . <h> 7 . The lifestyles of the rich and famous are not to be taken too seriously . <p> If there is anything I 've noticed about the few " rich and famous " people Ive met , its that a lot of them reach a point in their lives they simply do n't  care what other people think . While I do believe that the norms of ethical behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more attractive when they are simply comfortable in their own skin . <p> Its OK to use some of the methods of the rich and famous to look better without changing the skin you 're in .

A practicing dermatologist for decades , Dr. Murad and his family set up a company to provide acne and wrinkle treatment products over the Internet , through other doctors , and at Boots cosmetic stores all over the world . And Dr. Murad has done something that many doctors would not . <p> Murad advises his patients not to run to their dermatologists to get treatment for acne scars . That is , patients should not plan for expensive procedures to remove blemishes at least before they know what the blemishes are . <h> Summary : <p> Murad is a leader in the production of skin care kits that contain the controversial skin lightening agent hydroquinone . <p> Murad products are great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Murad acne treatment kits contain a number of ingredients that can irritate any type of skin . <h> Acne Scars vs . Acne Pigmentation <p> Sometimes acne destroys the skin and leaves a scar . The scar can be raised above surrounding skin , or the tissues beneath the scar can atrophy so that the scar lies beneath the contour of surrounding skin . But some scars are not really scars at all . <p> Acne inflammation can leave hyperpigmentation , and overproduction of skin pigment that appears pink or red instead of the more usual brown , especially on lighter skin . When acne bacteria infect pores , the immune system releases free radicals of oxygen to dissolve them . The melanocytes , which are the skin cells that make the brown and gold pigments of healthy skin , protect surrounding skin with a versatile antioxidant , melanin . <p> This melanin is the same pigment that gives skin its darker tones . Melanin concentrates around regions of inflammation , and sometimes permanently discolors the skin . While darker skins tend to produce more obvious spots , lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like scars , but are n't  . <p> How can you tell the difference ? The acne scar test is extremely simple . Run your finger over the " scar . " If it feels like surrounding skin , it probably is not a scar . And you may be better off to try a lightening agent before you spend hundreds or thousands of dollars just to get your skin assessed at the dermatologists office . <h> Murad Acne Pigment Treatment <p> Dr. Murad is famous for his pioneering use of hydroquinone for treatment of hyperpigmentation caused by acne . Frankly , hydroquinone is not for everyone . It is the strongest skin lightener you can get without a prescription , and if your skin has dark brown or gold skin tones you should never use it . If you have fair skin , and especially if you have blond or red hair and blue eyes , then hydroquinone will lighten skin better than any other over the counter acne treatment . <p> The way hydroquinone works is by alkalizing the skin . This process releases oxygen and stimulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good thing for the skin . When oxygen is exposed to sunlight , it releases destructive free radicals of oxygen that can go beyond just breaking down pigment and start breaking down skin . It is essential for users of Murads hydroquinone acne treatment to use sunscreen when they use the skin lightening product . The alcohol in Murads Post-Acne Spot Lightening Gel can dry out the skin , so moisturizer is also a must . <p> It may not be politically correct to put it quite so directly , but hydroquinone is an acne treatment for white people . If you do n't  have a northern European heritage , chances are that it is not an appropriate treatment for your skin . Many people mar beautiful skin with rich brown , gold , or nearly black skin tones by using this product when they should not . Correcting the damage to skin treated with hydroquinone incorrectly is a very difficult task . <p> The use of hydroquinone in skin treatment has always been controversial because of the potential to damage the skin when the products are not used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDA has proposed to ban them for over the counter use for that reason . <h> What About Other Murad Acne Products ? <p> The Murad Company also markets two acne treatment kit .

But there are serious problems with some of the products . <p> The Murad acne spot treatment , which is also available separately for US $17.50 per half-ounce ( 14 grams ) in Boots stores , kills acne bacteria with its 3% content of sulfur .

It is not that they are afraid that readers will figure out ways to get rid of acne for good so they wo n't need more products " in fact , this article will give you some very specific information about that at the end . The reason the term " remove acne " makes acne experts dangerous is that so many of the methods that promise to remove acne actually make it worse . <h> Summary : <p> Every good way to remove acne is a gentle way to remove acne . You ca n't rub , scrub , wash , or burn acne away . Let your skin do the work of removing acne . <p> Squeezing pimples just forces inflammation further into the skin . <p> Squeezing blackheads usually only injures the skin around them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a " quick fix " for a pimple , but repeated steroid injections can whiten and thin your skin . <p> Moisturizer and skin peels can help you get rid of whiteheads and blackheads " not immediately , but usually within 48 hours . <p> The best way to remove acne for good is with a complete skin care system .

It almost never works . The inflammation that makes a pimple red and noticeable is not generated by the bacteria inside the pimple . It is generated by the immune system as a way of fighting the bacteria inside the pimple . <p> Acne bacteria release " homing signals " called chemotactins that steer white blood cells to skin cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin rather than bacteria and inflammation of the skin results . <p> Squeezing a pimple may give some bacteria an escape route so they can infect nearby skin . But it forces more bacteria deeper into the skin , where they continue to release chemotactins . Sometimes the surface of the skin grows over these bacteria so they continue to trigger constant inflammation of the skin that coalesces into a nodule or a cyst . <p> Squeezing a blackhead is also harmful to the skin . Like squeezing a pimple , squeezing a blackhead forces bacteria deeper into the skin . Squeezing a blackhead may turn it into a pimple . But more often than not , all that happens is that the skin around the blackhead is broken " so you are left with a cut or a scratch and the original blemish . <h> Better Ways to Remove Acne <p> There are no instant ways to remove any kind of blemish caused by acne . There are methods that may get rid of a blemish in 24 to 48 hours . <p> The sure-fire way to reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get an injection of steroid like prednisone or prednisolone directly into the pimple . The steroid injection deflates the pimple right away , leaving a red spot on the skin . It is easier to conceal a red spot than it is to conceal a red zit , so most people are happy with the results of the process . The downside of the procedure is that each injection costs about $100 , not covered by insurance , and excess use of steroids can lighten skin tones and make the skin thin . <p> The best way to " pop " a blackhead is to apply moisturizer and exfoliant and let it pop on its own . Moisturizer loosens the skin around the pore . Exfoliation removes dead skin that may be keeping the opening of the pore tight . <p> Or if you need to get rid of blackheads on a budget , simply soak a clean cloth in warm ( not hot ) water and place it on your face for about half an hour . This loosens the skin around the blackhead . Do n't  squeeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But its not unusual to see the blackhead is gone the next time you look at your face , even if it does not fall out of your skin right away . <h> The Best Ways to Remove Acne <p> There are many kinds of acne treatments that get rid of about 1/2 to 2/3 of your blemishes in 2 to 3 months . Many treatments begin to reduce the number of visible blemishes in the first week , and then continue to clear the skin for up to 12 weeks , when some new blemishes begin to form . Combination therapies act faster and remove more blemishes , but when you use a combination of medications , you can get a combination of side effects . <p> Bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics . Medications that have been on the market for as long as 50 years , such as erythromycin , are not enough to get rid of all the acne bacteria that may be on your face " and using just erythromycin kills weaker acne bacteria but leaves stronger acne bacteria to cause an even worse acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bad as acne .

Using too strong a concentration of these chemical treatments for acne , however , can irritate the skin . <p> You can have pimples even without acne bacteria if you skin is stressed . Anything that leaves a " bracing " feeling on the skin , such as isopropyl ( rubbing ) alcohol or menthol , and any foaming detergent cleanser , can stress the skin and trigger the formation of pimples . <p> Retin-A , Accutane , Differin , Tazorac , Renova , and tretinoin tropical are great for stimulating the growth of the skin so it opens up over cysts and nodules without the need for lancing .

But there is a better way . Multiple treatments complement each other and help you get rid of more blemishes for good . <p> Here is a sample five-step program . <p> Start by using a cleanser at least once but no more than twice a day . The purpose of using a cleanser is not to scrub acne off your face . Use a cleanser to remove excess oil and acne bacteria to stop blemishes before they start . <p> Next use a clearing tonic on your skin . This is the first step in getting rid of whiteheads and blackheads . A mild skin peel such as glycolic acid strips off dead skin that can constrict pores , and stimulates the growth of new skin all over your face .

If you have acne , your skin may feel better even though irritation is worse . The net result of putting lavender on your skin is greater inflammation and more breakouts . <h> Lemon Oil <p> Lemon oil smells great .

The problem with most acne treatments that contain this Australian herb is that they contain enough tea tree oil to smell good but not enough tea tree oil to fight acne bacteria . For tea tree oil to fight acne infection , it has to be at least 10% strength . The only way to know for sure that you are getting this much tea tree oil is to apply pure tea tree oil directly to red and inflamed blemishes with a clean cotton ball . <p> Tea tree oil takes about 72 hours to bring acne infection under control .

There just is n't any single remedy that works for everyone who has adult acne . The right natural remedy for adult acne may depend on gender , nutritional status , occupation , or sun exposure , and just like medical remedies for adult acne , no single treatment gets rid of all your blemishes . <p> Choosing the correct natural remedy and following a good course of skin care , however , just might get rid of adult acne for good . Let 's take a look at some of the most reliable treatments for adult acne . <h> Summary : <p> Natural remedies are sometimes more effective than medical treatments for acne . <p> No single treatment for acne , however , gets rid of all your blemishes overnight . <p> Women who have PCOS can clear up their skin with low-calorie dieting . Losing just 2% to 3% of total body weight is usually enough . <p> Men undergoing andropause also benefit from dieting , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of all your blemishes for good requires the use of best treatments plus a complete skin maintenance system , such as Exposed Skin Care . <h> Diet for PCOS Acne <p> Millions of women deal with a condition known as polycystic ovarian syndrome , or PCOS . This ailment is caused by overproduction of testosterone in the ovaries , which typically in turn results from insulin resistance . <p> The phenomenon of insulin resistance protects cells in most of the tissues of the body from being flooded with sugar when blood sugar levels run high . The ovaries , however , do n't  have an " off switch " to keep them from absorbing glucose from the bloodstream . When blood sugar levels are high , they are forced to absorb sugar , and they use the extra energy to make both estrogen and testosterone . Fluctuations in hormones can cause ovarian cysts , infertility , and menstrual regularity , as well as unwanted hair growth and acne . <p> One way of dealing with the acne caused by high testosterone levels caused by insulin resistance is simply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about half of women who have PCOS are able to clear up their worst symptoms ( anovulation , dysmenorrhea , and acne ) by just losing 2 to 3% of total body weight by restricted calorie dieting . It can take up to a year to see improvements " but its a very easy , zero-cost , and safe method of treating PCOS acne . <h> Diet for Adult Acne in Men <p> Since men do n't  have ovaries , they do n't  get PCOS . In men , fatty tissue can be the culprit in hormone disturbances that affect the skin , especially after the age of 50 . <p> Many men experience the " male change of life " known as andropause . Fat , especially in the buttocks , converts estrogen into testosterone , reducing erectile function , interest in sex , and muscle growth . Fat just underneath the skin , however , can convert that tiny amount of estrogen back into testosterone , causing the skin to break out in much the same way as testosterone surges caused acne during adolescence . This form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the neck , back , and groin . <p> There are three major ways to deal with this kind of hormonally-induced acne in men . A man could visit an endocrinologist and pursue complicated and expensive hormone replacement therapies to attempt to bring hormones back to their pre-andropause levels . <p> Or it is possible simply to diet . Losing fat through calorie restriction reduces the conversion of testosterone into estrogen and estrogen into testosterone . The benefits of dieting are hard to quantify , and there is no fixed date that every man will start looking like he used to if just loses a specific percentage of his body weight . Most men , however , enjoy better looking skin as they diet for better looking bodies . <p> A third way of treating this kind of adult male acne is with the use of green tea extract " applied directly to the skin . Creams and lotions that contain at least 2% and preferably 3% green tea extract reduce sebum production by the skin . There is less oil to clog pores and fewer pores form whiteheads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the skin gets results in 30 days or less , although keeping your skin clear over the long term will involve weight control . <p> Some commentators like to point out that Traditional Chinese Medicine has been treating adult acne in men with green tea for over 2,200 years . What men need to know , however , is that it is not easy to drink enough green tea to have an effect on hormone balance . About 40 cups ( 10 liters ) of green tea every day would be necessary . There 's no need to slosh your way to healthy skin . The extracts are faster and easier . <p> Some commentators also like to point out that Traditional Chinese Medicine treated hormone imbalance in men with medicines made from dried urine . The Emperor even kept a cadre of healthy males to make donations for this purpose . <p> While there is testosterone in mens urine , the further recommendation that mens testosterone deficiency could be cured when they drink their own urine is just plain silly " if your body is n't producing enough testosterone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urine , either . And there are sanitary and legal issues in requesting help from friends with this method . <h> What If You Do n't  Want to Diet ? <p> Diet often makes the difference in controlling adult acne , but dieting requires discipline and results take weeks or months . If you are determined to use a natural approach to control adult acne and you want to see results now , here are some products you can use . <p> Tea tree oil kills both acne and staph bacteria . Its good for getting rid of pimples , usually in about a week , but it has no effect on non-inflammatory acne . The best way to use tea tree oil is " straight , " applied with a clean cotton swab once or twice a day directly to unbroken inflamed skin . <p> Dong quai , better known as a treatment for hot flashes , reduces inflammation in the skin . Acne bacteria redirect the immune systems attack on them by sensitizing nearby skin cells to inflammatory chemicals . Chemicals in dong quai cancel the bacterias " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bacteria . The Skin Research Institute in Yongin , South Korea , found that dong quai was more effective than erythromycin for controlling acne inflammation . <p> Oregon grape root is best known as a treatment for infection . It has no effect on acne bacteria , but it does reduce excessive sebum formation in the skin . Take any Oregon grape root product for infections as directed for up to two weeks . Any time you use an herb that contains the chemical berberine , such as Oregon grape root , coptis , goldenseal , or barberry , its important to give your digestive tract a break from the herb two weeks out of every month so probiotic bacteria are maintained in healthy numbers . <p> Its important to remember that no single treatment gets rid of all your blemishes . Even the very best medications and the most effective herbs will usually only remove about 65% to 85% of acne , and only over a period of several weeks . To get rid of all your blemishes , use best treatments plus a system of skin maintenance such as Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923

@@98778685 @2978685/ <h> Unexpressed Emotions and Acne 19922 @qwx879922 <p> One of the newest topics in acne research is the relationship between a psychiatric condition known as alexithymia and acne . Alexithymia is a personality trait that causes difficulty in expressing , understanding , or describing emotions . The Greek words from which the term is derived literally mean " without words for emotions . " The experience of alexithymia is not a condition in which emotions are repressed , but rather one which people do not know how to communicate or understand them . <p> Researchers have recognized for nearly 40 years that the inability to express or understand emotions makes all kinds of illnesses more likely and all kinds of treatments less effective . People who have alexithymia tend to get lower back pain , fibromyalgia , irritable bowel syndrome , allergies , asthma , nausea , and , scientists have recently discovered , acne . <p> Having acne does not mean that you have alexithymia . However , having alexithymia means that it is more likely that you have acne . The relationship between the inability to express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the brain-skin connection . <h> The Brain-Skin Connection <p> People who have alexithymia tend to have difficulties distinguishing between feelings caused by emotions and feelings caused by physical conditions . They tend to think in terms of events that go on outside their control . They seldom have fantasies , and they have difficulty describing how they feel to other people . <p> This combination of psychological symptoms occurs with a combination of physical symptoms . The nerves that control voluntary movements tend to become overly activated . The heart beats faster but pumps less blood so that tissues all over the body receive less oxygen . The skin becomes a better conductor of electricity so that any kind of stress in the skin is felt in the skin more intensely and more rapidly . Also , the skins reactions to stress are more intense . <p> When it comes to dealing with stress , the skin has its own " brain . " Just as the brain releases a chemical called corticotrophin stimulating hormone when it sense stress to trigger the release of stress hormones by the adrenal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it senses stress . This stress hormone activator in the skin sends a message to cells that store the inflammatory chemical histamine to break open the storage packets containing histamine . The histamine begins to dissolve nearby skin cells as if they were harboring a thorn or a splinter or an infection . The skin becomes redder and itchier and may break out in bumps , all because of heightened sensitivity in its nervous system . <h> What Can Be Done About Alexithymia and Acne ? <p> People who have both alexithymia and acne have some treatment options , but they are not what either a psychiatrist or a dermatologist is likely to suggest . While natural therapies do n't  relieve the combination of disordered brain chemistry and negative personal experiences that cause alexithymia , there is a natural therapy that may at least relieve the acne . <p> In the early 1930s , scientists in the United States noticed two things about people who consumed large amounts of foods that contain probiotic bacteria , such as Lactobacillus acidophilous . People who consume probiotics tend to suffer less anxiety and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For nearly 75 years scientists did not understand the connection between probiotics , depression , anxiety , and acne . But about 5 years ago another team of American scientists realized that the common element in all the three factors is inflammation , and that probiotics can reduce inflammation by " training " the immune system not to overreact . <p> Depression and anxiety are to a certain extent caused by inflammation in the brain . Acne is to a certain extent caused by inflammation in the skin . It may not be possible through holistic health means to stop the kinds of workings of the mind that cause an inability to express emotions and the excessive activation of the nervous system that results . It may be possible , however , to take inflammation out of the equation so that the effects of " nerves " on the skin are greatly reduced . <p> The way probiotics reduce inflammation is by training the immune system to release less inflammation . Lactobacillus bacteria do n't  cause disease . They do n't  release toxins . It is theoretically possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone takes an entire bottle of probiotic supplements or regularly eats large amounts of yogurt containing active cultures ) , but this is very rare . The immune system , however , does n't  know that Lactobacillus bacteria do n't  cause disease until it encounters them . <p> At first the immune system attacks Lactobacillus by generating inflammatory chemicals . These inflammatory chemicals do n't  get rid of the bacteria . However , the bacteria do n't  cause disease . When no disease symptoms are detected , the immune system stops releasing as many inflammatory chemicals in the bowel . <p> Some of the same white blood cells that are trained in the intestine not to attack Lactobacillus bacteria circulate to the skin . When they encounter acne bacteria , they do n't  unleash inflammation against the bacteria there , either . Because acne bacteria are capable of releasing chemotactins that " distract " the immune system so that it actually inflames healthy skin cells rather than attacking the bacteria , one important cause of acne inflammation is removed . <p> And while bacteria may not offer any benefit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they may reduce overall inflammation enough that acne does not break out . <p> Taking probiotics is a lot easier to understand than doing psychotherapy . It produces much more immediate results . At least as far as acne is concerned , probiotics may do what doctors focused on the psychiatric condition usually can not . People who have any mental health issue should seek mental health treatment , but the secondary effects often can be managed naturally . <p> Are you interested in the medical literature on this topic ?

Are home remedies and natural solutions effective ? Are there any methods that absolutely , positively always work ? The simple fact is , there are as many effective treatments for acne as there are people who have acne , but certain general skin care practices are a good idea for everyone and should be at the top of every acne sufferers to-do list . <h> Summary : <p> No acne care product works every time for every user . <p> Some skin care practices are always a good idea , especially keeping skin clean without trying to scrub acne away . <p> The foods that cause acne are usually foods that are otherwise healthy . These foods do n't  have to be absolutely avoided , but it is important not to over-indulge . Dietary causes and effects are not all myths ! <p> One common food can change the balance of stress and inflammation and heal acne while lifting mood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cleanliness is the foundation for acne freedom . All your efforts to kill acne bacteria on your face will come to no good if you constantly reinfect your skin with dirty washcloths and towels . <p> In fact , it is probably a good idea not to use washcloths at all , at least not on acne-affected skin . It is never possible to rub acne away . Vigorous rubbing of the skin only damages the delicate linings of pores , creating a red ring around a whitehead or blackhead , or puncturing a pimple to let even worse bacteria inside . <p> Let your cleanser do the work for you , applying a lather of cleanser with your fingertips . But when it comes to lather , more is not necessarily better . <h> A Lust for Lather Can Keep Acne Alive <p> Soaps , shampoos , and detergents that make big bubbles are especially detrimental to dry , normal , and even slightly oily skin . The problem with bubbles is that they break down lipids , ceramides , and cholesterol in the outermost layer of skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection ( usually not the organisms that cause acne , however ) . Inflammation swells the skin , strangling pores and trapping oil and acne bcteria inside . <p> When you apply a cleanser to your face , it should only form small bubbles . The bubbles do n't  get rid of oil and dirt . They just irritate the skin . Even if your cleanser makes no bubbles at all , it may be doing a very good job of cleansing your face . <h> Tingling is a Warning Signal <p> Tingling skin is almost never a sign of anything good . A tingling on the lip can be the sign of a cold sore . A tingling at the back of your neck can be a sign you are coming down with a cold or the flu . And tingling after you use a skin care product and rinse it away is a strong indication that the product has worn away an invisible layer of skin . <p> Certain tingly sensations are easy to recognize . Mint , menthol , " menthyl " chemicals , peppermint , lavender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tingly sensation on the skin . They can irritate the skin , causing the creation of new whiteheads and blackheads on fair skin , and even causing permanent skin discoloration on dark skin . <p> The rule for acne products is : If it tingles , take it back . Do n't  put any tingling sensation on acne-affected skin . <h> The Foods That Make a Difference Probably Are Not What You Expect <p> The old advice for acne sufferers used to be to avoid chocolate . It turns out that dark chocolate really does increase production of pimples , sometimes by a factor of up to 2000% . ( Milk chocolate is not as likely to cause breakouts . ) But most other traditional advice about food and acne turns out to have been wrong .

This wont necessarily increase acne activity if you are keeping pores open by an effective daily cleansing routine , but it helps not to eat too much of these otherwise healthy vegetables . <p> Drinking water keeps the skin hydrated and helps keep pores open , but you do n't  have to drink so much water that you slosh when you walk . As little as 5 cups ( 1200 ml ) of water a day is usually enough . If you are going to the bathroom all the time and you are n't  taking a diuretic and you do n't  have another health condition , you are drinking more water than your skin needs . <p> Every kind of " soda water " is not necessarily bad for your skin .

There is no need to try to eliminate all stress from your life if you have acne . <p> However , if you are an adult who has acne , and you have to deal with unremitting stress in your life , it is highly likely that stress is a major contributing factor in your condition and that reducing stress will help clear up your skin . Changing your life to change your skin is not usually practical . But there is a connection between diet and stress that can make skin care easier . <p> About 80 years ago , acne experts used to think that stress caused constipation , and that avoiding constipation was important for " flushing out toxins " that cause acne . It turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acne is not the presence of toxins but the absence of regulatory chemicals made by Lactobacillus bacteria in the colon . <p> These bacteria , which are found in yogurt and many other fermented foods , interact with the immune system in ways that reduce inflammation throughout the body , especially in the brain and the skin . Not only does reducing inflammation in the gut reduce inflammation in your skin , it also reduces the inflammation in your brain that keeps stress alive . <p> A single serving of yogurt a day , preferably eaten as a snack on an empty stomach , can help reduce stress and clear up your skin . If you cant eat yogurt , take a probiotic supplement . Of course , all other kinds of stress reduction " most of which require a great deal more effort " are likely to help keep acne under control . 19923 @qwx879923

Most of the time baby acne is most abundant on the forehead , chin , and ears , although babies can transfer just about all their bodily fluids and secretions just about anywhere on their skin . <h> Bathing Baby to Fight Infant Acne <p> What can parents do to stop baby acne ? The most important step is making sure baby gets a regular bath . <p> Its both unnecessary and harmful to try to scrub infant acne away .

Borage Dry Skin Therapy Natural Formula Childrens Lotion by ShiKai is also safe for babies , although quite expensive . <h> What About Benzoyl Peroxide for Baby Acne ? <p> Many teens and adults fight acne infections with benzoyl peroxide . There is no doubt that benzoyl peroxide will kill acne bacteria . The problem usually is that it also dries out and irritates skin . Acne sufferers who use benzoyl peroxide and nothing else to keep acne infections under control usually reach a point that as many new blemishes form under flakes of dead skin as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , stay on the skin long enough to take care of infections but not so long that they injure the skin . <p> The first thing to do before using benzoyl peroxide to treat baby acne is to make sure that you are dealing with acne and not some other skin problem such as the following : <p> Impetigo causes fluid-filled blisters instead of pimples . <p> Mongolian spots are brown , gray , or black and blue marks that are common in babies who have brown , black , or Asian skin .

For older children , teens , and adults , its a good idea to use a gel because it sticks to the skin . Babies , however , have a way of spreading the gel you put on one spot of skin all over their bodies and into their eyes . Its best to use a rinse or a foam that you very carefully rinse away to treat babys pimples . <p> And before you dunk your baby in acne medicine , make sure it will not cause any skin reactions .

It does not zap zits like a laser , but it kills acne bacteria and shrinks oil-producing glands to give skin a chance to recover on its own . <h> Summary : <p> Sunlight is good for treating acne , but it is specifically the red and blue wavelengths of visible sunlight that make a difference . <p> Red light reaches deep into the skin and activates hemoglobin . Red light treatment cuts off just enough of the blood supply of oil-producing sebaceous glands that pores do n't  get quite as oily . <p> Blue light penetrates pores and kills acne bacteria " but not all the pores acne bacteria . There are always some acne bacteria in the sebaceous gland that ca n't be reached by blue light . <p> When it comes to acne light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning the skin by holding the face too close to the lamp does not help . <p> The best way to use blue and red light therapy at home is for helping keep the skin clear between acne treatments . <p> Acne light therapy is always most effective when used as part of a complete skin care system such as Exposed Skin Care . <h> What Does Light Have to Do with Acne ? <p> If you live in a part of the world that has seasons , you may have noticed that there certain times of year that your skin gets better no matter what you do , and there are also certain times of year that your skin gets worse no matter what you do . The reason your skin may change with the seasons has to do with sunlight . <p> There are specific wavelengths of visible light that kill acne bacteria . Visible blue light from the sun ( in the frequency range of approximately 415 nm ) that shines into pores can activate light-sensitive chemicals called porphyrins that are found in the outer cell membranes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to vibrate in sync with solar energy , they rupture the outer lining of the bacterium . The contents of the bacterial cell begin to leak out , and the bacterium dies within 48 hours . <p> Visible red light from the sun has a complementary benefit in treating acne . Solar rays in the frequency range of approximately 650 nanometers reach deeper into the skin , down to the level of the sebocytes that produce the oil that sometimes clogs pores . <p> The red rays of the sun are absorbed by red compounds in the skin . They primarily heat up hemoglobin . Ordinary light shining on the surface of the skin , however , only reaches to the depth of the oil glands , and does not cauterize the blood vessels in the skin . The effects of red light on oil-producing glands are temporary , and they begin producing large amounts of all again a week or two after treatment . <p> The confusion about sunlight and acne comes from the fact that not everyone goes out into the sun when sunlight is strongest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norway , Finland , Denmark , or the UK , or in southernmost New Zealand or South America , chances are that you enjoy midsummer sun . If you live in the southern states of the USA or the northern states of Australia or anywhere near the equator , chances are that you prefer to get your sun when it is mildest , in the winter ( if your location experiences winter ) . Its not so much " summer " sun that clears up acne , it is " extra " sun . <p> If you go out in summer heat , chances are you will also dry out your skin . It may burn , flake , or peel . This happens at the same time that red and blue rays of sunlight are helping to clear up acne , so it is an easy mistake to assume that drying out the skin is what heals acne . But it is not . Drying out the skin never heals it . Reducing the production of oil and the number of bacteria in pores gives acne-prone skin a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get your red and blue light acne treatment , you do n't  get better results by holding your face so close to the lamp that your skin dries out or burns . You do n't  get better results by doing light treatment once a day instead of once a week . This is because the beneficial effects of blue and red light are not just about skin oil production and acne bacteria . <h> The Greatest Benefits of Acne Light Therapy Occur After Low Doses <p> Swedish scientists lead the world in many aspects of acne research . Four researchers at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in G+teborg did a careful study of the changes in numbers of bacteria and production of- skin oil during 20 weeks of treatment with low-intensity and high-intensity blue and red light . The Swedish dermatologists recruited 15 men and women aged 16 to 44 to see if a combination of light treatment and medication made a real difference in getting acne under control . <p> The researchers observed that : <p> Acne sometimes cleared up even when bacteria count and oil production stayed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflammation were more important than the effects of light therapy on acne bacteria and sebocytes . <p> This means that the real benefit of exposing your skin to blue and red light is reducing inflammation . Even whiteheads and blackheads are slightly inflamed , and reducing inflammation in the walls of these pores helps them open . <p> This also means that causing inflammation in your skin by exposing it too much blue and red light is counterproductive . When there 's pain , there 's no gain of clearer skin . <h> Should You Get Acne Light Therapy at Home , at the Spa , or at the Dermatologists Office <p> Blue and red light therapy for acne became popular when government agencies put new restrictions on the use of Accutane and Retin-A for treating acne . Since acne light therapy has no effect on internal organs , it can be used without fear of dire consequences for the patients health . Dermatologists who had been charging their patients $500 a month for office visits and lab work required for the use of Accutane and Retin-A ( as they were used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month for weekly acne light treatments . <p> Then blue and red light devices for spa and home use came out . <p> Some " light " treatment devices are really just hand-held heaters for the skin .

@@98778690 @2978690/ <h> How to Choose the Right Acne Device 19922 @qwx879922 <p> With most acne care products , price is not a good indicator of quality . The most expensive products tend to be the least effective . When it comes to choosing an acne device for home treatment , however , usually you do in fact get what you pay for . Let 's take a look at some of the options for home acne treatment and how well they work . <h> Summary : <p> With most acne products , price is not an indicator of quality , but with acne devices , the most expensive brands usually offer better results . <p> Blackhead extractors are cheap and usually do more harm than good . <p> Acne heat extraction devices , also known as zit zappers , do n't  do anything for blackheads or whiteheads . They can reduce swelling of pimples , but redness remains . If you have Asian or brown skin tones , use of these devices can cause permanent discoloration of the skin . <p> At-home laser therapy systems , which cost around US $1000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a skin type that should be treated with laser . <h> Blackhead Extractors <p> Blackhead extractors usually sell for US $5 or less in drugstores and pharmacies . They consist of a plastic syringe with an open tip surrounded by a rubber ring . The idea is to place the open end of the syringe over a blackhead and to draw the plunger back , creating a vacuum . The change in air pressure over the blackhead supposedly will loosen it so it falls right out . <p> Without any preparation of the skin , these devices just about never work . If they are not placed directly over a blackhead , they just leave little red rings or tiny cuts on healthy skin . If they are placed directly over a blackhead , more often than not they will just leave little red rings or tiny cuts around the blackhead . This makes the blackhead more noticeable , not less . <p> You can prepare your skin by holding a warm ( not hot ) moist clean washcloth to the skin for 10 to 20 minutes , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid ( BHA ) product on the skin . But if you take these steps first , the blackhead is just as likely to come out on its own as it is to come out with the help of the blackhead extractor . <h> Zit Zappers , also known as Acne Heat Extraction Devices <p> Several brands of acne heat extraction devices , including the ANSR Beam and Charger , Radiancy no ! no ! Skin , and the Zeno Hot Spot Blemish Clearing Device and other models in the same line , promise to get rid of pimples with a blast of heat . The " zapper " builds up heat in a replaceable cartridge that is then held to a pimple . There 's a slight ( or sometimes not so slight ) sting as heat kills the bacteria in the pore . Over the 24 hours , the pore subsides to the level of the skin so it is easier to conceal . Over the next two weeks , inflammation subsides in the pimple as it is replaced by healthy skin . <p> However , if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be replaced by healthy pigmented skin . Chances are that you will have replaced a pink spot with a brown or black spot . <p> People who have fair , oily , non-reactive skin ( that is , they do n't  experience redness and inflammation easily ) sometimes get good results with heating devices for the skin . People who have sensitive skin , or who have dark skin tones , usually do not . <p> Traditional microdermabrasion is a process of rubbing corundum or aluminum oxide crystals over the skin to remove dead skin and to stimulate the growth of collagen underneath the skin to smooth over scars and other imperfections . The results are not immediate , but the process is not painful . The only downside to at-home microdermabrasion is the possibility of getting crystals in your eyes , which can be avoided in you read and follow instructions . <p> Microdermabrasion kits for use at home range in price from US $14.97 to $299.99 . Usually the difference between a less expensive model and a more expensive model is the inclusion of vacuum wand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do the microdermabrasion . Without this attachment , you have to get crystals off your face with careful repeated cleansing . Aluminum oxide crystals left on your skin can cause skin irritation and get into your eyes . Most people find that the use of the wand makes the experience of microdermabrasion much more pleasant . <h> Blue and Red Light Therapy Devices <p> Visible blue light breaks down the cell membrane of acne bacteria . Visible red light helps shrink pores . Lamps providing blue and red light help stop the formation of new blemishes so the skin can repair existing blemishes , at no additional cost other than the initial purchase price of the lamp . Your initial outlay for the lamp or light box , however , will probably be between US $199.99 and $799.99 plus shipping and tax . The wavelengths of light used in acne treatment do n't  cause cancer and do n't  damage the eyes , but you may feel more comfortable using protective goggles for your eyes , which will cost another $14.99 to $59.99 . <p> Blue and red light therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically notice about half as many blemishes after 4 to 6 weeks . Further improvement depends on the rest of your skin care routine . It is still necessary to do daily cleansing and weekly exfoliation with alpha- or beta-hydroxy acids . <p> The key to success with any blue or red light therapy device for acne is to use it in moderation . The directions will tell you to use the device just 15 minutes a day . Using the lamp for an hour a day , or sitting so close to the lamp that you burn your skin , does not help you clear up pimples . It just dries out your skin so it becomes more susceptible to blackheads and whiteheads . Even if you spent your whole paycheck on a blue light lamp , do n't  try to get clear skin overnight . Blue and red light therapy help bring and keep acne under control , and they do n't  have side effects if used as directed , but they are not a miracle cure for acne . <h> Home Laser Therapy for Acne <p> Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resurfacing of the skin . Its fast , its relatively painless , and its also quite expensive . It is not unusual to spend US $1,000 to $5,000 for a complete set of laser resurfacing treatments for acne-scarred skin . <p> Home laser therapy treatment kits offer a lower-cost alternative to treatment at the doctors office , but they not cheap . The SDL30 At Home Use Laser for Spider Veins , Pigmentation Problems , Acne Treatments , Scar Reduction , Rejuvenation and Face Lift , for example , is discounted on Amazon.com to US $1,197.95 . It really works for all the applications for which is advertised " but what the product advertising does not mention is that some skin types should not be treated with laser at all . If you have black skin , for instance , laser treatment can cause permanent black pigmentation to form where acne blemishes are removed .

@@98778692 @2978692/ <h> Can Birth Control Pills Really Cure Acne ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> The pill can be used to help control acne , eliminating blemishes by as much as 60% . <p> Many women find that acne clears up when they go on the contraceptive Pill . For some women , however , oral contraceptives have a minimal effect on blemished skin . This article explains why most women who have acne get clearer skin but some do not . <h> Summary : <p> Many women of reproductive age break out with acne just before they get their periods . <p> Increasing estrogen levels decreases the production of sebum in the skin . <p> Increasing progesterone levels increases the production of sebum in the skin . <p> Contraceptive pills are usually a combination of estrogen and a chemical that is similar to progesterone , and often control acne breakouts . <p> Increasing the amount of estrogen in a contraceptive pill to fight acne can have other serious side effects . <p> In the US , the Bayer birth control pill branded as Yaz is the most popular treatment for premenstrual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It just reduces the number of blemishes by 40 to 60% . <h> How Hormones Interact with the Skin <p> Throughout a womans reproductive years , there is a constantly changing balance of hormones that supports the potential for conception , pregnancy , and birth . At the beginning of a womans menstrual cycle , the pituitary gland in the brain secretes a hormone called follicle stimulating hormone , or FSH . This hormone causes one or more follicles in the ovary to ripen so that they can release their eggs at ovulation . <p> The follicles secrete estrogen , which thickens the lining of the uterus . Small amounts of estrogen inhibit the pituitary gland in the brain from secreting luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , but when estrogen levels build up high enough , the pituitary sends a pulse of LH to cause the follicle or follicles to break open , releasing the egg inside . <p> The egg is viable for only about 24 hours , and sperm has to be on its way to the egg before ovulation for natural conception . More often than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the corpus luteum left behind in the ovary when the egg has been released begins producing another hormone called progesterone . <p> This hormone changes the lining of the uterus so that it could accept a fertilized egg , and also raises a womans core body temperature . If there is no implantation of a fertilized egg into the lining of the uterus , it sloughs off in menstruation , estrogen levels rise , and the cycle starts all over again . <p> When a womans core body temperature rises , acne tends to break out . Progesterone also increases oil production in the skin , so that most women who get this form of hormonal acne break out just before their period . Estrogen decreases the production of oil in the skin so that acne heals , at least until it builds up in the second half of the menstrual period , all over again . <h> How Birth Control Pills Affect Acne <p> Most birth control pills are a combination of estrogen and progestin , a synthetic chemical that is not progesterone but that has effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps the brain from ever sending the ovaries a signal to mature an egg and ovulate . There are many different brands of birth control pills containing varying amounts of the two hormones . Its the estrogen in the Pill that prevents acne . <p> The problem with estrogen is that too much estrogen increases risk of blood clots , heart disease , and cancers of the breast and uterus . High-dose estrogen can itself actually cause acne , by increasing sensitivity to testosterone . Newer forms of synthetic estrogen , however , are strong enough to prevent ovulation acne , but weak enough not to increase a womans sensitivity to her bodys testosterone . <h> How Effective Is the Pill in Treating Acne ? <p> Most studies of oral contraceptives as treatments for mild to moderate acne in women of reproductive age have found that taking the Pill reduces the total number of whiteheads , blackheads , and pimples from 40% to 60% . Oral contraceptives are not a cure for acne , not even for premenstrual acne . They can , however , make it a lot better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes requires trial and error . Extra estrogen does more to prevent acne breakouts , but can also cause breast tenderness , bloating , weight gain , nausea , and headache . Too much progestin increases sebum production in the skin , and also causes weight gain , fatigue , and breast pain . Women who have Asian skin types may experience less acne but more brown spots when acne heals . All of these problems , of course , also have to be considered when the primary goal for using the Pill is contraception . <h> The Pill and Antibiotics Together to Treat Mild Acne <p> Many doctors try to minimize side effects from contraceptives by treating acne with a combination of the Pill and tetracycline antibiotics . This also can cause important health issues . <p> Tetracycline should be taken on an empty stomach , and ca n't be taken with dairy products .

This brand of birth control is well known for its ability to clear up mild acne in women . <p> But because it also contains a chemical known as drosperinone , it can also cause a buildup of potassium in the bloodstream " a potentially serious side effect . This means that if you use Yaz , you should be careful not to eat too many high-potassium vegetables and fruits , such as tomatoes , bananas , and citrus fruit . <h> Should You Start Oral Contraceptives to Control Acne ? <p> Doctors sometimes put girls as young as eight on the Pill to control acne , although many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an age . Women who are old enough to make their own sexual choices , however , may consider going on the Pill to help their complexions . <p> Generally , this is a bad idea .

Then at puberty , she popped out with ugly acne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products she tried actually made her acne worse . <p> Paula Begouns way of handling her situation was not only to become an expert in skin care products , but to create new skin care products that actually work for treating " untreatable " skin conditions . As she writes in her bestselling book Do n't  Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me , " I knew from my own experience that there was something very wrong with the cosmetics industry , especially in the skin-care area . My personal experience had taught me that , no matter what the advertisements said , astringents do n't  close pores . Products that claimed not to cause breakouts actually made them worse , and many of the things I did to treat my acne only increased its redness and irritation . " <p> After years of trial and error , Paula Begoun created Paulas Choice , a line of reliable skin care treatments for almost every skin care need .

Excellent brands are Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel 10 , Clearasil Stay Clear Tinted Acne Treatment Cream , Oxy Spot Treatment , and Stridex Power Pads , all available for US $5 to $6 . <p> Olay Foaming Face Wash and Olay Gentle Foaming Face Wash are the least expensive effective skin cleansers for all types of skin except very dry . Boots Expert Sensitive Cleansing &amp; Toning Wipes are the best buy for acne sufferers who have very dry skin . <p> The best skin " scrubs " do n't  really scrub the skin . They combine exfoliants that lift up dead skin around pores and emollients that keep the skin soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five brands are very good for acne-affected skin : Boots , Good Skin , Marcelle , Neutrogena , and Olay . Boots and Neutrogena cost less than half as much as the other brands . <p> Swipes 14% AHA pads are a great way to exfoliate your skin for less than $0.75 per treatment . Simply swipe the skin with the pad as directed and dead skin cells stick to the pad . It opens clogged pores and helps smooth out fine lines and wrinkles . Do n't  forget to rinse your skin in warm water and pat dry with a clean towel after you use the pad . <h> Five Over the Counter Acne Treatments that Are n't  Worth the Money <p> Antioxidants are great for acne-prone skin . Antioxidant cleansers are a waste of money , though . Why ? Because you wash the antioxidants down the drain before they have a chance to sink into your skin . <p> Cooling " masques " made with medicinal clay will indeed relieve itchy acne . The problem is that they are usually quite expensive , and almost any " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/10 of the price . <p> Dead Sea salts and Dead Sea mud are never the cure-all for anyones skin . While a Dead Sea mud pack actually can soak up excess oil and tiny flakes of dead skin that can block pores , there are many less expensive products that work as well or better . <p> " Medicated " concealers typically do n't  contain any medication that actually reduces inflammation or kills acne bacteria . They do not harm the skin , but they do not help it , either . <p> Proactiv is a good product that is heavily advertised in TV infomercials in the United States and Canada . Clearskin Professional Acne Treatment is advertised as " better than Proactiv " because it contains zinc . Actually , the much more expensive Clearskin product is not as good as Proactiv . Zinc is of limited value to skin care when it is applied to the skin .

@@98778694 @2978694/ <h> What 's New In Acne Home Remedies ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Home ultrasound machines can help treat acne by drawing bacteria and oil out of pores . <p> Probably you can find out everything you need to know about how to use apple cider vinegar , lemon juice , rose water , various herbal concoctions , milk and honey , green tea , mud packs , and other low-tech acne home remedies in any number of books and on any number of sites on the Internet . But for a slightly higher initial investment , you can acquire many of the tools used by dermatologists for use in your own home for a fraction of what you would have to pay at the doctors office . None of them are cures , but- some beat medication in certain situations and get results without stress or any problems . Here are three of the best and most effective to reduce swelling and get rid of acne . <h> Summary : <p> Ultrasound is n't just for taking a look at babies before they are born . A home ultrasound machine can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and draw bacteria and oil out of pores . <p> Blue light and red-and-blue light kill acne bacteria . The addition of red light is anti-inflammatory . Light therapy is primarily a maintenance therapy , but it can also greatly accelerate recovery from outbreaks . <p> Dermatologists use hot lasers to burn acne off the skin . Home laser therapy kits use cool lasers to stimulate growth of the skin that opens pores from the inside out . <h> Ultrasound for Acne Treatment <p> Ultrasound is best known as a tool for medical diagnostic . Ultrasound machines generating 5 million pulses a second can be used as a kind of human body radar system to find the contours and textures of internal organs or an unborn baby . <p> Ultrasound operating at a slightly lower frequency , however , just 1 to 2 million pulses a second , has an astonishing effect on the skin . For just a few thousandths of a second , the pulses from an ultrasound machine can initiate resonant frequencies that jostle skin cells in ways that open tiny , molecule-sized pathways through the uppermost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit a molecule of a skin treatment agent , but not wide enough to admit viruses , bacteria , or dirt . Using an ultrasound massager on the face while applying a skin treatment agent vastly accelerates absorption . <p> Of course , if you use ultrasound treatment to help your skin absorb anti-acne treatments , you want to make sure that you are using the right treatments . Some natural products really are n't  a good idea for treating acne . You do n't  want to use ultrasound , for instance , to help your skin absorb essential oils that to which you may be allergic . You do n't  want to use ultrasound if you still have any kind of irritant soap or detergent on your skin . <p> Fortunately , home ultrasound treatment kits include detailed instructions for their use . You want to look for a " galvanic spot " or " home iontophoresis unit , " iontophoresis referring to the passage of small molecules through the skin during ultrasound massage . Most units retail for less than US $150 . Probably the best uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters or alpha-lipoic acid or DMAE creams for treating acne scars . Some people find that the machine also works without any skin care products at all , bringing pus and oil from inside pimples painlessly to the surface of the skin where they can be washed away . <h> Home Blue Light Acne Therapy <p> The bacteria that cause acne are particularly sensitive to certain wavelengths of visible blue light . Blue light resonates with a chemical called a porphyrin . Intense blue light causes the porphyrin in the cell membrane of the acne bacteria to release massive amounts of free radicals of oxygen , which rupture the lining of the cell . Since blue light does not penetrate deep into the skin , lower levels of the skin and the tissues underneath are unharmed by the treatment . <p> Blue light therapy only stops the growth of the bacteria that cause inflammation and irritation when they grow to excessive numbers inside skin pores . It does not melt away existing blackheads or whiteheads . When the skin is relieved of the burden of fighting infection , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing acne to fall off the face . <p> One of the most useful home blue light acne therapy units is the Trophy Skin BlueMD blue light treatment lamp . Designed by British dermatologists , the lamp can be used for 10,000 hours of treatment . Simply shining the lamp on acne-affected skin for 20 minutes three times a week , however , is usually enough to eliminate 50 to 60% of blemishes in about 3 months . <p> The best way to use home blue light acne therapy , however , is to maintain clear skin , stopping blemishes before they start . Home units generally cost about $200 . Blue light is helpful for most people who have acne , although people who have oily , sensitive skin or rosacea should not use it , because of heating of the skin . More is not necessarily better when it comes to blue light treatment . Never use the machine longer or more often than the manufacturer recommends . <h> Home Red Light Acne Therapy <p> For about US $50 , users of blue light therapy lamps can buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light simultaneously . Some researchers have found that the combination of light from both the red and blue spectra of visible light eliminated up to 80% of acne blemishes in 12 weeks . This result is a little better than most acne sufferers get from benzoyl peroxide . The treatment kit is a good alternative to benzoyl peroxide for people who get peeling or flaking when they use benzoyl peroxide foams or gels . The addition of red light is thought by some researchers to be anti-inflammatory as well as antibacterial . <p> The same people who should not use blue light also should not use red light . Rosacea outbreaks can be triggered by intense light treatment , especially if the lamp is held so close to the skin that it causes heat . When light treatment does not work , the main problem usually is tightness of the skin that traps oil and bacteria inside pores . However , when light treatment does not work , antibiotics and benzoyl peroxide usually would not work , either . <p> Many people find that their pimples heal 3 to 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria inside pimples . The low-intensity laser light kills bacteria without killing skin cells . It can even stimulate the skins production of vitamin D. <p> Home laser treatment , however , is used to treat existing pimples , not to prevent blackheads and whiteheads . Keeping skin clear depends on a comprehensive program of diet , cleansing , exfoliation , and moisturizing as needed to keep acne away for good . 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778695 @2978695/ <h> How to Cure Acne Taking a Look at Natural Cures for Acne 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Keeping your digestive system healthy and hydrated can help keep acne away . <p> Can you really cure acne and get rid of unsightly blemishes and pimples for good ? Almost every acne sufferer can cure acne with a minimum of prescription medications such as antibiotics and Accutane , but some of the most effective treatments for mild to moderate acne are seldom discussed . <p> Antioxidants can make a huge difference in how fast acne heals . But some antioxidants work inside your body , while other antioxidants are best applied directly to the skin . <p> Chocolate does not cause skin blemishes , most of the time . <p> For mild to moderate acne , treatment can be as simple as 1-2-3 . <h> The Hidden Connection Between Healthy Digestion and Healthy Skin <p> Seventy years ago , at least in the United States , it was taken for granted that a healthy colon had a lot to do with healthy skin . Two dermatologists named John H. Stokes and Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depression , and acne . They theorized that probiotic bacteria , such as Bifodobacterium and Lactobacillus acidophilous , interacted with the immune system , " upregulating " the chemical signals that tell the skin to fight acne bacteria , and also with the brain , by " downregulating " the chemical signals that cause inflammation . <p> Stokes and Pillsbury noticed that adults who continued to have acne often had bloating , gas , constipation , and a mental state best described as " the blahs . " Especially in older adults , the presence of acne , sluggish digestion , and low-grade depression was also accompanied by a failure of the stomach to secrete enough stomach acid . Stomach acid kills unhealthy bacteria , such as Bacteriodes , but leaves more of the helpful bacteria untouched . This observation led to two different ways to treat the combination of acne , indigestion , and depression . <p> One way to treat the problem is to consume probiotics . In the United States , " Greek " yogurt is the product most likely to provide the full range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vegan probiotic supplement like Alive . Providing your gut with more healthy bacteria helps them get rid of the unhealthy bacteria that cause symptoms . <p> To keep the unhealthy bacteria from coming back , it helps to stimulate the production of stomach acid . Bitter foods trigger the release of stomach acid . Since most poisons in plants have a bitter taste , the human body has developed a kind of preemptive first aid system that dissolves bitter foods more thoroughly than sweet , salty , sour , or umami foods . You do n't  have to give up anything sweet , you just have to eat the bitter food separately , preferably at the beginning of the meal . Salad greens are enough to activate the release of stomach acid that kills pro-acne bacteria and protects anti-acne bacteria . <h> Hydrating Tight Pores <p> Another way to fight acne is with water . Dry skin is usually tight skin . Tight skin traps oil and bacteria inside pores . Hydrating the skin loosens it so oil and bacteria can flow naturally to the surface , where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the inside out does n't  usually require drinking amounts of water . Drinking enough water to avoid dehydration is usually enough . If you are indoors in a cool place , you may only need 5 cups ( about 1200 ml ) of water every day to provide your skin with the moisture it needs from your body . Especially if you have oily skin , however , you need much more water if you go outside in hot water " as much as 5 cups or more per hour at 40- C/104- F or more . <p> Hydrating your skin from outside is usually accomplished with moisturizers . There are some ingredients in moisturizers that sound bad but that are really OK , such as cholesterol and ceramides ( famous as the supposedly " toxic " chemical formed in the oil used to cook French fries ) . There are also some ingredients in moisturizers that sound OK but that are really bad for your skin , such as essential oils , most herbal extracts , and alcohol . All of these ingredients can dry out skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep your skin hydrated . " Oily " skin just refers to the production of oil from your pores , not the moisture content of your skin itself . <h> Antioxidants in You vs . Antioxidants on You <p> Antioxidants help the skin stop the inflammation that causes the long-term damage from acne . If you have dark , oily acne-affected skin , for example , your skin will produce unusually large amounts of the pigment melanin to serve as a protective antioxidant . Melanin , however , gives your skin its darker shades , so the melanin it makes to repair damage from inflammation becomes a more or less permanent brown or black spot . Providing the skin with alternative antioxidants helps prevent the process that protects the skin with permanent blemishes . <p> The antioxidants that help when taken by mouth are alpha-lipoic acid , also great for firming up bags and sags , and DMAE , great for helping the skin fill in indentations . If you take alpha-lipoic acid , be sure your product is formulated to include the B vitamin biotin , or take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest effect applied to your skin in creams or lotions are vitamins C and E , but not just any vitamin C or E will work . " Ordinary " vitamin C is water-soluble , but about 75% of the content of your skin is fat . You need a special kind of vitamin C known as ascorbyl palmitate that can penetrate the skin to do it good . <h> But What About Chocolate ? <p> Very few people need to go on a special , restricted diet to fight acne . But nearly everyone does better by avoiding excessive consumption of chocolate . <p> Samantha Block , a medical student at the University of Miami , recruited 10 men aged 18 to 35 who had a history of mild to moderate acne vulgaris . Her recruits had at least one active acne lesion ( that is , a blackhead , a whitehead , or a pimple ) , but no more than four . She then offered them as many pure dark chocolate Ghiradelli candy bars as they wanted " no one in the test took more than three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next week . Ms. Block did not include women in the study because menstrual cycles and birth control use would complicate interpretation of the results . <p> At the end of five days , one of the volunteers in the study had 85 new pimples ! Most of the men who indulged in chocolate bars had at least 10 new blemishes . If you have acne , you really should not have chocolate . <h> Stress And Acne <p> While acne myths are quite common , hormonal fluctuations really do cause acne and stress really does affect hormone levels . Certainly remedies such as over the counter products , drugs , - and- light treatment devices have their place in the fight to get clear , but reducing stress is equally important and should not be overlooked . Most people do n't  need a guide to reducing stress , they already realize what needs to be changed , and its obviously something that is- both free and can be done from home . <h> Putting It All Together <p> None of these common sense interventions for acne is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , however , maybe that little something extra your skin needs for all the other hard work you put into acne treatment to work . Without giving up any part of your existing acne routine , try these simple steps . It may be that the treatment that enables you to cure acne is a safe , inexpensive , minor addition to your daily skin care routine . 19923 @qwx879923

A cream , for instance , is great for sticking to your skin , but there are two major problems with any " creamy " acne care product . One problem with a cream is that it can clog pores . The other problem with any kind of cream is that irritant ingredients stay on your skin and do maximum damage , and many misguided formulations for acne care contain multiple irritants " and charge you more for them . <p> Gels are designed to keep certain ingredients on your skin . The antiseptic benzoyl peroxide , for example , is often applied as a gel . Gels are semi-liquid because of the way they use proteins , rather than oils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a gel is going to ensure that it stays there . <p> A lotion is lighter on your skin . It is easier to spread across your skin , but it is thick enough to stay on your skin . Lotions do n't  contain the high concentrations of oils and emollients that can clog pores , but lotions often do contain emulsifiers that can irritate your skin . <p> Most lotions contain an ingredient called cetearyl alcohol , which is also known as cetostearyl alcohol and cetylstearyl alcohol . The addition of cetearyl alcohol to a mixture of oil in water or water in oil helps keep oil and water components blended . Some healing ingredients are water-soluble , and others are soluble in fat . With cetearyl alcohol to keep the whole mixture emulsified , lotions can deliver more different kinds of healing ingredients to the skin . <p> Even so , there are two major problems with most lotions . One is that the water-soluble vitamins and antioxidants that you are added to many lotions degrade as soon as the container is opened , or even before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or plastic . <p> The other problem with most lotions is that cetearyl alcohol itself can irritate the skin . One way this lotion ingredient can cause skin problems is by making lotions too foamy . Big bubbles " grab " the skin . They break down the skin and provide tiny passageways for staph and strep infections to enter the skin . <p> The other way cetearyl lotion can irritate the skin is by activating the immune system in the skin . Chemical byproducts of the interaction of cetearyl alcohol and the air form a kind of homing signal for a group of white blood cells known as the macrophages . <p> The term macrophage literally means " big eater . " A macrophage can surround a bacterium and consume it . That sounds like a good thing , but macrophages are so big that they tend to get stuck in blood vessels and stuck in pores . <p> The more often the immune system sends macrophages to the skin , the more likely they are to cause localized swelling . When the macrophages eventually die , the immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macrophages can get stuck , too . The result is puffiness in the skin that is not caused by allergy or infection and that is very hard to treat . <h> What Makes Serums Better for Your Skin ? <p> Serums have advantages over both creams and lotions . Wikipedia defines a serum as a " cosmetic that is more expensive than a cream , " but not all serums are more expensive than creams and lotions and there are reasons serums may work much better on the skin . <p> What makes a serum a serum is its lightness . Serums stick to the skin without smothering pores . They keep healing ingredients on the skin but they do n't  lock the ingredient into the skin . <p> Serums usually contain glycerin to give them the ability to stick to the skin . Glycerin is a food . ( Glycerol , which was the main ingredient in antifreeze before the widespread use of ethylene glycol , is toxic . ) Glycerin absorbs moisture from the air and helps keep moisture in the skin . It slowly releases the botanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into pores . <p> Glycerin is safe for all skin types , and it is preferable for serums used to treat normal , oily , and slightly dry skin . A similar chemical , propylene glycol , is not a foodstuff but is even lighter on the skin . Triglycerides and alkyl benzoates act in a similar way and are also safe for all skin types . But even serums can go wrong . <h> Serums You Need to Avoid <p> There is always a way to make a good acne product bad , and that happens with some serums . Some serums include sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate ( labeled in the UK and Australia and sodium dodecyl sulfate ) . This ingredient helps serums spread smoothly over the face , but it also irritates the skin . Tiny red pimples break out , especially at the corners of the mouth . The addition of sodium lauryl sulfate to a serum makes it a product you should avoid . <h> Serums You Should Try <p> On the other hand , some serums are very well balanced for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serum , for example , uses a glycerin-like ingredient called propylene glycol in purified water to spread green tea extracts and tea tree oil over the skin . You really would not want to eat this product ( you would get diarrhea ) , but it is non-toxic and light on this skin . <p> Exposed Skin Care Clear Pore Treatment uses propylene glycol and purified water to carry witch hazel extract , which helps bind " loose " skin cells to the surface of the skin , as well as licorice extract , which reduces the effects of testosterone on the skin . Witch hazel , by the way , is not for treating acne .

Eating yeast , however , is an age-old treatment for acne that actually works . <p> The microorganisms in yeast are dissolved in the digestive acids in your stomach . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from eating yeast . However , the dead bodies of yeast cells play an important role in your colon . <p> The immune system recognizes these dead yeast cells as bacteria . It releases inflammatory chemicals to destroy them " and destroys them very easily . The immune system learns that bacterial infections do not have to be hit with a massive attack of inflammation , and releases less inflammation when it encounters acne bacteria in the skin . <p> You can find live yeast ( dried yeast does n't  have a chance to activate before your stomach digests it ) in the dairy case at your local market . Its possible to eat the gray , moist yeast like a snack , but most people will prefer to disguise it in cold cereal or a smoothie . Just 5 grams ( about a teaspoon ) of live yeast every other day for 30 days will make a difference in your complexion . <p> The kind of yeast used to make bread , also known as brewers yeast , is what you need . This kind of yeast is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeast comes in foil and has to be kept in the refrigerator . Do n't  use the packets of dry yeast that you can keep on the shelf . <h> 2 . Olive oil <p> Every body knows that olive oil is a healthy food . Not everyone knows that you actually could cleanse your skin with it " even if you have oily skin . Like dissolves like , so olive oil can dissolve and remove oil clogging pores in your skin . <p> The best way to use olive oil as homemade acne treatment is to use just a tiny amount of oil , about 1/4 teaspoon or just 1 ml , as a moisturizer for the sides of your face after you wash your face and towel it dry . You can also apply olive oil to your cheeks , forehead , nose , and chin , but it is absolutely essential that the skin of your face should be absolutely clean first . You do n't  want for olive oil to seal in chemicals that can irritate your skin , including any splash from toothpaste or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as SLS. <h> 3 . Baking soda <p> The best way to use baking soda to treat your acne is to use it instead of toothpaste when you brush your teeth . Why ? A baking soda scrub gets food particles off your teeth without need for any chemical foaming agents . The chemicals toothpaste manufacturers add to their products to make them foam can cause acne on the chin and at the corners of the mouth . One study even found that 80% of adult women who had acne cleared up their skin in just one month by discontinuing use of toothpaste , mouthwash , and shampoo that contained SLS. <h> 4 . Sunshine <p> Sun is great for your skin " for about 20 minutes a day . A few minutes of sun on your face and hands eery morning enables your skin to make vitamin D. This vitamin not only is essential for healthy bones and for preventing cancer . It also reduces the production of oil in the pores of your skin . More than 20 minutes of sun a day , however , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your face when you use benzoyl peroxide. <h> 5 . Moisturizer <p> In much of the world , skin moisturizers are not a treatment for skin problems . They are a basic part of skin protection against summer heat and winter cold that cause the skin to dry and flake . Especially if you have adult acne or rosacea , however , using a moisturizer on your skin " any moisturizer that is made with oil and water and that does not contain alcohol " can keep your skin flexible and also prevent irritation of capillaries underneath your skin . Flexible skin allows pores to drain and prevents common acne . Healthy blood vessels do n't  leak blood and cause rosacea outbreaks . <h> 6 . Steroid avoidance <p> There is also a simple change in home health care that can help you avoid outbreaks of pimples on your cheeks and nose : Do n't  use over-the-counter steroid creams such as Cortaid and generic hydrocortisone . These products used to stop inflammation , ironically , can cause inflammation of the skin that closely resembles the tiny pimples induced by rosacea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak is around the nostrils " simply avoiding corticosteroid ointments whenever possible can spare a teen of the embarrassment of zits breaking out around the nose . <h> 7 . Cleaning combs and hair brushes <p> Acne on the scalp and forehead can be caused by an unsuspected source of oil " dirty combs and hair brushes . Cleansing your combs and brushes in warm water at least once a week will keep them from accumulating oils that can be transferred to your skin where they can clog pores that develop acne. <h> 8 . Preventing " stringers fingers " <p> If you play tennis , kick the habit of adjusting the strings of your racket after each match . The tension on the skin of your fingers can constrict pores and cause a relatively rare form of hand acne. <h> 9 . Fresh razors <p> One of the most disfiguring forms of acne is acne keloidalis nuchae , resulting from the ingrown hairs and whiskers being sealed under the skin . To prevent ingrown hairs , always shave whiskers or hair with a new razor , throwing away safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury to your skin . <p> I am currently in a complete detox and have started oil cleansing , if you have never heard of it . I use a mixture of Raw Honey , Castor oil , coconut oil , tea tree and lavender oil &amp; a tad of baking soda to cleanse and apple cider vinegar for astringent then use a blend of vitamin e oil , frankincense and lemon eo oils as a leave on treatment . I also started making my own spray deodorant and use olive oil with lavender to moisturize my body , all these eo oils are antibacterial , odor eliminating , the lavender is soothing of redness and cooling and it and frankincense are moisturizing . You have to give time for your body to detox itself since the first and easiest place for toxins to exit is your skin , I am going into week 2 and broke out worse but that was expected until about 3 weeks in . The idea is clean out the toxins so your skin will not be the vice to dispell them out of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ingredients I use all have anti fungal , antibacterial and antiseptic properties &amp; unlike otc treatments or even prescribed treatments it does not strip the oils from your skin causing your body to make all new oils , our natural skin oils are our natural cleanser , so instead of stripping it which can cause your skin to be unprotected and bacteria to enter pores easily it strips the old oil and REPLACES it with a natural good cleansing oil . Coconut and olive oil are good for so many things ear infections tooth infections ect nd the castor oil is way antiseptic and cleansing . I figure there is n't much to lose since I have tried everything else , It can basically get no worse and honestly the research I have done and logic behind this makes more sense really than everything else . 19923 @qwx879923

Together these two ingredients get rid of almost all acne bacteria on the skin and in pores and clear up blemishes fast . <h> Summary : <p> Duac cream is a combination of the antibiotic clindamycin with the antibacterial product benzoyl peroxide . <p> The advantage of Duac over nearly all other prescription acne treatments is that it gets to work fast . Up to 50% of blemishes may disappear in the first two weeks . <p> Some people will find the benzoyl peroxide in Duac irritating to the skin . If this happens , be sure to use the product at night rather than in the morning . <p> People with brown or Asian skin types can stop skin pigmentation before it starts by taking care to use sunscreen when Duac treatment , and by applying vitamin E creams to the skin during the part of the day Duac is not in use . <p> Moisturizer can prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> What 's Special About the Ingredients in Duac ? <p> Clindamycin is the antibiotic of choice for fighting acne in Canada and the UK . It has one very important advantage over the antibiotic minocycline , which is used in the USA . Minocycline can stain teeth , and clindamycin will not . Dermatologists in the USA usually reason that any staining of the teeth by minocycline will be at the gum line and " wont be all that bad , " but doctors in Canada and the UK seldom prescribe minocycline to anyone under the age of 22 . <p> Benzoyl peroxide is the worlds most commonly used acne treatment . It breaks down into two compounds , hydrogen peroxide and benzoin , both of which are slightly irritating ( and sometimes more than slightly irritating ) to the skin and both of which kill acne bacteria , although in different ways . The addition of benzoyl peroxide to the formula gets the acne bacteria that clindamycin leaves behind , and helps reduce the risk that antibiotic treatment could create a new strain of bacteria that is resistant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination products is that it starts to work fast , usually in 48 hours or less . It gets rid of significantly more blemishes than competing combination product Zineryt , nearly twice as many in the first week , and about 10% more by the end of four weeks . <p> Duac also works faster than Differin . In fact , the difference between Duac and Differin is even more pronounced than the difference between Duac and Zineryt . A clinical trial conducted at Warsaw Medical University in Poland found that Differin got rid of 25% of blemishes in two weeks , but Duac got rid of 45% of blemishes in the first 14 days of treatment . <p> Duac does not get rid of every blemish on acne-prone skin . No treatment does . However , over 2/3 of whiteheads , blackheads , and pimples should disappear in 30 days or less . <h> Who Benefits Most from Duac ? <p> Duac gets rid of all kinds of blemishes , but it is more effective for pimples than for whiteheads and blackheads . The benzoyl peroxide in Duac can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white bath linens if you use this product , and you need to keep it off shirts and blouses . <p> Duac contains 5% benzoyl peroxide . Many people complain that this concentration of benzoyl peroxide stings , especially at first . It can also cause redness and irritation of the skin . Duac is hard to hide beneath makeup , and you may need green concealer to hide pimples , because pimples treated with Duac may shine through gold or brown concealer or foundation . <h> What Can Go Wrong With Duac ? <p> Aside from bleaching clothes and causing skin irritation , the most common problem with Duac treatment is that acne sometimes comes back with a vengeance when you quit using the drug . The way to prevent this is to continue using a 2% to 4% benzoyl peroxide product for at least a week or so when you stop using Duac . <p> It is a good idea to use a moisturizer if you use Duac . If you use Duac at night , then you can apply the moisturizer at night over the layer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisturizer if you are using Duac ; no matter what your skin type , the combination of alcohol in any skin care product and benzoyl peroxide in Duac will dry out your skin . Taking the moisture out of your skin is not good for acne . It traps oil in pores by tightening your skin . <p> People who have Asian skin types sometimes experience browning of the skin after pimples have been cleared with Duac . Prevent this by using at least SPF-15 sun block ( sun block in your moisturizer is OK ) during the day , and by using arbutin powder and/or a moisturizer that contains vitamin E cream at night . Do n't  use the vitamin E cream or lotion during the same part of the day as when you are using Duac ; the benzoyl peroxide in the product can neutralize vitamin E. <p> In rare cases , people get the clindamycin component of Duac into their digestive tracts . In the colon , the antibiotic can kill almost all bacteria except Clostridium difficile . The Clostridium bacteria trigger severe diarrhea and can even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can stop absorption of water into the bloodstream . See your doctor the same day you develop diarrhea if you are using Duac . <h> Is Duac Enough for Fighting Acne ? <p> Duac is great for fighting pimples and for getting results fast . The thing to keep in mind about using Duac is that it almost never gets rid of 100% of acne blemishes . To do that , you will need a complete skin care system . <p> What makes a skin care system complete ? Ideally , you need a cleanser to keep pores from getting clogged , a skin tonic to help loosen hardened sebum to take the " black " out of blackheads , a moisture complex to keep your skin from drying and flaking and to keep your pores open , a microdermabrasion cloth to slowly remove brown spots and smooth out scars , and a clarifying mask that will pull oils out of your skin ( as well as feel really good ) .

There is one very important method we have not mentioned yet , however , and its dry tattooing . <h> What Is Dry Tattooing and Who Does It ? <p> A dry tattoo , also known as dry needling , is a tattoo without ink . Its a procedure that can be done by a tattoo artist ( make very , very sure you establish the result you want before you begin if you go this route ) , but it is better to go to an aesthetician who specializes in dry needling for acne skin repair . Usually you would go to an aesthetician or cosmetologist who does permanent makeup . <h> What 's Special About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmetic acupuncture , " but that description is wholly inaccurate . Acupuncture is an ancient Asian healing technique that was conceived in terms of blockages and flows of an invisible energy called chi . <p> Dry needling is not acupuncture . It is based on the scientific observation that the basal layer of the skin can- be stimulated to produce collagen that can fill in scars from the inside out . And dry needling around raised scars can stimulate growth of skin that pulls the skin taut and flattens the area of scarring so it can at least be concealed with makeup . <p> Dry needling is not something you should ever try at home . Especially if you have more than one scar , stimulating the growth of skin in ways that are helpful on one part of your face may be detrimental to the appearance of another part of your face . Leave the procedure to a professional who has seen many cases and knows how to prevent problems . But you do n't  have to get the procedure from a doctor . <h> Is Dry Needling Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scars and get dry needling find that the results of needling last a lot longer than the results of collagen injection . Collagen injections begin to break down as soon as the procedure is done . Collagen creation stimulated by needling the skin continues for months or years . Dry needling can also be an alternative for Botox injections for wrinkles . <p> A skilled aesthetician does not try to bring the skin to its original contours . That is asking too much of your skin . What the dry needle operator does is to make subtle changes to the skin that either take shadows off raised acne scars or that make indented acne scars appear to be filled in . In some cases the patient decides to go with " wet needling , " or traditional tattooing . The design used for the tattoo , however , usually is chosen to cover up scars that otherwise would have to be removed- by laser or surgery . <h> What Can You Expect at a Dry Needling Appointment ? <p> All professional aestheticians will make sure they understand your health needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or blood thinner ( either of which should be stopped at least 24 hours before the procedure under your doctors supervision ) and whether you have herpes or cold sores . Any kind of trauma to the skin can " awaken " herpes or cold sores viruses . <p> Aestheticians will also want to make sure that you are able to give informed consent , that you have made arrangements to stay indoors for a few days while your skin heals , and that you understand what they are about to do . The aesthetician first puts a topical anesthetic on the skin to dull the pain of needling . The needles used in dry needling are bulkier and go in deeper than the needles most American acupuncturists use for acupuncture . ( If you were to get acupuncture in China , usually without pain killers there , you would experience a sensation similar to dry needling in the United States ) . <p> The aesthetician then choose sites that need extra collagen to make scars less visible . A needle is stuck 1 to 2 mm ( about 1/20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the skin at a 45-degree angle . Its less painful and less injurious to needle the skin at a 45-degree angle than it is just to jab the needle straight in . ( This is something it is helpful to remember if you ever have to give yourself or a family member or a pet shots at home. ) - There is usually no bleeding at all , or if there is bleeding , it is usually only momentary and very slight . <p> The needling process follows the outline of the scar being treated . Your aesthetician should never place a needle into a raised scar . The skins healing processes kick in and create just enough collagen at just the right places . <h> Pros and Cons of Dry Needling <p> Dry needling is often used when other procedures , such as dermabrasion or facial peels , go wrong . While it would be better to use dry needling before using harsher skin treatment techniques , the simple fact is that the technique is usually a second choice . <p> Many other procedures for removing acne scars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needling usually requires 2 or 3 days . If you have an issue with hypopigmentation ( a common problem after surgical removal of acne-scarred skin and small skin cancers ) , needling will stimulate production of the pigment melanin in the skin so that your entire face has the same coloration . On the other hand , if you have an Asian , Hispanic , or African skin type , you should be sure to get assurances from the dry needler that the procedure will not cause excessive pigmentation of your face . <p> A good dry needler can achieve either a natural look , simply restoring the appearance of normal skin contours and even coloration , or a dramatic look , replacing a scar with a tattoo that is more noticeable than the skin problem . But before you even look into dry needling for acne scar repair , consider using microdermabrasion cloths and microdermabrasion creams available from Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778701 @2978701/ <h> Do Antibiotics for Acne Really Work ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> One of the reasons antibiotics are not as effective on acne as they used to be is a result of antibiotic resistance . <p> One of the most influential bloggers about acne in the world , an individual known as Dan , recently blogged about the declining confidence of dermatologists in antibiotic treatments for acne . Many antibiotics that used to work for acne do n't  work any more because of antibiotic resistance , Dan correctly points out , and antibiotics never have worked all that well at getting rid of blemishes anyway . But just how effective " or ineffective " are antibiotics for acne , anyway ? <h> The Problem of Antibiotic Resistance <p> One of the reasons antibiotics do n't  work for acne like they used to is the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance . Individual bacteria sometimes develop resistance to an antibiotic by sheer random mutation . Most mutations kill bacteria so that they do n't  reproduce and pass the mutation to their progeny . Some mutations , however , give a single bacterium the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem . But bacteria can reproduce as often as every 20 minutes . And bacteria also have the ability to swap genetic material through a process called horizontal gene transfer . A bacterium can share its mutation with its neighbors by direct transfer of DNA . One resistant bacterium can become millions or billions and spread from person to person , unhindered by treatment with the antibiotic to which it has acquired resistance . <p> Antibiotic resistance is not necessarily an all-or-nothing proposition . A mutation may enable to a bacterium to survive longer in the presence of an antibiotic but the antibiotic may still kill the bacterium if it is used long enough . <p> That 's the problem with antibiotics for acne . Doctors prescribe the medication and acne sufferers use it until their skin looks better , not until all the bacteria are killed . The antibiotic just wipes out the most susceptible bacteria and leaves the resistant bacteria . When the patient stops taking the antibiotic , then resistant bacteria are free to multiply unchecked by competition from other microbes , and acne can be worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which acne bacteria have become resistant include : <p> Rifampin , to which 17% of acne bacteria are resistant . <p> Tetracycline , to which 35% of acne bacteria are resistant . <p> Amoxycillin , to which 40% of acne bacteria are resistant . <p> Clindamycin , to which 50% of acne bacteria are resistant . <p> Erythromycin , to which 52% of acne bacteria are resistant . <p> Neomycin , to which 80% of acne bacteria are resistant . <p> Cloxacillin , to which 100% of acne bacteria are resistant . <p> But antibiotic resistance is just part of the story . There is emerging evidence that the old idea that just one strain of bacteria , Propionibacterium acnes , causes acne is wrong . Acne experts in Asia are finding Staphylococcus aureus in pimples , although they do not know whether the reason staph bacteria seem to contribute to acne in Asia has to do with Asian skin or Asian weather . <p> This means that , in Asia , you do n't  just need to control one kind of acne bacteria , you need to control two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other may just allow one strain to grow unchecked . It also means that impetigo , a staph infection that grows in cuts in the skin , can aggravate acne , which occurs in pores , and vice versa . If doctors have to prescribe two different kinds of antibiotics , then patients have to deal with two different sets of potential side effects . <p> More and more dermatologists are recommending that antibiotics should be just one part of acne treatment . Most skin doctors recommend benzoyl peroxide as a way to get rid of bacteria that antibiotics miss . But benzoyl peroxide is n't perfect , either . <p> The figure that gets quoted on the Internet for benzoyl peroxide is that it kills 99.99% of acne bacteria on contact . There was a time , about 30 years ago , when this was true . Nowadays , however , benzoyl peroxide only kills 65% to 85% of acne bacteria , even when it is combined with erythromycin or clindamycin . This is part of the reason neither antibiotics nor benzoyl peroxide , nor a combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2/3 of blemishes . <p> Adding to the problem , a concentration of benzoyl peroxide that is strong enough to kill most acne bacteria on contact ( about 5% or more ) is usually also strong enough to cause stinging , burning , itching , and peeling skin . Tiny flakes of dead skin can clog pores and cause whiteheads that can become blackheads . <p> Its possible to have fewer pimples but more non-inflammatory acne when you use benzoyl peroxide . Antibiotics are not enough to defeat acne . Killing bacteria is n't enough to get rid of acne , either . <h> Getting Rid of Acne Requires Systematic Treatment <p> Infection is just part of the process of acne " and there are forms of acne that do n't  necessarily involve infection at all . At the very beginning of the formation of blemishes , however , there is excessive growth and shedding of skin inside pores . If clumps of dead skin cells do n't  accumulate in pores , then acne bacteria never accumulate and skin oil does not build up , either , assuming the skin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just infection but also stress can cause inflammation of the skin . Often efforts to prevent acne actually cause it through harsh detergent cleansing of the skin or use of excessively concentrated benzoyl peroxide to kill bacteria in the skin . Acne treatments used in the wrong way can actually cause acne . So what 's the best approach to getting rid of blemishes ? <p> Here are four simple steps . <p> - Keep your skin clean but not " too clean . " Your primary objective in skin cleansing is keeping your pores free of dead skin . This means you do n't  want to use a cleanser that is so harsh that it kills the topmost layer of your skin . You do n't  ever want to scrub your skin . Cleanse your face once a day or maybe twice , but do n't  try to wash your acne away . <p> Keep your skin moist but not oily . Moisture in your skin keeps it flexible so pores stay open . Oil in your pores can be a problem if it is locked in the pore under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of skin care products that contain alcohol , and by using moisturizer if necessary . Even people who have oily skin sometimes need moisturizer on the sides of the face and along the jawline . <p> Keep your skin exfoliating but not " raw . " Gently removing the topmost layer of skin cells with alpha- or beta-hydroxy acids makes room for fresher , younger skin to emerge to the surface , and stimulates the production of collagen that fills out your skin . Exfoliating two or three times a week is enough . Exfoliating two or three times a day usually injures the skin . <p> Keep your skin disinfected but not sterile . Its important to avoid excessive growth of acne bacteria . When your immune system detects excessive acne bacteria it tries to destroy them with inflammation , but it usually only manages to inflame the skin . Acne bacteria actually serve a useful function on the skin , by consuming excess oil produced by pores . They are only a problem when they grow in large numbers and cant escape to the surface of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy over the Internet ( and we recommend you only take antibiotics under a doctors supervision ) .

If you can afford a system of acne treatment products , Exposed Skin Care is a better choice . <h> The Ingredients in Stridex <p> Stridex pads include up to- 2% salicylic acid . Despite what the advertising may say , this really is not the highest concentration of salicylic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a 2% concentration of salicylic acid is definitely enough to have a beneficial effect on blemish-prone skin . <p> The way salicylic acid works is by breaking down the proteins that serve as " glue " in the skin . If you apply salicylic acid to healthy skin , it loosens the topmost , oldest layer of cells in the skin , making it easier for younger , healthier skin cells to emerge to the surface . If you apply salicylic acid to blemished skin , it breaks down the adhesive that causes dead skin to stick to the linings of pores . It also breaks down hardened sebum and kills acne bacteria . <p> Salicylic acid is n't really a natural ingredient . It is made by compressing phenol with carbon dioxide under intense pressure . This creates sodium salicylate , which is transformed into salicylic acid by the addition of sulfuric acid into the mix . Salicylic acid is not found in willow bark , although there are tiny amounts of the chemical in the herb meadowsweet ( also known by its botanical name Filipendula ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Isopropyl alcohol just dries up skin , resulting in even more skin problems . <p> The distinctive feature of Stridex pads is what they do n't  contain , namely isopropyl alcohol .

Antioxidants are provided in the form of pomegranate and white tea extracts and it contains 1% salicylic acid . <p> Stridex Maximum pads , their strongest pads , contain both 2% salicylic acid and a small amount of simethicone .

But is rose water really a workable treatment for acne ? <h> Summary : <p> Rose water is an emulsion of rose oil in water created as a byproduct of distilling rose petals . <p> Rose water stimulates the growth of the skin and increases oil production in the skin . Its a remedy for dry skin rather than for oily skin . <p> Rose water works better when it is combined with lemon juice . If your skin looks unusually shiny after using a combination of rose water and lemon juice , use more lemon juice and less rose water next time . <p> Do n't  use rose water if you have rosacea . <p> Rose water is a useful addition to your tools for your fight against acne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Care . <h> What Is Rose Water ? <p> Rose water is a mixture of essential oils from rose petals suspended in water . It is a byproduct of distilling rose petals for their concentrated essential oils known as rose attar or rose otto . <p> It takes about two metric tons of rose petals to make one kilo of rose attar , or one common ton of rose petals to make a pound of rose attar . Workers pick rose petals and deliver them to a processing shed so they can be crushed before distillation in a huge copper pot . In this still , the petals are covered with water and heated for about two hours . Then a valve is opened to allow steam to escape from the still to be collected in a cooling flask . <p> The steam carries essential oils of rose and water to the flask . About 20% what arrives in the collection flask is essential oil , and about 80% is water with small amounts of essential oil mixed in . This water is known as rose water . The rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the green syrup forms white crystals . But the rose water stays liquid at room temperature and can be used in a variety of ways . <p> Some of the favorite foods of Greece and Turkey are flavored with rose water . Loukoum , also known as Turkish delight , is flavored with rose water . In India and the Arab world , rice is flavored with rose water . Rose water is used as a substitute for cooking sherry , vermouth , and wine in the Muslim world , and it is an important ingredient in fruit drinks in Malaysia and Singapore , marzipan in Europe , a French dessert known as a madeleine , and in the cookies and candies popular in the early United States . <h> Rose Water as a Skin Treatment <p> Rose water contains a variety of natural bioactive chemicals . The scent and taste of rose petals are due to a chemical called phenylethyl alcohol . Depending on which kinds of roses are harvested , how fully the roses have opened when they are picked , and the length of the distillation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , geraniol , methyleugenol , linalool , and various kinds of complex sugars . <p> Are these plant chemicals helpful for acne ? The answer is " it depends . " <p> It seems only reasonable that anything you call " water " would hydrate the skin , making it moister and more supple , helping clogged pores drain . When British scientists actually tested rose water on healthy skin , however , they found the opposite effect . Rose water did hydrate the skin , but pores got tighter , and sebum production increased . <p> The British experiment was the final word on rose water as an acne treatment for 36 years . Then scientists at the Freiburg University Medical Center in Germany took another look at how how rose oil interacts with the skin . What the scientists discovered was that the rose oil component of rose water stimulated the activity of skin cells known as keratinocytes . These cells lie in the basal layer of the skin . They produce new skin cells that gradually migrate up to the outermost layer of the skin , protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cellular equivalent of somersaults to move to different locations in the skin when they are needed to heal a wound . <p> But that is n't all that keratinocytes can do . If the immune system detects infection on the skin , the keratinocytes can also release inflammatory chemicals that attack both germs and healthy skin cells . They can also release anti-inflammatory chemicals that " put the brakes " on inflammation in the skin . <p> Because keratinocytes have so many different functions that are stimulated by contact with rose water , it is not surprising that different people have different experiences when they use rose water to treat acne . Some people report that their blemishes heal in days , and some report that using rose water makes clear skin red . Rose water can be mildly irritating if it is used the wrong way , but it can be strongly healing if it is used the right way . <h> How to Use Rose Water to Treat Acne <p> The best way to use rose water for acne is to use as a wash for pimples on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is even better . Do n't  use rose water if you have rosacea . Any kind of essential oil can aggravate rosacea , and treating your pores and the surface level of your skin really does not resolve rosacea . <p> Pour out 15 ml ( 1 tablespoon ) of rose water into a clean bowl . Add the juice squeezed from one lemon . This will probably be about 30 ml ( 2 tablespoons ) . Set the bowl aside in a convenient place while you cleanse your skin . You will need a clean soft washcloth and a clean towel for what comes next . <p> Wash your face with your usual cleanser . Rinse off the cleanser with warm water and pat your face dry with a clean towel . Then place the clean soft washcloth into the mixture of rose water and lemon juice until it is soaked , close your eyes , and place the rose water-soaked wash cloth over your face .

If you notice your skin looking shinier than normal after using the combination , then use half as much rose water next time . <p> Rose water can be a useful treatment for dry acne-prone skin that is not subject to rosacea .

@@98778704 @2978704/ <h> Surprising Ways to Clear Acne 19922 @qwx879922 <p> There are literally tens of thousands of over-the-counter acne treatments and dozens of prescription acne medications that usually do a fair job of clearing acne , leaving 30 to 50% of acne behind . But some of the best ways to clear acne do n't  require you to buy anything at all . Before you spend a small fortune on acne treatment , why not try one of these quick and simple methods that often clear acne ? <h> Summary : <p> Sometimes changes in diet clear up acne in just a few weeks , but different diets work for different skin types . <p> Fair skin usually responds to a high-protein diet . To increase the percentage of protein in your diet , just reduce the amount of sugar you eat . <p> Asian skin often responds to restricting iodine in the diet . That means less sushi , less seaweed , and less salt . <p> African skin often responds to a low-allergy diet . People of African heritage are more likely to be sensitive to wheat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these foods may clear acne on black skin . <p> People who have brown skin are often sensitive to beans . Changing the way beans are cooked and the type of bean used every day can help clear up the skin when it just is not possible to stop eating beans . <p> Diet often clears acne , but a complete acne treatment system keeps acne away for good . <h> High-Protein Diet to Clear Acne on Fair Skin <p> One way that sometimes clears up acne fast is a high-protein diet . High-protein does not mean 100% protein . Even a high-protein diet has to be complemented by some carbohydrate ( an absolute minimum of 40 grams/160 calories of carbohydrate is needed every day for the brain to absorb amino acids from the bloodstream ) , and everyone needs some essential fatty acids for regulating inflammation . In fact , a " high-protein " diet may contain less than 50% protein . <p> In one study , researchers asked volunteers who had acne to eat a diet consisting of : <p> 44% of calories from protein , <p> 35% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fat . <p> When volunteers ate this relatively high-protein diet , acne began to clear up in less than two weeks . Then the researchers asked the same volunteers to eat diet consisting of : <p> 10% of calories from protein , <p> 70% of calories from carbohydrate , and <p> 20% of calories from fat . <p> When volunteers at this low-protein diet , acne started getting worse in less than two weeks . The reason high-protein diets seem to fight acne is that they slow down the conversion of testosterone in the bloodstream into the skin-active form of the hormone , dihydrotestosterone . Testosterone does not stimulate excess oil production in the skin until it is converted into dihydrotestosterone . <p> How can you make your diet a high-protein diet ? You do n't  so much need to start eating hunks of meat as you need to avoid second helpings of carbohydrate . Get your extra protein from low-fat sources such as lean meat , fish ( not fried ! ) , soy , beans , and lentils . Skip dessert . Generally , you will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you eat more protein . <p> The high-protein diet is most helpful for controlling mild to moderate acne on fair skin . Another diet is best for Asian skin . <h> A Special Diet to Clear Diet on Asian Skin <p> Asian skin tends either to be very sensitive to food choices or totally insensitive to food choices . Changes in diet may produce dramatic changes in acne , or no change at all . When diet makes a difference , however , the offending foods are those that are high in iodine . <p> Iodine makes the skin break out by changing the way it uses thyroid hormone . Extra iodine in the diet may also increase production of thyroid hormones , which make the skin very sensitive to inflammation and prone to forming brown spots after acne heals . <p> Which foods are highest in iodine ? In most Asian diets , the highest-iodine foods are : <p> Seaweed salads , <p> Dried shrimp , fish , cuttlefish , squid , and urchin , <p> Seaweed snacks ( nori chips ) , <p> Tuna , and <p> Salty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of pickles and kimchi . <p> Eliminating these foods is just half of the battle . It is also necessary to cut back on fried chicken and braised pork , as well as soft drinks . People who have acne on Asian skin get over acne faster and have fewer brown spots once acne heals . <h> A Low-Allergy Diet to Clear Acne on Black Skin <p> Black skin stands up to sun . All the pigment in black skin that makes it resistant to the sun , however , makes it especially sensitive to inflammation . Often acne breaks out on black skin after food causes mild allergic reactions that are not even noticed except for the inflammation in the skin . Breakouts on black skin are not just due to oil and acne bacteria . They are due to inflammation caused by allergy . <p> The foods that most often cause allergies in people who have black skin include milk , wheat , and citrus . People of African heritage are less likely to be allergic to peanuts , tomatoes , chocolate , cola , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream , and orange juice reduces the number of acne breakouts . <h> Beans and Acne on Brown Skin <p> And if you have brown skin ? Be careful with beans . Many people of Hispanic or Middle Eastern heritage are sensitive to beans , especially fava beans . There are people of Mediterranean heritage who have life-threatening reactions to fava beans , but many more who have skin-tightening reactions to all kinds of beans and legumes . <p> It is best to take a " bean break " for about two weeks and see if there are changes in your skin . If there is just no way your family can function without beans at every meal , make one small change in their preparation . Pour off the water in which beans are soaked before they are cooked . Pouring off the soaking water reduces the lectins in the beans when they are cooked . This fights flatulence , and reduces irritation of the skin . It also helps to substitute Anasazi or appaloosa beans for pintos . Anasazi and appaloosa beans contain far fewer lectins to irritate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clear Acne <p> Sometimes a simple change in diet causes dramatic improvement in acne , better than you can get from any acne product or any acne medication . But the way to get rid of all your blemishes for good is to clear acne with the help of a complete acne care system such as Exposed Skin Care . With your complete acne treatment system , you can cleanse your skin to remove excess oil , moisturize your skin to keep it supple , exfoliate your skin to prevent clogged pores , and keep inflammation at a minimum with toners , astringents , serums , and probiotics . <p> The simple reality is that different colors and skin types have different skin care needs . It might be less " typist " to give someone who has type O blood a transfusion of type A blood but its not a good idea . <p> This site is very useful for me . After following some tips in this page I have notable difference in face . Pl can suggest me when can I stop protein rich food as must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich food one or two days I can feel acne again appears . Ur reply should be a great solution for my pm . Thanks a lot for this page . <p> I never tried this before , but I can confirm that a very high protein diet has done wonders for me : health , confidence and clear skin after a number of years of suffering and not knowing what my triggers are . <p> I 've also noticed that getting plenty of sleep has been beneficial ( 8 hours minimum ) and doing lots of exercise ( 3-4 high intensity workouts , other cardiovascular + weight lifting x2-3 per week ) . <p> Altogether I am very happy and hope that people find the solution for them quickly because its a horrible condition and after years it destroys confidence . <p> The minute I went to a carbohydrate intensive diet , back to square one . 19923 @qwx879923

There are some acne products that wo n't work on any type of skin , but more often the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one type of skin on a skin type for which is not beneficial . The main distinctions in skin types are : <p> Dry or oily . <p> Sensitive or resistant . <p> Pigmented or non-pigmented . <p> Wrinkled or tight . <p> Dry skin is skin that lacks moisture in the skin . It turns gray if it is not constantly moisturized , and it is prone to flaking and peeling . If you have dry skin and mild acne , tiny flakes of skin will keep your skin from stretching out , locking oil inside pores . <p> Oily skin is skin that has too much oil on the skin . Oily skin is shiny . The oil keeps the skin flexible so pores can drain , but the production of oil can be so great that whiteheads and blackheads form nonetheless . <p> Sensitive skin reacts to chemicals . Sensitive skin is easily stressed , and when it is stressed , it sends out chemicals that make the its outer layers more vulnerable to inflammation . In small amounts , inflammation can be a good thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But sensitive skin breaks out with redness and inflammation out of proportion to the stress and chemical irritation . Heat and cold , as well as irritant chemicals , stress the skin . <p> Resistant skin does not react to small amounts of most chemicals . Acne products that make breakouts on sensitive skin worse may heal breakouts on resistant skin . <p> Pigmented skin turns brown after inflammation . The melanin that gives the skin its brown tones doubles as both pigment and inflammation-fighter . The more active the melanin-making melanocytes are in your skin , the more melanin is made by your skin when acne breaks out , and the more melanin stays in your skin even after acne heals . People who have rich golden or brown skin tones are especially susceptible to skin discoloration caused by acne , and some of the products used to treat brown discoloration on fair skin can transform discoloration on Asian skin from brown to black and blue . <p> Non-pigmented skin stands up to lightening agents without unwanted chemical reactions .

Here are seven of the most important , and most frequently overlooked , tips for keeping skin blemish free without creating different skin problems in the process . <h> Summary : <p> Relaxing your skin can start in your stomach . <p> A little washing is usually better than a lot . <p> Do n't  wash your antioxidant anti-acne products down the drain . <p> A splash of the right kind of water to your face can stop acne in its tracks , at least for about 12 hours . <p> Sunlight is not usually good for acne , although everyone needs some sun so the skin can make vitamin D. Blue light , however , can kill acne bacteria . <p> The worlds most commonly used acne medication has serious limitations , although it is the treatment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important thing you can do for your acne is to relax . <p> But you do n't  need to stress out if you ca n't stop being stressed out . To prevent acne there are things you can do in any emotional state that change the physiological effects of your stress levels and slow the hormonal processes that cause acne to break out . <p> Add- yogurt to your diet- that contains live cultures . The probiotic bacteria in your gut reduce inflammation all over your body , including your brain ( so you feel better ) and your skin ( so you look better ) . Get 6 to 8 hours of sleep every night . Or at least spend 6 to 8 hours in a dark room that is free of any visible blue light . The pineal gland in the brain makes the calming chemical melatonin at night , provided the eyes do not detect any blue light " and the eyes can detect blue light even when the eyelids are closed . The production of melatonin in your brain affects the production of melanin in your skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold plunge into relaxation . Immersing your whole body into cold water slows down your pulse and sends oxygen to your brain , instead of your pimples . A splash of cold water to the face does the same thing . <h> 2 . Wash daily , but do n't  obsess over it . <p> Its only natural to want to scour your blemishes with a blast of bubbly soap . The problem is , any kind of soap that makes big bubbles also breaks up the protective barriers in the skin . The skin dries out and flakes , tightening pores and trapping oil and acne-causing bacteria inside . The same happens- if you put alcohol on your skin and it too is not the best way- to clear your acne. - Washing too often , with water that is too hot , with harsh detergent soaps actually makes acne worse . Scrubbing with a dirty wash cloth and rubbing with a dirty towel do n't  help either . <p> The most important thing to remember about facial cleansing for acne is to let your cleanser do the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your face with clean fingertips . Let the cleanser stand on your face a few seconds to loosen dirt and excess oils , and then rinse with warm water and pat dry . <h> 3 . Use the power of the right antioxidants to help stop inflammation . <p> Thousands of acne products provide antioxidant power to the skin . The problem is , most of these products are made by dissolving vitamin C in water . You splash the vitamins on your face , and then quickly rinse them off before they have a chance to sink in . <p> It is a lot better to use fat-soluble antioxidant products that contain ascorbyl palmitate ( a skin-friendly form of vitamin C ) , alpha-lipoic acid , and natural vitamin E in thin layers of cream that stay on the skin until they are wiped or sweated off . A splash of facial water for minerals is fine , but antioxidants need to be applied as creams , or taken as supplements by mouth . <h> 4 . Hydrate your face with facial waters . <p> Facial waters are natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most beneficial facial waters may be just a tiny bit stinky . Sulfur kills acne bacteria , but does n't  smell all that great . Facial waters may also contain calcium , magnesium , and/or selenium , which act as calming agents for the skin . The thing to remember about facial waters is that they only work if they are applied underneath a layer of moisturizer that binds them to the face . Otherwise , their minerals simply go down the drain . <h> 5 . Establish a healthy relationship with the sun . <p> The old advice to acne sufferers used to be to let the sun dry out the skin . Actually , drying out the skin is detrimental to treating acne . Excessive sun exposure not only tightens pores and causes comedos ( whiteheads and blackheads ) , it can also cause skin cancer " which can be a lot more unsightly on your face than pimples . Everyone needs a little sun on a regular basis to make vitamin D. About 20 minutes of exposure every day is enough . The rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will reduce new blemishes , and stop the formation of wrinkles . <h> 6 . When antibiotics and benzoyl peroxide do n't  work , think blue . <p> Prescription medications can cause- unpleasant side effects and antibiotics are no exception . Benzoyl peroxide sometimes causes blisters , which is obviously that last thing you want when trying to counter breakouts . Also , it will often cause a tingling feeling on the skin , which is a sure sign that it is doing more harm than good . When these treatments do n't  do the trick for getting rid of pimples , the answer may come from the right kind of light treatment . <p> Blue light falling on the skin has a devastating effect on acne bacteria . These wavelengths of light resonate with a chemical called porphyrin ( more specifically , coproporphyrin III ) in the protective membrane of the cell . The sunlight causes porphyrin to release free radicals that kill the bacterium over the course of a few hours to a few days . <p> If you have a tiny amount of acne bacteria on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in check . If you have a lot of bacteria on your face , then you may benefit from something stronger . Regular use of blue light lamps " without holding them so close to the face that your skin burns or feels uncomfortably hot " can be as effective as antibiotics or benzoyl peroxide and you can do it right from the comfort of your own home . This is assuming you do n't  have one of the more- severe- types of acne such as cystic acne in which case a visit to the dermatologists office is required. - More , however , is not necessarily better . Do not use any blue light ( or blue and red light ) lamp for treating acne more than the- three to five 20- to 30-minute sessions per week recommended by most manufacturers. - Blue light is not effective in reducing acne scar formations . <p> Back acne , also known as bacne , is usually hard to treat , but benzoyl peroxide , also known as BP , may be the answer . <p> Benzoyl peroxide gets praised and panned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to tea tree oil .

The tough skin of the back is not easily dried out or irritated . Benzoyl peroxide foams can get down deep into pores and kill bacteria . Just be sure not to use the same product for your back or buttocks and your face . <p> These seven tips may make the essential difference between failure and success for your skin treatment program .

" <p> Most of us do n't  live where its easy to call on a homeopath . That 's why most of us have to choose homeopathic remedies on our own . But instead of taking a " homeopathic acne remedy , " it is always best to choose the homeopathic remedy that most closely matches the full range of symptoms . That is the remedy that is mostly likely to work " over the period of a month or so .

Just as real chalk dust would trap sweat , calcarea carbonica has the energy of trapped sweat .

If you were to take this compound without dilution , it would cause no changes at all until all the symptoms happened suddenly . People who have tend to be perfectionists , or who have a " long fuse " before they explode in anger , or who have acne that tends to break out over night are treated with this remedy . It is also used to treat boils , folliculitis , and impetigo . <p> Pulsatilla is a flowering plant that is native to Sweden and Finland . Bearing purple flowers on stalk with silver-tinted leaves in the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For over 2,000 years it has been used to treat eye infections . In homeopathy , it is used to treat people who are easily moved with emotion , " people who need people , " and people who like sweets but who dislike spicy or fatty food . The kind of acne this remedy would be used to treat is premenstrual acne in women , or whiteheads and blackheads in men . <p> Silica is the mineral in sand . During the day , sand is dry . Overnight , it may become wet . Sand is a very weak building material . As a homeopathic remedy , silica is used to treat conditions that cause " leakage " at night , whether this leakage is a bowel problem or a skin problem . It is also used to strengthen weak nails , hair , and skin . <p> Sulphur is pungent . It is yellow . It tends to release fumes . Can you guess what kind of person gets homeopathic sulphur ? In addition to treating flatulence , homeopathic sulphur is also given to people who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to perspire and give off fumes . It is used to treat acne problems that have resisted other treatments and flaking skin . <p> The best way to use homeopathic acne tablets is to choose one of these remedies that seems to match your whole-body symptoms . Take one pill and wait a day . Take another pill and wait another day . Then start taking two pills a day and see if any of your symptoms improve . You may experience improvement in symptoms that are not related to your skin health before you experience improvement in acne . And you will still need to do daily cleansing of your skin and regular toning and exfoliation. 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778708 @2978708/ <h> Finding The Very Best Teen Acne Treatment System 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Teenage acne is not like acne at other times of life . Teens are more likely to get acne than any other age group , in fact as many as 85% of teens will experience some type of acne , whether the pimples come in the form of whiteheads , blackheads , papules , or cysts but they are also the most likely to recover " if they do n't  make certain devastating mistakes . Here are 13- truths about teenage acne that can help you find the best treatment system for your skin . <h> Summary : <p> Stress hormones are the most important trigger for teenaged acne . <p> Just because you have n't developed acne by the age of 18 does n't  mean you wo n't . Blacks and Hispanics often develop acne for the first time in their early 20s . <p> When teenaged girls experience both acne and unwanted hair growth , a low-carb diet may help . <p> Drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes increase acne breakouts . <p> Treating acne with Accutane can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acne . <p> Raw vegetables and salads can help you feel better . <p> If your doctor gives you a prescription for the antibiotic minocycline , ask about " blue smile . " <p> Be careful about scalp acne if you get bald fades or shave your head . <h> 1 . Teenage acne is normally caused by hormones , but primarily by stress hormones , not sex hormones . <p> Everybody knows that middle schoolers tend to be what Americans euphemistically term " hormonal . " Sex hormones rage by the teenage years . But acne breaks out as soon as the age of eight , several years before puberty . In many teens , acne is caused more by stress hormones than by sex hormones . And controlling stress also minimizes acne . <p> Children tend to develop allergy-prone skin before they develop pimple-prone skin . About the age of eight , the adrenal glands begin to make large amounts of a substance known as 5-dehydroepiandrosterone , or DHEA . This chemical becomes many different kinds of hormones , including stress hormones made by the adrenal glands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes its own stress hormones , the activate chemicals that cause the release of histamine . This causes allergy-like reactions even when there is nothing to which to be allergic . And it also makes the skin more sensitive to acne bacteria " which may or may not be present in large numbers . <p> Other potential causes include : <p> Genetics Unfortunately , some research shows that acne may actually be somewhat hereditary . Yep , that means that if your parents suffered with acne then there 's a good chance you will too at some point . <p> Medication If you take medications , talk to your doctor to see if they may be a culprit . Just some that are known to sometimes cause breakouts are prednisone , lithium , medications used for epilepsy and androgens that are used as medicine . <h> 2 . Different skin types get acne and get over acne at different ages . <p> Most of the time mild to moderate teenage acne clears up eventually no matter what you do , although improper treatment can leave brown spots or scars that last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acne early and get over it early . Children of Asian , Hispanic , or African heritage tend to get acne later and get over it later , and also to have much more severe acne . Peak age for newly diagnosed acne in Black and dark-skinned Hispanic males , often a devastating form of acne of the scalp known as acne keloidalis nuchae , is 22. <h> 3 . Teenaged girls who get acne sometimes have an underlying problem with insulin resistance . <p> Sometimes cutting down carbs and simple sugars may help , especially with girls . <p> Sometimes the cause of acne in teenaged girls is a variation of polycystic ovarian syndrome , only without any ovarian cysts or disruption of the menstrual cycles . Insulin resistance raises blood sugar levels , although not necessarily to levels that would be termed " diabetic . " Most tissues in the body can protect themselves from receiving excessive sugar from the bloodstream by becoming insensitive , or resistant , to insulin . <p> The ovaries , however , can not resist the effects of insulin , and they receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One of the ways the ovaries use their excess energy is to make excessive testosterone , which can cause the appearance of both acne on the face and body hair in places it is not supposed to be . <p> When teenaged girls notice both acne and hair growth , one way to deal with both problems is simply to cut down on calories , especially carbohydrate calories and simple- sugars . If the ovaries are not exposed to excessive blood sugar levels , they stop making excessive testosterone , and acne begins to clear up on its own . A doctors evaluation , of course , is helpful in finding other treatments that work . <p> Many people of Asian descent lack the enzymes the liver uses to break down acetaldehyde , an irritant chemical produced as a byproduct of its processing of alcohol . The acetaldehyde quickly circulates to the surface of the body , and the result is reddening and irritation of the skin , usually within just a few minutes of taking the first drink . The irritation of the skin triggers the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whiteheads break out . <p> Teens who are not of Asian descent sometimes break out in tiny red bumps over the cheeks of the face , around the eyes , and on the nose after they drink , especially after they drink gin . This reaction is a form of acne known as rosacea . Drinking too often can make the bumps both prominent and permanent . <h> 5 . Teens who smoke cigarettes tend to get blemishes . <p> Some of the chemicals in tobacco smoke destroy the antioxidants that reduce the tendency of the skin to produce sebum in response to stress . This effect is especially strong in teens , and stronger in females than in males . Smoking increases the production of whiteheads rather than pimples , although whiteheads left untreated can become pimples . <p> The nicotine in tobacco can also cause a condition known as " smokers face . " Nicotine receptors in the skin cause blood vessels to contract . Blood gets trapped in pockets under the skin , making it look red , but circulation is cut off , depriving most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen , and trapping irritant chemicals in the skin . <h> 6 . Accutane can give teens gas ( although adults who use Accutane usually do n't  have this problem ) . <p> One of the side effects of Accutane ( isotretinoin ) treatment of acne that almost never gets mentioned is that , in teenagers , it can cause uncontrollable flatulence , and then diarrhea and ulcerative colitis . If zits on your face is a social problem for you , probably uncontrollable flatulence would be , too . Be sure to discuss this possibility with your doctor before you accept a prescription for Accutane . There are other acne treatments of similar strength that do no have this side effect . <h> 7 . If it tingles , its working ( NO , it is not ) <p> Many teenagers believe , as did many of todays adults when they were teens , that if a product makes your skin tingle or have a cooling sensation then it was working hard at getting rid of acne . Unfortunately , that couldnt be farther from the truth . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are commonly found in acne care products but are actually irritants . They dry out the skin and encourage increased oil production , which will only lead to more breakouts. <h> 8 . Eating raw veggies can help teens who have acne feel better . <p> Eating raw vegetables , like celery sticks , carrot sticks , radishes , and salad greens , Norwegian scientists have found out , seems to help teens feel better about their acne , getting depressed less often . At least in Norway , where most people have fair , dry , sensitive skin , eating enough raw vegetables is the single most important change in diet that can improve health in teens who have acne . Just do n't  eat too many tomatoes " the lycopene in tomatoes can increase sebum production in your skin . <h> 9 . Benzoyl peroxide usually helps control acne on teenaged skin . <p> Adults usually have problems with using benzoyl peroxide gels , lotions , and washes to control acne . In people 25 years old and older , benzoyl peroxide often causes itching , burning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , benzoyl peroxide has fewer side effects because the skin is more actively growing . Always start with the lowest possible concentration of benzoyl peroxide , which you can find in many over the counter skin care products . Just make sure the label states that the product is 2.5% benzoyl peroxide or less " and keep it off hair and clothes , since it can bleach them . Teens usually should not use tea tree oil products , often offered as an alternative to benzoyl peroxide , because they sometimes interfere with the action of sex hormones , most noticeably increasing breast tissue growth in males . <p> Another ingredient in many cleansers and products for teen acne is- salicylic acid , which not only helps clear blackheads , whiteheads and unclog pores , but is also helpful for irritation and inflammation . Even better , look for something that has both benzoyl peroxide for the bacteria and salicylic acid for its- soothing , anti-inflammatory properties . <p> Note : If you have dark skin , talk to your doctor before using benzoyl peroxide . It has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all else fails , it may be time to seek professional help . <h> 10 . Sometimes you need professional help <p> In most cases , acne can be dealt with by the use of carefully chosen over the counter products . It might be a matter of time before you find the one that works for you , but unless there 's an underlying medical cause , its serious cyst-like acne or acne that poses a big risk of scarring , you can normally clear your skin on your own . With that said though , there are times when a doctor or dermatologist is needed . A few of the things they may be able to give you that you could n't get without a prescription are : <p> Antibiotics There was a time when antibiotics were one of the first treatments recommended . But with the prevalence of antibiotic resistance , this is rarely the first choice anymore . If it is prescribed , there 's a good chance it will be in the form of a topical solution , although there are some cases where oral antibiotics make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given both an oral medication and topical application . <p> Birth control Girls may be given certain birth control pills that are known to help clear and keep acne under control by regulating hormones . <p> Retinoids Retin-A ( and Retin-A Micro ) , Renova , Differin . These are some of the acne-treating retinoids that may be prescribed to you . <p> Benzoyl peroxide Yes , you can get this over the counter , but only in lower concentrations . Stronger concentrations require a prescription . <h> 11 . Teens who have acne should ask their doctors about prescriptions for clindamycin instead of minocycline . <p> In the United States , dermatologists never give minocycline to children whose adult teeth have not yet come in , because the drug can cause blue or black discoloration of the teeth , especially at the gum line . In Europe , dermatologists almost never give minocycline to anyone under the age of 22 , for the same reason . Clindamycin does not cause " blue smile " and similar problems . <h> 12 . Shaving your head may look cool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe form of acne . <p> Sometimes hairs get trapped inside pores when the head is shaved . Especially in Black males aged 16 and older and Hispanic males aged 18 and older , the immune system can attack the hair in the hair shaft as if it were bacteria . The pore turns bright red , and skin grows over the pore so that the redness becomes permanent . <p> Unless you have been to barber school , do n't  do your own bald fades and do n't  shave your own head . See a licensed barber or beautician to get you bald fades or head shave . If you get the hair of your scalp shaved , look at the back of your head in a mirror at least once a day and see a doctor at the first sign of a pimple . <h> 13. - Do n't  try to rush or overdo it <p> Slathering on more topical treatments , scrubbing vigorously multiple time per day and ( definitely ) not taking more oral medications is n't going to speed up the process . Not only could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastating effects on your health , too . Clearing and getting acne under control is n't an overnight process . You have to give it time . Many people do n't  see the results they want simply because they try it for a week , do n't  suddenly see clear skin in the mirror and give up on the product before it has even had time to do what its supposed to do . Stick to the treatment plan and recommended duration . Cleanse , moisturize , exfoliate and protect skin from the skin . Eat well and stay hydrated . If it still does n't  clear up , only then consider trying something new or seeking professional help . <p> Note to parents : - <p> The hype created around skin care and anti-acne products like Proactiv is often outrageous- and desperate teens are often open to believing anything , even if deep down they might not believe its true . Help them to understand that getting acne under control is going to take time and help them to develop realistic expectations . At the same time , let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyday lives . It may merely be a few pimples , but to them it is probably much more than that . This is a time , more than pretty much any other , when appearance is quickly and easily judged and many teen acne sufferers may be susceptible to depression . <p> Remember , too , that any skin care routine that 's tedious or difficult will be a challenge for most teens to stick to . All they really need in most cases- are a few simple products designed to open pores , kill bacteria , fight inflammation , keep skin moisturized and keep it protected from too much sun exposure . And for the most part , kits like Exposed Skin Care will cover all the basics needed to fight acne. 19923 @qwx879923

The skin forms sags and bags , first around the eyes , and then on the chin and jaw line , and gradually over the entire face . <p> The cross-links between the weakening cords of collagen , however , multiply .

The reason women break out with acne during pregnancy has to do with the hormone testosterone . <p> Testosterone is a hormone that in large amounts causes male sexual characteristics , such as hair growth , deepening of the voice , muscle development , and aggression . In women , testosterone fuels sex drive . The ovaries make tiny amounts of testosterone throughout a womans life , especially during the early teens and during pregnancy , notably when the baby is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during pregnancy stimulates the production of the skin oil known as sebum by the sebaceous gland in every pore in the skin . <p> Womens bodies also make much more estrogen during pregnancy .

This " mask of pregnancy " will usually disappear when the baby is born . Brown spots that form on the skin after pimples heal , however , may be more numerous and more persistent . Women who have dry , sensitive skin and darker skin tones are more prone to this problem . <h> What to Do About Pregnancy Acne <p> The treatment of acne during pregnancy is very similar to the treatment of acne during any other time of life .

The more pigmented the skin , the more prone it is to form spots during pregnancy . If you have brown or black skin tones , consider wearing a sunscreen that blocks UV-A rays all the time , even indoors . UV-A rays can penetrate glass windows in your house and car .

All you need is concealer , foundation , and a brush . And you can use concealer even if you do n't  have a brush . <p> Green concealer covers up red pimples . <p> If you do n't  have green concealer , you can use yellow concealer on fair skin or brown concealer on Asian skin .

Dot the concealer on the pimple you want to hide . Then spread concealer around the pimple to blend it evenly across surrounding skin . <p> Why is it best to apply concealer with a feather brush ? Using a brush allows you to apply the smallest possible amount of concealer to the surface of the pimple .

Apply foundation evenly over the pimple and the rest of your face . <p> It is important to use just one layer of cosmetics on top of your concealer . Multiple layers of cosmetics can clump or separate , making pimples even more noticeable than they were before you covered them up . The best cover up for acne is the lightest cover up you can use that cancels out the redness of a pimple . <p> Your foundation will conceal whiteheads and blackheads . If you use foundation with orange , peach , lavender , burgundy , wine , or ash tint , however , your concealer may suddenly stop concealing in the middle of the day . Except for that first layer of green concealer , use cosmetics that are as close to your natural skin tones as possible . This usually is not a problem except for people who have very fair or very black skin . <h> Other Ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you cover up acne . In fact , they may make pimples temporarily more noticeable . A better way way of concealing a pimple is to treat it with pure tea tree oil at night when you remove your makeup . <p> Tea tree oil in a concentration of 10% or more will kill acne bacteria on contact . Pure tea tree oil will also relieve inflammation and reduce redness , even as it is killing acne bacteria . The more often you can use tea tree oil at night , the less often you will need to use concealer during the day . Tea tree oil treatment usually completely removes redness in about a week , but products that are not at least 10% tea tree oil will not help very much , no matter how good they smell . <h> How Cover Ups for Acne Can Go Wrong <p> It is always essential to remove all makeup before you go to bed for the night .

In fact , the most expensive treatments for acne usually are not as good as moderately priced products . Its all a matter of knowing what to buy . <h> Summary : <p> The best acne treatments are not free , but they are usually moderately priced . <p> Very expensive acne treatments usually include unnecessary ( but important-sounding ) ingredients that either do not do anything for acne or even irritate the skin . <p> The best cheap skin cleansers contain just a few ingredients , with no alcohol or fragrances . <p> The best cheap- pimple fighters are used as spot treatments . <p> The best cheap treatments for blackheads contain green tea extract to be applied to the skin . <h> Good Values in Cleansers <p> There is simply no way you can beat acne without cleansing your skin . The problem with many skin cleansers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they correct . <p> Your objective in using a skin cleanser is to not wash the acne off your face . Acne is a problem in the skin . You cant wash it away . <p> What you want to do when cleansing your skin for fighting acne is to remove excess oil and makeup as well as tiny flakes of matted skin that can clog pores . Cleansing your skin is about preventing acne , not about treating it . If you keep excess oil and the slimier ingredients in makeup out of your pores , then they wont mix with flakes of dead skin and form clogs . So you need to be especially careful not to use any product that makes your skin dry and flaky in the process of cleansing of your skin . <p> Some good values in skin cleansers include : <p> Neutrogena Oil-Free Makeup Removing Cleanser for Acne Prone Skin . At US $5.99 for a 2.5 oz/75 ml bottle , this product wont force you apply for new credit cards . It gives a good clean rinse to your skin , lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any irritant chemicals .

Containing no perfumes or irritant ingredients , it is safe for use by people who have allergies and by people who have sensitive skin . <p> Exposed Skin Cares Acne Cleanser . At US $14.95 for 5 oz/150 ml , this cleanser is pricier than some of the alternatives , but it contains a chemical called betaine that breaks up blackheads and stimulate the growth of collagen underneath indented acne scars . The secret to successful use is to wait an extra minute before rinsing it away to give the betaine and botanical acne-fighters a chance to work . <p> Why not just use bar soap ? The problem with any kind of sudsy soap is that it can clog pores . If you have to use bar soap , try to buy Neutrogena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your skin rather than rubbing the soap across your skin with a washcloth . <h> Good Values in Pimple Treatments <p> Lots of companies try to sell you " natural " treatments for pimples . The problem with the selection of natural , botanical products used in treatments for pimples is that they either have no effect at all on pimples ( although they may help with other skin issues ) and some of them can actually make blemishes worse . <p> If you are shopping for budget treatments for pimples , you have basically three choices : <p> Benzoyl peroxide , <p> Tea tree oil , or <p> Triclosan . <p> Benzoyl peroxide is a chemical that releases hydrogen peroxide inside pores . It does most of its work in the first half hour after you use it , stunning acne bacteria so that about 98% of them live out their life cycle and die within 48 hours . <p> The drawback to benzoyl peroxide is that it does n't  just kill acne bacteria . It also dries out the skin . It will clear up almost all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then new blemishes will break out ( although about 1/3 as many ) where dry skin has accumulated . <p> The way to get around this problem is to use benzoyl peroxide as a treatment just for pimples , not for all the skin of your face . And some of the most effective benzoyl peroxide products are also the least expensive : <p> Oxy Maximum Vanishing Oxy Spot Treatment . Costing US $5.79 for 0.65 fluid oz ( 21 ml ) , this treatment also contains 10% benzoyl peroxide and also should be used just on pimples , not all over your skin . The Oxy product is a little more expensive because it contains ingredients that stop oil production around the pimple . <p> Clearasil DailyClear Vanishing Acne Treatment Cream . Costing US $6.99 for 1 fluid oz ( 30 ml ) , this is the old , familiar Clearasil minus the peach-colored tint ( which never really looked good unless you happened to have peach-colored skin ) .

It was one of the first companies to list all of the ingredients for its products on its website . Its complexion clearing products , unfortunately , are more " interesting " than effective . Let 's take a look at the topsellers in this subbrand . <h> Summary : <p> Biores claim to fame is its deep cleansing pore strips for blackheads , although it also makes cleansers , face wash and scrubs . <p> Biore makes an " ice cleanser , " which cools your skin with menthol , and a " warming cleanser , " which warms your skin with zeolyte .

It dries on your skin to form a fine film that can remove the " black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your skin . <p> The problem with the pore strips is that any benefits are temporary , and the filming agent can create new whiteheads and blackheads in adjacent pores " again , keeping you coming back for more . <p> If you are looking for a product that will actually help your skin , consider Exposed Skin Care . <h> - Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cream Cleanser <p> This unique product contains a compound called zeolite , which releases heat as it dissolves in water . Spreading the Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cream Cleanser will dissolve the zeolite and warm your skin . That warming action , however , is more interesting than curative . Warming your skin does not melt oil out of pores or stimulate growth of new skin . And although it also contains 2% salicylic acid , rinsing the cream cleanser off your skin also most as soon as you put in on negates any benefit of this ingredient . All you get for the US $7.99 you pay for 6.25 fluid oz/187.5 ml of this product is a so-so cleanser for normal to dry skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a " creamy , pearly formula with micro beads and maximum strength salicylic acid that unclogs pores and removes dry , dull skin so your pores can breath a little easier .

And unlike other Biore products , it contains waxes that stick to your skin and " guest what " clog pores . The menthol in this cleansing product irritates all skin types and increases sebum production , for which you will need to use more cleanser . The formulation of the product is designed to keep you paying US $7.99 for 5 fluid oz/150 ml and you 'll just need more and more to remove the wax the scrub leaves on your face . <p> Menthol and eucalyptus may seem refreshing , but they can be especially irritating to skin . <h> Biore Blemish Fighting Ice Cleanser <p> Here is a product that is advertised as " giving blemishes the cold shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the two main- ingredients that makes it feel cool on your skin , eucalyptus and menthol . Many people who have even slight skin sensitivity break out after they use products containing menthol . This cleanser also contains 2% salicyclic acid , which breaks up dead skin around blackheads and counteracts other irritant ingredients , but users wash the salicylic acid down the drain just a few seconds after application to the skin , too soon for it to do its work . Not to mention that the pH level of this product is too high for the salicyclic acid to be effective . Even as low as US $5.49 for 6.7 fluid oz/204 ml , Biore Blemish Fighting Ice Cleanser is not a bargain . <h> Biore Triple Action Astringent <p> Biore claims that this astringent will open pores and eliminate blackheads .

The product might be OK if you have very oily skin , a problem with blackheads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using skin care products . Otherwise you are just rinsing your US $7.99 per 8.5 fluid oz/255 ml down the drain . <p> Two more Biore products are not technically part of its Complexion Clearing line but are well known for treating acne . <h> Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips <p> If you are familiar with any Biore product , chances are it is the Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips or the Biore Ultra Deep Cleansing Pore Strips . Looking a little like a tiny Bandaid , you place these strips over clogged pores overnight and , the product promises , 15 minutes later you can just pull the deep cleansing strip and the clogs in your pores off your blemished skin . Biore used to make one version of the product for your nose and another version of the product for the rest of your face , but now one product is used for any area of your face . <p> Most users of Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips , however , find that they remove a little skin along with any contents of pores that stick to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strips is polyquaternium-37 , which is also used to make hair spray . Polyquaternium-37 dries into a thin film on the skin .

The strip will pull some oil off your skin , especially when you use it on your nose , but it will also leave polyquaternium-37 in your pores . <p> What 's the problem with polyquaternium-37 in your pores ? As is the case with so many acne products , this treatment will cause new blemishes even while it treats old blemishes . <p> But that 's not the worst potential problem . If you have rosacea , this chemical can irritate the capillaries beneath the pores in your skin .

Estrogen can be very important in managing womens acne , but its never as simple a matter as getting estrogen levels higher to clear up the skin . <h> Summary : <p> Estrogen relieves acne , but more estrogen is not always the answer . <p> Women who have premenstrual acne develop breakouts when progesterone levels go up and estrogen levels go down after ovulation . <p> Certain formulations of the Pill can reduce premenstrual acne , but no contraceptive ever stops 100% of premenstrual acne . <p> A condition called PCOS triggers acne by increased production of both estrogen and testosterone . <p> Too much estrogen can be as harmful for skin as too little . <p> PCOS is often correctable with diet , although it can take up to 12 months for results to be visible in the skin . <p> Hormonal fluctuations do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought back into balance , acne can be stopped in its tracks with the help of a complete acne treatment system such as Exposed Skin Care . <h> The Link Between Estrogen and Acne <p> When women have mild to moderate acne that comes and goes in sync with their menstrual cycles , bumps usually break out just after ovulation and clear up just after menstruation . " Menstrual acne " begins when estrogen levels begin to decline , about the midpoint of the menstrual cycle , and is at its worst just before menstruation , when estrogen levels start to go up again . <p> The way hormones have an influence on acne in women is through activation of oil making glands in the skin known as sebocytes . These cells make the oils that flush dead skin cells and excess bacteria out of a pore . Small amounts of oil in pores actually help keep them clean , as well as making the skin more flexible . <p> The sebocytes are activated by testosterone . Every womans body makes tiny amounts of testosterone , primarily in the ovaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testosterone in the same way they would respond in a mans body , except that most womens bodies make much less testosterone and have much lower skin oil production and hair formation than most men . <p> Estrogen levels start to climb at the beginning of the menstrual cycle . The estrogen binds to the cell receptors that would otherwise respond to testosterone . This " turns off " oil production and helps clear up pores . <p> Estrogen levels fall after ovulation . There is less estrogen to bind to the cell receptors in oil glands , so they are more likely to be activated by testosterone . They continue to produce excess oil until estrogen levels begin to climb again the next month . <p> There can be some lag time between increased oil production in the skin and acne breakouts timed to the menstrual cycle . If the skin is properly cleansed , acne may not break out at all . Not all of the pores in womens skin that respond to testosterone are in the face . There may be about 1/3 as many activated pores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is even possible for acne to break out on the chest in women . <h> Changing Estrogen Levels to Treat Acne <p> Changing estrogen levels is the way women can use the contraceptive Pill to fight acne . Most oral contraceptives are a mixture of synthetic estrogen and a synthetic progesterone-like compound known as progestin . Switching to a brand of contraceptive that contains more estrogen may stop the production of excess skin oils , and reduce the severity of acne . <p> Just switching contraceptives , however , never gets rid of all acne blemishes . Using a different brand of the Pill usually gets rid of just 30 to 50% of blemishes . Women who have premenstrual acne also need to : <p> Avoid irritating the skin with alcohol , perfumes , and certain botanicals ( especially menthol and cinnamon oil ) , especially in the second half of their menstrual cycle , the 10 days to 2 weeks before their periods . The skin repairs irritation and inflammation by making more oil . <p> Gently cleanse the skin at least once a day . Detergent cleansers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation worse . Mild cleansers that make small bubbles are better . Just place the cleanser on the skin and let the cleanser do all the " scrubbing " for you . <p> Keep the skin moisturized so it is soft and supple and pores can drain . Alcohol-based moisturizers can aggravate oil production , so it is best to use water-based or thin oil-based moisturizers on the skin . Moisturizers with skin-identical ingredients such as ceramides also help . <p> Many of the natural remedies for PMS help stop premenstrual acne because they block both testosterone and estrogen . Soy , green tea , and red clover can help with acne symptoms , but they do n't  get rid of all blemishes , either , and they do not replace the proper use of cleansers and moisturizers . <h> When Estrogen Is Not the Only Problem <p> The worst cases of acne in women of all ages , however , are usually associated with a condition known as polycystic ovarian syndrome , or PCOS . This condition occurs when the ovaries are overstimulated , usually by an influx of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual amount of both estrogen and testosterone , and the testosterone keeps oil glands overactive all the time . Many women who have PCOS have irregular periods or do not menstruate at all , so they never get a break from acne . Excess testosterone production may also cause unwanted hair growth . <p> The reason the ovaries work overtime to make testosterone in PCOS usually has to do with a phenomenon called insulin resistance . In insulin resistance , some toxin or trauma produces an enormous amount of free radicals . Its often impossible to tell the real origins of the problem . <p> Since burning sugar for fuel generates free radicals inside cells , most tissues in the body " switch off " their insulin receptors so they can avoid taking in too much glucose . These tissues are said to become " insulin resistant . " This leaves more glucose in the bloodstream . <p> The ovaries do n't  have an " off switch " for insulin , since the ovaries and the brain are given priority for receiving energy . They are flooded with sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy to make both estrogen and testosterone . <p> The simplest way to correct PCOS is to correct insulin sensitivity . This can be done with drugs , such as metformin ( Glucophage ) , or it can be done with diet . Lowering the amount of sugar in the bloodstream , even slightly , slowly reverses insulin resistance , and over a period of months , the ovaries stop making excessive amounts of testosterone . Normal periods may be restored , and acne and hair growth stop . <p> It does n't  take very much dieting to reverse PCOS . Losing 2-3% of total body mass through calorie reduction more often than not is enough to restore hormonal balance . Fertility returns about the same time acne disappears . This approach only works if women eat less . Exercising more does not have the same effect on the ovaries or on the skin . <h> Another Way to Stop Hormone-Induced Acne <p> Even when women can not get their hormones to normal levels , acne is not inevitable . Diligent daily skin care can keep the skin clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exposed Skin Care . <p> Acne and PCOS are also affected by fat metabolism . If you can not digest fats well , then you can not break down the Estrogen , which is also a fat , so that it can be eliminated properly through the digestive tract . When you can not digest fat , its because you do not have proper bile flow from the gallbladder which is required for breaking down those fats like estrogen . When it ca n't break down those fats , it comes out the skin as acne . It will get rid of it one way or another . So taking bile salts , or foods like radishes that stimulate bile flow , you have better chances of minimizing acne than just by minimizing Estrogen . Kind of cool . <p> HI !

@@98778716 @2978716/ <h> Could Hormones Be the Trigger of Your Acne ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Acne flares up when hormone levels change . There are some hormone changes that cause acne that you cant do anything about , but there are other interactions of acne and hormones for which smart skin care techniques make a big difference . This article about the hormones that effect acne that you control . <h> Summary : <p> Excessive testosterone increases sebum production that can clog pores . <p> If you have an issue with excess testosterone ( for example , you are a girl or woman who has PCOS , you are a teenaged or young adult male with excessive testosterone production , or you are a person of either sex who takes testosterone by injection ) , you can fight acne by taking special care to cleanse the skin . But do n't  " get rough " with your skin . That increases its production of its own stress hormones . <p> Get extra sleep to keep acne in check when you have issues with either stress or testosterone levels . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin clear , your bedroom must be free of blue light , or you need to wear a sleeping mask to keep your eyes from responding to blue light . Your eyes can detect blue light with your eyelids closed . <p> Managing hormones is just one part of acne care . Getting your skin clear and keeping your skin clear is easiest with a complete acne care system like Exposed Skin Care . <h> Acne and Stress Hormones <p> Everybody who has acne knows that acne can cause stress . It is also true that stress can cause acne . <p> Researchers at Stanford University recruited a cadre of students who had active acne , and asked them to come in for skin exams throughout the semester . As just about anyone would predict , students who had acne had more acne during final exam week , when academic stress was highest . But acne does not just respond to whole-body , general stress . It also responds to stress hormones made by the skin itself . <p> When the brain senses stress , it releases corticotrophin stimulating hormone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cortisol . When the skin senses stress , it also releases corticotrophin stimulating hormone , which instructs mast cells in the skin to release inflammatory chemicals . <p> What kinds of things stress out the skin ? Any kind of irritation of the skin is met with inflammation of the skin . An irritant is a chemical that could potentially compromise the skin barrier protecting the rest of the body . Inflammation isolates the irritant so it can not threaten the rest of the body . <p> Acne bacteria do not usually irritate the skin . In fact , one of the byproducts of their digestion of excess sebum in pores is essential fatty acids that reduce inflammation in the skin . Acne bacteria do n't  want to be chased out of their home . <p> To protect themselves from the immune system , however , acne bacteria secrete chemicals that make surrounding skin cells more sensitive to inflammation . That way , when the skin makes stress chemicals , it is the skin itself that gets bombarded with inflammation , not bacteria . As a pimple eventually opens up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a different pore . <p> The way to minimize stress on the skin is not to bombard it with chemicals to kill bacteria . These actually increase irritation and subsequent inflammation . The way to minimize stress on the skin is to avoid detergents , especially any kind of soap that makes big bubbles , to avoid alcohol on the skin , which dries it out , and to avoid any kind of product that makes your skin feel tingly . A tingly feeling on the skin is not a sign of healing . Its a sign of irritation and stress that will make skin break out later . <h> Acne and Testosterone <p> Testosterone is the hormone associated with masculine characteristics . The bodies of both men and women make testosterone , men in the testes and women in the ovaries . Mens bodies make much more testosterone than womens . Testosterone can also be made in the skin . <p> Fluctuations in testosterone levels are associated with acne even in babies , especially in baby boys in their second month of life . Testosterone increases activity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the sebaceous glands themselves can make testosterone from a chemical known as dehydroepiandrosterone , or DHEA , when they are stressed . The real relationship between testosterone and acne goes something like this : <p> When the skin produces its own stress hormones , sebaceous glands are stimulated to make testosterone . This testosterone increases sebum production , which in turn clogs pores . At the same time , the skin is releasing inflammatory factors . <p> When the whole body is under stress , sebaceous glands are stimulated to make the testosterone that increases sebum production and clogs pores . The skin does not , however , add to inflammation . Its a little easier to control acne that is triggered by " going through stress " than it is to control acne that is triggered by stressing the skin with alcohol rubs , steam treatments , harsh detergents , and strong antiseptics . <p> When children go through adrenarche , the maturation of their adrenal glands , which usually takes place 2 to 4 years before puberty , their adrenal glands start producing DHEA that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Childhood acne is not likely to occur unless the skin is treated harshly by too much scrubbing , rubbing , and skin care products containing alcohol or menthol . <p> In adult men , taking testosterone injections can also trigger acne . There are women who take testosterone and who are at added risk for acne , but most women who have high testosterone levels causing them to break out in acne have a condition known as polycystic ovarian syndrome , or PCOS . <h> Acne , Estrogen , Testosterone , and PCOS <p> PCOS is a condition that is caused by overactive ovaries . The ovaries normally make large amounts of estrogen- and small amounts of testosterone . In PCOS , the ovaries are overstimulated , so they make large amounts of both testosterone and estrogen . <p> The extra testosterone circulates to the skin and stimulates sebum production . Usually this makes the skin break out in tiny , red pimples around the nose and across the forehead . The solution for this problem , however , is not to try to counteract testosterone with estrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to deal with acne caused by PCOS is to reduce the ovaries production of testosterone . There are hormone-based treatments , but most women have much more success with diet . If there is less sugar in the bloodstream , the ovaries are less likely to be hyperactive , and the skin may clear up on its own . It usually does not require a lot of weight loss to correct acne related to PCOS . Just 2-3% of body weight , sometimes as little as 2-3 pounds ( 1-1.5 kilos ) , is enough to clear up the skin ( and also to restore normal menstrual periods and normal ovulation ) . Dieting to reverse PCOS symptoms , usually requires 6 to 12 months for results . <h> Acne and Melatonin <p> Melatonin is the hormone that induces sleep . Our brains make melatonin when the eyes do not detect blue light ( the same wavelengths of visible light that kill acne bacteria ) .

@@98778717 @2978717/ <h> Zineryt for Acne A Remedy That Works ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Zineryt is a combination of two old and reliable remedies for acne , the antibiotic erythromycin and the nutrient zinc , in a convenient lotion form . It is not as fast acting as some other combination treatments for acne , but its inexpensive , has few side effects , and usually gets rid of about 2/3 of blemishes in 3 months or less even if you do n't  do anything else . But there are very simple things you can do to get rid of the other 1/3 of your acne blemishes with little effort and very little money while Zineryt is doing its work . <h> Summary : <p> Zineryt is a combination of two treatments for acne , zinc and erythromycin . <p> Zineryt usually gets rid of about 2/3 of inflammatory acne ( pimples ) in about 90 days . <p> The combination of erythromycin and zinc minimizes redness , inflammation , and dryness that can be a side effect of erythromycin . <p> The downside of using erythromycin for acne treatment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Because Zineryt can kill the " easy " acne bacteria and leave the most virulent strains , it is important to follow up Zineryt treatment with another antibiotic and/or over-the-counter or prescription benzoyl peroxide or tea tree oil . <p> Zineryt wont get rid of whiteheads or blackheads . For that you need Exposed Skin Care . <h> The Antibiotic Power of Zineryt <p> Part of the anti-acne action of Zineryt is provided by the antibiotic erythromycin . In 1949 , a Filipino scientist named Abelardo Aguilar sent soil samples to Eli Lilly . In these soil samples there was a strain of bacteria called Saccharopolyspora erythraea . These bacteria released a chemical to defend them from other bacteria so they could multiply in the soil . Later known as erythromycin , this substance turned out to have antibacterial effects on many other kinds of bacteria that can cause infections . <p> Erythromycin works by interfering with the action of RNA in making proteins in certain bacteria . It in effect causes acne bacteria ( and some other kinds of microorganisms ) to go into a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If erythromycin is taken by mouth , it can increase the activity of a hormone called motilin , which speeds up the passage of food through the digestive tract , causing diarrhea or vomiting . And if erythromycin is taken orally for a period of years , it can cause a variety of rare but serious side effects that do n't  occur if it is used as a skin ointment . <p> For acne , erythromycin is best used as the first antibiotic used to treat acne . Because erythromycin has been on the market since the early 1960s , many strains of acne bacteria are resistant to it . But erythromycin is still a very inexpensive and very predictable treatment for most cases of acne . It just is not enough by itself . That is why Zineryt combines erythromycin with zinc . <h> Zinc for Immune Regulation <p> Zinc is an important nutrient for the skin , but it works by regulating the immune system , not by stimulating the immune system . <p> Acne bacteria do not cause significant inflammation of the skin . The redness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually caused by the nerves in the skin and immune system . When nerves in the skin sense " stress , " they send out a hormone that triggers the release of histamine from specialized " mast " cells in the skin . The histamine destroys tissues that might be harboring a toxin or infectious agent . <p> The immune system generates other chemicals that also break down skin cells in the lining of pores . The immune systems attack is " aimed " at acne bacteria , but they release chemotactins that redirect the immune systems inflammatory chemicals on skin cells rather than on themselves . This not only protects the bacteria , but gives them a way to escape to the surface of the skin as it breaks open . <p> Stimulating the immune system does not help anyone recover from acne . Regulating the immune system , on the other hand , can slow down inflammation enough that pores have a chance to expel acne bacteria , or antibiotics have a chance to kill bacteria , before inflammation injures the skin . The surest way to regulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplement , but zinc in lotions like Zineryt can do double duty as an immune system regulator and a sunscreen . <p> What 's special about the combination of erythromycin and zinc ? Erythromycin sometimes can cause redness , irritation , and drying of the skin . Zinc reduces these side effects . Erythromycin can kill acne bacteria without zinc , and zinc can clear up acne inflammation without erythromycin , but the combination of the two ingredients works even better . <h> The Best Way to Use Zineryt <p> If you live in the United States , Canada , or Europe , you will need a prescription to get Zineryt , but your health insurance will pay for it , or , if you live in the USA , you may be able to get the product for just $4 a month even without insurance . Its a very inexpensive treatment , but you should not use it for more than 90 days before you start using another treatment . <p> Why should you limit your use of Zineryt to 90 days ? As your doctor will probably tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for over 50 years . Some strains of acne bacteria will be able to resist erythromycin treatment . If you keep using Zineryt indefinitely , you will kill all the competitors of the resistant bacteria and they may cause an even worse infection on your face . This can also happen if you stop taking Zineryt abruptly and do n't  use another product , like benzoyl peroxide . <p> Always limit your use of Zineryt , but follow up with a different antibacterial product after you finish your prescription for the product . Even 2.0% over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide may be enough , but you will never get rid of acne with just Zineryt . One study found that when people with acne did not follow up with other antibacterial treatments , either other antibiotics or benzoyl peroxide , or both , the number of inflamed pimples in some cases increased more than 50% over baseline levels . <p> Its also important to keep in mind that killing acne bacteria is just part of getting rid of acne .

Thousands of pages of information tell us that cleansing the skin is basic to curing acne . But what does it mean to cleanse your skin , anyway ? <h> Cleansing Does n't  Equal Dirt Removal <p> For thousands of years , most human beings spent most of their lives getting dirty . Nearly everyone had to hunt for food " often without shoes " or toil on the soil to grow food . If you were one of the rare people who did not have to spend nearly all day nearly every day in intimate contact with dirt , you certainly did n't  have a Dyson cleaner you could use while you puttered around the house . <p> Cleansing the skin used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mud away , all you really need is water . But acne is n't caused by dirt and getting rid of dirt wont cure your acne ( although its pretty basic to good health if that 's something you need to do ) . The cleansing that works for acne is more about removing dead skin than it is about removing dirt . <h> Acne Begins with Dead Skin Buildup <p> The first step in acne is always the accumulation of dead skin in pores . Before the immune system attacks your skin with swelling and redness , bacteria have to accumulate in the pore . Before acne bacteria accumulate in a pore , they have to have a generous supply of sebum for their food . And before sebum can fill the pore , the opening of the pore has to be blocked by excessive growth of skin . <p> The sides of pores in your skin are also made of skin . This skin grows and matures and eventually sheds , just like the skin between your pores . But since ductal skin lies inside a pore , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with excess sebum . There is a fine balance between having enough sebaceous oil production in your skin to keep flakes of dead skin flowing to the surface and having so much sebaceous oil production to ensure your pores stay open . Its not a good thing to try to get rid of all the oil on or in your skin . <p> Obviously , there are n't  any teeny tiny brushes that you can use to scrub out your pores . Any bristle brush you use on your skin cant reach into your pores , but it can peel off healthy skin and leave it open to infection while appearing red and rough . But there are ways you can lift and separate dead skin on in your pores without damaging the skin between them . <h> Cleansing with Microbeads <p> One of the most effective ways to clean your pores while you clean your skin is to use cleansers that contain polyethylene or jojoba microbeads . These microscopic scrubbers are small enough to fit into the opening of the pore and small enough that they are easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin care products are smooth enough that they do n't  tear or irritate your skin . That 's something you do n't  want to do , because irritating the skin stimulates it to protect itself by making more oil . <p> Microbeads do n't  just clean your pores . They also lift and separate tiny flakes of dead skin on the surface between your pores . This action poses a number of benefits for your skin . Gently peeling off dead skin reveals the living skin beneath it . Your natural skin tones are brighter and more vibrant . <p> Removing that invisible layer of dead skin also helps smooth out fine lines and wrinkles . Dead skin tugs at the tissues around it and makes wrinkles deeper . Removing that dead skin reduces the tension on your skin so wrinkles and creases fade away . <p> And just because you are a teenager or a young adult , that does n't  mean that you do n't  need to lighten wrinkles and creases in your skin . Various kinds of creepy crawlies , such as the microscopic mite known as Demodex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your skin . When your skin gets either a little too dry or a little too oily , this mite is activated in your skin , either to consume dry flakes of skin or to consume excess oil in your skin . <p> All that crawling around in your skin " as many as 100 mites per square inch of skin " irriates your pores . The skin on the sides of your pores dies and flakes and blocks the pore at the same time the sebaceous gland at the base of the pore starts making more oil . The result is a whitehead that can oxidize to form a blackhead or that can become infected and form a pimple . One of the most important reasons to cleanse your skin is to get the parasites off your skin . Just do n't  work too hard at pest control . <p> You do n't  need to cleanse your skin 10 times a day . Or even 5 times a day . Unless something occurs like getting hit with a pie in the face , you only need to cleanse your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never need to rub and scrub vigorously to getting anything off or out of your skin .

The problem with washing too often or too hard or with detergents and soaps that are too harsh is that they do n't  just cleanse skin , they can kill it . Those little flakes of dead skin can flop and flap and land in your pores . And when flakes of skin block your pores , acne blemishes quickly follow . <p> Cleansing your skin is n't rocket science , and you do n't  have to wade through the thousands of skin care products on the market to choose the right one .

@@98778720 @2978720/ <h> How Benzoyl Peroxide Works <p> Benzoyl peroxide breaks down into two different chemicals when it is applied to the skin . One of these chemicals is a substance called benzoin . This chemical is found in cranberries , bilberries , and apples . It protects plants from fungal infections . In humans , it slows down the rate at which bacteria can reproduce and its also a mild pain reliever for infections in the skin ( assuming its used in concentrations that do n't  cause inflammation or irritation of the skin ) . <p> The other chemical that is released when benzoyl peroxide is applied to the skin is oxygen . Of course , the surface of the skin is exposed to oxygen in the atmosphere at all times , but atmospheric oxygen usually does not find its way into the base of skin pores . While acne bacteria , unlike some other species of bacteria , can withstand limited exposure to oxygen , too much oxygen on the surface of acne bacteria causes inflammation analogous to the inflammation generated by acne bacteria on the skin . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Generally speaking , benzoyl peroxide creams kill acne bacteria more slowly than micronized ( finely ground ) benzoyl peroxide creams and both kill acne bacteria more slowly than benzoyl peroxide foams . Benzoyl peroxide washes do n't  do much good at all , because the benzoyl peroxide in them is washed away almost as quickly as it is put on the skin . <p> It usually takes about 48 hours for benzoyl peroxide to kill 99% or more of the acne bacteria infecting a pimple . Getting rid of acne bacteria , however , is only the first half of the healing process . <p> Redness and irritation do n't  go away immediately because the inflammation of acne is actually the immune systems reaction to acne bacteria , not something caused by acne bacteria themselves . ( There are other kinds of skin infections , such as most streptococcal infections , that generate their own inflammatory toxins . ) Only when the immune system finally stops sending out chemicals to kill the bacteria that are no longer there will pimples begin to fade away . This second half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin and about two weeks on adult skin . <p> Benzoyl peroxide is of very limited value for treating whiteheads and blackheads . And a babys skin grows so rapidly that it opens clogged pores on its own . Pimples caused by baby acne , however , often will respond to treatment with benzoyl peroxide . <h> The Key to Success in Treating Baby Acne with Benzoyl Peroxide <p> The most important thing to do in choosing a benzoyl peroxide product for your baby is to choose the lowest strength available . The US Food and Drug Administration allows makers of acne skin care products to offer benzoyl peroxide in strengths of 2.5% to 10% . Its imperative always to buy 2.5% ( or , if you can find it , 2% ) benzoyl peroxide for use in treating baby acne . <p> The 10% strength of benzoyl peroxide is just too strong even for most adults . Its OK when applied directly to a pimple , but this concentration of active ingredient almost always triggers itching , peeling , drying , flaking , and irritation of the skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peroxide are available in both prescription and over-the-counter products . The 5% strength causes fewer problems than 10% , but its still hard on the skin even in adults . Nearly 80% of the people who start using a 5% benzoyl peroxide product do n't  use the entire tube . Most people find that it causes unpleasant reactions that at the very least require cutting back on the use of the medication . <p> A 2.5% strength of benzoyl peroxide is strong enough to kill acne bacteria but weak enough not enough to cause side effects . Most teens and most adults can use 2.5% benzoyl peroxide products to treat their entire faces . <p> On babies , however , this strength of benzoyl peroxide should only be applied directly to an inflamed pimple . Its not necessary to use any kind of acne care product on babys whiteheads and blackheads , because the babys skin is growing fast enough that they will literally fall out of the skin in a few weeks anyway . A dab of benzoyl peroxide on a babys pimple , however , will stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may take two weeks for an adults skin to heal completely after benzoyl peroxide treatment and about a week for a teenager , but sometimes a single dot of benzoyl peroxide on a babys pimple will result in complete healing in just 2 or 3 days . <h> Products That Work and Products That Do n't  <p> If you do n't  want to spend a lot of time reading product labels but you want be sure you buy a product that is safe for treating a pimple on babys skin , here are some suggestions . <p> Neutrogena On the Spot Acne Treatment is the least expensive benzoyl peroxide product on the market , and for treating baby acne , its also the best . The clay in Neutrogena On the Spot Acne Treatment holds the benzoyl peroxide to the skin , but also locks moisture in the skin so babys skin does not dry out . Do n't  use this product all over babys skin . Try a single dot of the product on a single pimple , wait a day , and make sure there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time , each with a tiny dot of the product , discontinuing the product if the baby shows any redness or irritation not there before treatment . <p> Paulas Choice CLEAR Acne Fighting Treatment with 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide is also a formula that is safe for babys skin .

Because that 's the wrong message . Acne is unhealthy and undesirable . These celebrities have acne scars because they picked at their acne or left it untreated .

Its particular common in women , because of the hormonal fluctuations women experience . There 's nothing " unhealthy " about acne .

@@98778723 @2978723/ <h> Grapefruit : A Secret Cure For Acne ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Every few years grapefruit is either praised as a miracle diet food or panned as the source of plant chemicals that interact with medications . The fact is , grapefruit can be helpful in controlling appetite , because it can fill up at the cost of very few calories , and grapefruit juice neutralizes enzymes that the liver uses to detoxify some , but not all , medications . The really useful medicinal part of grapefruit , however , is the seed . <h> Summary : <p> Grapefruit seed extracts kill the kind of bacteria that cause stomach ulcers . These bacteria are implicated in many cases of rosacea . <p> Up to 50% of people who have rosacea benefit from taking grapefruit seed extract . If your symptoms are set off by foods , you are more likely to benefit from taking grapefruit seed extract . <p> Grapefruit seed extract does not kill the bacteria that cause common acne , but it does kill staph and strep bacteria . <p> If you have a problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking grapefruit seed extract may help . <p> Allow about 4 weeks for visible results . <p> In botany the grapefruit is known as Citrus maximus , reflecting the fact that the grapefruit is almost the largest of all the cultivated citrus fruit . Grapefruit trees grow 6 to 7 meters ( 20 to 24 feet ) tall , bearing intensely sweet-smelling flowers that are followed by large , yellow fruit . The grapefruit tree originated in China , but was exported to Japan centuries ago , and to the Mediterranean countries and the United States in the nineteenth century . <p> Grapefruit has two colors of flesh . White grapefruit is better for juice , while pink grapefruit is sweeter and more often eaten as a fresh or candied fruit . <h> What 's Special About Grapefruit Seed Extract ? <p> In the 1970s an immunologist named Dr. Jacob Harich started gardening in Florida . He fertilized his plants with compost , which breaks down very quickly in Florida heat and humidity . The one food scrap- that did not break down in his compost pile , Harich observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds back to his lab and started testing . He found that the grapefruit seed extract neutralized hundreds of different strains of bacteria and fungus . The extract also killed many kinds of single-celled parasites . <p> Grapefruit seed extract contains vitamins A , B , and C , as well as the plant compounds naringen , neohesperidin , dihydrocampherol , quercetin , campherol , and apigenin rutoside . Laboratory studies over the last 30 years have found that grapefruit seed extract kills Streptococcus , Staphylococcus , E. coli , Salmonella , Helicobacter pylori , Giardia , and yeasts . Researchers in Mexico City have found that it kills 100% of the skin bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis in just 48 hours under laboratory conditions . <p> There are two different ways of making grapefruit seed extract . The cheaper way is to soak ground-up seeds and pulp in ethanol ( the kind of alcohol in alcoholic beverages ) and then to distill the extract from the mixture . This produces more of the naturally occurring antimicrobial compounds in the extract . <p> Another way of making grapefruit seed extract is grinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coconut oil . The coconut oil does more than just remove the antimicrobial compounds . It creates them by interacting with chemicals in the grapefruit . This method liberates fewer healthy compounds from the grapefruit seeds and pulp but produces more kinds of healthy compounds than soaking the fruit in alcohol . <p> There probably is some infection-fighting power in eating grapefruit ( you do n't  have to eat the seeds ) , although there is more in the extract than in the fresh fruit . To get the benefit of 5 grams ( a little over a teaspoon ) of extract , you would need to eat 1,000 grams ( a little over 2 pounds ) of fruit . <h> What About Grapefruit Seed Extract for Acne ? <p> The kind of acne that is most likely to respond to grapefruit seed extract is rosacea , the kind of acne that breaks out across the center of the face . The problem in rosacea is not clogged pores . It is leaky capillaries that make the skin look red or purple when blood drains into surrounding tissues . Triggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold , hot weather , cold weather , drinking alcohol , drinking hot beverages , drinking caffeinated beverages , humidity , indoor heat , medications that stimulate the skin , certain cosmetics , hot peppers , spices , barbecue , marinated meats , and dairy products . Not every one who has rosacea reacts to the triggers the same way . <p> Many people who have rosacea also have an infection with a strain of bacteria known as Helicobacter pylori . These bacteria colonize and form a film on the lining of the stomach . They keep from being dissolved by stomach acid by secreting urea . This kills cells in the lining of the stomach and gives them an anchor . The stomach attempts to get rid of the infection by secreting even more acid , which can cause ulcers of the stomach and duodenum . <p> Antibiotics ( and antibacterials like grapefruit seed extract ) are often useful for treating rosacea . When the Helicobacter bacteria in the duodenum are killed , the immune system in that part of the intestines no longer has to stay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer to the skin , where the immune system produces less of a reaction to allergy-causing substances . <p> In countries where nearly every one is exposed to Helicobacter all the time , bringing the infection under control often cures rosacea . In countries where nearly no one has Helicobacter infection , even if one happens to have both Helicobacter and rosacea , treating the infection usually does not help . Scientists do n't  know the reason why . However , the worse the infection in the duodenum , the more likely rosacea is to clear up if antibacterials or antibiotics are administered . <h> Who Should Take Grapefruit Seed Extract for Acne ? <p> If you have rosacea , you probably should not start eating large amounts of grapefruit to try to clear blemishes . Your skin might react to the acid in the fruit . However , you should try taking grapefruit seed extract , using the amount of extract recommended by the manufacturer . The small amount of extract in your mouth is unlikely to trigger a reaction in your skin . <p> There is no 100% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps rosacea , it helps reduce tendency toward blemishes by killing Helicobacter . This is useful for up to 50% of people in Latin America , but only about 10% of people in most Asian countries . And because rosacea is caused by a combination of factors , grapefruit seed extract will probably only make it better . It is very rare for using grapefruit seed extract to effect a cure . <p> Still , its worth a try . Buy products from a company that offers a money-back guarantee , and allow at least 4 weeks for results . 19923 @qwx879923

These aloe chemicals have to be applied to the lower layers of skin to have an effect .

In fact , there is little evidence that aloe applied directly to the skin has much benefit for acne , at all . <h> Scientific Studies of Aloe Vera for Acne <p> Indian scientists tested a variety of traditional herbal skin treatments as remedies for acne . They found that aloe vera did almost nothing to stop the inflammation and irritation caused by acne bacteria . British scientists have even found that using enough aloe to stimulate growth of the skin to open acne causes inflammation and irritation of its own , making acne worse .

@@98778725 @2978725/ <h> Ten Tips for Treating Acne on Asian Skin 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Acne products that work on other skin types can be harmful for Asian skin . <p> Treating acne on Asian skin presents special challenges that are often overlooked by the manufacturers of the most popular acne care products . The products that work on other skin types can be harmful for Asian skin . Here are ten useful tips for treating acne on Asian skin . <h> Summary : <p> Products that work for other skin types often can be harmful to Asian skin . <p> Many Asians have an enzyme deficiency that makes them very sensitive to hydroquinone . The products used to remove brown spots caused by acne can make them permanently black and blue . <p> Any product to foams , fizzes , or tingles can damage Asian skin . Tiny bubbles in a thin lather are OK . <p> Hydrating Asian skin is more likely to treat acne than drying Asian skin . Be sure to use alcohol-free moisturizers ! <p> Flushing on Asian skin is often misdiagnosed as rosacea . Usually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Asian heritage can be especially sensitive to detergent cleansers . <p> Any kind of soap or cleanser that makes big bubbles can break down the stratus corneum , the outermost layer of living skin . People who have Asian skin types , and especially people who have Japanese skin types , are especially sensitive to detergents . Not only do sudsing , foaming , big-bubble soaps and cleaners not clear up the skin , they can even cause worse breakouts of tiny pimples almost immediately after contact . Most people who are of Asian descent should wear gloves when handling any kind of detergent . Any skin cleanser should make a thin , creamy lather with barely visible bubbles . <p> 2 . Many people of Asian heritage have a hereditary condition called onchronosis that makes them very sensitive to skin lighteners . <p> Onchronosis is a genetic condition causing lack of an enzyme the body needs to utilize the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine . It causes cumulative damage to bones and joints often misdiagnosed by Western doctors as osteoporosis . It can also cause a much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially around the eyes and on the ears . <p> The dark discoloration of the skin can also occur as a reaction to exposure to industrial solvents , gasoline , benzene , or hydroquinone , which ironically is a product used to lighten the skin . The unfortunate reality is that when people with Asian skin tones use hydroquinone to remove brown spots on the skin left by acne , they often develop black and blue spots caused by onchronosis . Asian skin types must never be treated with products that contain hydroquinone , such as the Murad line of cosmetics . <p> 3 . Most Asians ( and most people with tight , oily skin ) are very sensitive to stinging and irritation from skin care products . <p> If you have an Asian skin type , chances are that any product that leaves your skin feeling " tingly " can cause irritation and even brown spotting of the skin . This means that products that contain alcohol , citrus extracts , lemon oil ( although lemon juice is OK ) , eugenol , cinnamon , eucalyptus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea tree oil , wintergreen , or menthol have to be used with caution , as do all benzoyl peroxide products . <p> 4 . Most Asians are more concerned about spots than wrinkles , and to prevent spots , they should treat pimples as early as possible . <p> Overexposure to the sun can leave brown spots on the skin , and so can acne . To minimize the formation of brown spots after acne heals , always treat acne with products that cause the least possible inflammation , and treat pimples as soon you see them . One of the ways acne bacteria defend themselves is by making surrounding skin cells more susceptible to inflammation generated by the immune system . The sooner you treat a pimple , the less sensitizing chemicals they secrete . <p> 5 . Many Asian experience skin breakouts similar to rosacea after they drink . These usually are not actual rosacea . <p> Many Asians , especially Koreans , lack an enzyme that detoxifies alcohol . Taking a shot or two of hard liquor can cause reddening of the skin , especially across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . This is not rosacea . It is a reaction to alcohol . Usually other symptoms are so unpleasant that the reaction is self-limiting . <p> 6 . Even though Asian skin looks light , it usually requires the same treatment as darker skin . <p> Asians tend to get spots from acne that can be made worse by some of the products used to lighten them . Higher concentrations of benzoyl peroxide ( over 5% ) and higher concentrations of alpha-hydroxy acid peels ( over 10% ) or beta-hydroxy acid peels ( over 2% ) also can cause permanent damage to Asian skin . <p> If you have Asian skin and you choose to use a mild facial peel , it is essential that you also use a neutralizing product to ensure that there is no damage to the skin . If you are getting a treatment at an aestheticians office or at a spa , make sure you get a " light " peel , just in case the provider is not familiar with Asian skin . Or better yet , go to aestheticians and spas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to wash their faces after they wash their hair . <p> Shampoo usually generates big bubbles to blast oil off hair . Unfortunately this can also damage to skin on the face . It is important to rinse the face after washing the hair to prevent redness and inflammation that can add to or cause brown spots , and it is also important to make sure the skin of the face does not come in contact with hair gels or leave-in conditioners . <p> 8. - Treating acne on Asian skin with a hydrating cleanser is more successful than treating acne with a drying cleanser . <p> Many Asians respond well to cleansers or cleansing pads that contain oil and respond poorly to cleansers or cleansing pads that contain alcohol . Oil in cleansers can dissolve excess oil on the skin , allowing it to be easily rinsed away . Alcohol in cleansers temporarily removes the " shine " from skin , but the skin responds to the drying effects of alcohol by producing even more oil later . <p> 9 . Certain ingredients in skin care products make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker and more noticeable on Asian skin . <p> 10 . Tea tree oil is usually not a good idea for treating acne on Asian skin . <p> Neither is Manuka honey , which is collected from hives of bees that feed on tea tree flowers . Tea tree oil is usually anti-inflammatory , but a surprisingly large number of people who have Asian skin types are allergic to it . Allergies , like cuts , scrapes , infections , and overly aggressive acne treatments , can irritate and darken Asian skin . <p> I 'm glad you found it helpful . I do n't  know about the sensitivity in general on Asian skin , but there is a mention about the benefits of Sandalwood in our article on treating acne with garlic . Also , we have an entire article dedicated to using rose water for acne . Again , I cant say for sure , but rose water is quite mild so I would n't expect it to pose a problem on Asian skin . As always when you try something new on your skin , put a small dab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you are n't  seeing any adverse reactions then it should be safe to try it on your face . I hope this helps <p> I 'm 25 and started breaking out for the first time after having my baby last year.im half australian half filipino but found out my skin is more sensitive whilst i was coin a hairdressing apprenticeship and would get bad dermatitis on my hands when constantly washing hair with all the shampoos and chemicals in colours . i tried using proactive but it was no good , i even went to a holistic specialist and had fortnightly glycolic peels but would badly break out a few days after treatment.then by chance whilst shopping in one of austarlias high end malls i was looking at make up by " Shu Eumura " when talking to the brands assistant about my skin she recommend i use their brightening cleansing oil . i was amazed on how well it worked after one was and how much better my skin felt with no stinging or burning or tingling at all . i recommend any asian or oily skin type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisturiser like la rosy posays sensitive asian skin range.its takes about 28day for your skin to renew itself so do n't  give up and go back to a stripping harsh cleanser after two weeks just be patient and you 'll see results before you know it ! <p> i 'm an asian . if you see me , you 'll assume that i have a light skin but actually not and i get tan so so veryy easily ( like u said up there on ur article ) . <p> i had acne so i used benzoyl and astringent and my acne reduced quickly and there are still some few pimples BUT brown spots everywhere ( second thing ure right about asian skin ) <p> so i decided to change my regimen and throw away benzoyl and those astringent and use rich brightening moisturizer lotion , my brown spots improved but my acne seems to got worse like when i use moisturizer my acne become hard <p> could u recommend any good mild product for asian skin like me ? i have oily t zone and quite dry cheeks <p> Hello , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it seems to help me ?

@@98778726 @2978726/ <h> Can Lavender Oil Really Cure Your Acne ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Sometimes herbal products can be extremely useful in some skin care applications , and downright harmful in others . Lavender oil for acne is a good example of this principle . <h> Summary : <p> Lavender oil smells good and is useful for treating burns . <p> For most people who have acne , however , lavender oil makes the skin redder . <p> Many acne care products contain lavender oil . <p> You may be able to tolerate lavender oil by itself , but have a problem when it is combined with other essential oils or botanicals . <p> Lavender oil seems to be interfere with the way the male body uses testosterone , but serious consequences have only been noted in three pre-adolescent boys . <h> What Is Lavender ? <p> Lavender is a plant that grows wild over much of Asia , Europe , and Africa . It has been planted in gardens all over the world , and it is cultivated for production of essential oils for healing and perfumery in France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavender is used to treat anxiety , headaches , and painful burns . It is also used to treat acne , but this is almost never a good idea . <h> How Does Lavender Act on the Skin ? <p> The essential oils of lavender bind to fats on the surface of the skin . If lavender oil gets inside a pore , it is likely to remain there , even after the skin is washed , unless it is washed with an oil-based cleanser . <p> Lavender interacts with the autonomic nervous system , the nerves that control the " automatic " functions of the body . In the skin , there are nerves that are excited when the skin is irritated . They release a compound called corticotrophin releasing hormone , or CRH . This hormone stimulates the release of histamine , the chemical that triggers allergic reactions . <p> When the skin has been burned , releasing histamine is a good thing . The chemical blocks off the tissue that has been burned . Lavender is also carminative , relaxing the muscles around blood vessels so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow of blood reddens the skin , but this effect is not noticeable , because the skin has already been reddened even more by the burn . <p> Applying lavender to skin affected by acne , however , makes the condition worse . The relaxation of the smooth muscles around blood vessels actually can trigger an outbreak of rosacea . And in mild to moderate common acne , it can make pimples look redder and more prominent . <p> Exposing the skin to the UV-A rays of the sun after application of lavender increases the amount of time it stays in the skin . If the skin is not exposed to the sun , the active chemicals in lavender oil begin to break down after about 4 hours , although it may take several days for every trace of lavender oil to leave the skin . <h> Which Products Contain Lavender Oil ? <p> Lavender oil is a named ingredient in literally hundreds of skin care products . Products that are labeled " linalool " or " linalyl acetate " also contain the active ingredients of lavender oil . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that are often used to treat acne include : <p> Not everyones skin responds to lavender oil with equal intensity . If you have irritation-resistant oily skin , you may be able to tolerate occasional use of products with lavender oil with no problems . If you have irritation-prone dry skin , however , probably you should avoid all skin care products of any kind that contain lavender oil , linalool , or linalyl acetate . <p> Sometimes you might be able to tolerate a little bit of lavender added to a product to make it smell nice , except it also contains arnica , boldo , chamomile , cinnamon , eugenol , frankincense , mint , peppermint , menthol , wintergreen , rose , tea tree oil , or vanilla . And the combination of any of these ingredients with cocoa butter or products that contain isopropyl isostearate , isopropyl myristate , or sodium laurel sulfate can cause blemishes to break out , especially around the eyes and mouth . <p> If you have any kind of irritation , inflammation , or sensitivity of any kind on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain lavender oil . A drop on your forehead to stop a headache , lavender in cookies or tea , or lavender capsules for allergies are all OK , just keep lavender off your skin . <h> Does Lavender Oil Disrupt Estrogen and Testosterone Balance ? <p> A clinical report in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine started a rumor that lavender oil contains estrogen and can cause feminizing effects in men and premenstrual tension in women . This is not true . The New England Journal of Medicine reported and analyzed the cases of three boys , none of whom had entered puberty , who had gynecomastia , or enlargement of the breasts . <p> Gynecomastia is not unusual in teenaged boys who have entered puberty . It is very rare in boys who have not yet experienced puberty . The boys were very carefully examined for any factors that could have caused these unusual symptoms . It was found that two of the boys had been exposed to a soap that contains lavender , and the third had been exposed to a soap that contains lavender and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual breast swelling ended after use of the soaps was continued . <p> Does this mean that lavender contains compounds that act like estrogen or that block the action of testosterone ? Further research indicates that this is possible , but if you are not a pre-adolescent boy , the effect seems to be of limited importance . However , no products that contain lavender oil are a first choice for treating blemished skin . 19923 @qwx879923

@@98778729 @2978729/ <h> Best Treatments for Latino Acne Problems 19922 @qwx879922 <p> If you were raised in a Hispanic household in the United States , your mother may have sent you to the curandera for acne treatment rather than to the dermatologist . And if your dermatologist is not aware of the special issues of Latino skin care , it sometimes may seem to be a better idea to seek " Latino acne treatment " at your traditional herbalist . With the right information beforehand , however , Latinos can enjoy successful medical treatment of acne problems . <p> Many of the issues of Latin acne management apply not to just to people of Hispanic descent or to people who have brown skin but also to anyone who has diabetes in the family . You do n't  have to have a Spanish last name or to speak Spanish or even be Spanish to have Latino skin care problems . Certain acne problems , however , are much more common among Hispanics . <h> Summary : <p> Latinos are especially susceptible to cystic acne . <p> For mild to moderate acne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Certain traditional practices , such as the afternoon break and the herbal therapies of curander+sma , make sense for treating acne on Latino skin . <h> Hispanics and Cystic Acne <p> More than any other ethnic group , Hispanics are susceptible to an especially nasty form of acne known as cystic acne . In cystic acne , the skin traps infection inside pores that are then covered by healthy , although pinkish colored , scar tissue . The walls of the pore erode so the mass of acne bacteria is exposed to the immune systems constant attack . The immune system tries to make the bacteria disappear by generating chemicals called interleukins and tumor necrosis factor , and the bacteria fight back by releasing chemicals that cause these chemicals to attack healthy skin . <p> The process goes on until something releases the infection , either surgery or Accutane treatment . But why are Hispanics susceptible to this awful form of acne ? <p> The answer seems to be that Hispanics are as susceptible to " diabetes of the skin " as they are susceptible to type 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not due to an accumulation of sugar in the skin somehow feeding acne bacteria . Acne bacteria do not eat sugar . They consume sebum ( and when they are present on the skin in small numbers , that is actually a good thing ) . <p> The reason so many Hispanics develop cystic acne is an overproduction of insulin-like growth factors that stimulate the growth of the skin . Healthy , pink skin grows over a pimple , and the bacteria inside and the immune system go mano a mano to try to dominate each other . The result is a nasty acne cyst . <p> Among the various groups of Hispanics , Puerto Ricans are the most susceptible to cystic acne . The more " indio " ones heritage , the less likely cystic acne is to be a problem . The more " mixto " ones ethnic origins , the more likely cystic acne is to occur . <h> Cystic Acne and Body Size <p> Cystic acne is also a special problem in Hispanic women who have a hormonal imbalance called polycystic ovarian syndrome , or PCOS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testosterone because they are flooded with sugar . <p> Most cells in the body have an " off switch " that protects them from absorbing so much sugar that their energy-making mitochondria go into high production . The ovaries have to protect eggs throughout a womans reproductive life , so they are configured to receive as much glucose as possible . In PCOS , the excess sugar leads to excess production of both estrogen and testosterone , the testosterone causing acne , and overproduction of insulin-like growth factor causing cysts . <p> Hispanic women who have issues with both PCOS and weight are especially likely to develop cystic acne . Fortunately , dieting helps resolve PCOS , overweight , diabetes , and acne all at the same time . Bringing PCOS and diabetes under control will help keep new cysts from forming . Then it is possible to pursue treatment . <h> Treating Cystic Acne in Hispanics <p> As is the case with other ethnic groups , Hispanics have limited options for treating cystic acne . The cysts can be lanced . They can be treated surgically . Or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lining of cysts and encourages the growth of skin over the cyst so it eventually opens on its own . <p> Then it is only necessary to treat mild to moderate acne daily , for the rest of ones life , to keep cysts from reappearing . Hispanics tend to have either cystic acne or no acne at all , but the principles for treating mild to moderate acne on Latino skin are the same as for everyone else . Latino skin can be dry or oily , sensitive to chemicals or resistant to chemicals , tight or wrinkly , and spotted or spotless . Different people need different acne treatments , but for mild to moderate acne , Latinos make the same choices as everyone else . <h> A Siesta Is Not a Bad Thing for Your Skin <p> Although the afternoon break known as a siesta is not very common for Hispanics in the United States , it is still practiced in much of the Caribbean and Latin America . From the standpoint of acne skin care , a siesta is not a bad thing . Staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevents drying of the skin across the nose and around the eyes . This reduces the formation of whiteheads , blackheads , and pimples . And you can always use your afternoon break to see your herbalist . <h> Curander+sma ( Traditional Cures ) for Latino Acne <p> What can the traditional curandera or curandero ( Latino folk healers who offer a combination of sympathetic magic and herbal treatment ) offer that the doctor can not ? <p> Well , traditional healers are in the miracle business . Chances are that your doctor will probably never promise miracles . Your traditional healer might , but if they deliver , that 's OK , too . Your abuela ( grandmother ) might be happy if you go . <p> Aside from spiritual ritual , if you turn to curander+sma for acne treatment , you are likely to get a " stinky cure . " These treatments are natural compounds that contain sulfur . Solid " stinky cures " may be a little strong for Hispanic skin " even if the " doctor " tells you burning is a good thing , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing . Burned skin scars . <p> Liquid " stinky cures , " however , can be beneficial for your skin if they are bound to the skin with the application of aloe vera gel or moisturizer . The sulfur , magnesium , and selenium in artesian water relaxes the skin and fights infection , and can really help mild to moderate acne on Latino skin . <p> Most of us , however , do n't  have time to show the proper respect to the traditional healer . If you are working long hours on the job , and your money is tight , consider an acne healing system , like Exposed Skin Care . You get all the treatments you need for mild to moderate acne in a single kit , and it comes with a money-back guarantee . 19923 @qwx879923

ThermaClear , marketers tell us , is very similar to laser therapy used by dermatologists , but at a fraction of the expense and none of the hassle . What are the facts ? <h> Summary : <p> ThermaClear is a " zit zapper " that heats pimples with a single quick jolt of heat . <p> The ThermaClear system takes much less time to warm up and much less time to use than competing products . <p> The problem with ThermaClear is that heating the skin does not heal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause inflammation . <p> The healing proteins the skin uses to heal itself only emerge to the surface of the skin after the top layers have been destroyed " and do you really want to kill your skin to improve it ? <p> Most people who have acne get better results with a complete acne skin care system such as Exposed Skin Care . <h> How To Use ThermaClear <p> To use the ThermaClear acne treatment device , you first have to let it warm up for about a minute . You then apply the device to a pimple for two painful seconds . It gives the pimple a quick blast of heat , and the treatment is done . Some users note that you could use ThermaClear to treat your whole face in the same amount of time as another device requires for treating a single pimple . <p> As " zit zappers " go , ThermaClear comes with a decent guarantee .

You will just have to buy a new treatment head for $19.95 plus shipping , handling , and tax about twice a year . ThermaClear is offered on reasonable terms and the company has a reputation for good customer service . <p> But do the claims made about ThermaClear make it sound too good to be true ? Let 's take a closer look . <h> How ThermaClear Works " or Does n't  <p> The principle of using heat to cauterize skin wounds is as old as the practice of medicine . Heating a wound to kill infection and stop circulation to the wound is a proven , if outdated , method of skin treatment . But acne is n't a skin wound . <p> In fact , the inflammatory reactions that cause pimples in acne are n't  really due to infection , either . The skin cells lining pores grow too rapidly . When they eventually mature and begin to slough off , they accumulate in clumps at the openings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pore beneath them . <p> The immune system attempts to kill the bacteria by releasing inflammatory chemicals that would dissolve them . The bacteria protect themselves , however , by releasing chemotactic chemicals of their own that redirect the inflammatory attack against the skin itself , injuring the skin but leaving the bacteria untouched . <p> ThermaClear claims that heating the skin for two minutes kills acne bacteria . There is no reliable scientific data to confirm that exactly how long acne bacteria have to exposed to heat to kill them , and no reason to believe that enough heat to kill the bacteria is not also enough heat to kill the skin . But even if Thermaclear does kill acne bacteria , scientific studies show that dead acne bacteria also release the chemotactins that redirect the immune systems attack to healthy skin . Killing acne bacteria with heat does not stop acne inflammation . Even in the presence of heat-killed acne bacteria , the skin releases nitric oxide , which opens capillaries and causes redness , plus interleukin-8 , which causes inflammation . <p> Does ThermaClear stimulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin ? Well , yes , but before collagen is released to rebuild the skin , the immune system sends first neutrophils to irritate and dissolve the skin and macrophages to consume dead skin tissue . Healing proteins come back up into the skin from the bases of pores only after the pore after has been destroyed . And do you really think you need to destroy an acne-prone pore to save it ? You do n't  . <h> The Appeal of Zit Zappers <p> Most of the people who use ThermaClear and similar products like the Zeno acne heat treatment device subscribe to the erroneous notion that there is no beauty gain without skin pain . That is simply not the case . Pain does not relieve acne . Pain makes acne worse . <p> The neurotransmitters that convey pain messages in the skin both increase the skins sensitivity to testosterone , causing it to secrete more skin oil , and trigger the release of a stress hormone known as corticotrophin releasing factor , or CRF . The net effect of CRF in the skin is to trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hives ) and tissue-destructive interleukin-8 . Pain never improves acne , and nor does heat . <p> So why do people use thermal devices for acne ? There is a human need to " do something " in response to a problem . Skin heating devices give acne sufferers something to do . And since they typically make the skin worse , they are a gift that keeps on giving " at the expense of ever clearing up the skin . <h> What to Do Instead of Using ThermaClear <p> No acne heat treatment device is going to improve your skin . A blue and/or red light lamp usually kills acne bacteria and shrinks oil-producing glands , but the benefits of blue and red light treatments are due to light , not heat . <p> Similarly , it does n't  really help to scrub your skin vigorously . You ca n't rub or scrub your blemishes away . Strong detergents can dry out the skin so that it clogs new pores . Failure to use sunscreen when using benzoyl peroxide can result in permanent darkening of the skin . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pimples in less than about two weeks . There just are n't  any treatments , medical or otherwise , that can give you beautiful , clear skin overnight . <p> There are acne treatment systems , however , that get rid of about 95% of pimples in 30 days , by combining cleansing , disinfection , moisturizing , skin peels , and microdermabrasion . One of the best is Exposed Skin Care " which retails for less than 1/3 the cost of ThermaClear and comes with a one-year money-back guarantee . 19923 @qwx879923

The fact is , for all but the most resistant skin , apple cider vinegar can cause more skin oil buildup than it treats , and people who have eczema or contact dermatitis may even break out when they use apple cider vinegar acne treatments . <h> Summary : <p> Apple cider vinegar is one of the most popular natural foods . <p> Apple cider vinegar applied to your skin , however , probably will increase oil in your skin , rather than reducing it . <p> Apple cider vinegar as a food can be very helpful in controlling breakouts caused by allergies and eczema . <p> Apple cider vinegar taken with meals can also help you control appetite , and , if you are type 2 diabetic , your blood sugar levels , which may be of indirect benefit in clearing up your skin . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fermented apple juice . Apple cider vinegar is fermented apple cider . In making vinegar , the alcohol in a cider or wine is further fermented into acetic acid . <p> Everyone who has tasted apple cider vinegar knows that is has an acidity beyond mere " tartness . " Although apple cider vinegar is not so acidic that it can burn the mouth , esophagus , or skin ( burns reported form the use apple cider vinegar tablets seem to be due to other ingredients in the supplement ) , it is acidic enough to lower the pH of the outer layer of the skin , or , oddly enough , to raise the pH of the small intestine when it is drunk or consumed with food . <p> Apple cider vinegar is usually considered an exceptionally " natural " product because it is often sold unfiltered , and because it may contain the " mother of vinegar " sediment left after fermentation . <h> Apple Cider Vinegar and Acne <p> Next to water , the most prominent ingredient in apple cider vinegar is acetic acid . Table vinegar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vinegar contains up to 18% acetic acid . The acetic acid in apple cider vinegar gives it a pH of 4.2 to 5 . <p> There is considerable evidence that apple cider vinegar can kill the food borne bacterium E. coli , source of stomach upset , diarrhea , and , in some cases , kidney damage . There is n't any scientific evidence that it can kill acne bacteria . Its simply not acidic enough . <p> What apple cider vinegar can do when it is placed on the skin is to irritate the pores . The skin attempts to heal the irritation by releasing even more sebum " so the net effect of using apple cider vinegar as a skin treatment usually is temporarily improvement in the color of the skin followed by longer-term increases in the numbers of whiteheads and blackheads . When people see they are breaking out , however , they often use more vinegar , causing still more blemishes . <h> Apple Cider Vinegar and Eczema <p> Although apple cider vinegar is not useful as a skin treatment for acne , it does have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a food . In particular , apple cider vinegar may be useful in reducing the severity of eczema . <p> Eczema is often triggered by consumption of certain foods . Milk , beef , tomatoes , citrus fruit , chocolate , cheeses , and eggs are the most frequent offenders . Allergy-provoking proteins in these foods are incompletely digested in the stomach , and pass through the lining of the intestine into the bloodstream . When these substances reach the skin , they cause a red , itchy , pimple-like breakout . <p> Apple cider vinegar may reduce the severity of eczema by ensuring the more complete digestion of the skin-irritating substances in these and other foods . When at least 1 oz/30 ml of vinegar is consumed either as a " shot " of vinegar or in salad dressings at the beginning of the meal , the stomach takes longer to digest food . It has to generate more stomach acid to neutralize the bicarbonate released from the digestion of the vinegar . <p> When food stays in the stomach longer , proteins are more completely broken down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may not help your acne , but vinegar in your may help your eczema . <h> Other Benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar <p> Apple cider vinegar is often advertised as a tool for aiding weight control . The effects of vinegar on weight control , however , are a little more subtle . <p> When your stomach is full , you do n't  feel like eating . When you consume vinegar with your food , food stays in your stomach longer . By helping you avoid snacks , you eat less , and you are more likely to lose weight " or at least not to gain it as fat . It is possible that eating less sugar and eating less of the wrong kinds of fats can have an indirect effect on acne control . <p> Apple cider vinegar can also help newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics control blood sugar levels . Slowing down the passage of food also slows down the increase in blood sugars after a meal , and gives the pancreas a chance to secrete enough insulin to " keep up " with food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control measures help keep all kinds of skin infections in check , including acne . Older type 2 diabetics who have the condition of " sluggish digestion " called gastroparesis , however , should not use apple cider vinegar at all . <h> Should You Use Apple Cider Vinegar for Acne ? <p> The simple fact is that it is a bit of a stretch to justify the use of apple cider vinegar in the treatment of acne . If you have very resistant skin , that is , nothing breaks you out but you have a problem with whiteheads and blackheads , then an apple cider vinegar soak might help with non-inflammatory blemishes . Soak a clean cloth in apple cider vinegar , rest it on your face for 10 to 15 minutes , and the , assuming you do n't  want to walk around smelling like a pickled herring factory , rinse the vinegar off your skin with warm water . The treatment should not leave your skin feeling tingly .

@@98778733 @2978733/ <h> Weight Loss Diets and Acne Vulgaris 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Losing weight can actually help get mild to moderate acne known as acne vulgaris under control . <p> January is the biggest month of the year for weight loss diets . Hundreds of millions of holiday party goers around the world pack in extra calories in December and pack around extra pounds in January . Hundreds of millions of people go on calorie-restricted diets to get the extra weight off . But what about weight loss diets and acne ? <p> It turns out that losing weight by short-term fasting is also a good way to get the everyday form of mild to moderate acne known as acne vulgaris under control . And the reason dieters sometimes clear up their skin overnight has less to do with fewer fats in the diet than it has to do with the production of more growth hormone in the brain . <h> Growth Hormone and Acne <p> Growth hormone , also known as GH , is a protein produced in the pituitary gland in the brain . It is well known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use ( illegal ) growth hormone injections . Growth hormone stimulates the production of muscle by " forcing its way in " to a muscle by activating receptors in cartilage . Once inside the cartilage , it helps the muscles respond to insulin-like growth factors ( note , " insulin-like , " these growth factors are not insulin itself ) and absorb the amino acids , sugar , and water they need to make themselves larger and stronger . <p> Growth hormone also stimulates the growth of the skin . Because it rejuvenates tissues underneath the skin at the same time , the skin smooths itself out and assumes a more youthful texture and tone . <p> For acne , stimulating the skins sensitivity to insulin-like growth factors is not by itself a good thing . These hormones stimulate the production of the skin oil known as sebum . If stimulating the production of sebum was all that was going on the skin , growth hormone might make acne worse instead of better . But since growth hormone also opens up pores as stimulates the production of this lubricating oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softer , and more nearly blemish-free . <h> How to Get More Growth Hormone Into Your System <p> Its not that hard to increase your bodys growth hormone . Just take a shot of recombinant growth hormone . You 'll need a doctors prescription ( or you may find yourself the object of scrutiny by the authorities ) , and that can cost up to US $10,000 per week . Sorry , the homeopathic growth hormone wont work for this purpose . <p> But you can also stimulate your body to make more growth hormone . One way is to work out . Working your muscles hard enough that they hurt " something you not do more often than every 48 hours if you are less than 50 years old or every 72 hours if you are over 50 " will stimulate the pituitary gland in your brain to release more growth hormone . <p> Another way to stimulate your body to make more growth hormone is to get deep sleep . This usually means six to seven hours of uninterrupted sleep every night to allow your pituitary gland to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use it . Growth hormone production plummets as soon as you wake up . <p> It can help to take the B-vitamin nicotinamide , although you have to be careful about taking nicotinamide if you have rosacea ( it can cause flare-ups ) , or you can make very sure that you do not let your blood sugar levels go too high . No candy bars , no desserts , no sugar-sweetened soft drinks , and no stuffing yourself with anything . <p> Or you can fast . <p> Your brain releases growth hormone to protect your muscles when you fast . This same growth hormone can rejuvenate your skin . <p> You do n't  have to fast for weeks or even days to activate the pituitary gland inside your brain to make more growth hormone . About 18 hours does the trick . Assuming you do n't  sleep walk in the middle of the night to make giant sandwiches or drive yourself to the all-night doughnut shop , you are already fasting 8 or 9 hours a day without even trying . Skip just one meal and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Unless you have a glycogen storage disease ( and you 're likely to know about that already if you do ) or you follow a rigid schedule for treating diabetes ( rather than taking your blood sugar levels with a glucometer and using medication or insulin on a sliding scale tied to your blood sugar readings ) , fasting for 18 hours wont do you any harm . It certainly wont hurt your muscles . Your pituitary releases growth hormone to ensure that they absorb amino acids rather than releasing them . <p> The effects of very short-term fasting are very positive for most people . A fast of 18 hours is long enough for your body to start burning fat instead of sugar released by your liver . Its long enough for your body to re-regulate its responses to the hormones that control your appetite . And its long enough for your body to make growth hormone that stimulates new muscle and rejuvenates your skin . <p> Unless you have a metabolic disease such as those mentioned above , you probably can fast for up to 48 hours without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and for your skin , however , occur after 18 hours of fasting . That 's nothing more than skipping dinner or breakfast once or twice a week . <p> Even if you eat more than you missed at the meal you skipped while you were fasting , by the way , eating food forces your body to make digestive enzymes all over again . This more than offsets the extra food you eat if you are hungry after skipping a meal . ( Do n't  eat double portions at the next meal ! ) You will lose more weight if you eat normally when you break your fast " and your body will be more able to process foods of all sorts . <p> If you put on a few pounds over the holidays and you 're having trouble with acne , too , try short-term fasting . Skipping just two meals a week may help you take off the pounds painlessly and clear up your complexion at the same time . 19923 @qwx879923

Most skin cancers are non-malignant , that is , they do not break out of the original tumor and spread throughout the body . <p> Melanoma , however , can break though the lower layers of the skin and spread to lymph nodes and the lungs . Once melanoma ulcerates the skin and spreads to other parts of the body , it is extremely difficult to treat , and only about 30% of patients can be expected to live 5 years or more . <p> Once considered a very rare form of cancer , melanoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While whites who have fair skin get melanoma 20 times as often as people with other skin colors , anyone of any race can develop melanoma . The disease usually strikes before the age of 55 . <h> Acne Bacteria and Melanoma <p> Japanese scientists came up with the idea of injecting melanoma tumors with the bacteria that cause acne , Propionibacterium acnes , by taking a careful look at the role acne bacteria play in acne inflammation . The redness , swelling , itching , oozing , and pain of acne are not actually caused by the acne bacteria themselves . Acne bacteria release chemicals called chemotactins that redirect the immune system away from themselves and into surrounding human tissue . The immune system " aims " at the bacteria but " hits " the skin . <p> There 's actually a long history of using immunizations to treat melanoma . Over a hundred years ago , doctors treated melanoma with what were known as Coley toxins . In the 1990s , cancer researchers developed melanoma vaccines that activate the immune system to fight the cancer . These vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years for 95% of patients and melanoma is now fatal within 5 years for just about 70% of patients . <p> The great value of an acne bacteria vaccine , the Japanese researchers hoped , would be the ability to direct the immune systems attention directly on the tumor , rather than creating antibodies spread throughout the body via the bloodstream . <h> Dramatic Results from an Acne Bacteria Vaccine <p> To test the treatment , the scientists introduced tiny amounts of melanoma tissue into the abdominal cavities of laboratory mice . The cancer cells multiplied very quickly and formed visible tumors . Then the scientists injected live acne bacteria into the tumors to see if they would trigger an immune reaction . <p> When the mouses immune system encountered the acne bacteria , it sent out dendritic cells to attack them . These are white blood cells that look a little like a branching tree , sending out " arms " to surround and reel in individual bacteria that the white blood cell literally eats . <p> In the process of consuming the bacteria , these white blood cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells began attacking the tumors as if they were the healthy skin infected with acne . Just as the immune system destroys a tiny patch of healthy skin to make a pimple , the mices immune systems attacked the melanoma tumors . <p> The results were dramatic . Without any radiation or chemotherapy or any other treatment , tumors shrank by 70 to 99% . The immune system itself was able to destroy the tumors without any outside help once it was trained by the acne bacteria . <h> Acne Isnt Entirely Bad After All <p> A study conducted in Spain found that immigrants to Spain from Latin America were more likely to have acne and less likely to have melanoma . The results may not hold for other ethnic groups and they do n't  show causality , that is , it is not possible to conclude causality from this kind of study , whether acne causes resistance to melanoma .

Acne bacteria feed on sebum and even release anti-inflammatory essential fatty acids as a byproduct . A small number of acne bacteria in your pores is a good thing for your skin . <p> Its only when the skin grows so fast that pores close up that both sebum and bacteria can accumulate and precipitate the immune reactions we know as acne .

Acne bacteria do not cause this inflammation . The immune system does after it receives a hormonal " distress " signal from the skin , which may be generated even when bacteria are not present . This hormone , corticotrophin stimulating hormone , causes the release of interleukin-8 and histamine , which in turn inflame the skin . The immune system gets rid of bacteria by killing skin along with them . <p> When Lactobacillus acidophilous bacteria colonize the colon , the immune system attempts to get rid of them , too .

Since 80% of teenagers get acne and 80% of teenagers masturbate , there might be a ring of truth to this age-old advice . But is there really any relationship at all between masturbation or any other sexual activity and acne ? <h> Mr. Kelloggs Anti-Masturbation Crusade <p> One of the most influential health experts in American history was John Harvey Kellogg , who was born in 1852 and died in 1943 . A missionary , a physician , and the co-inventor of corn flakes breakfast cereal ( with his brother William Keith Kellogg , found of the Kelloggs cereal company ) , Dr. Kellogg was an early advocate of vegetarianism , enemas , and sexual abstinence as the three keys of good health . <p> Kellogg was trained in medicine at the Michigan State Normal School ( now Eastern Michigan State University ) and New York University and the famous Bellevue Hospital , now best known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation of the races and isolation of immigrants who were not from northern Europe , although he adopted several Black children . He was a devout Seventh Day Adventist and a skilled surgeon , often offering his services to the public for free , especially circumcisions to prevent male masturbation . <p> Dr. Kellogg was also a true believer in sexual abstinence , writing his anti-masturbation book Plain Facts on his honeymoon . Kellogg tried to convince millions of Americans that " neither the plague , nor war , nor small-pox , nor similar diseases , have produced results so disastrous to humanity as the pernicious habit of- " onanism " ( masturbation , referring to the Biblical story of Onan who withdrew during sexual intercourse rather than impregnate his sisters widow ) . He also taught that female masturbation caused diseases of the uterus . <p> Kellogg also had innovative ideas on how to prevent masturbation . He advocated clitorectomy , the removal of the clitoris , the same act as female circumcision practiced in Africa , although under sterile surgical conditions . After performing circumcisions , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a tiny opening remained for urination , and he also patented genital cages for little girls . He had some patients confined to cages so they could not masturbate , and he also advocated the application of pure carbolic acid to the clitoris to discourage women who wanted to indulge in solo sex . Dr. Kellogg recommended " cool " enemas for what he considered to be nymphomania , to discourage sexual activity , especially in women . And his cereal formulas were designed for cleaning out the colon so that there would less to remind people of what was " down there . " <p> Fortunately for us in the twenty-first century , about all that remains of Dr. Kelloggs teaching is the idea that somehow masturbation causes acne . The idea is the punch line for many jokes , although some parents and teens still take it seriously . No one in the medical establishment accepts the relationship between masturbation and acne as causal , but that does n't  mean there is no relationship at all . <p> One of several triggers of acne is increased testosterone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual characteristics , occurs in relatively large amounts in mens bodies and relatively small amounts in womens bodies . Increases in testosterone levels in both males and females cause increased production of sebum in the skin . The increase in skin oil production does not cause acne unless there is also hyperkeratinization ( overgrowth ) of skin cells in the lining of pores that traps the oil inside , but when both events occur , blemishes are more prominent . And testosterone has to be transformed into the related chemical **27;223;TOOLONG before it activates sebum production . <p> In men , there is no doubt that visual sexual signals ( such as viewing erotic photos or DVDs while masturbating ) raises testosterone levels . Researchers at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas ( a somehow appropriate research institution for this study ) accompanied male strip club patrons to midnight sex shows to measure changes in their testosterone levels . The researchers own testosterone levels rose 14% during the sex show . The test subjects testosterone levels rose 72% .

The study found that older and younger men alike had higher testosterone levels at the club . <p> In women , sexual arousal of any kind , including masturbation , increases bloodstream levels of testosterone and also prolactin and luteinizing hormone . Researchers at the University Clinic Essen in Germany determined this by asking women to watch a pornographic film and then masturbate to organsm . Ironically , these changes in hormone levels after sexual arousal make women slightly less fertile . <h> Could Dr. Kellogg Have Been Right After All ? <p> There really is scientific evidence that masturbation can cause increased testosterone levels , and that increased testosterone levels are one factor in acne breakouts . The fact that one has acne , however , neither proves nor disproves the proposition that they indulge in masturbation . <p> In the rare , unfortunate individuals who masturbate so compulsively that they do not attend to basic hygiene , acne may occur " but it would hardly be the most significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times daily , there may be temporary increases in testosterone levels that may lead to temporary increases in **27;252;TOOLONG levels that lead to increased oil production " but this probably is not enough to cause acne . If skin oil production goes up for a few hours , the excess oil is not necessarily trapped in pores . Shiny skin would seem to be a more likely indicator of sexual self-gratification than acne " but there are also multiple factors that cause shiny skin . <p> If you have acne , stopping masturbation wont cure it . If you masturbate , your auto-erotic activities wo n't cause masturbation .

The same characteristics that give black skin the power to stand up to sun damage , however , also make it vulnerable to permanent damage from acne . <h> Summary : <p> The same physical characteristics that makes black skin so resistant to infection makes it very vulnerable to discoloration . <p> The problems that come up in acne care for black skin also come up in dealing with hair removal , cuts and scrapes , and the use of all kinds of skin care products . <p> The skin care products that work on white skin usually do n't  work on black skin . Some product selections can be cosmetically disastrous . <p> This article lists simple and inexpensive products for major concerns of black skin care . <h> What Makes Black Skin Black ? <p> Black skin has a high concentration of the pigment-producing cells called melanocytes . These cells make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its color , but that is not their primary function . The main task of the melanocytes is to make melanin , which is not just a pigment but also a skin-protective antioxidant . <p> When the skin is injured by infection , sun , exposure to a toxic chemical , a bug bite , or a mechanical injury like a cut or a scrape , the immune system isolates the disease-causing germ or chemical and clears out the diseased tissue by releasing inflammation . Melanin puts a brake on that process , keeping inflammation from destroying healthy skin . People who have black and dark brown skin tones are blessed with an unusual ability for the skin to heal . <h> The Unique Challenges of a Black Complexion <p> The high production of melanin that protects the skin from inflammation , however , also can produce long-term or even permanent discoloration of the skin . This discoloration is known as melasma . Acne , as well as cuts , scrapes , bug bites , and other kinds of skin infections can cause permanent brown and black melasma to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the logical thing and try to correct those brown and black spots with skin lighteners . <p> That 's where the real problems begin . <p> If you were to use a product by the famous Dr. Murad , for example , you might find your skin lightener eventually makes your skin even darker . Many of the skin lightening products that are great for white or light brown skin are devastating for black or dark brown skin . The worst problem ingredient for black skin is a chemical called hydroquinone . <h> Hydroquinone is Horrible for Black Skin <p> Hydroquinone is , as its name suggests , a derivative of quinine , the chemical in quinine water and malaria treatments . Hydroquinone binds to trace minerals in the skin and generates free radicals that destroy melanin deposits . In white or light brown skin , there is not as much melanin to be destroyed , so there is relatively little inflammation . ( Light-skinned persons who use hydroquinone for skin lightening , however , still need to use sun screen to prevent sun damage . ) <p> In dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melanin for hydroquinone to destroy . The destruction of so much melanin temporarily lightens the skin , but it causes a lot of inflammation . And what does the skin do to repair excessive inflammation ? It produces more melanin ! People who have beautiful , dark skin tones need to preserve their skin tones by taking a totally different approach to acne repair and acne treatment . <h> It Isnt Just Skin Lighteners <p> Bad choices in skin lighteners for acne problems produce the most tragic preventable cosmetic errors on black and dark brown skin , but they are not the only problem . Let 's take a look at the problem areas in managing black skin . <p> Dark skin develops dark spots after almost any kind of injury , including bruises , cuts , scrapes , and burns , as well as acne and skin infections . <p> People who have dark skin usually have dark hairs . Hairs that grow in places where they are n't  supposed to be are tempting to remove , but the waxing , tweezing , and chemical depilatories can all leave dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a particular problem of men with black skin who shave . <p> The skin on the face , especially on the nose and across the cheeks , tends to get oily . This means many dark-skinned people tend to take shiny photos . They also tend to get acne in the middle of the face where it is most noticeable . <p> In dark-skinned people , acne starts later in life and lasts longer . While people with dark skin have just as many or more stresses than people of any other skin type , acne on dark skin seems to have less to do with stress and more to do with blood sugar problems and imbalances between estrogen and testosterone . <p> All kinds of skin care products can make dark skin oily . This means that hair conditioners , bug repellants , sun screen , and Vaseline ( even if it is not applied directly to the face it may be transferred to the face from the hands ) all tend to clog dark skin . <p> Sun block tends to leave white or purple tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially makeup that covers up acne or acne-related skin spots , very difficult . <p> Foundation for makeup tends to streak , sometimes making acne even more noticeable . <p> So how on earth can anyone manage acne on black or dark brown skin ? Here are some suggestions . <h> Managing Acne on Dark Skin <p> What works for a native of Iceland usually does not work for a native of Ghana . People who have naturally dark skin tones need different approaches to and different products for skin care . <p> There are two relatively inexpensive products that both keep pores open , preventing acne , and preventing the formation of spots on black or dark brown skin . These are Aveeno Positively Radiant Cleansing Pads and Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash Clarifying Cleanser . <p> There are two relatively inexpensive toners that soak up excess oil to prevent shininess and also prevent darkening of the skin .

Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer with SPF is a low-cost choice that actually works . <p> Before you invest a lot of time and money in trying various skin care products , however , why not at least treat acne with a kit that contains everything you need . Exposed Skin Care offers all the products you need for acne treatment in a single kit that comes with a money-back guarantee . <p> Ive been thinking this whole time , before i came across this article , that i was a some sort of freak for having different darker skin that does n't  respond very well to various acne products formulated for lighter skin tones .

It is not at all unusual to want treatment before you can afford to pay cash . And its not at all unusual to feel like a contestant on TVs Let 's Make a Deal as you politely tell your doctor that you will have to take a take it or leave it stance on treatment that simply costs too much . <p> In the United States it was once considered socially unacceptable " too vain " to spend large amounts of money on ones appearance . For men , any investment in cosmetic treatment at all opened them to ridicule . For women , expenditures on beauty care that competed with mortgage payments , retirement savings , or sending the kids to college was also frowned upon . <p> Television programming has changed American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series Extreme Makeover has caused many people to open up about how much they spend on skin care to fight aging , and increasing frequency of divorce , remarriage , and mid-life career change make many Baby Boomers " in the market " for cosmetic improvements of all kinds . <h> Aestheticians vs . Dermatologists <p> Another new development in the United States is the emergence of day spas that compete with dermatologist clinics . In the 1960s and 1970s , there were only a few dozen aestheticians operating skin rejuvenation salons in the whole of the United States , although hairdressers and nail salons often sold beauty products . <p> In 2011 , there are thousands of aestheticians offering high-quality skin care that directly competes with many of the services only doctors used to provide . Only doctors can perform surgery , but licensed cosmetologists may offer dermabrasion , microdermabrasion , and skin peels that were once only available at the doctors office . Doctors of dermatology feel pressure both to house their practices in buildings that have a spa-like feel , and to lower their fees for certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can an Aesthetician Do For You That You Ca n't Do for Yourself ? <p> There are gentler , safer versions of many of the procedures offered by aestheticians and dermatologists that you can do at home . There are at-home chemical peels , microdermabrasion , and even laser treatments . While most home versions of popular skin treatments only require an initial investment of US $100 to $300 , getting results from home treatments also takes months when treatments from either the aesthetician or the dermatologist only takes weeks . <p> You may spend $500 on home treatment and get visible results in a year , or $5000 at a day spa or dermatologists office and get better results in a month or two . Most people really do get a better look from professional skin care . <h> Where to Get Cash for Treatment <p> Many people borrow money for skin care . CareCredit , Citibank Health Card , GE Care Credit , and Chase Health Advance all finance dermatological procedures at a relatively low rate of interest , probably more than you would pay on your car loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doctors are encouraged to recommend these lenders to their creditworthy patients . <p> Not everyone qualifies for loans at low rates . If this is your situation , chances are that your doctor will also accept Visa , Mastercard , Discover , and American Express . But if your doctor accepts various forms of patients , he or she is likely to realize that other doctors do , too . <p> Its probably more comfortable for you to have a discussion with the doctors office manager than with the doctor herself or himself . But if the doctor accepts payment plans , the doctor may also be willing to negotiate prices . <h> Walk Away from Sticker Shock <p> The Internet is not a good place to research the cost of most acne skin correction procedures . The low prices you see on the Internet may refer to treatment outside the USA , or they may be faked . Do n't  assume that any doctor you consult will try to match them . <p> But do n't  settle for sticker shock . If during the initial consultation the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1000 , for a procedure , and you are presented with a bill for a much higher amount after the procedure is done , say $5000 , make sure you have an acceptable explanation .

You may be offered a payment plan during your initial consultation , or you may get a call from the office a week or two later offering a payment plan to encourage you to being acne revision treatments . You may also be offered a payment plan if you ask about other cosmetic procedures . Older adults are less likely to be offered payment plans because they are usually assumed to have more money . <p> Just do n't  forget to consider the total price of your care .

And Other Reader Questions 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Were just getting the forum for this site set up , but our writer Robert Rister has been getting reader questions about acne for over a decade . Here are some classic questions that get asked over and over again . <h> Q. I 'm a guy . Can I use makeup to cover up my acne ? <p> A. Guys like Brad Pitt and James Olmos use makeup to cover acne ( and sometimes do n't  ) , so there 's no inherent reason you cant , too , just because you are a guy . Since you probably are n't  familiar with foundation and powders and blush and so on , its best to start simple . <p> Clearasil is far and away the least expensive and most available acne cover up . Clearasil used to come in one color , peach . The problem with peach Clearasil was that just about no one ( unless you have a liver disease or you eat too many carrots ) has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as the pimple or blackhead itself . Clearasil will help clear up your acne , but you are just lucking out if you find a tint that matches your skin tone . <p> The next step up the coverup ladder is foundation makeup . Foundation is just what it sounds like . Its the first layer of makeup that is applied to the face after cleansing , patting dry , and moisturizer . If all you want to do is to cover up acne , however , you do n't  necessarily have to use it all over your face . If you have dry skin ( the kind of skin that tightens up and breaks out in small blackheads and pimples ) you 'll use liquid foundation . Powder foundation on dry skin can clump and cake . If you have oily skin you 'll use liquid to power foundation . Liquid foundation on oily skin can streak . <p> Ideally , you would take a tiny bit of foundation makeup ( about the size of an English pea ) and put it on the back of your hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dab itty bitty bits of makeup on your blemish without touching it . Then you would use your thumbs to smooth out the makeup around the blemish to blend it into your skin . <p> You do n't  absolutely have to use a makeup brush . You can use your fingers , - but it is absolutely essential that you only put clean fingers in makeup . You do n't  want to transfer bacteria from your hands into your makeup and then from your makeup back to your face . <p> Where can you get makeup ? The people who run cosmetics counters in department stores and drugstores can be very helpful . They can help you select the right product and the right tint . Just be very sure to clean off the makeup every night and put acne care products on . The less time you spend wearing a cover up the faster the blemish will heal . <h> Q. I recently started eating healthier , more fruit and vegetables and especially vegetables . I also started drinking a glass of red wine every day , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthier , I have started getting acne on my chin . What is going on ? <p> A. No site , including this one , can give you a medical diagnosis . We can suggest the right questions , however . <p> One possible culprit is sodium lauryl sulfate , also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate and SLS . Its added to countless oral care products and shampoos to keep the ingredients dissolved . The problem with SLS is that some people are very sensitive to it . The splash of mouthwash or toothpaste over your chin and the sides of your mouth can make you break out . The fix is simple , either stop using products that contain SLS , or make a point of washing your face after you use mouthwash or brush your teeth . <p> Another possibility is an allergy to salicylates . These are aspirin-like compounds that are concentrated in dried fruit , especially raisins , blueberries , cranberries , baking powder , and most spices that are derived from the leaves of a plant , especially dill . While the foods that contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut back if they are making your face break out . <h> Q. Lately Ive been having a problem with black acne . I do n't  get pimples , but I get blackheads that nothing seems to budge . I 'm not exactly a teenager . Next week I 'll turn 83 . Do you have any suggestions for me ? <p> A. First of all , Happy Birthday in advance . And be assured that back acne is a common problem after the age of 70 . <p> People who get back acne after 70 tend also to be people who take medications that dry out the- body in general . Diuretics and medications for Parkinsons disease cause dryness all over the body . Autoimmune diseases , which are more common the older we get , also often cause dryness all over the body . <p> The skin on the back is unusually tough and get unusually dry . This makes it very tight around blackheads that can literally stay in the skin for years . <p> Probably the best way to deal with the problem is to try a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be able to reach your back to use it , as long as you can point it at the acne and spray .

Benzoyl peroxide on your face can cause drying and redness and irritation , and when it dries out the skin on your face , new acne blemishes can follow . <p> Most people in their 70s , 80s , and beyond do n't  have a problem with acne on their faces , so they should not use benzoyl peroxide on their faces . But if you have skin on your back that is so tough that you have stubborn blackheads it is not likely that you will have any kind of negative skin reaction from benzoyl peroxide . <p> Nonetheless , do n't  use benzoyl peroxide foam or any other acne care product all over your back without testing a tiny spot first .

Its pricey , but its available over the counter . The drawback to using topical tretinoin is that you will probably need someone to put it on your back for you and you will need to be able to avoid rubbing it off the skin of your back while you are using it .

What about mild acne ? Are you worried about your children getting acne ? Worried they will go through the same struggles with it like you did ? This is a common concern among parents . Growing up with acne can be really tough and in extreme cases , even cause teens to go through depression . It is perfectly natural to want to be protective of your teenage son or daughter . Unfortunately , skin type , oil production and ultimately acne are all pretty much hereditary . <p> Genetics and Acne <p> Our genetics are passed down to us from our parents .

@@98778743 @2978743/ <h> Vitamin C for Acne 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Natural sources of Vitamin C are much more effective in fighting acne . <p> If there is any vitamin we have all heard about , it is vitamin C. Most people take vitamin C to boost immunity . For acne , however , vitamin C when it is used to keep immune responses in check . <h> Is Vitamin C Really What We Think It Is ? <p> Vitamin C is the nutrient most people get from orange juice or by taking 1000-mg capsules . It turns out that neither orange juice nor 1000-mg capsules of synthetic ascorbic acid is the best way to get vitamin C for fighting acne . <p> When the famous Hungarian-American scientist Albert Szent-Gy+rgyi was researching treatments for scurvy nearly 90 years ago , he noticed that vitamin C was n't enough to treat the red and sore gums , red and sore skin , loose teeth , and connective tissue degeneration caused by this vitamin C deficiency disease . Vitamin C needed some kind of co-factor to regenerate it and to keep it active . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goulash made with paprika ( he was Hungarian , after all ) , then they got better . If they did n't  get this factor he called " vitamin P , " the vitamin C did n't  work . <p> The term " vitamin P " was used in the medical literature not printed in English until just a few years ago . In the English-speaking world , what Dr. Szent-Gy+rgyi called vitamin P we call citrus bioflavonoids . <p> What this means is that natural sources of vitamin C are far more effective than synthetic sources of vitamin C. There is even a standardized product known as Acerola with Vitamin C USP that uses the Caribbean fruit acerola as the source of an intensely concentrated natural vitamin C that has the cofactors that stabilize the collagen in blood vessels . But what does that have to do with acne ? <h> Vitamin C Helps Take the Red Out of Acne <p> Probably the most dramatic effect of taking a vitamin C supplement if you have acne is clearing up the redness in your skin . Redness is partially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as leukotrienes to destroy acne bacteria , but the bacteria have a " decoy " system that redirect those chemicals toward the skin itself . Vitamin C in large doses does n't  stimulate the immune system . It " tones it down . " That 's a good thing , however , when the immune system is misfiring and destroying healthy skin rather than the acne bacteria in pores . <p> The other way vitamin C helps take the red out of acne is by strengthening the linings of capillaries . These are microscopic blood vessels that provide oxygen and nutrients to the basal layer of the skin , about the thickness of 25 cells deep . The basal layer generates new skin cells that keep pushing outward to the stratum corneum , where they die and rupture to form a solid protective layer of protein and ceramides over the skin . The redness we see in pimples is mostly generated at this lower layer , but it is minimized when vitamin C with its cofactors helps stop leaks of bright red blood . <h> Do You Get Enough Vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutrition experts to recommend very large doses of vitamin C. Daily doses of 1000 , 5000 , and even 25,000 mg of vitamin C were supposed to be thing to activate the immune system . Some people ( who made their living by selling vitamin C ) even tried to persuade their customers that the diarrhea and dehydration that come with taking huge doses of vitamin C was a good thing , a signal that the vitamin C was working . But the old advertising pitch for vitamin C was based on at best a faulty understanding of how the nutrient actually works in the human body . <p> Getting enough vitamin C to avoid scurvy really only requires an orange or an apple once or twice a week . ( In the UK , however , many people do n't  get that much . ) Getting enough vitamin C for optimum health of your skin really is n't especially hard , either . You can just fine on as little as 100 mg per day if you are sure to get it from natural sources . <p> Some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single serving . All serving sizes in this list are 3-1/2 oz , which is roughly 100 grams . <p> One serving of Tang or other orange-flavored powdered drink provides 2400 mg of vitamin C. <p> One serving of fresh acerola ( West Indian cherry ) provides 1677 mg of vitamin C. There is even more in acerola " leather . " <p> Just one to four ( five if you only eat potatoes ) servings of the foods on this list provides all the vitamin C you need for the health of your skin . There are other conditions that require more vitamin C , but 100 mg per day is enough for acne . <p> Of course , some people just are n't  going to get their vitamin C from fruits and vegetables . If that 's you , then there are two ways you need to get your vitamin C. <p> Take vitamin C with bioflavonoids or Acerola with Vitamin C USP . One capsule or tablet per day is enough . Use skin care products that provide the form of vitamin C known as palmityl ascorbate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close the tube tightly to prevent the oxidation of the palmityl ascorbate by exposure to the air . <p> Great article . How do you explain that the first humans where able to produce between 1 to 20 gr of vit c a day , according to stress levels ? And why do goats , for example , use 13 gram of self produced vit c a day ? Vit c is underrated , that 's just my opinion . <p> Vitamin C is quite fragile , most food looses its content of Vit.C in some conditions , from Wikipedia : Vitamin C chemically decomposes under certain conditions , many of which may occur during the cooking of food . Vitamin C concentrations in various food substances decrease with time in proportion to the temperature they are stored at and cooking can reduce the Vitamin C content of vegetables by around 60% possibly partly due to increased enzymatic destruction as it may be more significant at sub-boiling temperatures . Longer cooking times also add to this effect , as will copper food vessels , which catalyse the decomposition . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaching , where the water-soluble vitamin dissolves into the cooking water , which is later poured away and not consumed . <p> " based on at best a faulty understanding of how the nutrient actually works in the human body . You can just fine on as little as 100 mg per day if you are sure to get it from natural sources . " <p> Faulty understanding ? How is your understanding ? Did you know that the RDA for chimpanzees and other higher primates in zoos is far higher than the pathetic 80mg RDA which is basically enough to avoid acute scurvy but not for optimal health . Yes , humans are able to recycle their C , but its nowhere near the quantity of vitamin C produced by an average 160-lb mammal some 10g / day , although they can produce 10 times that quantity in case of illness , nor is it near the average quantity eaten by other higher primates in the wild ( including our relatively recent ancestors ) . Higher primates lost the ability to produce vitamin C due to a viral mutation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million ya . Ever wonder why animals so rarely exhibit signs of illness ? ( Or at least they used to , until this era of ubiquitous toxic pollution now covering nearly every inch of the planet . ) <p> " faulty understanding " ? ? ? please elaborate , according to studies over 4g of vit C per day has been proven to be a useful tool against cancer , 1000mg is recommended by many health practitioners for general health , did you just pull this 100mg number from your backside ? <p> I watched the video . Suzanne Humphries states the same as this article ; you can get your daily requirement of Vitamin C from your diet . Under different circumstances , such as traveling , for example , or during illness , it makes sense to increase dosage depending on the individual and the situation . What exactly do you mean that our claims about dosage of vit c is so wrong ? Its not really possible to do any research unless you pin point exactly what you think is wrong . <p> Author did clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C , but 100 mg per day is enough for acne .. <p> But the preceding text did feel like it condoned not having &gt;100mg p/day on a more general basis rather than making it as clearer that the mg requirement for acne is considerably less than recommended for other health conditions and bodily functions . Admittedly , if I had n't  read the comments I would have left with the impression that I did n't  need as much vit c for general health . However , the article is n't just about vit c levels and I found the other points very useful . 19923 @qwx879923

Instead of being pushed to the top of the skin by newer skin cells , they have to be carried out of the pore with sebum . When too many skin cells die at the bottom of a pore , it can become clogged . But if not enough skin cells die around a pore , its opening can be narrowed . <p> Vitamin A acts like a key in a lock for certain sequences of DNA that carry the code for proteins that cause skin cells to mature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , is extremely unstable , so it is not available in an active form from food , supplements , skin care creams , or even from retinoid drugs . And skin care creams that you dip out of a jar lose any vitamin A they contain almost as soon as they are opened , due to oxidation from exposure to the air . <p> The best ways to get vitamin A for your skin are : <p> Start drinking cod liver oil for breakfast . You 'll get plenty of the vitamin A your skin needs . Or , if that 's not your thing , <p> Eat lots of carrots and yellow-orange fruits and vegetables . They contain beta-carotene , which your body can convert to vitamin A as needed , unless you are overweight , in which case the beta-carotene tends to remain in your fat cells . In that case , you can eat butter , cream , and liver , which are n't  the greatest for weight control diets , or <p> Take vitamin supplements , up to 5,000 IU a day . Women who are or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only supplements that are in capsule form deliver vitamin A in a form the body can use . <p> Retinyl palmitate in skin creams provides vitamin A for the skin . These products should packaged in a tube , not a jar . <p> Retinoid drugs such as topical tretinoin deliver an even more stimulating form of vitamin A , but should be used only as directed . <h> Vitamin B for Acne <p> The B vitamins are often overlooked in acne care . That 's not necessarily a bad thing . People who live in North America almost never have B-vitamin deficiencies , because they eat so many foods that are fortified with B vitamins at the food manufacturing plants . People in Europe , Australia , and most of the rest of the world do n't  get as many pre-fortified foods , but they do n't  often have deficiency symptoms , either . The time to take a vitamin B supplement is when you take isotretinoin ( Accutane ) . <p> Isotretinoin can interfere with the bodys absorption of folic acid and vitamin B12 . These vitamins are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthesis in red blood cells . Sometimes people who take Accutane develop megaloblastic anemia , which has to be treated by reducing the dose of Accutane and increasing consumption of folic acid and B12 . <p> Taking too much vitamin B12 in a single dose can also make your skin break out . If you are taking Accutane , just to be on the safe side , take a regular complete vitamin B supplement . Make sure your doctor runs blood tests that can give you early warning of anemia , and work with your doctor to get the right dose of the drug . <h> Vitamin C for Acne <p> Vitamin C is one of the most important vitamins for treating acne on Asian skin . Vitamin C prevents the formation of the brown pigments that can mar the skin after blemishes have healed . Vitamin C should be applied to the skin as acne is healing , not afterward . <p> The most useful form of vitamin C for treating acne-prone skin is ascorbyl palmitate . Like all antioxidant vitamins , vitamin C should be applied from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not protect the vitamin from oxidation by the air . If you use vitamin C properly , you will never know it worked . You will just see clear skin . <h> Vitamin D for Acne <p> Vitamin D is the vitamin our skin makes when we get up to 20 minutes of strong sunlight on the face and hands every morning . If you always have your skin protected by sunscreen , or you never go out into the sun , you will need supplemental vitamin D for general health . <p> The best natural supplement for vitamin D is , believe it or not , cod liver oil . Just a teaspoon a day gives you all the vitamin A and vitamin D you need and more . Cod liver oil comes in cherry , lemon , lime , and even chocolate flavors . Otherwise , up to 1,000 IU of vitamin D from supplements is a good idea , especially during the winter . <h> Vitamin E for Acne <p> Vitamin E amplifies the effects of benzoyl peroxide , but you do n't  get the benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You need to use a skin cream that contains vitamin E alternating with your benzoyl peroxide . The vitamin E not only helps the benzoyl peroxide work better , it also prevents darkening of the skin . Adding vitamin E to your treatment routine can be especially helpful if you have Asian or brown skin . Just use benzoyl peroxide in the morning and the vitamin E product in the evening , or vice versa . <p> One of the very best products for providing vitamin to Asian skin is C E Ferulic Acid Combination Treatment by SkinCeauticals . The US $138 per 1 oz/28 g tube price tag may seem expensive , but it is easy to spend far more than $138 on skin lighteners after the fact . Another excellent product that works on all types of skin is Moisture Infusion Serum with CoQ10 by Zia . At US $42.95 for half an ounce , it is less expensive than the SkinCeauticals product , but it is important to store the container in a dark place so the vitamin E will not break down with exposure to light . 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778746 @2978746/ <h> The Facts On Treating Acne With Doryx 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Doryx , or doxycycline , is an antibiotic pill used to treat acne and many other kinds of bacterial infection . It is the acne treatment of choice in some parts of Europe , and it is available worldwide . <h> Summary : <p> Doryx is the trade name for an antibiotic known as doxycycline heclate . <p> Doryx has advantages over other antibiotics . It is absorbed more quickly and more completely , and it can be taken with food . <p> Doryx is effective by itself as some combination treatments for the skin . <p> Doryx is extremely inexpensive . Treatment can cost as little as US $0.10 a day . <p> Doryx , however , is not for everyone . People who have sun-sensitive skin , or who tend to get brown spots on the skin when acne heals , should not use Doryx . <p> Before you take Doryx or any other antibiotic , try a complete acne treatment system with a money-back guarantee such as Exposed Skin Care . <h> What 's Special About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibiotic pills for acne : <p> Doryx is better absorbed into the bloodstream than tetracycline , oxytetracycline , and lymecycline , and equally as well absorbed as minocycline . <p> Food does not interfere with the absorption of Doryx as it does with some other antibiotics . <p> Milk interferes with the absorption of Doryx , but only slightly . Even if you were to take Doryx with a glass of milk , your body would absorb more of the medication than if you took tetracycline with a glass of water . <p> Doryx gets into the bloodstream up to twice as fast and stays in the bloodstream up to three times longer than other antibiotics . <p> Calcium , iron , and magnesium supplements interfere with the bodys absorption of Doryx , as does rose hip tea . <p> If you happen to live in Belgium , Germany , India , the Middle East , or Latin America , Doryx is very inexpensive . Even if you have to pay for it yourself , it only costs about US $10 a month , less than half that much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doryx does not make oral contraceptives less effective . European doctors believe that Doryx and tetracyclines are traced to some instances in which the contraceptive Pill has failed . <p> Unfortunately , Doryx makes the skin sensitive to summer sun . <p> Over a period of 12 weeks , Doryx usually gets rid of about 60% to 65% of blemishes , which is approximately equal to the performance of the best antibiotics and almost as good as Ziana , which combines another antibiotic and- the lotion form of Retin-A . If you do n't  have Asian , brown , or black skin , and you do n't  get freckles , Doryx is often a great choice for fighting acne . If you tend to get any kind of skin discoloration when you go out into the sun , however , Doryx is not a good choice for you , especially if you have Asian skin tones . <h> When Doryx Makes a Difference <p> If you have skin that does not " spot " when it is exposed to sun , then Doryx can make a big difference in certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also getting treatment with a drug called spironolactone . Doryx essentially stops infection so spironolactone can balances hormones and clear up the skin . <p> Doryx and benzoyl peroxide gels often get rid of essentially all acne blemishes in about 12 weeks . However , this combination of treatments makes the skin especially sensitive to sun . Its not a good idea if you have golden , dark brown , or black skin tones . If you have light brown skin , you will definitely need to use SPF 30 sunscreen or higher when you go outdoors , and you will need to take 1,000 IU of vitamin D a day to compensate for lost vitamin D production in your skin . <h> When Doryx Can Go Wrong <p> There are a few users of Doryx who complain that it has left them with acne that is worse than ever before . This almost always happens when users of Doryx suddenly stop the medication without taking any other measures to reduce the number of bacteria on the skin . <p> Especially in Korea and northern Mexico , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doxycycline in Doryx . These bacteria are kept in check by other bacteria in the skin , and even they struggle when Doryx is used every day . If Doryx is stopped suddenly and there is no other antibacterial treatment , these resistant bacteria are left on the skin with no natural competition . They multiply rapidly and cause even worse breakouts than before . <p> The way to prevent this result is to taper off your use of Doryx . If you were taking a tablet every day for months , then take a tablet every other day for one week , and a tablet every three days for the next week . When you stop using Doryx , start using benzoyl peroxide and/or tea tree oil . Always take all the antibiotics you are prescribed , and never , unless your doctor tells you otherwise , stop taking an antibiotic before it has a chance to do all of its work . <p> There are also people who should not use Doryx because they have liver disease . The body eliminates Doryx through the liver . Taking Doryx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yellowing of the skin , headache , blurred vision , dizziness , and confusion . Do n't  take over-the-counter Doryx if you have a history of liver disease , and be sure to tell your doctor if you have had liver disease when you go in for acne treatment . <p> There are a very few people who break out because of the dyes used to color the capsule . Doryx is manufactured with FD and C blue No.1 , FD and C yellow No. 6 , and D and C yellow No. 1 . The medication is mixed with titanium dioxide ( which is usually harmless ) and sodium lauryl sulfate so it will dissolve in the stomach . Sometimes sodium lauryl sulfate will make the skin around the mouth break out . <p> Doryx is used to treat an astonishing range of infections other than acne .

@@98778748 @2978748/ <h> Can You Spray Your Acne Away ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Acne sprays are an easy way to treat back and body acne , but remember not to use them on your face . <p> Acne sprays are marketed as the simple solution for body acne , that is , acne on the shoulders , chest , arms , legs , buttocks , and scalp . There is no need to stretch to apply benzoyl peroxide or antibiotics on those hard to reach places . Just spray an anti-acne product on your skin after you dry off from your bath or shower and blemishes will disappear . <p> Or will they ? Let 's take a look at the most popular acne sprays and what they have to offer . <h> Summary : <p> Acne sprays are a simple way to treat back acne ( bacne ) and body acne , but not all acne sprays work . <p> The most expensive acne sprays are generally the least effective . <p> Salicylic acid loosens blackheads . <p> Green tea extract reduces sebum production . <p> Grapefruit extract fights a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinnamon , and juniper extracts often can cause allergies that are worse than acne . <p> Never use an acne spray on your face , to keep the product out of your eyes . <h> Murad Clarifying Body Spray <p> Retailing for US $37.00 for 4.3 oz/130 ml , Murad Clarifying Body Spray promises a simple method to spray back acne away with a beta-hydroxy acid skin peel . Its a nice idea , but there are a number of problems with the product . It contains the lowest possible mount of salicylic acid that might actually help loosen dead skin and compact skin oils off pores , just 0.5% . On the other hand , it is loaded with alcohol and contains lemon grass and menthol , all of which can dry the skin of your back and tighten pores . Since you inevitably spray unblemished skin along with blemished skin when you use a body spray , you wind up creating new blemishes while treating old ones . <h> Paula 's Choice 2% Beta Hydroxy Acid Liquid <p> Retailing for US $18.95 for 4 oz/120 ml , Paulas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dislodge blackheads while smoothing the surface of the skin . It will also get the red out of existing pimples and prevent new blemishes for forming . Its best applied with fingertips or a cotton swab , but you can simply use it in a spray bottle if you need to treat back acne . <h> Glytone Back Acne Spray <p> Retailing for US $28.95 for 8 oz/240 ml , Glytone Back Acne Spray offers the same strength of salicylic acid as Paulas Choice at a slightly lower cost per use and in a unique upside down pump spray bottle . Unlike the Paulas Choice product , Glytone Back Acne Spray contains a large amount of isopropyl alcohol . This can cause problems if you have recently got a sunburn on your back , but it should not be a problem if you have normal to oily skin . Because of its high alcohol content , do n't  use this product on your face . <h> Bare Escentuals ( Bare Vitamins ) Skin Revver-Upper <p> Retailing for US $21 for 2.3 oz/69 ml , this Bare Escentuals product contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to loosen up blackheads and stop new blemishes from forming . Unfortunately , it also contains St. Johns wort extract , which does nothing to keep the skin from becoming " depressed " but which can greatly increase the risk of sunburn , as well as witch hazel extract , which when used on the skin of the back or chest , can close up the pores the salicylic acid opens . The form of vitamin E used in this formula also can clog pores . <h> Tea Tree Water Toner by LUSH <p> Retailing for US $18.95 for 8.5 oz/255 ml , Tea Tree Water Toner is often advertised as the " solution for teenage acne problems . " It has lot going for it . It contains enough tea tree oil both to fight acne bacteria and to take the red out of pimples . It can also be used to treat staph and strep infections .

Avon Mark Back Up Anti-Acne Treatment Liquid Spray contains the right active ingredient , salicyclic acid , in the right concentration , 2% , at the right pH , 3.0 , to remove dead skin and tightened skin oils around black heads and blemishes on the tough skin of the back or chest . <p> The problem with the product is that contains enough apple and cinnamon fragrance to leave the user smelling like Febreze fabric sheets . If you get itchy when your clothes are laundered with Febreze , you definitely do n't  want to use this product .

However , if you do not apply moisturizer over this " toner " before your skin gets dry , the minerals will just rub off into your clothing and stop working within minutes of application . Some advertisements and reviews suggest that it forms a " skin protective barrier , " but actually the user has to provide this with moisturizer . <p> All of these products except the most expensive ( Murad ) acne spray can do some good for some users .

@@98778751 @2978751/ <h> Two New Combinations of Drugs for Treating Acne 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Finding the right combination of medications to fight acne without prescribing too much can be a difficult process . <p> Its been at least 30 years since doctors prescribed single drugs for treating acne . Acne patients no longer get just a disinfectant like benzoyl peroxide or just an antibiotic like minocycline or just a retinoid drug like Differin . Dermatologists prescribe multiple medications with multiple effects to get rid of as many blemishes as possible . Typically they prescribe an antibiotic plus a retinoid plus benzoyl peroxide . <p> There are increasing suggestions in the medical literature that using three medications for treating acne at the same time is just too much . In particular , adding a retinoid like Accutane , Retin-A , Tazorac , or Differin to benzoyl peroxide and an antibiotic often causes more irritation than it prevents . <p> That 's why its news when new combinations are suggested and they are just duos , not combinations of three or four drugs or more . Here are two of the new acne medication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The brand name drug Ziana , which is also marketed as Biacna ( there is a similar product in a different strength called Veltin ) , is a combination of clindamycin antibiotic and tretinoin gel . The antibiotic kills acne bacteria and the tretinoin gel is intended to stimulate growth of the skin beneath pores to open them for better drainage . Tretinoin gel also peels away dead skin . This combination was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in the USA in 2006 and by HealthCanada for use in Canada in 2010 . Its advantage over using the medications singly is that it combines a relatively low dose of clindamycin with a relatively low concentration of tretinoin topical . <p> In the first study of the combination therapy , over 87% of users showed no complications . It did not cause the skin to flake and peel and it did not cause excessive redness , swelling , or itching in most users . When the combination did cause problems they were usually immediate . About 7% of users got sunburn . About 1% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the clindamycin killed all but antibiotic-resistant bacteria , which then had no competition from other germs and no control from clindamycin . About 1 in 80 users turned out to be allergic to the drug , and about 1 in 100 experienced rawness where they applied the gel . But nearly everyone got some control over blemishes in just one week . <p> What the companies do n't  tell doctors is that most people who use Ziana or Biacna to treat acne need to be sure to use moisturizer . The directions say it is best to use the product at night , but its probably imperative not to use the product during the day if you want to avoid heightened susceptibility to sunburn . <p> Users of Ziana and Biacna who have severe acne are more likely to report that the product smells bad . That may be another reason to be sure to use it at night rather than during the day . <h> Epiduo/Tactuo <p> Epiduo , which is also marketed as Tactuo , is a combination of the kinder , gentler retinoid drug adapalene ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BPO ) . The combination was approved for treating acne by the FDA in the United States in January 2009 and for treating acne in Canada by HealthCanada in May 2011 . This product uses a relatively low 0.1% concentration of adapalene and a relatively low 2.5% concentration of benzoyl peroxide . <p> The problem with benzoyl peroxide has always been that the concentration that is high enough to fight acne is usually also high enough to cause complications . Very few people have any kind of adverse reaction to 2.5% benzoyl peroxide , but this may not be strong enough to keep acne bacteria under control . Very few bacteria can withstand 10% benzoyl peroxide , but most users will experience intolerable dryness , redness , flaking , peeling , swelling , and pain . Even a 5% concentration of benzoyl peroxide is rejected by about 70% of people who use it . <p> The makers of Epiduo found that 98% of acne patients who used the combination of low doses of both drugs were able to continue to use the drug for at least three months . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About 17% of Epiduo users complained of dry skin . But unlike tretinoin , adapalene does not cause sensitivity to sunlight , and none of the users of Epiduo complained of increased susceptibility to sunburn . <p> Some users report immediate and " massive " positive results from using Epiduo . It sometimes even helps erase acne scars . If you have been using antibiotics , however , you may be at risk for a massive breakout when you start using this drug . <p> Neither component of Epiduo is an antibiotic . If you have been using an antibiotic and you suddenly stop , the bacteria kept in check by your antibiotic medication may suddenly multiply and cause pimples all over your face . Its actually more likely that you would experience a " bloom " of staph or strep bacteria than acne bacteria when you stop using antibiotics , but either way the result is a major change to your complexion in a bad way . <p> Other users report that Epiduo temporarily increases the number of bumps on your face .

Stress makes acne worse , and as soon as you look in the mirror or you hear that first snide remark , acne makes stress worse . There is a vicious cycle between stress and acne that keeps the condition flaring up again and again even if you take good care of your skin . And there is a growing body of scientific evidence that acne bacteria take advantage of stress to protect themselves from the immune system . <p> Everyone , whether they have acne or not , has a few acne bacteria in their pores . In small numbers , acne bacteria are actually useful . They keep excessive amounts of sebum from building up . <p> The inflammation that causes pimples is not the fault of acne bacteria . It is well known to dermatological science that the redness , itchiness , and swelling in pimples is actually caused by the immune systems misguided attack on the skin itself rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems , which are so good at getting rid of most kinds of disease-causing bacteria , aim at healthy tissues when they are confronted by acne bacteria ? <p> The answer seems to be a unique relationship among acne inflammation , acne bacteria , and stress . And there are similar processes at work in sagging skin , wrinkled skin , dandruff , seborrhea , and subcutaneous ( under the skin ) weight gain . <h> Stress Hormones In Your Skin <p> When your brain senses stress , the a gland inside the brain known as the hypothalamus releases a substance called corticotrophin releasing hormone ( abbreviated CRH ) . This hormone travels through the bloodstream to the adrenal glands , where it triggers the release of the stress hormone cortisol . This is the hormone that raises your blood sugar levels and your blood pressure and clears your bloodstream of fatty acids by parking them inside your fat cells . <p> When your skin senses stress , it does n't  have to wait on the brain to send a signal to your adrenal glands to release stress hormones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own stresses . <p> How does the skin respond to stress ? When the skin is cut or broken or burned , or infected , or exposed to toxic chemicals , CRH : <p> Stimulates the oil glands to make more sebum . The added skin oil makes the skin more flexible " or wrinkled , depending on how long stimulation goes on . <p> Stimulates the keratinocytes to release inflammatory chemicals . These leukotrienes can attack infectious microorganisms . They can also attack healthy skin cells . <p> Stimulates a process known as ductal hyperkeratosis . This term just refers to thickening the lining of pores so toxins cant come in and blood and body fluids wo n't leak out . <p> Thickening the walls of pores , however , traps oil and bacteria inside . The oil that is trapped in the pore is food for acne bacteria , which multiply rapidly . The skin senses the infection and releases histamine , the same chemical that causes allergic reactions , to attack the bacteria . <p> Acne bacteria , however , have a way of defending themselves . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lining of the pore itself . This gives them a path to escape to the surface of the skin where they may be brushed or washed into another nearby pore that is not affected by stress . <p> The action of breaking down the pore wall that was made thicker by stress generates still more stress . Other pores undergo the process of ductal hyperkeratosis , accumulate acne bacteria and skin oil , and form new pimples . On and on the process goes until : <p> The skin is calmed . This can happen by a lowering of stress in the rest of the body and/or with the help of certain antioxidant minerals , such as selenium . <p> The bacteria are killed . The immune system , however , can react even to dead bacteria , so inflammation continues even after acne bacteria are wiped out by antibiotics or antiseptics , at least for a few days to a few weeks .

( On black skin , zinc oxide leaves a kind of purple cast . ) <p> It only takes a very small amount of zinc to have a large effect on the skin . Skin creams that contain as little as 0.06% zinc have been found to help control pimples . But testing at the Institut de Recherche Pierre Fabre in Toulouse in France has also found that zinc can help control blackheads and whiteheads . <p> Acne bacteria , it turns out , have the capacity to release chemicals that lock onto genes in specialized skin cells known as keratinocytes .

Its really harmful to the skin . <p> Saving money by washing the face with shampoo can cause new acne breakouts . <p> There are budget face washes that really work that cost as little as US $1 . <p> If you can afford as much as $5 for an anti-acne skin wash , you can get a lot more benefits from these non-prescription remedies and treatment . <p> Expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few exceptions to the rule . <p> After every wash with cleanser , wash with water , locking in moisture and minerals from facial waters . <h> The Ideal Face Wash <p> A complete skin care regimen to control acne usually starts with washing . The ideal face wash creates a soft creamy lather in warm water . It rinses off dirt , excess oil , and makeup , leaving the face ready for the next step in daily skin care , whether that is toner , moisturizer , exfoliant , sunblock , or more makeup . It is fragrance-free , and it does not create a foam , film , or tingly sensation on the face . Any product that foams and suds vigorously , like a detergent , is a strict no-no for acne treatment , especially on dry skin . <h> Ivory Is Awful <p> Although home remedies are generally- convenient and popular , some have significant counter productive effects on the skin . The famous Procter &amp; Gamble product Ivory Soap is probably the worlds most frequently used acne face wash ingredient . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertised as " so pure that it floats , " Ivory Soap is depicted with pictures of babies and fair-skinned blondes to imply that it is a good and inexpensive face wash for acne-affected skin . Nothing could be farther from the truth . <p> The alkaline ingredients in Ivory Soap reach into the skin and dissolve the fats and ceramides that lock moisture in and keep the skin soft and flexible . Tight skin constricts pores , locking oil and acne bacteria inside . If you wash your face with Ivory Soap once or twice a day , you almost certainly will have no big pieces of dirt or grime lurking in enlarged pores , but you are likely to have an ongoing problem with whiteheads and blackheads , and the constant irritation will also make pimples redder and more inflamed . <h> Shampoo Is Sinister ( And Bubble Bath Is , Too ) <p> Probably the only thing worse for your skin than Ivory soap is to use shampoo or bubble bath to wash your face . The more bubbles the product makes , the more it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but its never a good idea to use a sudsy face wash . <p> A second problem with shampoo for delicate skin is the sodium lauryl sulfate used in most products . You may see sodium lauryl sulfate spelled " sodium laurilsulfate " or abbreviated as SLS on the label . Sodium lauryl sulfate is a terrific degreaser , especially if you are cleaning industrial machinery . <p> If even a trace of sodium lauryl sulfate is left on the skin for more than an hour , however , the upper layer of living skin cells is irritated and dies . Tiny flakes of skin make the texture of the skin look uneven , and they can clog pores . The scent of sodium lauryl sulfate also causes your nose and tongue to be less sensitive to sweet tastes and their associated odors , so you will crave sugar . <h> Budget Face Washes That Work <p> If you just cant afford even a US $5 or $10 product , what can you safely use to cleanse your skin ? Here are three useful products : <p> Dove <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually available for US $1 a bar or less , and they will not irritate the skin . But they wo n't do anything to repair it , either. - If you can afford to spend a little more , then you can make choices appropriate to your individual skin type that can help you clear up acne a lot faster . <h> If You Can Afford a Little More <p> Acne face wash options abound when your budget expands even to about US $25 a month for skin care . Even on that tiny budget , you can choose the products that are best for your unique skin care needs . <p> If you have oily , sensitive skin , you can also benefit from cleansers that contain salicylic acid or beta-hydroxy acids . " These will break up the sebum that has hardened and clogged pores .

Your product has to be gentle enough not to cause irritation and strong enough to remove makeup . If you are on a budget , then Black Opal Skin Perfecting Blemish Wash , Burts Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser , or Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash will work well . ProActiv Renewing Cleanser or PanOxy soap cost a little more but help heal pimples . <p> If you have rosacea , you will probably get good results from non-irritant formulas such as Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser or Eucerin Redness Relief Soothing Cleanser . <p> If you have oily , tight skin and tend to get age spots or sun spots , try an exfoliant made with glycolic acid right after you cleanser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . Aveeno Positively Radiant Cleansing Pads provide just a " dab " of exfoliant that will help lighten the spots without irritating your skin ( which over the long run would create new brown spots ) . <h> Locking Moisture In Your Skin with Facial Waters <p> If your skin care routine includes a moisturizer , you may want to try an additional step just before applying the moisturizer : Splashing your face with facial waters . ( Applying the facial water after you put down the moisturizer layer wont do you any good . ) <p> Facial waters such as La Roche-Posay Thermal Spring Water are naturally rich in minerals , especially sulfur ( a traditional anti-bacterial treatment ) and selenium ( which " calms " the skin ) .

Some other kinds of acne , however , are not just a cosmetic burden . They can be even be a threat to life itself . <h> Summary : <p> Not everything that looks like acne is actually acne . <p> Nearly everyone has the most common form of acne , acne vulgaris , between the ages of 8 and 18 . <p> People who have dark skin acne get acne later . Dark skin acne is primarily caused by fluctuations in testosterone . <p> Pimples that suddenly appear on the back and shoulders after an infection may be psoriatric acne , also known as guttate psoriasis . <p> Pimples that pop up on the nose and cheeks after changes in temperature are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of acne known as acne fulminans . <p> Shaving the head can cause a kind of acne that leaves permanent scars , especially in young men who have dark brown or black skin . <h> Acne vulgaris <p> Acne vulgaris is the medical term for " common acne .

In people of European descent , it usually first occurs as the adrenal glands mature to the point they can make the a chemical called DHEA , which is turned into the stress hormone cortisol . In people of African descent , it usually first occurs when the body starts making the sex hormone testosterone , which occurs , in different amounts , in both males and females at puberty . In people of Asian , Middle Eastern , and Hispanic descent , common acne is not quite as common .

This process , however , can take 5 to 10 years , which is a long time to be bothered with blemishes . If there is any single principle of skin care that everyone who has acne vulgaris needs to know , it is this : <h> Never try to scrub acne away . <p> The things people who have this the most common of acne types do to get rid of blemishes often make them worse . Vigorous scrubbing with a cloth or a brush ( acne " scrubs " applied to the skin without mechanical force are OK ) , picking at pimples , steaming away pimples , applying ice , or even worse , dry ice to pimples , and products that are too harsh for the skin type can leave permanent blemishes that last long after whiteheads and blackheads have fallen out of pores and pimples have healed . <p> Always use gentle skin care . And if you do n't  know what to use , start with a treatment system like Exposed Skin Care . <h> Nodular and Cystic Acne <p> Nodules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually caused by picking at , probing , needling , mashing , smashing , or lancing pimples . Bacteria get forced into the skin . Pink skin grows over the infection , locking it inside , where it gets bigger and bigger , more embarrassing and more painful . <p> Its a bad idea to open pimples on your own . Its a worse idea to dry to drain your own cysts or lance your own nodules . These kinds of acne do not respond to surface level treatments . Short of surgery , the only thing to be done for them is treatment with Accutane ( isotretinoin ) or Retin-A ( tretinoin ) , which stimulate the skin to grow so fast it literally opens up over these deep skin infections . Treatment with these medications , however , has a side effect : It usually triggers even worse acne vulgaris , requiring even more diligent attention to cleansing , exfoliation , moisturizing , and antiseptics . <h> Psoriatic Acne <p> Psoriatic acne , also known as guttate psoriasis , really is not acne at all . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like whiteheads or blackheads , or by the immune systems attack on acne bacteria , like a pimple . Psoriatic acne is a collection of small , painless , salmon-colored pimples that appear on the back and chest , then the legs and thighs , and sometimes on the face , ears , and scalp . Children often get psoriatic acne around the anus , causing intense itching . <p> This form of acne usually occurs after an infection . The microorganism can be a fungus , such as yeast ( Candida ) or Malassezia ( the fungus that causes seborrheic dermatitis ) or a bacterium , especially Staphylococcus aureus . It can also be caused by HPV , the human papillomavirus , the same family of viruses that causes genital warts . The immune system becomes over-activated after the infection and causes the formation of tiny acne-like pimples . <p> Treatment of psoriatic acne usually involves treatment with steroids or UV-B light " which is not the same as the blue light used to treat common acne . <h> Rosacea <p> Rosacea is a highly reactive condition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheeks and on the nose . These red spots are due to a breakdown of blood vessels in the skin , causing them to leak .

That is why rosacea breaks out after drinking a cup of hot coffee , or coming in to a warm room on a cold day , or after eating spicy foods . Rosacea does not involve acne bacteria , but certain stomach infections and skin mites can increase the risk of the disease .

Treating acne on oily skin , however , requires a different skin care treatment plan and different skin care products .

@@98778761 @2978761/ <h> Seven Simple Tips for Acne Relief 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Simply moisturizing your face is an inexpensive way to help fight acne . <p> Are you struggling to get acne under control ? It is always best to treat acne with a complete skin care system , but if you just do n't  have the cash for the best acne care products , there are simple methods of getting blemishes under control . <h> Summary : <p> Here are seven simple tips for getting acne under control without busting your budget . <p> Fight acne with moisture . Simply moistening your face with water helps , but if you use makeup , start with a layer of moisturizer . <p> Do n't  scrub and rub your skin . Let your cleanser do the work . <p> Do n't  pick or poke or break open your skin to remove a blemish . Loosen the skin with moisturizers or toners and exfoliants so that clogs of sebum simply fall out of pores . <p> Use expensive or irritating acne care products only where you need them most , applied direclty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisture . <p> Its a fallacy that the best way to treat acne is to dry up your skin . The products , like rubbing alcohol , that dry out your skin actually increase oil production in your pores and make acne worse . To fight acne you need to get oil off your skin while keeping moisture in your skin . <p> The very best moisturizer is water , but especially if you wear makeup , it is just not practical to splash water on your face all day . The next best treatment is any alcohol-free moisturizer applied to your face after cleansing and before ( if you use makeup ) putting on foundation . If you have naturally oily skin , you may not need moisturizer , or you may just need it on the sides of your face around your eyes . <h> 2 . Let you skin cleanser do the work of cleansing your skin . <p> You ca n't rub or scrub your acne away . In fact , you can make acne worse by rubbing your skin too hard . When you use an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product into your clean hand and make a lather of thin , small , foamy bubbles . Apply the foam to your face and leave it there for 15 to 30 seconds , then wash off with warm water . It may be tempting to try to get rid of blemishes right away , but you will be more likely to get rid of them food good if you let your cleanser do the work of getting excess oil and grime off your face . <p> Trying to force a blackhead or pimple off your skin usually just leaves a nasty bruise or scratch that can make the blemish even more noticeable . If you need to do a really inexpensive treatment for blackheads , soak a clean cloth in warm water and let it rest on blemished skin . If you do this several times over several days , blackheads may just fall out of your skin , and they will leave smaller pores behind . <p> If you really need to get rid of a pimple , buy 2% benzoyl peroxide gel . Apply it directly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you go to bed . It wo n't get rid of the pimple right away , but it should stop swelling fast and clear up redness in a few days . <h> 4 . Eat your veggies , especially your raw veggies . <p> Researchers do n't  really know the reasons why , but the darker your skin , the less acne you will have to endure if you eat salads and raw vegetables . There is just one kind of raw vegetable you should not load up on , and that 's any kind of seaweed . Sea vegetables are rich in iodine . Like other minerals , iodine is important to health , but consuming too much iodine can make your face break out . <h> 5 . Stay away from crispy snack foods and packaged desserts . <p> Most chips and crisps list a starch as their number one ingredient . Usually soybean oil is number two . Soybean oil is nearly pure omega-6 fat , the kind of fat every cell in your body can use to make inflammatory hormones . Eating crisps and chips can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes more chemicals that cause inflammation , ready to attack the skin to get rid of acne bacteria . <p> In North America , snack cakes and doughnuts are also often made with soybean oil . Even if you eat the vanilla Twinkies instead of the Hersheys chocolate bar , your skin may break out because of excessive omega-6 fat . <h> 6 . Put a light on acne . <p> You do n't  need to go out into the sun to dry out your skin , but a hand-held color lamp can do a lot to help acne . Blue light kills acne bacteria , at least those near the surface of skin pores . Red light helps shrink the sebaceous glands that make oil that can clog pores . There are small , hand-held color lamp units for as little as US $34.95 , although larger heat lamps are also available . <p> The thing to remember about light treatment for acne is that a little is good , but a lot is not better . Many overly enthusiastic purchases of acne light systems use their lamps so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the skin and can clog pores . <h> 7 . Do spot treatments , not face treatments . <p> When you find a good acne lotion , its tempting to coat your face from top to bottom and side to side . Never do that before you test a dot of the product on your arm , leaving it there for several hours , to make sure you are not allergic to any of its ingredients . And when you do find a powerful acne treatment , you can save money and avoid irritation by using it as a spot treatment rather than as a facial treatment . <p> A 10% concentration of benzoyl peroxide , for example , is just too strong for almost anyones skin . This strength of benzoyl peroxide almost always causes drying , itching , redness , and irritation . Applied directly to a pimple , however , it might be exactly what you need to clear up your skin . <p> Similarly , some alpha- and beta-hydroxy acid treatments may be too irritating for treating your entire face , but they might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackheads on a small part of your face . Be sure you examine the sides of your face and your jawline for blemishes , but only use potent acne products where they are most needed . 19923 @qwx879923

Let 's see what these are : <p> Topical therapy <p> This consists of the prescription or over-the-counter creams , face washes etc. , that you apply directly to your face . These typically contain agents such as Salicylic Acid , Retinoids , Sulfones or Azelaic Acid . <p> Antibiotics <p> This line of attack involves targeting the germs causing acne .

As a matter of fact , women on this drug are required to enroll in the federal iPledge program . <p> The AAD Guidelines also did not recommend three more popular treatments to control acne : treatments like laser and chemical peels , alternative treatments like tea-tree and other essential oils and diet changes that advocated cutting down skim milk . 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778764 @2978764/ <h> Microcyn for Acne : Is it the Ultimate Acne Treatment ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a growing concern . Many strains of bacteria that were once responsive to common antibiotics are rapidly becoming resistant . And it just so happens that the root cause of acne is often a bacteria called Propionibacterium acnes and unfortunately it appears to be evolving and becoming resistant to antibiotics . <p> The proportion of resistant strains of these gram-positive bacteria is on the rise . According to a 10-year long study in England , the proportion of resistant P. acnes rose from 34.5% in 1991 to 55.5% in the year 2000 . These bacteria were found to be resistant to many commonly used antibiotics such as erythromycin and clindamycin . This is particularly bad news in light of the fact that these very same antibiotics are used to treat many serious Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MERSA ) infections . <p> Many recent publications in Dermatology Today attest to the fact that antibiotics are one of the first-line therapies to treat acne . The overuse of these antibiotics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confound the problem . As a result , many dermatologists are trying to implement alternative and combination therapies to limit the development of resistance as well as to improve patient outcomes . The combination regimens often involve the use of a topical antibacterial agent and a systemic anti-inflammatory agent to wage a two-way attack on acne . <p> Alternative Approaches <p> Although these established treatments have been used by specialists for a long time , newer strategies look promising . Many dermatological companies are trying to implement different approaches tackling acne . The acne market that is stipulated to reach a mind-boggling $3.02 Billion in 2016 according to the forecast by Research and Markets , would certainly see some players adopting a much different approach . <p> An interesting alternative approach taken by Oculus Innovative Sciences ( OCLS ) , involving products based on Microcyn - technology , is gaining significant traction . The company has developed a number of products to treat skin itching , scarring , inflammation and infection based on the Microcyn - technology . Acne has some hallmarks that are very similar to all these conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future in acne treatment . <p> The Microcyn - technology centers around synthesizing a pH neutral solution , an acid called hypochlorous acid ( HOCl ) . This is a naturally occurring acid that has some very effective antibacterial properties . It is synthesized naturally by the white blood cells ( Neutrophils ) to fight bacteria . <p> What Does the Research Say ? <p> A number of studies on the use of hypochlorous acid have been done . In an 89-patient study , Microcyn performed better than the leading acne treatment benzyl peroxide , although the study failed to show any statistical significance in reducing inflammatory lesions . However , HOCl was found to be very effective in rapidly killing bacteria in the study by targeting non-specific molecules on the bacterial cell wall . HOCL is known to reach a number of biomolecules such as DNA , RNA and fatty acids and is rendered completely neutral once the reaction ends . <p> The lack of a specific target for HOCl and its non-specificity theoretically exempts it from resistance as reported by McKenna back in 1998 . Its fair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to give rise to resistant strains of bacteria have some merit . <p> Approval Status <p> The USFDA has approved one of the products of Oculus for the treatment of atopic dermatitis ( commonly called eczema ) , scar and advanced wound management . The company also manufactures a number of antibacterial drugs including doxycycline monohydrate , which is said to reduce the development of resistant strains . <p> The True Alternative <p> There are many alternatives and medications that are available today and that are being researched to treat acne , but the true alternative is to prevent them from appearing in the first place . With a complete acne care system , you can prevent the outbreak of acne and avoid all the complications that come with it . <p> Making sure that your skin is clean and your pores are not clogged , you can maintain healthy , acne free skin . The right skin treatment serum will also help you to remove any discolorations from old acne scars and unclog the pores .

The way the acne bacterium Propionibacterium acnes causes pimples to break out is not by any direct attack on the skin . Instead , acne bacteria release what are known as chemotactic factors to redirect the immune systems attack on them to neighboring healthy skin cells . Acne bacteria release these factors in pores as a kind of signal to neutrophils from the immune system to attack . But because these chemotactic factors are attached to skin cells , the immune system kills skin instead of bacteria . <p> To cure acne , it is not enough to kill acne bacteria . It is also necessary to stop the effects of chemotactic factors .

Ampicillin continues to be used with success to treat staph and strep infections of the skin . <p> Staph infections cause bumps that look like especially inflamed pimples . These bumps get their start in tiny cracks or cuts in the skin , not in pores . The reason they are often much more painful than acne is that while acne bacteria redirect inflammation generated by the immune system to surrounding skin , staph bacteria can release their own toxins into the skin . <p> Acne infections are mostly limited to the face . Staph infections can break out anywhere on the body , but especially the fingers and toes . They can cause the blood to clot so that they escape the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing tissue destruction . Clear , yellow pus leaking from a sore on the skin is a telltale sign of a staph infection . <p> Strep infections can occur anywhere on the body , but they are most common on the face in adults and on the buttocks in children . Strep infections literally dissolve the skin , but usually only the uppermost layers of the skin . The skin blisters and releases a thin , honey-like fluid that dries hard on the skin . <p> Both staph and strep bacteria can cause a condition called impetigo . When impetigo is caused by staph infection , it usually begins as a sinus infection . Mucus falls on broken skin , and staph bacteria make the skin blister . Because the staph infection goes deep into the skin , these blisters burst very slowly , deflating from the middle to the sides . Staph infections can cause permanent swelling of nearby lymph nodes and also scar the skin . <p> When strep bacteria cause impetigo , they do n't  go as deep into the skin . Blisters burst faster . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lymph nodes . This form of strep , however , is much more contagious . <p> There is a product called Neosporin that treats both kinds of impetigo .

None of these antibiotics has any effect on acne bacteria , but together they are very useful for treating impetigo " unless the user is allergic to one or more of the three components of the treatment . <p> That 's where ampicillin is very useful . People who ca n't use Neosporin usually can use ampicillin . Other antibiotics , especially clindamycin , are needed for treating acne bacteria , but ampicillin treats other disfiguring infections of the skin . <h> Do People Who Have Acne Ever Need Ampicillin ? <p> If you are treating pimples with benzoyl peroxide and they do n't  get better , your doctor may suspect ( or , better , run a culture to test for ) staph or strep infections of the skin .

One downside of ampicillin is that it has to be taken at least four times a day .

This antibiotic can cause rashes , exfoliative ( " peeling " ) dermatitis , and reductions in red and white blood cell counts . It is also know to cause a condition called " hairy tongue , " which is due to a yeast infection of the mouth , and yeast infections in the urinary tract . It can cause inflammation of the mouth and a bruise-like condition known as thrombocytopenic purpura . <p> Using both ampicillin and certain other antibiotics at the same time can cause fatal anaphylactic reactions . Ampicillin must never be combined with demeclocylcine , doxycycline , minacycline , or tetracycline . Three of these four antibiotics are often prescribed for acne . It can also interact with aluminum hydroxide from deodorants , vitamin C , aspirin , estrogen , antidepressants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not something you want to take on your own . There are just too many possibilities for treatment to go horribly wrong . If you use ampicillin , you should use it under a doctors care . <p> You may be able to avoid the need for staph and strep treatments if you do the regular cleansing of your skin required to keep acne in check . One of the best ways to keep acne and other skin problems under control is with a complete treatment system such as Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923

" the advertisement asks . " Do you worry about uneven skin tone , blemishes , and even blackheads ? You are about to learn how to feel better , look better , and get rid of acne for good " in as little as three days ! " It sounds too good to be true . <p> The Chris Gibson ebook Acne-Free in Three Days is both praised and panned , by people who market the book and by people who do n't  . This article wont tell you whether that system works . Acne is a serious condition and were here to help solve this- common skin problem . We do n't  review fantasy literature .

" <p> Blue lights effects are almost instantaneous , and limited . <p> The primary short-term effects of the " wonder drugs " for severe acne are drying , stinging , itching , swelling , and sensitivity to sunlight . <p> Especially if you are using an acne treatment kit , a more reasonable expectation is to get good results in 30 days . <h> Benzoyl Peroxide and Its Alternatives <p> Foaming benzoyl peroxide creams and gels get into pores and kill acne bacteria , in as little as two days . They stop the growth of the irritant microorganisms , but they do not resolve irritation . Your skin has to circulate these chemicals out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tea tree oil kills the bacteria more slowly , but gets the red out fast , typically in four or five days , not three . <p> Benzoyl peroxide is only good for pimples . It does not do anything for preexisting whiteheads or blackheads . Nor will tea tree oil . <h> Facial Waters <p> Nearly all of us give ourselves a splash in the face after cleansing . A facial water is a mineral spring water used to splash the face with naturally occurring minerals . Most mineral waters are rich in magnesium , which reduces the appearance of redness , selenium , which slows down inflammatory processes , and/or sulfur , which fights bacterial infection . A facial water is applied to the face after cleansing and before applying moisturizer or makeup . <p> The effects of facial waters are visible the same day you use them . They may not make a big difference in your skins appearance , but any benefit from them only takes a few minutes and lasts about a day . <h> Blackhead Extraction <p> Many acne sufferers try to use brute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad idea . <p> When someone uses a sterilized needle to " dig around " for a blackhead , usually the blackhead stays in place while the surrounding skin is bruised . Scar tissue may form that seals the blackhead underneath the skin where no cleansing routine will have any effect on it . <p> There is , however , a way to get rid of blackheads in about three days . Apply a warm , moist , clean cloth to the blackhead and hold it in place about 10 minutes , longer if you can . Then pat the skin dry with a clean towel and apply an alpha-hydroxy acid exfoliant , such as DDF Glycolic Oil Control Gel or the slightly pricier Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid 3% Facial Wash . Then wait . Chances are that in a day or two the blackhead will simply have disappeared , as long you do not try to force it out . <h> Blue Light Therapy <p> Certain wavelengths of visible blue light energize a chemical called porphyrin , a component of the protective membrane that surrounds acne bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the membrane breaks down , and the bacterium dies . Of course , we are exposed to low-intensity blue light all the time . This effect is the reason that people with acne used to be advised to " let the sun dry out " their acne . Drying out the skin , however , had nothing to do with the process of killing acne bacteria . The benefit of sun was the destruction of bacteria . <p> Blue light treatment units are used in dermatologist offices , and they are also available for home use . The benefit of blue light is that it does not penetrate the skin deep enough to cause any damage . It only penetrates deep enough to kill the bacteria in pores . Destruction of the acne-causing infection takes minutes , but blue light does nothing to get hard , packed oily sebum out of clogged pores . <h> Chemical Peels <p> Chemical peels use a stronger concentration of the same alpha-hydroxy acids used in exfoliants . The idea behind the use of a peel is to break down the outermost layers of skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin will grow back blemish-free . The drawback to chemical peels " which you should never try to do at home " is that they sting and burn . <p> Glycolic acid ( alpha-hydroxy acid ) peels are primarily useful for removing blackheads and whiteheads , while salicyclic acid ( beta-hydroxy acid ) peels are more useful for treating pimples . During the first week after treatment , the number of zits and pimples is visibly reduced , but the skin looks as if it had been sunburned . <h> Topical Antibiotics <p> Topical antibiotics are great for getting rid of oozing , pus-filled pimples with a yellow cone in the middle , which actually are not acne . They are not as effective for treating pimples , usually taking at least a week to get any visible results , and they will have no effect at all on existing whiteheads or blackheads .

In North America , especially in the United States , people tend to get pre-holiday depression , but all over the Northern Hemisphere many people start to get SAD , or seasonal affective disorder . And making their depression worse , late autumn and early winter are also the time of year acne gets worse . <p> SAD is a kind of depression with fatigue that sets in as the days get shorter , especially just after the switch off daylight savings time . People who have SAD want to sleep more , on average about 2-1/2 hours a night more . They have trouble getting up in the morning . They eat more , especially sugar , and they withdraw from friends and family . <p> The symptoms of SAD are most common in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least sunshine , but people who work in windowless offices or who live in basement apartments can develop the condition any time of year . SAD is consider " major " depression , and can cause symptoms that just as serious as major depression of any other cause . <h> The Biological Basis of SAD <p> Physiologists have determined that people who get SAD have a different kind of brain chemistry with regard to the sleep hormone melatonin . Melatonin is the hormone that makes us sleepy . The brain makes melatonin during sleep provided the eyes do not sense blue light . Even a night light , even when the eyelids are closed , can emit enough blue light to interfere with the production of melatonin for most people . Sufferers of SAD , however , are not as sensitive to dim blue light . <p> People do n't  get SAD unless they sleep in dark rooms " but when they do , their brains make so much melatonin that they feel tired and depressed all day long . The effects of SAD are similar to those caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more severe . Brain scientists have observed that the pineal gland ( which makes melatonin ) can become enlarged due to overactivity during the early winter in people who have SAD . <h> Treating SAD with Blue Light <p> The standard treatment for SAD is blue light to interrupt the production of melatonin . Strong sunlight includes some blue light and helps SAD sufferers wake up in the morning . Of course , most people who have seasonal depression do n't  live in places where there is a lot of sunshine , so they need to use lamps and light boxes . <p> Doctors used to think that more would be better for blue light therapy . Light boxes delivering nearly as much light as standing under a spotlight were designed for depression treatment . Clinical experiments have found , however , that the best intensity of blue light for treating SAD is 550 lux , or about the same intensity as good office lighting . It takes two to three hours exposure to blue light " with eyes open " to help counteract the condition . <h> Treating Acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat the wintertime blues . It is also used to treat acne . Acne bacteria contain a pigment known as a porphyrin that resonates when it is exposed to visible blue light . The pigment vibrates and breaks the cell membrane and the bacterium dies , usually within 48 hours . Blue light rays reach through the skin down to the level of pores , but they do not reach the bloodstream or the oil-producing sebaceous glands where acne bacteria can also reside . Blue light treatment kills enough acne bacteria to reduce the number of blemishes but it will not make acne-prone skin blemish-free . <p> Since blue light treats seasonal affective disorder and blue light treats acne , if you have both the wintertime blues and acne could you treat both conditions at the same time ? The answer is " maybe . " <p> The brain responds to blue light concentrated at a wavelength of 464 nanometers . Acne bacteria respond to blue light concentrated at a wavelength of 415 nanometers . A light box for SAD will not help your acne and a blue light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue light that is the right frequency for treating depression is not at the right frequency for treating acne " unless you use " enhanced " blue light therapy . <h> Enhanced Blue Light Therapy for Seasonal Affective Disorder and Acne <p> Enhanced blue light therapy provides the full range of visible light in sunlight plus an extra dose of blue light in the frequencies that can treat both depression and acne . It does not include the UV rays that can potentially damage the skin . Technically , the intensity of enhanced blue light can not be measured in lux so direct comparisons to other treatment systems are not possible , but the energy emitted by enhanced blue light therapy is about 1/20 as much as the energy used in the " light box " systems used to treat seasonal affective disorder . Enhanced blue light therapy provides enough light to stop depression but no so much light that the system causes glare . <p> The light from enhanced blue light therapy is strong enough to treat both conditions , but it is essential ( 1 ) that eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop depression and ( 2 ) acne-prone skin is exposed to the light to kill acne bacteria . Since enhanced blue light therapy lamps also generate red light , they can help stop excess oil production deeper in the skin at the same time they kill acne bacteria in pores . <p> When you are using blue and/or red light therapy for treating acne , it is important to remember that more is not necessarily better . The inflammation caused by acne , unlike the inflammation caused by impetigo and some other kinds of skin infections , is not generated by the bacteria themselves . It is generated by the immune system . Your objective is just to kill enough acne bacteria that your immune system does not stay on high alert trying to get rid of this usually harmless skin infection . <p> Likewise , with red light therapy , your objective is not to " dry out " the skin . It is only necessary to reduce excessive sebum production in the oil glands of the skin to keep blemishes smaller . But light therapy is just part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There 's just no way you can get rid of acne blemishes without a good daily cleansing routine . You may also benefit from exfoliant skin peels that keep dead skin from accumulating in pores .

Getting rid of blemishes on acne-prone skin almost always takes a combination of treatments , best applied in a systematic way . Some acne solutions , however , offer outstanding results on certain types of skin . Matching your skin type to your acne solution is the key to success . <h> Summary : <p> The best acne solution is not necessarily your only acne solution . Its always best to use a combination of methods to fight acne and keep skin clear . <p> The best solution for baby acne is gentle cleansing of the skin " and cleaning the skin around the mouth promptly with water when baby spits up .

In the weeks just before the baby is born , the mothers body sends extra testosterone to the fetus to help the lungs mature . This is essential for the baby to be able to breathe after he or she is born , but it also causes about 20% of babies to break out in acne , usually about a month after they are born . <p> The excess testosterone that causes acne in infants " wears off " by the time the baby is six months old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin . When pores are irritated , the skin cells in the lining tend to she 'd into the pore and block the flow of oil to the surface of the skin .

Only the mildest soap and warm water are needed to keep baby clean . <p> Do n't  try to use any products that might treat acne in an older child , teen , or adult . It also helps to keep baby clean in general , since dirt and debris anywhere on the babys body quickly finds its way to the babys face . <h> Best Solution for Childhood Acne <p> When children who have not yet reached puberty get acne , the culprit usually is excessive production of a chemical called DHEA , which is the building block for stress hormones .

Many people get their best results from a 5% benzoyl peroxide foam that is applied to the back in the shower . The foam is allowed to work on the skin of the back for 5 minutes before it is rinsed away . Benzoyl peroxide washes usually do n't  work because they do n't  stay on the back long enough to have a healing effect . If you do sweaty work or you work up a sweat when you work out , be sure to take a shower . The sooner you rinse sweat off your back the less likely it is to irritate your skin and trigger an outbreak of back acne . <h> Best Acne Solution for Pimple-Prone Fair Skin <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny pimples on the nose and across the cheeks often have a mild or subclinical case of a form of acne called rosacea . In this form of acne , the problem really is not clogged pores . Its broken blood vessels . The capillaries at the basal layer of the skin tend to break and leak , with red or purple coloration showing through the layers of skin above them . <p> The key to treating this kind of acne is to avoid irritating blood vessels . Avoid anything that heats the skin and expands blood vessels , whether its " warming " acne products containing the ingredient zeolyte , hot coffee , spiced food , or coming in from the cold into an overheated room . Every time you stress the capillaries in the skin , you make them more prone to future outbreaks . You can rebuild the strength of your skin by regular use of products that contain an ingredient called azelaic acid , and by eating weekly servings of blueberries , blackberries , and barley . <h> Best Acne Solution for Blackhead-Prone Oily Skin <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oddly enough , tend to have more blemishes where the skin tends to dry out . Even though pores may make too much oil , drying the skin around the pores stops the drainage of oil and leads to the formation of blackheads . The most problematic areas for blackheads on oily skin usually appear on the sides of the face , on the jawline , and at the hair line . <p> The key to treating blackhead-prone oily skin is to apply small amounts of a water-based or even an oil-in-water moisturizer immediately after cleansing and drying the skin every morning . Its important to avoid products that contain alcohol , because these can cause flaking of the skin that also clogs pores . <h> Best Acne Solution for Premenstrual Acne <p> Many women ask their doctors about different brands of the Pill for controlling premenstrual acne . If you do not want to use the Pill , there is another approach . Acne breaks out as progesterone levels rise and core body temperature rises during the second half of the menstrual cycle .

A cup of coffee in the morning , when body temperatures are lowest , may be OK , but it is not a good idea to sip any kind of hot beverage all day long . <p> It also helps to get at least seven hours of uninterrupted sleep . Core body temperature falls as women sleep , especially if they are able to get to sleep before midnight . Getting about seven hours of sleep is optimal for interrupting the metabolic processes that cause increased production of oil in the skin . 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778772 @2978772/ <h> Acne is Not Always a Fair Game for Men 19922 @qwx879922 <p> As usual , when it comes to the information about the skin and hair , there just are n't  many full articles dedicated to men . Acne is just as prevalent in adolescent males as females . As adults though , more women tend to get acne than men . But that does n't  mean men do n't  suffer the same issues and heartache as women do in regards to this condition . There are sometimes different reasons men get acne and there are different types of treatments for them as well . <p> A Mans Take on Acne Treatment <p> As a man , acne is embarrassing and troublesome . From personal relationships to personal care , acne gets in the way . Men do n't  usually wear makeup to cover blemishes or hide discolorations , so this is n't a mainstream option for them . Scarring caused by adolescent acne is , most times , more severe in males and scarring becomes even more prominent with age . <p> So how can a man cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the time to worry with cleanser and moisturizers , opting for shampoo , body wash and even bar soaps for their facial skin cleansing routines . However , men who shave tend to have smoother , softer and even healthier skin on the chin , cheeks and jawline than even women . That 's because shaving is exfoliating and some men do that daily ! Shaving becomes a whole different ballgame when acne is present though . The list of difference could go on and on but let 's take a look at what can cause acne for men that probably is n't a factor in womens acne . <p> Types of Acne Seen in Men <p> Of course acne requires great hygiene , a healthy diet and a lifestyle of overall healthy choices such as exercise and routine sleep schedule . With all that in place , men still can start to see acne well into there 30s . Why is that ? <p> Hormonal <p> Some people are literally genetically predisposed to acne . In the case of males , this disposition can mean disaster . There 's pretty much nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mild . It might be cystic . No matter what though , it will be . <p> So why is it inevitable that men who carry this in their genes will develop some sort of acne ? The simple answer is , well , because they 're male . The more definitive reason is because men have a hormone called dihydrotestosterone or DHT . When the sebaceous glands that make oil to keep our skin moist and protected come in contact with DHT they overproduce oil . This in turn creates an environment ripe for bacteria , which everyone has on their skin , to reproduce and thus become an infection . These infections are called whiteheads . And there it is , acne . Hormonal acne . <p> Steroid Use <p> Another type of acne that is much more common among men is acne caused by the use of anabolic steroids . These steroids are the kind use for strength and speed . Although mild to moderate acne can be seen in both men and women who use a prescribed systemic steroid for one or more of many ailments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves behind deep scars and discolorations . Metabolic steroids imbalance the hormones , and among the many reversible and irreversible conditions , acne can be treated but often leaves behind the scars forever . <p> Folliculitis : Not Really Acne , but Worth Taking a Look At <p> Folliculitis is not acne , but it creates the same effects as acne . Bacteria gathers in open pores and creates whiteheads and cysts . Unlike acne however , this is totally preventable by just adjusting how close a man is shaving . Too close of a shave will remove too many of the outer layers of the skin and leave pores unprotected . This causes ingrown hairs which also tend to get infected . Treating folliculitis like acne will help in healing but if the close shaving continues , so will the infections of the pores . <p> Skin Care-less <p> Sometimes men get acne because they 're just not taking proper care of their skin and they do n't  even know it . If a males has a condition that causes dead skin cells to block pores or a job that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more attention must be paid to skin care . Not aware that their face wash routine is n't as effective as they think it is or even not being aware of the existence of a whole other skin disorder can lead to the problem of late and long term acne . This too is a simple fix but one has to be aware of the fact that something is wrong before it can be made right . <p> Treatments <p> The best treatments for men with acne is of course to get to the root of the problem first . Once this is established , help isnt far off . From male specific skin care lines and spot treatments to visits to the dermatologist now and then to pick up a prescription for a topical treatment , some acne treatments are quick and easy . <p> On the other hand , those with moderate to severe acne may need to integrate a light therapy in with their skin care products , look into Proactive reviews or see an esthetician for extracting blackheads . Men with deep scarring may consider laser therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one used on your face ! Of course , if buying things from the drugstore or shining light in your face for 20 minutes is n't really his style , there 's always the option of at home remedies as well .

The problem with the technology , however , is that it may be overused . <p> Very few people who have active acne or acne scars respond to lasers used by themselves . They still have to have more traditional treatments , and neither acne nor scars can be removed with just one ( of the usually quite expensive ) treatments . Laser therapies leave stark boundaries between treated and untreated areas of skin , and inflammation caused by laser therapy can leave lasting problems with excessive pigmentation on all but the fairest skin . <p> Of course , a second dermatologist might offer to treat the skin discoloration caused by the first dermatologist will still more laser therapy . <p> Most doctors will try to establish " reasonable expectations " for laser therapy . They will persuade you , correctly , that you may still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatments . They will also try to persuade you , sometimes correctly and sometimes not , that no other treatment will work for you skin care needs . Let 's take a look at the other options you should discuss with your doctor when you are offered laser therapy . <h> Dermabrasion <p> Dermabrasion is a process of wearing away the topmost layer of skin ( about 1 mm or 0.04 inch ) to stimulate new growth . Its a method that is especially applicable to treating raised " box car " or chicken pox scars . Its not a preferred technique for indented or ice pick scars . <p> Doctors like dermabrasion because there are no disposables . After sterilization , they can use the same machine over and over again . Dermabrasion is a well-understood technique that has been around for about 100 years , so the way to get good results is well understood . <p> The downside to dermabrasion is that the doctor or aesthetician still needs to have experience to make the technique work right . You probably do n't  want to be their first patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin particles to turn into an aerosol in the doctors office , and there is a real risk of catching an infection from another patient . Moreover , the doctor may need to treat your skin with an acid peel to make the areas treated with dermabrasion blend in with untreated skin . <p> Microdermabrasion is a slower but far less expensive way to treat acne scars . Many people get good results with microdermabrasion , but it is necessary to use the treatment every day " at home " for months to get a cosmetically acceptable result . <h> Excision <p> Excision , or acne surgery , is a procedure designed to replace an obvious scar with a less obvious scar . The skin is still scarred even after the surgery , but the edges of the scar may be softer or moved to a position on the face that is less obvious . <p> Acne scar surgery requires both art and science . The dermatologist has to be able to visualize how the face will look from different angles , and to have a good idea of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risky , since the inflammation and irritation caused by the surgery will trigger the release of pigments by the skin as it heals . On dark skin , acne surgery can leave not only scars by spotted skin making the scar even more visible . <p> Dermatologists usually say their ideal candidates for surgical removal of acne scars have " realistic expectations , " that is , they will let the doctor off the hook if improvement is not especially noticeable . On the right skin types , however , acne scar excision can sometimes produce dramatic results in smoothing out ice pick scars and scars on natural relaxation lines in the skin . <h> Skin Needling <p> The author of this entry was introduced to skin needling in Japan . Many Japanese aestheticians use a hand held steel dermaroller about the size of a cheese slicer that is studded with tiny ( 0.3 mm ) steel spikes . These spikes are not long enough to draw blood but they are long enough to reach into the top layer of the skin . The penetration of the skin stimulates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer of the skin stronger and firmer beneath acne scars . After several months of using the roller about 3 times a week , the contour of the skin becomes smoother and acne scars begin to fade away . <p> Doctors in the rest of the world often use a similar process called skin needling , which is also known as dry tattooing ( tattooing without ink ) , dermarolling , percutaneous collagen induction , and intradermabrasion . It is probably the safest approach to treating small acne scars on brown , golden , or black skin . That does n't  mean it is without drawbacks . <p> As it is practiced in the United States , skin needling can be a bloody procedure . ( Using a Japanese steel dermaroller does not draw blood . ) It is not something most dermatologists do every day , and since it is a relatively low-revenue procedure , they may give the task to an assistant . <p> There is always a risk of infection , and the procedure can hurt . However , skin needling is inexpensive , requires no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results " better results when it is used with other skin restoration procedures . <h> Comparing Costs of Treatment <p> Laser ablation of acne scars typically requires 3 to 10 visits that cost US $500 to $2000 each , paid in cash . Microdermabrasion may cost as little as $20 a month , and a Japanese dermaroller only requires a single $50 investment ( considerably less if you buy the roller in Japan ) . <p> Most other procedures cost about $200 at the doctors office or at a licensed spa . Do be sure you are putting your skin in well-trained , capable hands . You do n't  want to get any of these procedures at a tattoo parlor ( although licensed tattoo artists may understand the skin treatment issues involved ) or from your hairdresser " unless they have specialized training , licensing , and insurance , as well as a professional relationship with a doctor and a hospital in case unexpected complications arise . <p> Dry Tattoos to Eliminate Acne Scars In the hundreds of entries on this site , you can find articles about skin peels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acne ... 19923 @qwx879923

Its a weight loss pill ! And it will help you get rid of your wrinkles , too , claim the makers of Lipovox . One could almost say that Lipovox sounds too good to be true . But is it ? <h> Summary : <p> The anonymous inventor of Lipovox claims inspiration from watching Oprah . <p> Lipovox claims to fight acne and wrinkles and help users lose weight . <p> Clinical studies of the green tea extract used in Lipovox confirm that it does help people lose weight " usually about an extra pound ( 450 grams ) every other month . <p> Lipovox also contains extracts of 10 healthy foods . <p> These foods are healthy for the skin when eaten as foods , but a capsule can not deliver all the nutrition needed for supporting skin health . <h> Origins on Oprah <p> The story of Lipovox begins with the story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning and then surf all afternoon . It was a great lifestyle except the sun was taking its toll , making skin look as if it were 50 years old instead of belonging to a person in her early 20s . Exposure to strong , tropical sun day after day had already caused wrinkling on top of acne , and there was also a weight problem . <p> One day this surfer ( whose name and gender are never revealed ) came in from the surf and spent an hour watching a segment on Oprah entitled " Ten Foods That Help You Take Off Ten Years in Ten Days . " Oprahs guest told her enormous TV audience that eating barley , acai berries , garlic , cayenne , wheatgrass , edamame ( soybeans ) , flaxseed , alfalfa sprouts , buckwheat , and yogurt with live cultures would enable anyone to take a decade off their appearance " so the Hawaiian youth tried the program . <p> Ten days on the superfoods did not give this surfer the skin of a 12-year-old. - But wrinkles began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and acne disappeared completely . <h> Superfoods Are Expensive <p> It was obvious that Oprah was on to something . The combination of nine antioxidant-rich foods plus Lactobacillus probiotics from yogurt really could reverse the visible signs of aging . The problem with the program was that superfoods are n't  cheap . Its not easy to nibble on macadamia nuts and add real acai berries to your smoothies when you are on a surfers budget . So the originator of Lipovox came up with a different idea . Instead of eating whole foods , take extracts . <p> Its not hard to find an acai or green tea supplement . There are probiotic capsules that deliver all the live bacteria that can be found in the best organic yogurt and more . <p> Its a little more challenging to find a barley or wheatgrass or flaxseed supplement that fits into a capsule . And the inventor of Lipovox also wanted to add the antioxidant power of green tea . After six months of experimenting , the report goes , the originator of the Lipovox found a way to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take once to three times a day . The encapsulated extracts , the company says , give you more bang for the buck and make it possible to support recovery from acne without spending a fortune . <h> Does Lipovox Really Work ? <p> There are a number of things to admire about the way Lipovox runs its business . Customers are not asked to plunk down their credit cards to get autorefills for life . Lipovox sells one bottle of its supplement at a time , and only when the customer asks for it . <p> Lipovox takes returns of its product , although the company claims that only about 2% of customers seek refunds . And the company also offers 17 tips for losing weight and 3 tips for treating acne . <p> There is good reason to believe the product may be helpful for losing weight . It contains both green tea and caffeine . When they are combined with caffeine ( typically a byproduct of making decaffeinated coffee , rather than concentrated caffeine from green tea ) , the polyphenols in green tea usually " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that fat is burned and weight is lost . <p> The average effect of green tea in 15 studies was 1.38 kilos during 12 weeks of use . That means if you take green tea every day for 12 weeks , you lose about 1.4 kilos or 3 pounds extra fat ( not 10 pounds in 10 days ) . Taking too much green tea with caffeine , however , or drinking caffeinated coffee in addition to taking green tea with caffeine , cancels out the effect . <p> So the claim that Lipovox helps with weight loss is partially true but the amount of weight loss is exaggerated . Is there any independent evidence that Lipovox could cure acne ? <p> There 's a little . If you happen to have rosacea , usually manifesting itself as tiny pimples breaking out on the nose and across the cheeks when you experience changes in temperature ( heating the skin ) or during stress , the buckwheat , barley , and acai in the formula can all help strengthen the capillaries in your face .

But its best used in skin creams applied directly to the skin , not eaten or taken as a supplement . <p> Soy isoflavones are also used to lighten the skin , but the are applied directly to the skin rather than taken as a supplement . <h> Should You Use Lipovox for Acne ? <p> There 's nothing in Lipovox that can harm your health or harm your skin , although if you are especially sensitive to caffeine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capsule a day .

However , there is an art to treating- breakouts with soap and water , and some soaps are better than others . <p> Soap and water treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin with soap and water to treat acne , or any other skin problem , is not primarily about removing dirt . Only enlarged , healed pores get clogged with dirt , and dirt is easily removed . <p> Soap and water treatment for acne is primarily about removing excess sebum and bacteria . Cleansing your skin with soap and water is primarily about preventing the accumulation of excess sebum and bacteria that can whisked away from pores that are not yet clogged . Unfortunately , clogged pores ca n't be opened by washing your face , and excessive washing can even dry out and tighten the skin , making them even tighter . <p> Clean washcloths and clean towels are essential for cleansing the skin . No matter which soap you use , you do n't  want to put bacteria back on your face as soon as you rinse them off . Always use a clean washcloth and a clean towel when you wash you face . Of course , you may not want to use a washcloth at all . <p> Washcloths are fine for taking soap off your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap on your face . In particular , its important not to grind soap film into pours by wrapping a washcloth around a bar of soap and rubbing your skin .

Let your soap or other cleanser to the work of getting excess oil and bacteria out of your pores . <p> What kinds of soap work best ? <p> Neem-based soaps are great for soothing allergies and fighting bacterial infections . <p> Soaps with benzoyl peroxide kill bacteria quickly but do n't  " get the red out . " If you overuse them , they can dry out the skin , which starts the acne cycle all over again . The one exception to this rule is fighting back acne , for which benzoyl peroxide is superior to all other cleansers . <p> Soaps with tea tree oil kill bacteria more slowly but remove redness and irritation of pimples . Especially if you have raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the zit , tea tree oil is usually a good choice . <p> Soaps that contain shea butter or glycerin help fight flaking and peeling in dry summer heat or cold winter air . <p> What kinds of soap should be avoided ? <p> Any soap that makes your face feel tingly after you wash it off is tightening your pores and drying out your skin . <p> Any soap that contains alcohol or acetone ( usually a liquid soap ) is definitely to be avoided . <p> When it comes to your skin , unlike your diet , acid is better than alkaline . The bacteria that cause the nastiest skin infections cant survive acidic conditions . And acids in milk , apple cider vinegar , and green tea can tone the skin in ways that keep excess oil from accumulating . <h> Milk , - Apple Cider Vinegar , and Green Tea <p> The legendary Egyptian beauty Cleopatra , some histories of her time record , bathed her skin in tubs of milk to keep it beautiful .

You cant burn your skin with a milk mask . <p> The other important characteristic of lactic acid is that is forms lactones . These become tiny , sticky plastics . They are too small to clog a pore , but they are just large enough to grab on to dead skin . When you rinse off your milk mask or your lactic acid peel , tiny flakes of skin that were clogging pores come off with the treatment . <p> If you do n't  mind running the risk of smelling like a pickle factory , you can always rinse your skin with apple cider vinegar .

Honey contains compounds that fight not just acne bacteria but also the microorganisms that cause boils and cellulitis . There are just two cautionary notes one needs to know about honey for the skin . <p> One thing to know about honey is that the " ooze " from a bacterial infection is what activates it . If you just have whiteheads and blackheads , all putting honey on your face will do is to attract ants , bees , and Yogi the Bear .

A " health-grade " honey like Manuka honey will be safer to use than the honey you 've had in the refrigerator for a year or the honey you buy at the grocery store . <h> Benzoyl Peroxide <p> Most of the fizzing anti-acne products that you can buy without a prescription , as well as many that are prescription-only , contain benzoyl peroxide as the main active ingredient . The rule of thumb for benzoyl peroxide is to use it on tougher skin , like back acne , and to use other products for facial acne . It fights infection " but that 's all it does . Your skin has to heal on its own . <h> Tea Tree Oil <p> The herbal soaps and gels made with Australian tea tree oil , on the other hand , are a little less effective at fighting acne bacteria , taking maybe a day or two longer to kill the infection , but they also help your pimples look better right away . Tea tree oil is a good option if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use both tea tree oil and Manuka honey . They contain the same antibacterial ingredients . <h> Retinol <p> Retinol creams are nothing more than a highly concentrated form of vitamin A. They are great for stimulating " tired " skin , but they are problematic for sensitive skin , especially if you get lots of sun . If you live in Australia or the USA , do n't  even think of using any kind of retinol cream without also using sunblock . <h> Scrubs and Peels <p> There are also many products that take basic natural ingredients , the very same chemicals found in apple cider vinegar and green tea and other treatments that are the best home remedies , and package them in an easy to use form . There is a very simple way to choose peels that work for acne . Look for : <p> Alpha-hydroxy acids ( AHAs ) in a concentration of 8 to 10% . These will list glycolic acid or lactic acid ( or maybe water ) as their first-named ingredient . <p> Beta-hydroxy acids ( BHAs ) in a concentration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercially available beta-hydroxy acid . It may not be at the top of the list of ingredients . <p> Then be sure your product does not contain alcohol , essential oils , fragrances , or perfumes , since these dry out the skin . But there is a much easier way to do your acne care . <h> Exposed Skin Care <p> There are any number of skin care " systems " on the market , and the simple truth is , most ( but not all ) of them work to some degree . But rather than trying lots of products to find one that works just a little better for you " or not " and rather than running to one store for apple cider vinegar and then picking up your alpha-hydroxy acids at another stores and your retinol at a third , why not integrate your acne care with a product like Exposed Skin Care ? <p> Exposed Skin Care provides a three-step solution that does all the things your everyday acne care routine can do , all in one product . The system knocks out acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anti-acne serum you apply to your skin , and the right kind of cleansing cloths to remove just dead skin without damaging healthy pores . With a money-back guarantee , you have nothing to lose , and youll never have to run down to the store to get a facial ingredient and there 's absolutely , positively no risk you 'll wind up smelling like someone kicked over the apple cider vinegar barrel at the pickle factory .

@@98778776 @2978776/ <h> ClearPores Review Will It Really Clear Your Pores ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> The Clear Pores system claims it can heal acne from the inside out in three easy steps . But are the promises made by the Clear Pores systems based on scientific evidence ? <h> Summary : <p> The Clear Pores system claims it fights acne " from the root . " Acne does n't  really have roots , but the internal causes of acne inflammation can be remedied by probiotic treatment . <p> Some of the ingredients in Clear Pores herbal supplement provide " prebiotics " or food for the probiotics , or friendly bacteria , that can train the immune system to respond to bacterial inflammation with a minimum of inflammation . <p> The Clear Pores cleanser is a good choice for acne-prone skin . <p> The Clear Pores protection team is mild enough not to cause irritation , but probably too mild to remove the skin debris that clogs pores . <p> Clear Pores is not a bad choice . <h> Step 1 . Fighting Acne " From the Root " <p> The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acne from the inside out to combat acne " from the root . " Acne , of course , does not grow " roots . " Acne is a condition that begins when the linings of pores shed more skin than the pore can expel , trapping oil and bacteria inside . The combination of cellular debris , acne bacteria , and excess skin oil can clog the pore and cause a whitehead or blackhead . Or the immune system can attack the acne bacteria with inflammation and cause a pimple . <p> The Clear Pores people tell us that acne breakouts are also aggravated by internal factors , such as stress , hormone imbalances , sluggish digestion , and liver dysfunction " and they are absolutely right . But will the Clear Pores herbal formula actually correct the internal imbalances that can manifest as skin problems ? Let 's take a look at the ingredients in their herbal pill . <p> Dandelion root stimulates flow of bile from the liver , increasing frequency of bowel movements . Regular elimination helps maintain colon colonies of Lactobacillus bacteria , which train the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as acne , with less inflammation . <p> Burdock root contains chemicals that interfere with the action of an enzyme known as collagenase , which breaks down collagen under the skin . This can help prevent the spread of the most aggressive forms of acne . <p> Aloe vera is a laxative when taken orally . This complements the action of dandelion root . <p> Echinacea purpurea stimulates T-cells to fight bacteria . In the case of acne , however , it reduces the amount of inflammation the immune system releases to fight the infection , reducing inflammation of the skin . <p> Yellow dock contains compounds that fight staph infections " but these compounds are only released when the herb is treated with alcohol . If the herb is just dried and encapsulated , it does not have this effect . <p> Sarsaparilla is a traditional remedy for skin infections . <p> And most companies add additional herbs to their formulas that have little or no therapeutic benefit just to ensure that they are not violating another companys patent . <p> Will the Clear Pores herbal formula actually help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help balance the metabolic processes that go awry in acne . However , this part of the formula wont work unless you have probiotic bacteria in your system . You can get them by eating yogurt with live cultures ( in the United States , by eating Stonyfield Farms or Activita ) , or by taking a probiotic supplement in addition to the Clear Pores herbal supplement . <h> 2 . Cleansing the Skin to Prevent Future Breakouts <p> The makers of Clear Pores recognize that nobody can rub , scrub , or cleanse acne away . Their cleanser offers gentle ingredients that remove excess oil and makeup from your skin without damaging pores , and does not include ingredients that can harm your skin . <p> The primary ingredients in the Clear Pores cleanser are water , glycerin , and glycerol stearate . Water rinses away dirt , but it also provides moisture to your skin . The skin forms an almost water-tight barrier , but applying any amount of water on your skin allows it to travel through tiny channels in the skin that act as microscopic wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two at a time before the moisture is depleted . <p> Glycerine ( which is also known as glycerol ) prevents sensitive skin from drying out . Its extremely non-toxic , and even safe to be used in making candies and liqueurs ( in small amounts , since it absorbs water and has a mild laxative effect ) . Glycerol stearate is an emulsifier that keeps the glycerine and water mixed . Its also a natural product made by the body itself , which makes it a great way to dissolve sebum in pores . <p> There is nothing in the Clear Pores formula that can dry out your skin or cause additional inflammation . Clear Pores cleanser is a sensible and safe way to cleanse sensitive skin . <h> 3 . Giving the Skin a Healthy Glow <p> The Clear Pores Protection Cream is advertised as protecting the skin from future breakouts and giving it a healthy glow . It contains the right ingredients for this purpose , glycolic acid to strip away clumps of dead skin cells from the linings of pores and the surface of the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease irritation . These ingredients open pores and stimulate the production of collagen under the skin . Healthier capillaries give the skin an attractive glow , makers of the product promise , and freely draining pores are far less likely to become clogged and form blemished skin . <p> The makers of Clear Pores definitely chose the right ingredients for giving skin a healthy glow and keeping pores open . The problem with making an acne product is always choosing the right amounts of glycolic acid and salicylic acid , enough to rejuvenate the skin , but not so much as to burn the skin . The Clear Pores Protection Cream adds potassium hydroxide to buffer the skin-stripping ingredients , probably erring on the side of safety . The pH of this product is higher than other products that have a more immediate effect on the skin . <h> What can you expect if you use Clear Pores products ? <p> If you eat yogurt ( dairy or soy ) with live cultures regularly , or if you take a probiotic supplement , the herbal formula actually will help clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cleanser is great if you have fair , dry skin that tends to form pimples . Its not the best cleanser for darker , oilier skin that tends to form blackheads . <p> The protection cream is exactly right if you have sensitive skin . If you do n't  tend to get redness and irritation when you use skin care products , however , you probably could use a stronger product . <p> Clear Pores wo n't clear up your skin overnight . And if your skin gets worse while you are using the system , your skin problem may not be common acne . Rosacea might actually get worse if you use this system . But Clear Pores is a good choice for people with fair , dry skin who can wait 1 to 3 months for most of their pimples to go away . If you also have a problem with acne scarring , you may get better results by using a system that includes microdermabrasion , such as Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923

This article looks at how natural skin care fits into that equation . <h> Summary : <p> Natural products do n't  always produce the best results in acne care . <p> Some natural products reliably improve acne . <p> Some natural products may or may not improve acne . <p> Some of the natural products most often used in acne skin care almost always irritate the skin and make acne worse . <p> There are at least three approaches to acne skin care . One way to treat acne is to stick to tried and true medically based skin therapy . Doctors know they work because they give you enough of the medication that they are sure they are eradicating acne . The problem is that many of these treatments have severe side effects . <p> Another way to treat acne is to insist on totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acne products for some people are the only way to go .

Sometimes the right treatment may be chemical or an herb " but the goal of treatment is always to achieve lastingly clear skin rather than to prove ones devotion to abstract ideas about therapies . <p> There are lots of examples of side effects caused by acne therapy .

Reliable tea tree oil products include Serious Skin Care Clearz-It Nano Hydra+ On-the-Spot Treatment Acne Medication and Serious Skin Care Clearz-It Acne Medication , both of which use tea tree oil to offset irritation that may be caused by the other active ingredient , benzoyl peroxide . Derma E Tea Tree and E Face and Body Wash contains enough tea tree oil to fight infection but you rinse down the drain almost as soon as you put it on your skin .

Most plant oils are actually useful for cleansing the skin , even if you have oily skin . You could actually cleanse your face with olive oil . An oil-in-water ( mostly water ) cleanser containing no alcohol , however , is optimal for most kinds of skin . <p> There are also some natural products that have demonstrated skin-healing properties that are not necessarily the best choice for acne care . <p> Aloe vera gel soothes irritated skin and encourages skin to heal .

Calendula washes and gels are often a good treatment for acne , but many people are allergic to them . <p> Wintergreen extract contains tannins that literally " tan " the skin . They can make pimples less noticeable , but they are not really a great idea if your primary skin issue is whiteheads , since wintergreen can tighten the skin around small pores and keep them from draining . <p> And there are other natural products that are always a bad idea for acne . <p> Bloodroot ( sanguinaria ) and creosote salves are a bad idea for treating acne , or any other skin problem .

Just because a product costs more does not mean it will make your skin look better . <p> In choosing acne care products , the most important thing to avoid is ingredients that can cause irritation .

No dermatologist is going out of business because patients buy " natural " products . Many otherwise good products are ruined by the addition of herb extracts or essential oils that can dry out the skin , added to the formula so marketers can persuade customers the product is organic . <p> When you are fighting acne , you need products that : <p> Reduce the numbers of acne bacteria , and/or <p> Reduce the accumulation of oil in pores that serve as acne bacterias food , and/or <p> Remove dead skin around tight pores to let excess oil and bacteria flow to the surface so they can be rinsed away . <p> Now let 's take a look at the 5 most frequently purchased acne products that do not accomplish any of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US $15 for a 4 oz ( 120 ml ) bottle , Arbonne Clear Advantage Acne Wash is not cheap , but it is not expensive , either . Unfortunately , this product should be avoided at any price because it contains peppermint . <p> This popular herbal ingredient smells great and makes your face feel tingly . The problem is that the tingly sensation that stays with your skin even after you rinse off the product is an indication it has stripped a microscopic layer of healthy skin " not something that really helps with acne treatment . <p> Arbonne Clear Advantage Acne Wash contains the beta-hydroxy acid salicylic acid , which reduces inflammation and opens up pores on oily skin . This would be a redeeming feature except for one thing . When you rinse off Clear Advantage within seconds of putting it on your face , this extra ingredient does no good . <p> Lard , the kind of lard for which some fattened hog makes the ultimate sacrifice to provide to you , along with beef tallow , are the basic ingredients traditionally used to manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Grapeseed Extract Facial Cleansing Lotion . <p> The truth is , soap made with lye and lard will in fact clean skin . It cleans the skin , and then the top-most layer of your skin goes down the drain with the soap . Aubrey has reformulated this product to use Castille soap made with olive oil rather than lard for sale in most countries , but the blue green algae and grapeseed extract really do n't  make up for the irritation caused by the soap . <h> Aveeno Clear Complexion Cream Cleanser <p> You have probably heard the old saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions . Most Aveeno Clear Complexion products were obviously made with good intentions in mind , but they miss the mark for effectiveness , containing ingredients that damage the skin . <p> Aveeno Clear Complexion Cream Cleanser is a good example .

It wo n't exfoliate or condition the skin and you rinse the salicylic acid right down the drain anyway . <p> This product contains another ingredient , however , that stays on your face even after you rinse . That ingredient is menthyl lactate . It makes the cleanser smell minty and stimulates your face , producing redness all over your face instead of just around your pimples . <h> Avon Clinical Advanced Retexturizing Peel <p> Avon Clinical Advanced Retexturizing Peel used to be a great product for loosening up old , dead skin so it can be rinsed off to open up pores . The Retexturizing Peel consisted of two products . One was a glycolic acid pad applied to the face to exfoliate the skin . The second was a neutralizing pad applied to the skin to keep the glycolic acid from burning the skin .

This product is so safe it never peels the skin , either , so there is no point in using it . However , the alcohol in the formula will dry out the skin so you will need more of the exfoliation this Avon product does not provide . <h> Burts Bees Blemish Products <p> Burts Bees is famous for its budget lip balm . The companys anti-acne products are questionable . The Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser is a gentle product that is safe for all types of skin . It is so gentle that it wont remove makeup , grease , or grime . It claims to contain " natural salicylic acid " made from willow bark , but the salicylic acid it contains is synthetic ( not that synthetic salicylic acid is necessarily a bad thing ) . <p> Burts Bees Natural Acne Solutions Pore Refining Scrub is a little more problematic .

@@98778779 @2978779/ <h> Photodynamic Acne Treatments Reviewed 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Photodynamic therapy is a tool for treating acne that utilizes the interactions of certain wavelengths with acne bacteria and the skin itself . Blue light kills acne bacteria on the skin . Red light heats and shrinks oil-producing sebum glands in the skin . And the use of red and blue in a pulsating , photodynamic acne treatment system minimizes the risk of accidental overheating or burning of the skin . But light treatment is never enough all by itself to get rid of acne for good . <h> Summary : <p> Photodynamic therapy for acne takes advantage of the effects of certain wavelengths of light on bacteria and on the skin . <p> Visible blue light can damage the cell membranes of acne bacteria , killing them in 48 hours or less . <p> Blue light may not reach the bottom of skin pores , but it is never necessary to kill all acne bacteria to clear up a blemish . A few acne bacteria on the skin are actually beneficial , since they consume excess oil . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heals itself after acne bacteria are gone . Teens may see results overnight , while adults may not see results for a week or more . <p> Non-white skin types respond well to a combination of pre-treatment and blue light therapy . <h> How Blue Light Can Treat Acne <p> For centuries , acne sufferers were advised to let the sun " dry out " their acne . It turns out that it is never a good idea to use the sun or anything else to dry out the skin to treat acne , because dry skin is tight skin , and tight skin traps sebum and bacteria in pores . The visible blue light from the sun , however , actually does treat acne by killing acne bacteria . <p> Acne bacteria have chemicals in their protective membranes called porphyrins . One of the poryphorins in the protective barrier of the acne bacterium resonates with visible blue light of wavelengths between 407 and 420 nanometers . These blue pigments in the bacteria respond to the blue light in a photodynamic fashion that causes them heat up and burst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the bacterium , and most acne bacteria , about 99.99% of all acne bacteria , die within 48 hours of exposure . <p> Blue light therapy has a tremendous advantage over antibiotics in that bacteria can not develop genetic resistance to the therapy , and the treatment will not create a resistant strain . Even better , the skin itself is undamaged by these wavelengths of light . UV light is not necessary to kill the bacteria . <p> Killing acne bacteria does not clear up blemishes instantly . Bacteria do not actually cause inflammation in the pore . The immune systems over-reaction to the presence of bacteria is what causes itching , irritation , and , at least in part , hardening of sebum . When the bacteria die , their stimulation of the immune system stops , and the blemish can begin to heal . The skin of teenagers and young adults , however , can begin to heal within 48 hours of blue light treatment . Daily cleansing will keep blemishes away once the skin has cleared . <h> How Red Light Can Heal Acne <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of acne . Another part of the problem is the over-production of sebum . Stopping the over-production of sebum can help the skin keep pores open . <p> The sebaceous glands that make sebum are located beneath the pores . They can not be reached by blue light . They can , however , be reached by red light . When the skin is irradiated with visible red light , sebaceous glands are heated , and shrink . Although it is possible to irritate the skin so much that there is a rebound reaction in which pores actually fill with even more sebum , a mild dose of red light may be just enough to stop the production of new whiteheads and blackheads . <h> Pulsing Blue and Red Light <p> To prevent skin damage by red light treatment , dermatologists have devised treatment devices that deliver pulses of blue and red light . The idea is to heat the lower layers of the skin just enough to reduce oil production without damaging the skin . <h> Just How Good Is Photodynamic Therapy ? <p> It is very rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies comparing photodynamic therapy find that it gets rid of about half of whiteheads and blackheads and about 2/3 of pimples after a month of weekly treatments . Benzoyl peroxide , by comparison , is usually about 50% as successful . But should everyone use light therapy no matter what their skin type ? <p> Here are some important considerations : <p> If you cant take Accutane or Retin-A because you are a woman who wants to become pregnant or who is pregnant , consider blue light therapy first . Blue light therapy is safe for both mother and unborn child . <p> Never use photodynamic therapy at home when you are sleepy or when you are taking a nap . There is a possibility of burning your skin , and the blue light from the therapy unit will keep your brain from making its own sleep-inducing melatonin , at least while the light is on . <p> Blue light therapy is probably the first antibacterial treatment you should try if you have an African skin type . It will not cause irritation or pigmentation that most other antibacterial skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only gets rid of acne bacteria . If you are using acne care products that contain harsh detergents or stinging alcohol , blue light therapy wont do anything to correct their effects on your skin . <p> Blue light therapy tends to work best on Asian skin types if they are pretreated with another bacteria-fighting treatment . For instance , if you have Asian skin , you might pre-treat your skin with the mildest available benzoyl peroxide lotion , absolutely nothing stronger than 2.5% . Then , if there is no irritation to your skin , do a blue light treatment the next day , making sure you have not used benzoyl peroxide for at least 24 hours before you do the blue light treatment . <p> Red light therapy tends to work best on dark brown and black skin , but it is important not to overheat the skin . Overheating brown and black skin can trigger a reaction that increases the production of pigment in the skin . If your red light therapy feels hot , stop it . It has already done enough work . People who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy . <p> Your dermatologist may recommend a pre-treatment with 5-aminolevulenic acid ( one of many compounds known by the abbreviation ALA ) before using blue light . This is especially useful for persons who have Korean skin types . <p> If you use a home blue light , red light , combination light , or pulsating light system , keep in mind that more is not better . You wo n't get better results by holding your face close to the lamp .

Claiming it works at the " cellular level , " Acneticin advises potential customers that it does not just scratch the surface to get rid of acne , but eradicates redness , blotchiness , blackheads , pustules , persistent acne , and zits by going " to the root of the problem to root it out at the source " ( with exclamation points added ) . <p> Acneticin claims that acne starts far below the surface of the skin , and that acne is only a symptom of the underlying problem . The body , Acneticin tells us , manifests acne as a symptom because it is out of balance . Cells are breaking down too fast and the toxins they release build up in the epidermis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin care product acne sufferers will ever need , resolving redness and blemishes in just 72 hours or less . <p> The supposed mechanism of cure in Acneticin is " hormonal balancing . " <p> Some of the ingredients in Acneticin have no benefits for the skin , and others do " but are n't  included in adequate amounts . <p> If you really want to take a nutritional approach to treating acne , try supplementing with zinc or or omega-3 essential fatty acids . You may not see any results at all for up to two months , and then there is usually dramatic improvement in the third month . <p> In addition to a nutritional approach , it is also a good idea to use a system of skin cleansers and moisturizers that work together to clear your skin and keep it clear , such as Exposed Skin Care . <h> Taking Toxicity Literally <p> The theory supposedly underlying the use of Acneticin echoes the explanation of acne found in Traditional Chinese Medicine . The ancient sages of Chinese herbal medicine explained the origins of acne metaphorically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This corresponds to a modern understanding of acne as caused by stress hormones in the skin . <p> Or , in Traditional Chinese Medicine , blackheads and whiteheads might be a sign of accumulated " phlegm . " In Chinese medicine , phlegm can be mucus , but it can be a sticky " residue " of emotional energies . Blackheads and whiteheads occur in the skin after sebum accumulates in pores , and surges of sebum occur after surges in sex hormones . <p> Traditional Chinese Medicine also can occur after " toxic heat . " This roughly corresponds to rosacea . Toxic heat causes sudden breakouts of tiny pimples . Rosacea breaks out in tiny pimples after sudden heating of the skin . <p> Over thousands of years , Traditional Chinese Medicine developed a system of relating changes in the energy to the body to changes in the energy of herbs . Certain combinations of herbs were explained in the same terms as changes in the body . The whole system works . <p> Acneticin is based on a similar kind of thinking , but without thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hodge-podge of " detoxifying " ingredients that do n't  directly relate to healing of the skin . Unfortunately , they do n't  indirectly relate to healing of the skin , either . <h> What 's In Acneticin ? <p> Acneticin is a blend of herbs and nutritional supplements in small amounts . The " active ingredients " include : <p> Dandelion . The makers of Acneticin note that dandelion contains more calcium and iron than spinach and that its a good source of vitamins A and C. This is true " but you cant possibly get more than 225 mg of calcium , iron , and vitamins from the 225 mg of dandelion in each serving . Its true that dandelion stimulates the production of bile by the liver and that bile stimulates bowel movement , but to do this you need to eat a dandelion salad , not take a tiny amount of dandelion in a capsule . <p> Green tea . Acneticin claims that green tea will " help balance your hormonal imbalance " that causes unsightly skin blemishes . Actually , green tea does reduce the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it is applied directly to the skin . <p> Mangosteen . Acneticin labels mangosteen as a " miracle fruit " that can kill acne and staph bacteria . This statement is based on actual clinical research , sort of . A research team at Mahidol University in Thailand found that a dichloromethane extract of mangosteen can kills these kinds of acne bacteria in a test tube . No research has ever found that mangosteen that is not treated with dichloromethane can kill bacteria in the human body , or that the extract would not be broken down when it went through the stomach . <p> Noni . Acneticin claims that biological research proves that noni fruit can accelerate the healing of an acne pustule . Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences confirm that noni fruit contains a compound called LONG ... that can kill various kinds of bacteria , but not acne bacteria . <p> Vitamin A. Acneticins advertisers are absolutely correct that vitamin A is key to skin health . The kind of vitamin A that has an effect on acne is approximately 5,000 times stronger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Vitamin B5 , also known as pantothenic acid ( and used in nutritional formulas in the form of calcium pentothenate ) . Acneticin is correct in stating that vitamin B5 is used in treating acne , but it is used in doses of 10,000 mg or more , not the 500 mg used in the formula . <p> Biotin . Acneticin identifies the B vitamin biotin as an important " metabolite " of fats . It is n't . Its involved in energy creation in cells and accelerates fat burning , but it is not produced from fats . Acneticin is at least right that biotin is needed in a formula that also contains alpha-lipoic acid , since they are co-factors . <p> Alpha-lipoic acid . The usual application of alpha-lipoic acid is stimulating the flow of fluids in the skin so outward-bulging scars are less noticeable . The 50 mg dosage in Acneticin is n't enough to have this effect . <p> There are similar issues with all the other ingredients in Acneticin . They may sound good , but they just are not useful for balancing any kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you use Acneticin , it is just an accident . <h> If Acneticin Does n't  Heal Acne from the Inside Out , What Does ? <p> If you really want to heal acne with nutritional supplements , there are far better products you can try . Here are some suggestions that may really help you . <p> Zinc with methionine . Researchers at the Maulana Azad Medical College in India have found that just taking 50 mg of zinc bound to the amino acid methionine every day resolved 80% to 100% of blackheads and pimples in volunteers who took the supplement . There 's just one catch to this plan . Zinc supplements have almost no effect at all for the first 8 weeks . Then acne dramatically improves in the ninth to twelfth weeks . <p> Omega-3 fatty acids . The Lasky Skin Clinic in Los Angeles reports five cases of acne that cleared up substantially after use of omega-3 essential fatty acids , the kind of " good fat " you get from flaxseed oil or fish oil . Even better , the omega-3 essential fatty acids also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat , " which is basically any kind of industrially processed cooking oil or snack foods fried in it . Butter , bacon , and even lard do n't  have a detrimental effect on acne ( although there are other reasons you may not want to eat them ) . <p> Probiotics . Lactobacillus in the colon " trains " the immune system to respond to acne bacteria with less inflammation . You can take probiotic supplements or eat yogurt that contains live cultures . Actually , even dead Lactobacillus bacteria have some value in controlling inflammation in the skin , but you get better results from live cultures . <p> And if you also want to treat acne with effective cleansers and blackhead removers , consider an acne treatment system such as Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923

Lerosett Organic Clear Skin Face Wash is made primarily from aloe vera gel . Lerosett Organic Clear Skin Moisturizer is made primarily from aloe vera gel . Lerosett Organic Clear Skin Toner is also made primarily from aloe vera gel . These products also contain a variety of botanical extracts to complement their effects on the skin to pull " out the bad stuff and leave the good .

The bulk of the scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflammation that comes as a side effect of acne treatment , but that has no real use in acne care . <p> You might benefit from using aloe vera gel if : <p> You are experiencing redness and inflammation after recent microdermabrasion treatment . <p> You have been using benzoyl peroxide to treat pimples and you have a problem with dry , itchy , or peeling skin . <p> You tend to develop brown spots after acne treatment ( a special problem on Asian skin ) and you need a secondary treatment to prevent excessive irritation from acne treatments . <p> You have an acne-like staph or strep infection of the skin . <p> Dry skin makes indented acne scars look even more prominent . <p> You forgot to use sunscreen or sun block and you got a bad burn when you went out into the sun . <p> You tend to get pimple-like infections of the skin when you use a hot tub or you visit a water park . <p> Aloe vera gel , however , has no direct effect on acne .

Some of them are helpful in treating acne-prone skin , while others are not . Let 's take a look at herbs and botanicals commonly used by Lerosett . Many of the botanicals used by Lerosett are listed by their Latin botanical names ( many of them misspelled ) . <p> Arnica is used homeopathic doses ( less than 0.0000001% ) to treat sore muscles and bruises .

If you live in Sweden , this wont be a problem . If you use St. Johns wort extract on your skin in Florida , it almost certainly will . <h> If Lerosett Isnt What It Claims to Be , Could It Work Anyway ? <p> Lerosett products clearly are not what their advertising claim . Their major ingredient is a botanical that has no effect on acne , and they use a form of that botanical that has the smallest concentration of healing ingredients .

If you have mild to moderate common acne , you are more likely to get good results with Exposed Skin Care . <p> Hello , I stumbled upon your website about acne . All I can say about Lerosett is that I 've struggled with acne since puberty , taken lots of antibiotics over the years , have cystic type , even did accutane . Nothing has ever helped until I tried Lerosett . Its like a clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , then rinse it off in the morning and apply sunscreen . My skin has never looked better , and no more clogged pores , blackheads , greasy skin . I am very happy with it . It took about a month to change my skin , but I was so impressed with how great of a job it did pulling the crud out of my skin . Now I will get 1 or 2 pimples a month , and they never fully develop or turn into the cyst , they will go away if I just keep using the clay . thank you , J <p> J , Thank you for leaving your comment . I have been looking for alternatives for my daughter to use other than the standard antibiotics and acutane for cystic acne . I have seen other good reviews on 2 other websites . I almost decided that Lerosett may not be worth it until I saw your response . <p> Seconding Js comment . This incomplete review did not address or even mention the original and most important Lerosett product the clay ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin when I was younger . Now , at the age of 49 , I no longer have acne issues , but I still keep a tube of Lerosett around to spot treat the occasional breakout and calm the mild rosacea that has developed in recent years . The clay mask is amazing . <p> I disagree with this article , I have used Lerosett products for me and my teenage son . Both of us cleared up.The moisturizer did n't  leave any kind of residue , which I was surprised about . I only wish the product was something I could buy in stores . Not something I could say about proactive or any other product that I have tried . <p> I 'm on my thirties and I used Lerosset ( the clay mask ) when I was 16-17 yrs old and it really helped to clear my acne .

I used the cleanser , moisturizing matte lotion , clay spot treatment as well as the clearpoint supplements . I have inflammatory and cystic acne on my cheeks and jawline . These products made my acne worse over the 4 months with bigger and painful cysts . I would not recommend this product for severe acne it may work for people with less severe acne .

Americans can and do sue each other for good reasons , bad reasons , and no reason at all . You do n't  have to sue anyone you do n't  want to , but knowing your rights in the doctors office can prevent situations where you might feel the need to assert your legal rights , and might keep you from getting sued yourself . <h> Privacy and Acne Treatment <p> Many people who have acne spend a great deal of effort successfully concealing their condition . They may be very skillful in their use of cosmetics , or they may have had dermabrasion , skin peels , dry tattooing , laser resurfacing , or surgery . ( You can read about all of these methods on this site . ) The last thing they want is for their dermatologists to hold them up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is exactly what can happen to many acne care patients .

Neither is your doctors staff . Despite the legal protections of doctor-patient privilege in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia , from time to time doctors use before and after photos of their patients in office brochures , on office websites , and in social media such as Facebook and Twitter . The first time your physician takes a photo of your face , ask about office privacy policy . And do n't  sign any waivers of patient privacy you have not read . <h> Social Media and Your Doctor-Patient Relationship <p> Federal privacy laws , more specifically HIPAA ( the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ) , place stringent limits on your doctors ability to disclose even that you are his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not " friend " you on Facebook , because you would then have access to the doctors other connections on Facebook . <p> If your doctor requests a Facebook friend connection , and you only connection is as a patient , you should decline , sending your doctor a brief explanation . It is all too easy for a careless comment on Facebook by your doctor to let all your Facebook friends know what kind of treatment you are getting . Connect to your acne doctor on Facebook through the doctors Fan Page , if at all . <h> Emailing Your Acne Doctor <p> Officials of the US Federal Communication Commission are quoted as saying that if you send your doctor an email , you are giving your doctor implied consent to respond to your email without encrypting it . This means that if you , for instance , emailed your doctor a question about whether your husband need to wear a condom while you were changing your IUD so you could take Accutane , the doctor is not liable for any email security problems that may arise when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treatment <p> A reality of acne scar treatment in the USA is that it is very expensive and there is no public program that pays for it . Unless you have a very high-end ( and probably extremely expensive ) private health insurance policy , you will probably have to pay for office visits , medications , lab tests , and skin treatment procedures out of your own pocket . <p> That does n't  mean that your doctor wont be able to get initial approval to start your treatment from your insurance company . What often happens is that the insurer tells the doctor that your treatment will be covered so you might only be asked , say , for a $35 copay on a $500 to $1000 visit . Then several months later , after you have had three or four $500 to $1000 visits to the skin care doctor , your health insurance company rescinds the authorization and the doctor tries to collect from you . <p> The only likely exception to this rule occurs when an acne scar interferes with some function , such as some scars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for treatment of scars caused by acne conglobata , but not for scars caused by acne keloidalis nuchae . <p> Active acne treatment , that is , treating pimples , blackheads , and whiteheads , is also very expensive in the United States , but more health insurance policies will pay for it . If you had acne acne before you got your health insurance and you did not disclose the condition on your application , however , the insurance company may deny payments or even cancel your coverage . Health insurance you get through the new federally funded health insurance risk pools , however , covers pre-existing conditions . <h> Be Careful What You Post About Your Doctor Online <p> Doctors understandably get upset when they are criticized online . If you make statements that are critical of your doctor , harm your doctors business , and you ca n't back up , you may find yourself defending a suit for slander . <p> Different states have different rules about posting information about doctors .

In the rest of the United States , however , the Internet is considered to be " perpetual , " that is , you could be sued at any time for the rest of your life . <p> Do n't  make your life complicated . If your doctor does n't  do a good job , just move on .

The restrictions on the amount you are allowed to include in your itemized deductions for medical care is a lot less than it once was , but since 2010 Americans have been allowed to deduct the cost of some acne care products . <h> Itemized Deductions on Your Federal Tax Return <p> Americans compute their taxable income by adding up wages , taxable interest and dividends , capital gains , and then subtracting deductions to gross income such as contributions to retirement and health savings accounts and alimony .

Taking a deduction for treating your dogs acne on your personal income tax return might fall into this category . <p> Even though tax preparers are n't  cheap , they at least have to be registered with the IRS , and having someone else prepare your return for you minimizes the chances you will be assessed a penalty for negligence or fraud .

You cant deduct the whole amount of the expense if you worked out a payment plan with your doctor unless you paid the whole amount in the tax year . And you cant deduct amounts your insurance company paid at all . Deducting what your insurance company paid on your own tax return will likely get you zinged with a negligence penalty . <p> The IRS rules allow you to deduct amounts you pay to doctors , nurse practitioners , and other licensed health practitioners .

In addition , there is no research data to back up many of- the claims made in the book . <h> Based on Dubious Theories <p> The problem with the Acne No More program is that it is based on quack medicine . Your liver , kidneys , and colon do n't  accumulate toxins , and you ca n't fine tune them by " flushes . " Even though some minerals and vitamins can help to make acne better , there is no research that proves that making dietary changes will help to improve acne , apart from maybe glycemic carbohydrates and dairy products . Therefore , it seems absurd that someone would recommend making drastic dietary changes so as to cleanse your body and reduce acne. - If you really want to bring your inner organs into optimal function : <p> Eat a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compounds in food and from the environment with a variety of enzymes . Eating a variety of foods " not just eating raw foods " minimizes the amount of any one enzyme your liver has to use for healthy function . <p> Your kidneys flush just fine without your drinking extra water . If you want to make kidney function easier , be sure you get plenty of calcium in your diet , since the kidneys use calcium to alkalize the urine . <p> Your colon does not accumulate toxins . But when you accumulate ordinary , non-toxic waste in your colon , stretch sensors in the lining of the intestines send a constant signal to the pancreas to keep secreting insulin . This increases the storage of fat around your belly and increases inflammation in your skin . The problem is not that your intestines are full of toxins , its just that they are full . <p> The second pillar of Acne No More is getting rid of yeast overgrowth . That would be fine if acne were caused by yeast , but its not . Acne can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . If you increase probiotics in your colon , however , your immune system learns to tolerate low levels of harmless bacteria , and releases less inflammation in your skin . <p> The third pillar of Acne No More is fasting to reduce levels of toxins . Fasting probably wo n't hurt you ( unless you have a glycogen storage disease or you take a constant dosage of insulin ) . The main result of fasting is that you will lose weight . Losing too much weight within a short period of time can affect your health . When you fast , your body does not begin to break down muscle tissue for proteins until you have gone without eating anything at all for 48 hours , and even the tiny amount of protein you get on a juice fast will probably provide your body with all the amino acids it needs . ( Your body also digests about 100 grams of protein from your saliva every day . ) But there is no benefit from fasting unless you happen to have a bad reaction to a food you eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really controlling an allergy , not acne . <p> Juice cleansing does not really cleanse the body as most people think . It just serves as a placebo. - The main reason why it may seem like fasting helps acne to get better is because severe restriction of calories in the body results in the body secreting less oil therefore , the bacteria on the skin wont grow , so acne breakouts will decrease . But it is temporary and will not last once you return to a normal diet . <p> The fourth pillar of Acne No More offers tips for stress control and better sleep . Emotional stress really can make your skin break out . The more sleep you get , the more time your brain has to balance the hormones that can trigger inflammation in your skin. - This may be only part of the book that is certainly true since stress can cause acne to flare up . <p> The fifth pillar of Acne No More is the use of home remedies for keeping your skin clear . If you simply do n't  have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be very useful for treating acne . But there are no home remedies that can smooth out the matte of your skin or that can conceal blemishes that Acne No More has not yet healed . <h> The Lure of Natural Solution <p> One of the reasons why this book has gained popularity is the fact that most people are now looking for natural solutions to their skin care problems . Never mind the fact that Salicylic acid , Benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics have been proven to be quite effective in dealing with acne . But even for individuals who prefer natural solutions to their problems , it has been proven that vitamin A is quite effective in fighting against acne . However , it is interesting to note that the book is so focused on internal cleansing of the body that it does not allow for alternative treatments , such as topical application of this vitamin on the skin as a cure for acne . <p> Refusal to acknowledge valid research adds to doubt of credibility . <p> Acne develops due to the bacteria on the skin becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The oil causes the skin pores to get clogged , which creates an ideal environment for the bacteria to thrive . Surprisingly , the author of this book does not support the idea of reducing bacteria on the skin , so as to prevent acne from getting worse . This is contrary to a lot of research , which has shown that getting rid of bacteria will help to minimize chances of acne flare ups . <p> Other dubious claims made by the author in the book include : <p> 95 percent of people who treat acne normally end up worse than they were before <p> Acne medication , creams and lotions do not work , including Accutane and antibiotics . Instead , they can cause your condition to become worse . <p> Other people who have used the treatment methods suggested in the book got results within a few weeks and the results lasted forever . <p> The reason why these claims are dubious is because : <p> There is no research that shows that 95 percent of people affected by acne end up worse than they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that acne treatments work and even antibiotics , which do n't  completely eliminate acne at least help to significantly reduce it . <p> It is not possible to clear acne within a short period of time since it takes weeks for acne to develop and eventually breakout on the skin . And its not possible to stop its growth once it has started . <h> Can Anyone Benefit From Acne No More ? <p> The fundamental idea of Acne No More is that acne is caused by toxins and toxins come from food . That idea is just plain wrong . If you really want to clear up acne-prone skin , you do n't  need to get rid of " toxins " in your digestive tract or to " tonify " your inner organs . You need to minimize the accumulation of excess skin oil , dead skin cells , and acne bacteria in your pores and to compensate for blemishes while you heal them . <p> You actually spend less when you buy a complete skin care system like Exposed Skin Care than when you buy all the products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes with a one-year money-back guarantee " something the supermarket wont give you for the $500 worth of raw foods you will need to buy for Acne No More. - Since there are no research studies to back up the bulk- of the claims in the book , it would be irresponsible to recommend this book to anyone as a way to cure acne. 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778787 @2978787/ <h> Location , Location , Location and Light Therapy for Acne 19922 @qwx879922 <p> There is a well-known saying about the value of real estate that the three most important things about a piece of property are location , location , and location . It turns out that the same thing can be said about the effectiveness of blue and red light therapy for acne . <p> Blue light therapy for acne has been around for about 20 years . Its a very safe and moderate effective technique that uses a lamp that generates blue visible light . It does not have to generate wavelengths of light that could damage the skin or eyes . Blue light resonates with blue pigments in the outer cell membranes of acne bacteria . These pigments heat and burst the membrane , and the bacteria are unable to reproduce . They die and the skin has a chance to heal . <p> Red light therapy for acne has been around for a little less than 20 years . Its also a very safe and very effective technique that uses visible light , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , red light therapy does not depend on wavelengths that could damage the skin or eyes or overheat the skin . Red light reaches deeper into the skin and shrinks the oil-producing glands at the base of acne-prone pores . It does not eliminate the production of oil completely " this actually would not be a good thing , since sebum keeps the skin lubricated " but it does reduce the production of oil so that pores stay open . <p> Lamps that produce a combination of blue and red light are available for US $50 to $200 . They can be worth many times their initial cost in savings on acne medication . But it turns out that different parts of the body need different amounts of exposure for best results . <h> Taking a Cue from Pre-Cancer Treatment <p> Blue light therapy is not just used for treating acne . It is also used for treating problems that can be triggered by using the wrong products for lightening the skin . Sometimes black and blue blotches appear on Asian skin after attempts to use hydroquinone as a skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) and to treat a kind of pre-cancerous condition of the skin called actinic keratosis . A dermatologist named Amy Forman Taub , who teaches medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago , has noted very large differences in results when using different amounts of blue light on different areas of skin . <p> Dr. Taub always uses a pre-treatment called 5-aminolevulinic acid before she treats pre-cancerous skin . This pre-treatment can be used for pre-treatment of acne , but this should be under medical supervision . Different parts of the body need different amounts of light therapy . <p> Face lesions are pre-treated for 60 to 90 minutes and then exposed to blue light for 16 minutes , with the skin 2 to 4 inches ( 5 to 10 cm ) away from the blue light lamp . Dr. Taub has her patients use zinc oxide sunscreen ( the kind of sunblock life guards use that makes their noses white ) for two weeks and to be sure to use moisturizers for at least a month . If another treatment is necessary later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue light , just 1 minute . <p> Scalp lesions are pre-treated for 60 to 90 minutes and then exposed to blue light for 20 minutes , again with the skin 2 to 4 inches ( 5 to 10 cm ) away from the lamp . If there needs to be a second treatment , Dr. Taub uses a full 20 minutes of blue light . <p> Lesions elsewhere on the body are pre-treated for 2 hours and then exposed to blue light for 20 minutes , with the skin 2 to 4 inches ( 5 to 10 cm ) away from the lamp . The arms , legs , and chest respond better to pulsed blue light . <p> Do these recommendations translate into acne therapy ? <p> There is no firm scientific evidence , but its probably the case that you need less time under a blue light lamp when you are treating face acne and more time under a blue light lamp when you are treating scalp or body acne . Holding the lamp close to the face ( protecting your eyes with goggles to avoid glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel actual burning , may make a big difference in the quality of- your results . <p> What about pre-treatments for blue light therapy therapy for acne ? <p> It is a good idea to use any exfoliants before you use blue and/or red light therapy . They remove just a tiny amount of dead skin so that blue light can penetrate just a tiny distance deeper into your pores . If you have sensitive skin , you may want to stick with products that use polyethylene beads to remove dead skin . Exposed Skin Care makes a product with corundum crystals . <p> It also helps to exfoliate with either alpha- or beta-hydroxy acids ( usually either glycolic acid or salicylic acid ) before using blue or red light therapy . They lift the plug at the tip of clogged pores so that the light penetrates deeper into the pore and the sebaceous glands beneath .

If you have oily skin , make sure you treat your forehead and nose . <p> Its important , however , to rinse all products off your skin before your light therapy . Light has to penetrate them , too , and thoroughly cleansing your skin before starting your therapy makes it easier for light to penetrate your skin . 19923 @qwx879923

Approved by the FDA as a non-invasive pulsing laser treatment , many acne care seekers go in for N-Lite treatment with the expectation that it will be completely painless , but that is not always the case . <h> Summary : <p> The N-Lite Laser is intended to stimulate skin growth rather than to burn off scar tissue . <p> Stimulation of skin growth is of no value for raised acne scars . <p> Rosacea may respond well to N-Lite Laser treatment . <h> What Is the N-Lite Laser ? <p> The N-Lite Laser is billed as a " nonablative skin rejuvenation device . " This laser generates yellow light with a wavelength of 585 nanometers . The wavelength of light penetrates beneath the skin , but does not- heat water to its boiling point or coagulate the blood . The purpose of exposing the skin to yellow laser light , we are told , is to stimulate the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and filling in scars . But that 's not exactly how the N-Lite Laser works . <p> Laser light at a frequency of 585 nanometers is selected for oxygenated hemoglobin . That is , this wavelength of light energizes red blood cells that are carrying oxygen in the bloodstream . The N-Lite only reaches to the depth of the uppermost capillaries bringing blood to the skin , and only interacts with some red blood cells , not all . It triggers inflammation in those red blood cells , which in turn triggers the activation of a collagen-producing " repair crew " in the skin . Early studies of the laser showed that it increased the rate of collagen production underneath the skin by about 84% . This does not create dramatic , overnight results , for any kind of skin condition , but it can help reduce redness of the skin caused by leaky blood vessels . <p> N-Lite yellow laser light is a compromise between the stronger blue light lasers that generate a tiny layer of steam beneath the skin and the red light lasers that do not destroy any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , but not so strong that it causes pain or redness " usually . Dermatologists do not do laser treatment on dark skin , because of the risk of causing permanent discoloration of the skin by activating melanin-producing cells , but most advocates of N-Lite Laser claim it is safe for all skin types , and for use on the face , neck , chest , back , buttocks , and arms . <h> Does the N-Lite Laser Really Work ? <p> Most people who go to clinics to have N-Lite Laser to treat active pimples are not happy with the results . Representative reports go something like this : <p> I had N-Lite Laser treatments where I had brown spots from healed-over pimples . Now I have new nasty sores . <p> After paying -500 ( US $800 ) to book three N-Lite Laser treatments , I cant see that my jaw line acne has improved one bit . <p> N-Lite Laser seems to stop acne dead in its tracks , as long as I get another treatment every two weeks . <p> The simple fact is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria . It works by increasing inflammation , not decreasing it . It will not reduce redness of either scars or pimples . It will not shrink protruding scar tissue , but it may help rebuild collagen underneath the " moon shaped " type of sunken acne scar over the course of several treatments . Partial results may be visible in nine months to a year . <h> What Can Go Wrong with N-Lite Laser Treatments ? <p> The biggest problem with N-Lite Laser treatments is not when it does not work . The biggest problem is when it works on the wrong scars . With N-Lite Laser treatments , it is always possible that they may smooth out little scars so that bigger scars look even more noticeable . <p> Another problem with N-Lite Laser is the potential for blood leakage . Treatments may stimulate enough collagen production to expand the skin but not enough collagen production to build new blood vessels . Blood may leak and form tiny purple streaks , especially around the nose . This problem is compounded when patients take aspirin within 10 days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Trental , Plavix , or Coumadin should not get N-Lite Laser Treatment at all . <p> So who benefits from N-Lite Laser therapy ? <h> N-Lite for Rosacea <p> The one type of acne that usually responds well to N-Lite Laser therapy is rosacea . This type of acne is not caused by bacterial infection in pores . It is the result of the expansion of weak blood vessels underneath the skin of the cheeks and nose . Invisible blood vessels may fill with blood so the skin looks red , usually after some kind of stimulus to the peripheral nervous system of the face ( sipping a cup of hot coffee or coming in from winter cold , for example ) . As the blood vessels break down , there may be permanent purple marks on the nose and around the eyes , and eventually scar tissue can create little lumps in the nose known as rhinophyma . <p> Stimulating collagen production with N-Lite Laser treatment sometimes reduces redness the very first visit . The N-Lite Laser will not change the surface of the skin , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosacea sufferers who have fair skin and red or blond hair . <p> Most people who have their rosacea treated with N-Lite have slight swelling for a day or two . N-Lite , however , should never be the sole treatment for rosacea . Here are some ideas for treating rosacea that are easy to overlook : <p> For reasons scientists do not understand , the presence of the bacterium Helicobacter pylorans in the stomach can aggravate rosacea . If you have ever traveled to any Central American country other than Costa Rica and drunk tap water , you almost certainly have been exposed to this infection . In the United States , Hispanics are much more likely than other groups to have this germ in the stomach . Treating the stomach infection with antibiotics or by taking deglycyrrhizinated licorice ( sold as DGL ) can help clear up the face . <p> Anything you do that stops rosacea attacks while your skin is recovering helps it grow stronger . Even if you have N-Lite laser treatment , you may still need to avoid hot drinks and spicy food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and keep your air conditioner setting high to avoid temperature contrast when you go outside during the summer .

@@98778790 @2978790/ <h> Which Form of Acne Do You Have ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Understanding what type of acne you have is essential to picking the right acne treatment . <p> There are so many kinds of acne that you practically need a scorecard to keep up . Understanding your personal form of acne , however , is essential to choosing the right acne treatment . Different kinds of acne require different kinds of treatment , and what is helpful for one acne form may be harmful for another . <h> Summary : <p> Acne vulgaris , a term that literally means " common acne , " is the most common form of acne . <p> Not all kinds of acne are caused by infection , and not all acne infections stay on the face . <p> Rosacea is a form of acne that has very little to do with sebum accumulation and a great deal to do with hyperactivity of the peripheral nervous system . The detergents that sometimes are successful for treating common acne on oily skin can have a devastating effect on rosacea . <p> Different ethnic groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acne Vulgaris <p> Acne vulgaris is the common acne that nearly all people experience during adolescence . This form of acne occurs when pores are clogged with wicks of solid sebum , the normally liquid oil that helps lubricate the face to prevent wrinkling . The tightness of the pores may be a reaction to pain or to sex hormones , and this form of acne may or may not cause inflammation . <p> Whiteheads and blackheads are known as non-inflammatory comedones . A whitehead is just a plug of waxy sebum that is stuck in a pore . A blackhead is a plug of waxy sebum that has oxidized . Pimples , pustules , and papules are red , itchy , tingly , tender , and sometimes painful because of inflammation . This inflammation may be caused by the release of peroxides by acne bacteria trapped in the pore , or by the action of the immune system trying to contain the infection . <p> Acne vulgaris is most common on the nose and around the eyes . It rarely is found on the neck and back or elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , but is most common beginning about the age of 8 and 18 , when the adrenal glands begin to mature , until the age of 18 , when sex organs completely mature . <h> Understanding Rosacea <p> Another common form of acne , affecting up to 1 in 10 people of Scandinavian or British descent , is rosacea . This form of acne usually is limited to the nose and cheeks . It causes tiny pimples rather than big pimples , but it can change the structure of tissues beneath the skin . <p> Hypersensitivity to cold , heat , fumes , and spices trigger a reaction in the nerves of the face that sends blood rushing to the skin and reddens the face . The reaction may be so intense that tiny bumps that look like pimples break out in minutes . These bumps , however , are not caused by bacteria . <p> Most of the " heavy duty " treatments that work for some cases of acne vulgaris actually make rosacea worse . Any kind of irritation to the face , nose , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , or stepping outside into cold wind or dry desert heat , can make the condition quickly worse . A variation of rosacea known as acne graminata occurs in up to 1 in 10 people of African heritage , causing a thickening of the skin across the nose and cheeks without obvious redness . <h> Understanding Acne Conglobata <p> Acne congoblata is a severely disfiguring " burrowing " form of acne in which bacterial infection spreads from pimple to pimple underneath the skin . Most common in men who have an extra X chromosome , acne conglobata usually strikes between the ages of 15 and 18 , but can even occur in infants . There is also a hereditary white blood cell abnormality that can cause the disease . <p> The presence of acne conglobata does not necessarily mean someone has an extra X chromosome . An even worse form of this disease , known as acne fulminans , sometimes occurs in women as well as men in their teens and early 20s . Acne fulminans can spread to bone . Fortunately , both of these conditions are rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires medical supervision . A variety of potent medications including retinoids ( such as Accutane or Retin-A ) and dapsone ( also used to treat a kind of gluten sensitivity that causes skin problems ) along with laser treatment is usually required . <h> Understanding Staph Infections of the Skin <p> Staph infections of the skin are not really acne , but they are often confused with acne . A staph infection can cause a tiny raised pimple with a round yellow center . If you were to pop this pimple ( which is something you should not do ) it would squirt out clear or yellow pus . Staph infections of the skin occur when a different microorganism , Staphylococcus aureus , gets trapped in pores . <p> This much more aggressive bacterium can spread from the skin to other parts of the body . Common acne bacteria only infect the inner organs when the immune system is weakened by chemotherapy , radiation , or HIV . <p> If you notice pimples with yellow centers , standard acne treatments wo n't work . In fact , most of them will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Treat staph infections of the skin from the inside out , either with natural immunostimulants , such as echinacea , or appropriate antibiotic therapy . <h> Understanding Acne Keloidalis Nuchae ( AKN ) <p> Acne keloidalis nuchae , also known by its acronym AKN , is a particularly disfiguring form of acne that most often strikes people with very dark skin tones , typically people of African or South Asian descent . This form of acne usually starts in a hair shaft rather than in a skin pore . It is itchy , then painful . It triggers the formation of a dense mat of tough collagen that makes hair fall out and stands out as a pink raised scar . <p> The most common trigger for this form of acne is shaving the head or getting " bald fades . " Hairs get bent over and trapped in their follicles . Various kinds of bacteria may accumulate in the follicle , but the damage to skin is done by the immune system , not bacteria . The lesion may drain , but the fluid is not pus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and most of them are of African or Hispanic descent . The condition can occur , however , even among women of British , Irish , or Scandinavian descent . <h> Understanding Acneiform Eruptions <p> Acneiform eruptions are skin outbreaks that look like acne but are not acne . They may be caused by chemical exposure , tumors in hair follicles , steroid use , or syphilis . Usually there are other symptoms that make the nature of the outbreak obvious . <p> If you have a condition that looks like mild to moderate acne , chances are that it really is mild to moderate acne .

Or you might get results that are just as good at far lower expense from a complete acne care system such as Exposed Skin Care . <h> Acneiform Eruptions <p> An astonishing number of diseases cause acne-like or " acneiform " eruptions on the skin that require medical treatment , including : <p> Eruptive vellus hair cysts . Vellus hair is the fine , light-colored , nearly invisible hair that can grow between darker hairs on the skin . Sometime vellus hair follicles quit growing upward over the " bulb " at the bottom of the follicle that generates the hair , and a painless pimple erupts on the skin . This can happen to infants and seniors and at any age in between , although its a relatively rare condition . <p> Pityrosporum folliculitis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fatty acids that accumulate in pores of the skin . ( Acne bacteria break down long-chain fatty acids into essential fatty acids , and the yeast in turn feed on the fatty acids . ) The immune system tries to attack them with inflammation , with the result of itchy patches of pink skin forming in various locations on the body , although not usually the face . <p> Perioral dermatitis . Sometimes the use of toothpaste or mouthwash that contains sodium lauryl sulfate , also known as sodium dodecyl sulphate and SLS , can cause an outbreak of tiny pimples at the corners of the mouth and on the chin . This condition is closer to an allergy than it is to acne . It most commonly occurs in adult women . <p> Coccidioidomycosis , or San Joaquin Valley fever ( not to be confused with the valley fever that occurs in Arizona ) .

If you have acne-like outbreaks on the skin which do n't  respond to your usual acne care , see a doctor for advice . <h> Acne Conglobata <p> Acne conglobata " burrows " between pimples to form large sores on the face , back , chest , and buttocks . It can strike between birth and the age of 30 , and it can not be treated by conventional acne medications .

Much as celiac disease causes severe irritation of the bowel , dermatitis herpetiformis causes severe irritation of the skin . Medications that shut down the inflammation function of the immune system , such as dapsone , are usually required to bring the condition under control . <h> Cystic Acne <p> Many people who do n't  have acne as teenagers develop cystic acne in their early 20s . Usually striking young people with otherwise healthy brown skin , cysts form when rapidly growing skin envelops acne bacteria in pores . The immune system tries to remove bacteria with inflammation , but the bacteria secrete a chemical that redirects the effects of inflammation to nearby skin cells . The cyst grows larger and larger because the acne bacteria are not killed but can not escape . <p> Cystic acne used to be treated by lancing . Nowadays it is treated with retinoid drugs like Accutane and Retin-A . Safe use of these medications , however , requires medical supervision . Never try to pop or lance cysts on your own . Permanent scarring and even worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of " pimpling " of the skin on the nose , across the cheeks , and around the eyes . Capillaries leak blood when they are filled with blood , creating tiny red spots on the skin .

You may be able to control rosacea outbreaks on your own , but you will need the assistance of a physician to treat rhinophyma , or " bumpy nose . " <h> When to See a Doctor About Everyday Acne <p> You can probably manage everyday acne on your own without ever seeing a dermatologist , but there are things a doctor can do for you that you can not do for yourself : <p> If your primary problem is pimples , rather than whiteheads or blackheads , your doctor may be able to prescribe an antibiotic to help bring acne infection under control . <p> If you have problems with scars or pigmentation of the skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin issues than treatments you can do on your own . <p> If you have acne at a deeper level of your skin , your doctor may be able to recommend retinoid drugs that will accelerate healing . <p> And sometimes your dermatologist can treat " cosmetic emergencies .

@@98778792 @2978792/ <h> What Is The Acne Cosmetics Connection ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Acne and cosmetics are not necessarily incompatible . With a little planning , cosmetics can help you achieve smooth skin even while blemishes are still healing , but you will need to pay careful attention to your daily skin care routine . Here is what is required for effective use of cosmetics in the day of the life of a teen who has acne . <h> Summary : <p> The most important thing to remember about applying cosmetics to acne-prone skin is to avoid transferring dirt and bacteria to clean skin . <p> Do n't  use anyone elses cosmetics , especially if they come in a jar . <p> Always use a clean towel , or if that is not possible , use a clean part of a towel you ( and no one else ) has used before . <p> Always cleanse your skin before applying makeup . <p> Its always best to use the fewest layers of makeup possible " preferably just one . <p> If you have a gym class or your work out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back acne . <p> Do n't  forget to remove your cosmetics at night . <p> To maintain clear skin , use a complete acne care system like Exposed Skin Care . <h> Always Cleanse Your Skin Before Using Makeup <p> Even before you put on foundation makeup , the very first step in your beauty routine every morning has to be cleansing your skin . There are two essentials for cleansing your skin : <p> Do n't  transfer dirt , grime , old cosmetics , or acne bacteria to your skin before or after you cleanse it . Wash your hands before you cleanse your face , and always pat your face dry on a clean towel . <p> Let your cleanser do the work . Rubbing and scrubbing just injure your skin and force it to repair itself by making more oil . <p> You shouldnt be able to feel your cleanser working . You cant really feel dirt removal . What you can feel when a cleansing product makes your face tingle is the death of cells on your skin and in your pores , creating new debris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanse over your jawline and on your chin . <h> Moisturize If You Need It <p> Teens who have acne are often advised that they need to " dry out " their skin . They really do n't  . They need to control excess oil on their skin . If your face tends to shine a few hours after you wash it then your probably have naturally oily skin and you do n't  need moisturizer . <p> If your skin tends to get a duller , grayer color as the days goes on , however , and if you tend to have tiny blemishes on the sides of your face , then you may need to use a moisturizer after you cleanse your face . The purpose of a moisturizer is to lock moisture in your skin , not in your pores . The best products for dry skin on the sides of the face are made with a combination of oil and water . <p> Never use a moisturizer- that contains alcohol . It will actually dry out your face . And do n't  forget to use your moisturizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is highest . <h> Foundation Is Fundamental <p> Foundation makeup helps you achieve an even texture and color across your entire face . You can even use foundation to cover up pimples without the often-recommending dabbing of green makeup over red pimples if : <p> You use a slighter more golden tone of foundation makeup than the closest match for your skin color if you have fair or light-brown skin . <p> You use a slightly darker brown tone of foundation makeup that the closest match for your skin if you have Asian or dark skin tones . <p> The advantage of using green makeup to mask a red pimple is that you can then cover up both the pimple and the green makeup with the foundation that is closest to your natural skin tone . The disadvantage of using green makeup to mask a red pimple is that it is , well , green . If you rub off your foundation makeup or perspiration dissolves it , you may have a green pimple on your face instead of a red one . And that 's kind of noticeable , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The kind of foundation that will give you the best finish for your skin depends on whether your skin is dry or oily . If you have dry skin , you will tend to have fewer whiteheads and blackheads and more tiny pimples . If you have oily skin , you will tend to have more whiteheads and blackheads and fewer but larger pimples . <p> Foundation can cover all your acne blemishes , but the wrong kind of foundation will tend to cause problems later in the day . If you have oily skin , use a powder or cream-to-powder foundation . This will keep it from streaking on your face . If you have dry skin , use a cream foundation . This will keep it from clumping , especially over pimples . <h> One Layer Is Always Better than Two <p> The important thing to remember about foundation is not to overdo it . The more layers of cosmetics you put on your face , the more likely they are to clump , cake , flake , or streak . Its always best to use just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lip Care <p> Many women use lipstick and some men use lip gloss . There is probably no more problematic area of the face for cosmetics than the lips . <p> The wax and fragrances used in lipstick and lip gloss , as well as in lip balm , can easily accumulate on the cheeks and chin . The chemicals in these products irritate pores , and the waxes clog them . Many people who use lipstick , lip gloss , or lip balm have a special problem with chin acne and acne at the corners of the mouth . <p> The best way to deal with this acne issue is to use lip products that are all about how your lips look " not about how they smell or taste . The fewer added ingredients there are in your lipstick , lip gloss , or lip balm , the less acne you will have on your chin . <h> Shaving Products <p> Many teen males shave . Especially if you have brown or black skin , it is extremely important never to use a dull razor . Its OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three shaves . This keeps the razor from bending hairs into follicles that can become inflamed and cause an especially difficult form of acne known as acne keloidalis nuchae . <p> What about aftershave ? If you have reddened skin over your nose and cheeks , do n't  use any cologne or after-shave to avoid irritation of your skin . <h> If You Have Gym Class <p> If you have gym class , do n't  skip your shower . Sweat can accumulate under tight clothing and shrivel skin like a prune . If you do n't  remove dead skin flakes that can get onto your pores while you are working out within four hours of your exercise session , they can get into your pores and cause back and chest acne . <h> Removing Makeup at Night <p> Wearing makeup all day wont seriously set back your acne care . But you simply have to be able to use acne products like benzoyl peroxide and tea tree oil at night to help acne heal . <p> The traditional way to remove makeup is with cold cream . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream . Choose a cleanser that removes all your makeup , but without any need to scrub your face . Scrubbing at night is just as detrimental to your skin . After you pat your skin dry with a clean towel ( or at least a clean area on a towel you have used before ) , then apply acne products that will work all night until its time to start the acne care cycle all over again . <p> Its a lot easier to keep up with your acne skin care routine if you use a complete acne care system like Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778793 @2978793/ <h> Removing Acne : Treatments and Remedies Reviewed 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Getting rid of acne never happens overnight , but there are great products that can help you achieve noticeable improvement of blemishes in 48 hours , and removing acne in approximately 48 days or about two months . Here are the top ten methods for removing acne that almost always work . <h> Summary : <p> Removing acne never happens overnight . Take advantage of any product that has a 30-day guarantee . <p> Test any product on the skin of your forearm before you use it on your face . <h> 1 . If you have dry skin , moisturize . <p> Dry skin is skin that begins to look crinkly , crackly , peeled , or gray after several hours in the sun . Many of us have dry skin on our heels and elbows , but some of us also have dry skin on the face . <p> If you have both dry skin and acne , its a good idea to moisturize . Why ? Moisture makes the skin more flexible . It keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hardened sebum and form whiteheads or blackheads , and existing whiteheads and blackheads are more likely simply to fall out of the skin without any effort on your part at all . <p> The very best moisturizer is water , but its effects only last a few minutes . If you have dry skin , use a water-based or oil-based moisturizer , but make sure you do not use any product that contains alcohol , which can dry out the skin even more . <h> 2 . If you have oily skin , exfoliate . <p> Oily skin is skin that looks shiny unless it is blotted . Its possible for skin to be both oily and dry at the same time , especially if it is treated with moisture-robbing skin care products that contain alcohol or menthol . Most of the time , however , if you have oily skin , dryness is not a problem . <p> Exfoliation is a process of removing both dead skin and excessive oils on the surface of the skin . If you have oily skin , you should use products that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid used on the skin ) , not alpha-hydroxy acids . Make sure the product is at least 1 or 2% salicylic acid and has a pH of no more than 3.8 . If you have dark skin tones , it is especially important to rinse off the product as soon as the instructions say , to prevent irritation and inflammation that can cause persistent spotting of the skin . <h> 3 . If you cant beat your acne , hide it . <p> You can cover whiteheads and blackheads with concealer makeup . Most of the time people who have acne need yellow concealer for non-inflammatory skin blemishes . Just put a dab of the product on the back of your hand and work it into a feather brush , and then use the feather brush to transfer concealer to the skin . Lightly rub the concealer into the skin to cover the blemish smoothly , with no obvious edges around the blemish . <p> Pimples may require green concealer then followed by treating the entire face with a flesh-tone foundation matching your skin tones . Remember , concealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop with just the green concealer on your face , . <h> 4 . Scrub your acne away , but not with a cloth or a brush . <p> Scrubbing your skin with a washcloth , or worse , a brush , only makes acne worse . The skin is irritated , and protects itself by making even more oily sebum . Skin scrubs , however , contain mild foaming agents that can get into pores , and tiny microparticles of polyethylene plastic , coconut , or oatmeal that physically remove excess oil as the product is rinsed away . If a scrub leaves your face looking red or feeling tingly , however , take it back to the retailer and ask for your money back . Redness and tingling are signs of skin destruction , not fighting acne. <h> 5 . Eat yogurt . <p> Yogurt contains symbiotic bacteria that not only keep harmful bacteria from multiplying in the lower digestive tract , but also send signals to the immune system that they have those harmful bacteria under control . When the immune system gets these signals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight dangerous infections , it produces less inflammation . This relieves stress on the brain , improving mood and fighting infection . It also relieves stress in the skin , reducing the production of both irritant chemicals like histamine , and also of sebum , which helps protect the skin by releasing essential fatty acids . <p> It used to be considered simple commonsense that eating yogurt or even bakers yeast would provide clear up the skin . Now scientists know the reasons why . A small serving of yogurt every day , preferably between meals , will keep the colons supply of useful bacteria healthy and help skin problems including both acne and eczema in check . <h> 6 . Just say no to bar soap . <p> Bar soap is never good for cleansing the skin , especially when there is acne on the skin . It certainly is not useful for removing acne . Rubbing a bar on the skin grinds soap film into pores , making a sticky mess with the oils that are naturally inside . The foamier the soap , the bigger the bubbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , and the ingredients that make soap smell good can also cause skin allergies . Use acne cleansers on the skin , letting them to do their work without rubbing and scrubbing , rinsing them off with warm water and patting the skin dry with a clean towel . <h> 7 . Just say yes to water . <p> Water hydrates the skin , keeping pores open so acne never gets a chance to get started . You do n't  have to drink unusually large amounts of water to hydrate your skin . No one ever cured acne by sloshing while they raced down the hall to the bathroom . And you do n't  have to keep your home so humid that your pet turtle does not need terrarium . <p> The way to get the right amount of water in your skin is to apply water to your skin whenever you can . You do n't  want to streak your makeup , but simply splashing your face with water before you put on makeup increases the moisture in your skin up to 500% until you take off your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  need . Any kind of collagen you put on your skin does attract water , but it keeps the water on your skin , not in your skin . This may make your skin look plumper until you rinse the product off , but it will do nothing to keep pores open or to remove acne. <h> 8 . Just say yes to facial waters . <p> There is a special kind of water that is especially helpful if you have acne : Facial waters . These are waters from natural springs that are rich in sulfur , magnesium , or selenium , minerals that calm the skin and fight infection . Splash you face with facial water after you rinse off your cleanser , allowing the water to evaporate off your skin rather than toweling your skin , or use it before you use moisturizer and other makeup . <h> 9 . Be sure to remove makeup every day . <p> It is important to remove makeup completely every day . Leaving cosmetics on the skin all night allows them to break down into fatty acids that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with yellow centers that are uglier and harder to conceal than pimples . <h> 10 . Test any new product to make sure you are not allergic to it , and then give it 30 days to work . <p> Allergic reactions to acne care products are rare , but they happen . It is always a good idea to test just a small dot of the product on the skin of your forearm , leaving it there for 24 hours to make sure it does not cause any kind of inflammation or irritation . If it does n't  , then you can use it on your face . <p> Do n't  expect any product to remove acne overnight , or even in a week . Your skin may begin to look better almost immediately when you use some treatments , but most of the time its best to take full advantage of your 30-day money-back guarantee , such as you get when you buy Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923

A serum is a light liquid that is easy to spread over your face that contains specific healing ingredients such as green tea extract and tea tree oil . Green tea extract reduces sebum production while relieving inflammation on the skin .

There are two ways to do microdermabrasion . <p> One method of microdermabrasion is rubbing crystals on your skin . Aluminum hydroxide crystals can irritate your skin unless you have a vacuum wand to suck them off your skin when you are finished with the treatment . Corundum crystals are easier to remove with a simple rinse of water and do n't  cause irritation of the skin . <p> Another way to do microdermabrasion is with a microdermabrasion cloth .

But microdermabrasion is an inexpensive and painless process you can do every day as long as you do not have open wounds or obvious irritation on the skin you wish to treat . <h> Remove Acne with a Clarifying Mask <p> Even in the twenty-first century , there are spas built around hot springs that contain special mud for rejuvenating the skin .

They are benzoyl peroxide , tea tree oil , and salicylic acid . <p> Do n't  try to fight acne with just one method . Use an acne-fighting system , like Exposed Skin Care . <h> Misinformation <p> One website claims that the B-vitamin panthothenic acid eliminates acne fast and completely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website correctly identifies vitamin B5 as panthothenic , and then incorrectly identifies it as " the only non-prescription treatment proven to work against acne .

No clinical study has ever shown that any of the 10 superfoods in the product cures any acne , but one study found that one of the antioxidants in the product helps users lose an additional pound every six months without dieting . <p> There simply are n't  any diets , foods , or nutritional products that get rid of all of your blemishes in 24 hours .

But how effective are clinically tested products for acne ? <h> No Medication Gets Rid of 100% of Acne , Either <p> Some medications are usually better than others " different users getting different results " but no medication gets rid of all acne blemishes . Here are some key findings of published medical research . <p> Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid often recommended for exfoliating oily skin to break up blackheads . A study published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology reported that using a salicylic acid product three times a week got rid of- an average of 48% of blackheads in three months . <p> 0.05% tretinoin topical is the strongest over-the-counter form of Retin-A available in the USA . A study of tretinoin topical as an acne treatment for teens found that it got rid of and average of 30% of pimples and 36% of blackheads in three months . Clindamycin is antibiotic favored for acne treatment in Canada ( although it is also available in the US , Australia , and Europe ) because it has relatively few side effects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that it got rid of an average of 60% of pimples and 49% of blackheads in three months . <p> Benzoyl peroxide is the worlds most commonly used treatment for truncal acne , also known as back acne or bacne .

Scientists at the Isfahan University of the Medical Sciences in Iran found that applying a 5% solution of tea tree oil to the skin for 6 weeks reduced , on average , the number of pimples by 47% and the number of blackheads by 40% . <p> Oral contraceptives are often used to treat premenstrual acne .

A clinical trial conducted at the RMT University in Melbourne , Australia concluded that reducing glycemic load ( reducing both the consumption of sugars and the total consumption of carbohydrates ) reduced the average count of acne blemishes by approximately 50% . <p> In going through the fact-based literature of acne treatment , two things stand out about the results . One thing that stands out is that real-world acne treatment methods , as opposed to some wild idea marketer hypes to sell you a product , typically find that it takes about three months to get rid of just 50% of blemishes . And the other thing that stands out in the findings of medical science is that simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree oil , salicylic acid , and diet are just as effective as most medications . Just because something costs more and is only available with a doctors prescription does not mean it works better . <p> But what do you use if you want to get rid of all of your blemishes ? <h> Acne Treatment Systems <p> Using a single method to treat acne will never get rid of all of your blemishes . And , to be honest about- it , using a treatment system will never get rid of all of your blemishes , either . However , a good acne treatment system , offering you a combination of skin treatments , will usually get rid of 90% or more of your blemishes in 30 days . You may get visible results the very first day and up to a 30% reduction in the count of blemishes in 7 days , but completely clear skin usually takes about 30 days . <p> That 's why you just should n't use acne skin care products that do n't  come with at least a 30-day money-back guarantee . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in less than 30 days . <p> And its also why you need a system for fighting acne . At the very least , you need a cleanser for removing dead skin that can clog pores . You need a treatment serum to reduce the production of oil in your skin if you have oily skin , or a moisturizer to help keep your skin soft ( and your pores open ) if you have dry skin . You need a clearing tonic to get rid of blackheads and you might also benefit from the one nutritional supplement that reliably relieves acne on all skin types , Lactobacillus . <p> You can choose from several acne treatment kits at great prices with a one-year money-back guarantee at Exposed Skin Care . Many other good products by other manufacturers are reviewed on this site . But do n't  try to fight acne with just one product alone .

Its more common in the elderly than it is in other age groups . One of the odd symptoms of xerosis is the development of acne . Even if you did n't  get whiteheads and blackheads at the age of 17 , you just might at 47 or 57 or 67 or 77 if you do n't  keep xerosis under control . <h> How the Skin Keeps Moist <p> The task of keeping moisture in the skin and admitting tiny amounts of moisture from the into the skin falls to the layer of skin known as the stratum corneum . Most of the cells in the stratum corneum have reached the end of their life cycle , the DNA in their nuclei and the activities of their organelles already shut down . Since they do n't  need to continue to absorb nutrients and food , the cell membranes break down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both absorbs are retains moisture and holds this outermost layer of the skin together . The living cells just below the stratum corneum have an ability to " pump " water in and out so that we never become waterlogged while taking a bath or a shower or a swim . Ceramide is the substance that makes our skin wrinkle when we spend a long time in water . <h> Why The Skin Dries Out <p> There are certain causes of dry skin that affect just about everyone more or less equally . Here are just a few : <p> Central air conditioning and forced air heating systems dry out the indoor atmosphere and dry out the skin . <p> Unusually dry and hot weather conditions dry out the skin , as does a day in the sun without moisturizer . <p> Hot baths and showers break down the protective lipid layers of the skin , as does frequent swimming in heavily chlorinated pools . <p> Harsh soaps and detergents , basically any product that makes big bubbles , can also damage the lipid layer and dry out the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And there are certain causes of dry skin that link back to disease conditions . <p> The skin absorbs moisture into ceramide . In turn , ceramide forms as skin cells mature and break down at the end of their life cycle . If some disease condition interferes with the production of new skin cells , then at some point there wont be enough old skin cells to break down into ceramides . The skin will dry out and flake , usually causing itchiness . <p> Some conditions can interfere with the normal production of skin cells at any time during life . Eczema ( also known as atopic dermatitis ) causes dry skin , as do hypothyroidism and kidney disease . Psoriasis causes dry skin through a different process . Psoriasis causes skin cells to multiply so quickly that they stack up on the skin , unable to receive oxygen and nutrients , dying in large numbers and causing peeling and itch . <p> The most common health condition that causes dry skin after the age of 50 , however , is something most people have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venous insufficiency can cause flaking and itching of the skin that can be almost unbearable if its not treated , and make large patches of skin so tight that the skin that does n't  flake away is infested by blackheads . <h> What Is Venous Insufficiency ? <p> The veins carry blood back to the heart . Veins in the lower half of the body use valves to ensure that blood flows against gravity back to the heart . When high blood pressure is left untreated for a long time , the valves begin to fail and the tissues they serve begin to die . Itchy skin is usually a sign of superficial venous insufficiency in which the smallest veins fail and skin fails to regenerate but deeper , larger veins continue to supply the muscles beneath the skin . <p> The first places venous insufficiency will cause dry skin are the shins and heels , and then the tops of the feet and the calves of the legs . On the legs there can be drying skin and then skin wounds that take a long time to heal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough to trim . Blackheads that just wont come out of the skin are a sign of advanced disease . <h> What Can You Do About Venous Insufficiency ? <p> Moisturizer only treats one symptom of venous insufficiency , but you should use a lot of it nonetheless . Keeping your skin moist and smooth helps prevent infections that in some cases can even lead to amputation of the leg . <p> Even more important than moisturizer is wearing compression stockings . These garments are tighter at the toes and looser at the middle of the calf , forcing blood back up into the leg as it is needed . They are very different from the bandages that are sometimes used for venous sufficiency . It is absolutely critical that the compression stocking does not act as a tourniquet at the middle of the leg ( or the middle of the thigh , in some stockings ) . The stocking has to force blood up but also allow it to flow back down . The compression stockings used in hospitals to prevent blood clots after surgery do not have enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what else can you do to prevent skin damage caused by venous insufficiency ? <p> Avoid standing in place or sitting in the same position for long periods . Locking the knees makes it difficult for blood to flow back to the heart through the veins . <p> If your leg muscles are still intact , use them as much as you can . Walking , swimming , and bicycling are all great activities for people who have chronic venous insufficiency . <p> Moisturize every day . Even if your skin looks fine , use moisturizer . The best time to moisturizer is right after you towel off from your shower . Taking a shower briefly increases the moisture content of your skin about 500% . You need to remove any visible drops of water from your skin , but putting a moisturizer on your skin just as soon as your towel off helps the ceramides in your skin retain that moisture . <p> Skin-identical ingredients , often labeled as ceramides , are desirable in any moisturizer you use on your legs . <p> If you develop an infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  do much good when the underlying problem is insufficient circulation to your skin . 19923 @qwx879923

There are also masks that contain plasticizing agents . These usually have to be pulled off the skin . Since pulling the mask off your skin can cause damage of its own , this article does not recommend any products that contain plasticizing agents. - According to Dr. Erin Kil , bentonite and sulfur have anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties that are good for your skin .

A well-formulated acne mask can be left on the skin for 10 minutes up to an hour , and then washed off with warm water .

In addition , leaving a cleanser on your skin for extended periods of time is not advisable as it can lead to the skin getting irritated . In any case , this product is not very- good at exfoliating given that it has a high pH . In addition , this product does not have salicylic acid , which is effective in fighting against acne . <p> There are a few advantages of using this product , though . It soaks up excess oil produced on the skin , which makes it quite good for oily skin . It has niacibamide , which facilitates communication between cells . It also has a couple of anti-irritants . Its disadvantages include the fact that it can cause irritation on the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of salicylic acid it contains is too small to have any significant impact on acne due to the high pH levels of the product . <p> In addition , the product has a strong fragrance , which is not helpful in any way for the treatment of acne and it does not fade red marks left on the skin by acne . The red and pink marks left on the skin are referred to as post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation and they are a great source of frustration for people who are struggling with acne . Even though salicylic acid is great at helping to get rid of red marks on the skin , it is more effective when used on products that you can leave on your skin for quite some time . However , leaving a cleansing agent on your skin for long , such as this product , can slow down your skin from healing . <p> One of the things that make this mask really effective is that it treats acne right from under the skin even before the blemishes break out on the surface of the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimizes the sizes of pimples .

Not every treatment works for every kind of acne or for everyone who has the same kind of acne , however , and what helps one person fight acne can actually make acne worse for another . Here is what you need to know about the most common topical acne treatments . <h> Summary : <p> Even soap and water can be a useful acne treatment . <p> People who have acne and do not have sensitive skin can use almost any kind of soap , but it is best not to rub the soap into the skin . <p> People who have both acne and sensitive skin need to be careful to avoid soaps that contain botanicals or fragrances , since these can cause irritation , and irritation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least expensive face masks usually get the best results . <p> The least expensive non-prescription retinoid creams usually get the best results . <p> Topic Retin-A opens cysts and nodules without lancing , but it can also cause new blemishes if careful cleansing is not part of the routine . <h> Soap and Water <p> No acne expert is ever going to tell you that soap and water is the best way to fight acne , but if soap and water is all you have , then soap and water is the topical acne treatment for you . But there is a right way to use soap and water for fighting acne , and a wrong way to use soap and water for fighting acne . <p> The right way to use soap and water to treat acne is to make a lather of soap with your hands and to apply the soap to your skin with your fingers . Let the soap do the work . Do n't  rub , scrub , or work at making it work . Rinse the lather off your skin with warm water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wrong way to use soap and water is to rub it into your skin , either directly or with a washcloth . Not only can soap film clog pores , any irritant chemical in the soap can trigger a protective reaction in the skin : The skin protects itself by making even more sebum . <p> Some acne sufferers can wash their faces with any soap that 's handy . If you are n't  sensitive to perfumes , or laundry products , and you do n't  have eczema or contact dermatitis , chances are any old soap as a topical acne treatment will do . <p> Other acne sufferers have sensitive skin and have to be careful about their choices of soaps . If perfumes make you sneeze , or laundry products make you break out , or you get pimples after you get too cold ( rosacea ) or too hot ( heat rash ) , you probably need to be careful about your choice of soaps . Most Neutrogena and Cetaphil products , however , are fine for sensitive skin . Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash and Eucerin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driest skin , and Body Shop Aloe Soothing Facial Cleanser works well for very dry skin . <h> Benzoyl Peroxide <p> Benzoyl peroxide creams , gels , and lotions are a good way to fight the bacteria that cause acne , but they do n't  get rid of inflammation right away . They just stop the skins production of its own irritant chemicals by taking away the target of inflammation , the bacteria that cause acne . Still , most people see significant clearing of the skin in one to two weeks , provided the benzoyl peroxide itself does not cause its own inflammation and irritation of the skin . <p> Benzoyl peroxide comes in different strengths . Over the counter products , in most countries , range from 2.5% to 10% benzoyl peroxide , while prescription products range from 5% to 20% benzoyl peroxide . Sometimes the 5% prescription strength product causes redness , inflammation , irritation , and peeling , while the 2.5% product , which the doctor would not prescribe , works just fine . Always start with the lowest concentration you can find , and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face when you are sure that you are not causing irritation . <p> Since the skin repairs itself by producing sebum , using benzoyl peroxide that it is too strong may cure pimples but make whiteheads and blackheads pop out . You may be able to use a stronger spot treatment than all-over-the-face lotion or gel . <p> On the other hand , benzoyl peroxide face washes do n't  do you any good because they only stay on your face a few seconds before you wash them down the drain . Benzoyl peroxide has to stay on your face several hours to work . <h> Facial Masks <p> Clay masks and , as strange as it sounds , Phillips Milk of Magnesia , are very useful for absorbing excess oil from the skin . You simply place the mask material on your skin , let it dry , and rinse it off 15 to 30 minutes later . <p> In choosing facial masks , the thing to remember is that the least expensive mask works best ( but do n't  dig around in your yard to get the clay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs US $3 may be more beneficial for your skin than a mask that costs $30 if the more expensive product contains additional ingredients that irritate the skin . And they usually do . <h> Non-Prescription Retinoid Creams <p> Retinoids are nothing more than vitamin A for the skin applied directly to the skin . Vitamin A stimulates the growth of the skin , opening pores , and allowing them to drain . <p> Different non-prescription retinoids have different effects and side-effects : <p> Retinol can be used directly by the skin but can cause peeling , dryness , redness , itching , irritation , and sensitivity to the sun . <p> Retinyl propionate ( used in Olay products ) is a more stable form of retinol that has to be converted into retinol by enzymes in the skin , that will only work when the skin needs it . It causes less irritation but may not be as fast-acting . <p> Retinyl palmitate is a form of retinol that also has to be processed by the skin itself , but which is easily absorbed into the skin .

Products that contain enough retinyl palmitate to make a difference include the Vit-A-Plus and A-Force XR acne products . <h> Prescription Retinoid Creams <p> The prescription retinoid creams use " turbocharged " forms of vitamin A , with the intention of causing the skin to grow so fast that it opens up over nodules and cysts so that they do not have to be lanced . In the United States , most retinoids are taken as a pill , but tretinoin topical , marketed under the trade names Retin-A Micro and Avita , is available as a cream . <p> The drawback to topical tretinoin is that it is comedogenic . That is , it cures nodules and cysts , but causes whiteheads and blackheads . Your physician will give you detailed instructions for the use of the drug , but you will also have to do regular cleansing of the skin to prevent the formation of new blemishes . 19923 @qwx879923

Here are ten acne home remedies that really work . <p> Make a habit of washing your hands when you come home , whether they " need it " or not . <h> 1 . Wipe your cell phone with rubbing alcohol at least once a week <p> A study at the London School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene found that cell phones harbor acne , staph , and E. coli bacteria .

The more sebum your skin makes , the more whiteheads and blackheads will appear . Cutting out tomatoes wo n't clear up your acne overnight , but it can make a real difference in the health of your skin . <p> Is it really a good idea to start making pizzas and spaghetti with cream-based Alfredo sauce ? The same Dutch study found that butter , cream , cheese , and animal fat had no effects on acne , although foods fried in soybean oil or corn oil , such as most fast food and most crispy packaged snacks , made acne worse . <h> 3 .

Add about 10 minutes before it is time to take out your clothes . Your clothes wont cling to each other , and they will also look as if they were freshly ironed . <h> 4 .

Just a single squirt of foaming shaving cream is usually enough to clean hands so you do n't  have to be concerned about touching your face and causing new blemishes . <h> 5 . Brush your teeth with natural toothpaste <p> Most brands of toothpaste include a foaming agent called sodium lauryl sulfate . ( In the UK , its called sodium dodecyl sulphate . ) Especially in women , the suds from toothpaste can cause tiny pimples to break out at the corners of the mouth .

You can get additional blue and red light by using red and blue glass or plastic in the sunniest room in your house . <p> Of course , you can get even better results from blue light or combination blue and red light lamps . Just be sure not to sit so close to the lamp that you dry out or burn your skin . Blue light and red and blue light therapy always take about a month to make visible changes in your skin . <h> 7 . Drink decaffeinated coffee for breakfast <p> Several studies find that coffee helps your body regulate blood sugar .

Your immune system recognizes them as an infection , but because the flow of food through your lower digestive tract keeps removing them , it " learns " not to produce excessive inflammation . This information is transferred to the immune system in your skin so that you get fewer pimples . <h> 10 . Make a habit of washing your hands whenever you have been outside your home <p> Washing your hands when you come home lessens the risk that you will carry E. coli and the bacteria that cause colds and flu into your home .

And while none of these superfoods is quite as super as its marketers would have us believe , some of the really are useful as part of a diet for keeping acne under control . One of the first of the superfoods was wheatgrass . <h> Wheatgrass <p> Back when a new superfood might have been described as " groovy , " wheatgrass was the choice of natural healers all over the United States . Wheatgrass is both wheat and a grass , consisting of the green shoots of freshly sprouted wheat berries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wheatgerm into readily absorbed forms .

There are not enough nutrients in wheatgrass to act medicinally but there are enough nutrients in wheatgrass to prevent mineral deficiency . <h> Barley Greens <p> Barley greens were popularized in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s , but they have been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for at least 2000 years . Known as mai ya , barley shoots are dried for use as a tea to stop excessive lactation .

Both men and women may get similar benefits from drinking beer , but the hops in beer can cause estrogen-like effects , increasing breast size in both men and women who drink it . <h> Pomegranate <p> Pomegranates have been cultivated throughout the Middle East and the drier parts of India , China , and Southeast Asia for centuries . In Ayurvedic and Unani medicine , pomegranates are used to treat diseases caused excessive consumption of sweets . <p> There have been at least 10 studies of pomegranate extract as a treatment for sun damaged skin . There is good evidence that pomegranate peel contains antioxidants that slow down the production of enzymes known as matrix metalloproteinases that break down collagen after the skin has been injured by the sun . These extracts of pomegranate peel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin to work . Drinking pomegranate juice and taking pomegranate extract pills and capsules wo n't hurt , but wo n't help either . Just about the only products that contain pomegranate that are useful for people who have acne are Jane Iredell Amazing Base Loose Minerals SPF 20 and Paulas Choice Hydralight Moisture Infusing Lotion " but do n't  buy them just because they contain pomegranate . Buy them if you use powder and need sun protection or if you need a moisturizer . <h> Mangosteen <p> The mangosteen is an evergreen tree native to Indonesia that bears a purplish red fruit that is nearly totally inedible , except a tiny amount of soft flesh around its seeds known as an aril . The edible aril of mangosteen is white and bland , but mangosteen juice makers add the inedible rinds to the mix to add antioxidant polyphenols and to give the resulting juice a puckery taste . <p> Mangosteen is a traditional remedy for acne .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MyChelle Dermaceuticals Apple Brightening Mist , unfortunately also causes witch hazel , which can cause as much irritation as mangosteen can prevent . Any mangosteens imported into the United States , incidentally , have been sterilized with radiation to kill Asian fruit flies . <h> Acai Berry <p> The most recent superfoods craze centers around the acai berry . Popularized through the tireless efforts of Amazon ethnobotanist Chris Kilham , one of the claims to fame for acai berry is that it is sustainably and ethically harvested . Natives of the Amazon jungle collect the plant in the wild and are paid fair prices for their 50-kilo ( 110 pound ) baskets of berries delivered to the processing plant in Manaus , Brazil . <p> Acai is supposed to be good for everything , but most of the scientific study of acai is on the lines of " A+ai palm fruit ( Euterpe oleracea Mart. ) pulp improves survival of flies on a high fat diet " ( published in Experimental Gerontology in March 2011 ) .

Oddly enough , the Alba Botanica Rainforest , Brazilian Peel , and Perricone MD Cosmeceuticals acne products that contain acai actually do work " just not because they contain acai . <h> Coconut Water <p> Coconut water is the thin " juice " inside a fresh coconut . ( Coconut milk is made by heating coconut meat . ) Its rich in potassium and it contains cytokinins that promote cell growth " inside the coconut , not in your skin . <h> Seaweed Chips <p> Seaweed chips , made from dried seaweed with no added oil , have been a favorite Japanese and Korean and snack food for decades . They are just now becoming more of a mainstream food in the United States . If you have rosacea or sensitive skin allergies , however , you should avoid them because they contain too much iodine . <h> And the Next Superfood Is ? <p> Whey protein , from the clear fluid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in muscle building powders for over 50 years . It is only in the last two years , however , that companies have been advertising whey powder as a treatment for acne . <p> Scientists at Kyung Hee University in Korea asked volunteers with acne to take a daily dose of a yogurt drink fortified with whey powder that was especially rich in the protein lactoferrin . They also gave a control group a daily dose of a yogurt drink that did not have the additional whey . Volunteers were asked not to use any other methods to treat their acne . <p> At the end of 12 weeks , acne in the control group was unchanged . The group that had been consuming the whey-fortified yogurt drink , however , showed 39% fewer pimples and 20% fewer whiteheads and blackheads . There will probably be an anti-acne yogurt beverage on the market in the United States in 2013 . In the meantime , you can probably get comparable benefits from eating Greek yogurt with live cultures , such as the Oikos brand by Stonyfield Farms . 19923 @qwx879923

Only small zits grow on the face , because smaller pores are present . The body contains larger pores , which means big , obnoxious pimples can grow on all areas .

There is solid scientific evidence that time-release benzoyl peroxide really does make a difference in treating acne . <p> The kind of benzoyl peroxide that is truly " time-released " is a specialized polymer known as a microsphere . In the 1990s , scientists in Turkey developed a way of mixing benzoyl peroxide with a solvent that created a microscopic structure that would look something like a kiwi fruit . The outside of the pore-sized sphere was covered with benzoyl peroxide . Molecules of benzoyl peroxide broke off as the pore was moved inside the pore by natural mechanical forces on the skin . Only a small amount of benzoyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very little irritation , but acne bacteria were constantly exposed to the treatment , so they died off much faster . <p> That is n't the kind of benzoyl peroxide used in AcneFree .

" The benzoyl peroxide in this product is ground about 60 times finer than the benzoyl peroxide used in most lotions . It does a much better job of staying inside pores " but most of the product will remain on the surface of your face between pores where there are no acne bacteria to fight . <h> Absorbed More Quickly ? <p> The makers of AcneFree claim that their finely ground ( micronized ) benzoyl peroxide is absorbed more quickly that most other benzoyl peroxide products . This is true , but most of the product is rinsed away . <h> Fighting Acne Up to Five Ways <p> Time-released benzoyl peroxide , the makers of AcneFree tell us , is just one of up to five ways that the product clears acne-prone skin ( depending on the kit you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retinol , Cetearyl Alcohol and benzalkonium chloride .

Its wonderful for exfoliating , but can also be a helpful ingredient in products used for acne scars , anti-aging , skin discoloration and in lower concentrations , moisturizing . <p> Retinol A- form of vitamin used to stimulate growth of the skin , opening pores and making the skin smoother . Too much retinol , however , can cause the skin to grow too fast , resulting in itching and irritation . <p> Benzalkonium Chloride An- antibacterial compound that is more often used to treat sinus infections . Back in the 1970 's , dermatologists found that it was as effective as antibiotics for controlling the growth of the kinds of bacteria that cause acne and impetigo " but that is only enough to control about 20% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a month . <p> Cetearyl Alcohol We talk a lot about how bad alcohol is for acne-prone skin , so if you 've read much on Facing Acne , you probably immediately think this is a bad ingredient . But its not . There are actually a few types of alcohol that are actually good for the skin . They 're called fatty alcohols , and cetearyl alcohol is just one example . You might also see cetyl alcohol or stearyl alcohol . These alcohols wo n't cause irritation and are actually great for dry skin and good for any other skin type in small amounts . So while generally speaking , alcohol is bad , its good to understand there are different types and which ones are fine . <h> AcneFree Kits <p> The Original AcneFree 24 Hour Acne Clearing System <p> This kit contains three products : Oil-Free Purifying Cleanser , Renewing Toner and Repair Lotion . On the surface , it looks like something that may actually work .

With a 2.5% concentration , it could be effective if it was n't washed down the drain before it has time to do much good . Its effective at removing makeup , should rinse off easily without leaving the skin feeling stretched , tight or dry . But even though it contains ingredients meant to be nurturing and soothing , other ingredients like Farnesol could potentially cause irritation . <p> Renewing Toner " Here is where the biggest problem lies with this kit . Although it does have some helpful ingredients in it , such as niacinamide , they 're overrun by problematic ingredients . Alcohol denat is listed as the second ingredient . Do n't  let this fool you . Its just another way of simply saying alcohol . Denat just means that something called denaturant is added to the alcohol to give it a bad taste , which is required in many countries ( including the US ) if the end product is n't a food , drink or oral medicaiton . <p> Alcohol in skincare is always bad ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the second ingredient listed , this product has a lot of alcohol in it . It makes the toner dry quickly and weightlessly on the skin , but you can bet it will cause irritation for most people . It will dry out the skin , cause more damage and put the skin under more stress , which will almost certainly just lead to more breakouts . And if you have oily skin , it will only get oilier . <p> It also contains witch hazel , which is the third ingredient . You do n't  want to use products with either alcohol or witch hazel , let alone both . <p> Repair Lotion " If it was n't for a few of the troublesome ingredients , this lotion might be recommended . It has a 3.7% concentration of benzoyl peroxide , which is good . Benzoyl peroxide in a product that you leave on your face is better than in a wash or cleanser that you wash off moments later . However , this lotion has some questionable ingredients , most importantly noted is the use of a preservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cases of sensitization are on the rise . Big companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson are starting to remove it from their products . Bottom line ? You can easily find other leave-on , topical treatments with benzoyl peroxide without potentially irritating or dangerous ingredients . <p> It also contains an ingredient that can easily cause irritation " ginger root extract . <p> Anti-Acne Cleansing Wash " This wash contains 2.5% benzoyl peroxide , which is fine , but because you wash it right off it is n't doing any big favors for your skin . Also keep in mind that it has a potentially irritating ingredient in the form a fragrance called farnesol . <p> Corrective Toner " The inclusion of glycolic acid here would otherwise be good , if it was n't combined with irritating ingredients like witch hazel and alcohol . Itd be better if glycolic ac i 'd ( an AHA ) was replaced with salicylic acid ( a BHA ) and the alcohol and witch hazel were removed . With this combination , your skin will likely become oilier , causing more blemishes , and worsen red spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repair Lotion " This powerful lotion has 10% benzoyl peroxide , which is very high . Yes , it will kill the acne-causing bacteria on the skin , but its also going to excessive dryness . If you consider the fact that this is supposed to be used after the corrective toner above that has alcohol and witch hazel , this is not a good move . And that 's besides the fact that there 's very little evidence to support the need and benefits of using this strong of concentration of benzoyl peroxide . <p> Retinol Complex " This is n't a particularly bad product , but there are far better options out there . It does n't  contain fragrances , that 's good . But its likely too heavy and creamy for acne-prone , oily skin . It also contains ginger root extract , which we would n't recommend . Lastly , and again , it has the sensitizing preservative methylisothiazolinone . <p> Salicylic acid can be very beneficial , but not when its in a cleanser that 's washed away almost immediately . <p> Corrective Cleanser " A decent water-soluble cleanser for sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are minimal since it does n't  stay on the skin . The only real downside here is the use of ginger root extract . While its known to helpful for inflammation , its also known that it can cause irritation . <p> Alcohol-Free Acne Toner " This is a decent toner for normal and oily skin , assuming that your skin is n't sensitive . Unfortunately , its included in a kit specifically meant for sensitive skin . There are a number of very good , beneficial ingredients here including niacinamide that acts as an anti-inflammatory that reduces sebum production , increases skin moisture and reduces redness and pigmentation for a better complexion . It also has anti-irritants and antioxidants " all which are good for the skin . Unfortunately , this might all be undermined by the many potentially irritating ingredients , namely all the citrus extracts found in this product . <p> Hydrating Acne Repair Lotion + Spot Treatment " Again , its another example of a potentially great product undermined by needless , possibly troublesome ingredients . The 3% benzoyl peroxide is a good amount even for sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do recommend using it only a s pot treatment to see how your skin reacts and give it time to adjust to the benzoyl peroxide . It also has anti-irritants , which is a good thing considering that yet again , it contains ginger root extract . <p> It also contains methylisothiazolinone and as mentioned above , using products with this preservative is n't recommended . <h> Ten Times More Gentle <p> AcneFree also claims that its product is " ten times more gentle " ( or causes 10% less- irritation ) as other benzoyl peroxide products . There are no independent studies to confirm this claim . <h> So , What Kind of Experience Can You Expect with AcneFree ? <p> How you respond to AcneFree has a lot to do with the severity of your acne when you start treatment . <p> If you have very mild acne , up to 10 blemishes ( whiteheads , blackheads , or pimples ) on your face , AcneFree will probably work well for you , as long as you do n't  combine it with other treatments . Adding AcneFree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee of reddening , inflammation , irritation , and a complexion that actually looks worse after treatment than before . If you get a good response to ProActiv , you will probably get a good response to Acne Free . <p> If you have moderate acne , up to 25 blemishes on your face , AcneFree will probably work as well as Proactiv , but you are likely to experience drying of your face . You may find that you break out in whiteheads and blackheads about as quickly as you clear up pimples . This is a problem with many other products , too , but there are acne treatment systems that do n't  have this side effect . <p> If you have severe acne , over 25 blemishes on your face , AcneFree is more likely to work if you also take a zinc supplement . Any kind of zinc is fine , but do n't  take more than 50 mg a day , because excess zinc can deplete your bodys supply of copper . People with oily skin acne report that the AcneFree system can leave their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate , or severe acne , always test any new acne treatment on a small area of skin before you put it all over your face . Its important to know whether you are allergic to a product before you put it all over your face . If you get itchy or burning skin after using AcneFree and there is not enough money in your budget to buy another acne care product , try using it as a spot treatment for pimples rather than all over your face . You will limit the side effects but still get some benefit from your purchase . <p> Or better yet , return unused product for a money-back refund . <p> No acne treatment product clears up your skin in 24 hours . The very best acne treatment systems may get rid of most of your blemishes in about 30 days . A more reliable acne treatment system that is likely to be a lot easier on your skin is Exposed Skin Care . <p> I 'm confused , its working really well , its clearing up my acne and everything , but lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and feels like a sunburn , I do n't  want it stop using it because it truthfully works , but I 'm getting tired of the burning . 19923 @qwx879923

@@98778810 @2978810/ <h> Toothpaste and Other Home Remedies for Acne 19922 @qwx879922 <p> One way to fight acne is by eliminating toothpaste and other personal care products that contain SLS . <p> Your toothpaste be aggravating acne at the corners of your mouth . It happens more often than most people realize , due to the presence of a chemical called SLS in most oral care products . <h> Summary : <p> Toothpaste can cause a condition known as acne cosmetica , or acne caused by personal care and skin care products . <p> One clinic found that 80% of adult women who had acne were able to clear up their skin by eliminating toothpaste and other personal care products that contained the ingredient sodium lauryl sulfate ( sodium dodecyl sulfate ) , also known as SLS . <p> Three other easily avoidable ingredients that many products include with SLS also cause breakouts . <h> What Is SLS ? <p> SLS is an abbreviation for a chemical known as sodium lauryl sulfate , a chemical compound that is also known as SDS , or sodium dodecyl sulfate . Outside North America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sulphate . " <p> SLS is a versatile sudsing agent . Mixed with water , it creates big bubbles that lift grease and grime off living and non-living surfaces . Its used in products that remove grease from heavy machinery , but it is also added to toothpaste to form bubbles that remove particles from teeth . <p> When SLS comes in contact with the skin or with the membranes of the mouth , these bubbles can dissolve the " glue " that holds skin and membrane tissues together . They dissolve ceramides and cholesterol so that individual cells are loosened from skin and mucous membranes . This kills the cells and damages the remaining tissue . <p> Sensitivity to SLS is genetically determined . There is a recessive gene on the X chromosome that determine the sensitivity of the skin and mucous membranes to SLS . Since the gene is recessive , it has to be inherited from both parents to be active . Since it is on the X chromosome , and women have two X chromosomes , it is primarily women ( and men who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive to SLS . <h> SLS Usually Mixed with Other Problem Ingredients <p> SLS is just one of several emulsifiers used in toothpaste . Many brands of toothpaste also contain butyl stearate or isopropyl myristate . Butyl stearate is a mild stimulant to the immune system . That sounds good , but in acne , the problem is that acne bacteria make surrounding tissues unusually susceptible to the inflammatory compounds that attack them . This causes the immune system to kill skin cells and let the bacteria flow to surrounding tissues or into the bloodstream . Butyl stearate makes acne more inflammatory . <p> The effects of butyl stearate are the same for both sexes . Storing personal care products in hot conditions ( over 104-F/ 40- C ) concentrates butyl stearate in the product . Butyl stearate is added to toothpaste to ensure that SLS does not make the toothpaste too foamy . Because of the way the ingredients work together , it is not always possible just to use less SLS and get the same result . <p> Isopropyl myristate is added to personal care products specifically to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they stay on them . In toothpaste , its added to make sure fluoride stays on enamel . If you use a product that contains isopropyl myristate and the other two chemicals , any effects on your skin are going to be a lot greater than if your product only contained the other two chemicals alone . <h> Toothpaste a Significant Contributor to Acne in Adult Women <p> Back in the 1970s , a group of American researchers found that eliminating all personal care products that contained SLS , butyl sterate , or isopropyl myristate greatly reduced the number of women coming to their clinic for treatment of a condition they termed " acne cosmetica . " Before the doctors started advising their adult women patients to avoid products with these ingredients , 25% of women had problem blemishes . After the doctors started advising patients to avoid products with these ingredients , only 5% continued to have acne . <p> SLS and related compounds may be the single greatest cause of adult acne in women , affecting even more women than polycystic ovarian disease ( PCOS ) or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brands of the contraceptive Pill . But how can one recognize whether a skin care or oral care product contains one of these acne-inducing ingredients ? <h> Recognizing Emulsifiers in Personal Care Products <p> Almost any brand of toothpaste contains SLS and can aggravate acne , especially at the corners of the mouth . If you tend to get tiny red pimples around the mouth , or if your rosacea sometimes flare right after you brush your teeth , SLS may be the problem . <p> It takes a little effort to find brands of toothpaste that do not contain SLS and other problem ingredients , but there are many choices in almost all retail outlets that offer toothpaste . Most brands listed retail for US $5 to $20 . Some choices include : <p> Toms of Maine toothpastes <p> Burts Bees Natural Toothpaste <p> Jason Natural Products Powersmile Toothpaste <p> Organix South Neem Toothpaste <p> Sensodyne Pronamel <p> Now Foods Xyliwhite <p> Biot+ne ( but read the label to make sure ) <p> Squigel Enamel Saver Toothpaste <p> Urtekram Organic Eucalyptus Toothpaste ( made in Denmark ) <p> These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of these products , the Organix South Neem Toothpaste is the only product that will help reverse and control inflammation caused by other toothpastes and personal care products .

If no redness develops , you are probably not sensitive to neem , and the product will help rather than hurt . <p> If you have problems with personal care products that contain SLS or any of the chemicals used with it , chances are you will also have problems with personal care products that contain a chemical called dithranol .

Other acne treatment systems focus on treating acne from the outside in . Zenmed offers products that can be applied to the skin to open pores and reverse discoloration of the skin , as well as products that replenish healthy bacteria in the digestive tract and fight inflammation . Let 's take a look at some of Zenmeds top selling products . <h> Summary : <p> Zenmed is an ethical company that offers its products with a 60-day guarantee . <p> Zenmed Dermacleanse is a good product for getting rid of blackheads and brown skin blemishes on oily , acne-prone skin . It has too many botanical ingredients for use by people who have sensitive skin . <p> Zenmed Facial Cleansing Gel contains botanicals that can cause allergies in about 30% of users . <p> Zenmed Acne Scar Treatment Kit can relieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin . Do n't  use it if you are allergic to parabens . <p> Zenmeds treatments for rosacea tend to get better results if your underlying problem is an infection . But youd get still better results just by treating the infection . <p> For mild to moderate common acne , Exposed Skin Care is more effective , less expensive , and comes with a better money-back guarantee . <h> Dermacleanse <p> Lots of acne products contain alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids intended to exfoliate the skin . Stripping away particles of dried skin that are " glued " to the surface of pores along with oxidized , black , unsightly skin oils opens pores and begins the healing process for whiteheads and blackheads . It also stimulates the production of collagen beneath the skin that fills in shallow scars , fine lines , and small wrinkles . <p> The problem with most acne products that list alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids is that they contain the wrong acid , or the right acid in the wrong concentration , or the right acid at the wrong pH . Zenmed Dermacleanse exfoliates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.5 " the right acid at the right concentration and the right pH for opening clogged pores . <p> Any product that has a pH of 3.5 can cause a little stinging and tingling of the skin . When you are using an exfoliant , stinging and tingling " although not burning and itching " are a sign the product is working . Just do n't  leave it on your skin if the feeling is uncomfortable . That is a sign the product is working " too hard " and can damage your skin . <p> Zenmed Dermacleanse works especially well for oily skin acne . If you have dry , sensitive skin , then the witch hazel extract and chlorhexidine might be a little too much " and if you have dry , sensitive skin , you are probably better off using a product made with glycolic acid rather than salicylic acid . <h> Gentle Facial Cleansing Gel for Acne Treatment and Prevention <p> Zenmeds Dermacleanse is great for oily skin and possibly problematic for sensitive skin . Zenmeds " Gentle " Facial Cleansing Gel might be OK if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-no if you have rosacea , eczema , contact dermatitis , or you just tend to break out when you put chemicals on your skin . <p> The problem with the Gentle Facial Cleansing Gel is that it contains a number of botanicals that can trigger allergic reactions in about 20% to 30% of the population . These include balsam tolu , which sometimes triggers severe allergic reactions , yarrow , which can trigger allergies in people who are allergic to ragweed , geranium oil , which can cause itching and irritation , essential oil of lavender , which works by breaking down the skin ( great for burns , awful for acne ) , and essential oil of tangerine , which smells good but can make the skin feel itchy . <h> Acne Scar Treatment Kit <p> Zenmeds Acne Scar Treatment Kit contains the cleanser described above plus a microdermabrasion complex that uses kaolin , montmorillonite , and ground walnut shells to rub off the topmost cells in the epidermis of the skin and encourage younger skin to come to the surface .

Its possible that this product would make small acne scars look better , but it is more likely to make your face break out with tiny new pimples . <h> Skin Eraser <p> Zenmeds Skin Eraser is intended to be used to remove the reminders of acne after it has healed , the brown spots and scars that are especially noticeable on brown or Asian skin .

But they are not likely to relieve redness , either . <p> In fact , the ylang ylang , lime oil , and geranium oil in this product may sometimes cause a rosacea breakout , especially in users who are sensitive to perfumes and fragrances . When rosacea is caused by a stomach infection with the the bacteria that also cause ulcers or a skin infection with tiny Demodex mites , this product may help .

Essential oils of sage , wild thyme , mint , and comfrey can irritate the skin just enough to stimulate increased formation of collagen , strengthening the skin and opening up pores . There are no ingredients in this formula that will get rid of body acne overnight , but it is a valid natural formula for body acne relief . <p> However , ZENMED Botanical Body Wash is a product you should not use on the skin of your face . Any kind of scrubbing fiber , such as ground walnut shells , can damage delicate pores in facial skin . There are at least 20 herbal ingredients in this formula that can cause allergies .

The salicylic acid in this formula will exfoliate dry , normal , or oily skin , and the herbal ingredients in the mask will leave a bracing , refreshed feeling on your face . <p> The possible downside to the ZENMED Botanical Acne Mask is the same as the possible downside for the ZENMED Botanical Body Wash .

Their products are available through skin care professionals and at spas throughout the United States , Australia , Canada , and Finland , but are not sold to the general public . This article can tell you what to expect from BiON products , and what to request from your skin care professional . <h> Summary : <p> BiON products are typically more concentrated and more effective than comparable products available over the counter . Because these products can also cause more side effects , they are only used under professional supervision . <p> No professional will offer every BiON product to every client or patient .

Even the best formulas can contain ingredients that do n't  work " or cause unexpected skin damage " in a few users . It may be that 99.9% of users will get great results but 0.1% will be sorry . And that 's the problem we have with some but by no means all of the Murad products for acne . <p> Its enough of a problem we feel have to say something for the public good , but we do want to put it in context . <p> Dr. Howard Murad is arguably one of the most knowledgeable dermatologists in the world today . A professor of medicine at the Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles , Dr. Howard is famous for designing a collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns . <p> Labeled a " Beauty Genius " by Elle Magazine , Dr. Murad has appeared on countless television programs and is the author of four books , including The Murad Method ( St. Martins Press , 2003 ) , Wrinkle-Free Forever : The 5-Minute 5-Week Dermatologists Program ( Griffin Trade Paperbacks , 2004 ) , The Cellulite Solution ( St. Martins Press , 2005 ) , and The Water Secret : the Cellular Breakthrough to Look and Feel 10 Years Younger ( Wiley , 2010 ) , which was a #1 bestseller at both Barnes and Noble and Amazon.com . <p> And the truth is , we think most of his products are great . We just have one problem , and its more than a peccadillo for many people who have Asian skin . Many Murad products lighten skin with hydroquinone . <h> What Is Hydroquinone and What Does It Do ? <p> Hydroquinone is a very mild organic acid . Traditionally , and still in China today , hydroquinone has been made by adding the metal manganese to aniline dye , the chemical that revolutionize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mass-produce cloth in shades of purple and mauve . In the rest of the world , hydroquinone is made from benzene in way that produces hydroquinone and acetone , the latter product better known as nail polish remover . <p> When hydroquinone is applied to the skin , it is absorbed into the melanocytes , skin cells that make skin pigment . Inside these cells , it binds with an enzyme called tyrosinase . Through a series of chemical reactions the combination of hydroquinone and tyrosinase turns into a trigger for the production of tissue-destructive antigens by the immune system , localized in the skin . These antigens destroy the melanocyte , and as more and more melanocytes are eliminated , dark spots turn lighter . <p> Hydroquinone begins to fade discoloration of the type left behind when acne heals after about a month . It takes another 4 to 12 months for the spot to fade away completely . Like most products that alter the appearance of the skin , there are various possible side effects . <p> Skin-to-skin contact with another person can cause their skin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanning or excessive sun exposure , and sun exposure can cause pigmentation to come back after the spot has been removed . The hydroquinone cream can run and fade pigment in skin that was already the right tone . It can cause drying and flaking of the skin and minor skin irritation . And it can cause spotting on the conjunctiva , the inner membranes of the eyelids . <p> But for some people who have Asian skin types , or Hispanic skin types , hydroquinone has a much more serious side effect . <h> Hydroquinone and Ochronosis <p> In ochronosis , the process of immune destruction is not limited just to the pigment-producing melanocytes . The melanocytes can fuse with nearby tissues to dye them black and blue . The collagen in in cartilage can be broken down , too , but in ochronosis , it is replaced by hydroxyapetite , the same mineral compound that is found in bone . Discoloration of the skin is likely to be permanent and is very literally more than skin deep . <p> Ochronosis can be triggered by either hydroquinone or resorcinol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This form of the disease is known as exogeneous ochronosis . <p> The condition can also occur as a result of a hereditary fault in the creation of tyrosinase . The hereditary form of the disease is known as endogeneous ochronosis . <p> Some people who have Asian skin types , especially Japanese people , may have mild cases of endogenous ochronosis that become cosmetically devastating when they are combined with exogeneous ochronosis triggered by the use of hydroquinone . Even products that contain just 2% hydroquinone can cause permanent changes in the skin . The majority of people who use these products will not develop ochronosis , but about 1 in 25,000 does . For that 1 in 25,000 , its a devastating condition . <h> Your Doctor May Not Know About Ochronosis <p> Hydroquinone is n't just for dermatologists any more . The medical literature encourages family practitioners to prescribe hydroquinone , too . One article written a team of dermatologists at Mt . Sinai Hospital in New York City ( none of them Dr. Murad ) entitled " Hydroquinone Therapy for Post-inflammatory Hyperpigmentation Secondary to Acne : Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Because steroids should not be applied to the face for prolonged periods , care should be taken when a hydroquinone cream containing a steroid is chosen . If post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation consists of a few lesions , spot therapy is useful . If post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation consists of many lesions , field therapy is favored . Safety concerns with hydroquinone consist only of occasional irritation , which can be suppressed with topical steroid or a short drug holiday . Physicians should feel comfortable to use hydroquinone without consulting a dermatologist . " <p> The article goes on to say that there are just 25 cases of exogeneous ochronosis in the USA every year , and when the condition has occurred in people who had Black skin , well , they were ignorant and they just used too much . The implication seems to be that only white people have problems with discoloration after acne , anyway . Of course , the exact opposite is true . Its primarily people who have Asian or African skin types who experience spotting of the skin after acne . And its primarily Japanese people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also relatively large numbers of people who have the problem in the Czech Republic and in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic . <h> So Are We Giving Dr. Murad a Bum Rap ? <p> But this brings us back to Dr. Murad . Murad skin care products are intended for use under no supervision at all . If you happen to use one of the many Murad products that contains hydroquinone , there would be no one to warn you about the potential problems of ochronosis until it became too late . <p> We can recommend many Murad products . We just caution you not to use the products that contain hydroquinone " especially if you are Japanese heritage or you have dark skin . Safer products that contain arbutin and kojic acid are likely to be better for you . <p> Hello there , Your website are really helpful , I 'm from Indonesia . I would like to ask some questions .

Some people just need to stop drinking hot cocoa and hot coffee , and like magic , they are cured . Some people get good results by taking special precautions to avoid sudden changes in temperature . Usually this means bundling up in cold weather , wearing face protection . And various medications and laser therapies work wonders " or do n't  work at all . <p> One of the more mysterious contributing causes of rosacea is a tiny mite known as Demodex . This microscopic creature is related to spiders and spider crabs , but its about 3/10 of a millimeter ( 1/100 of an inch ) long and it looks something like a itty bitty slug that was run over by a steamroller . There are two primary species of Demodex that live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair follicles , and there 's Demodex brevis , which lives in skin pores next to hair follicles . Both species are most common on the regions of skin where rosacea is most likely to break out , across the brow and around the nose . <p> For a long time , skin care scientists have known that some people who have rosacea have Demodex infestations in their skin and some people who have Demodex infestations in their skin have rosacea . What skin care scientists have had trouble figuring out is why some people who have rosacea have the little critters in the pores and some people who have rosacea do n't  . Scientists at the Xian Jiaotong University College of Medicine in China may have come up with the answer . <h> Like the Chicken and the Egg <p> Most researchers have looked at the question of whether Demodex infestations cause rosacea or whether rosacea creates a home for Demodex infestations . Its sort of like the old unanswerable question , " Which came first , the chicken or the egg ? " The researchers at Xian Jiaotong University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  just look at rosacea patients . They examined over 500 patients they identified as having Demodex in their facial skin . They they looked at the associated skin complaints . <p> The Chinese researchers found 860 people aged 12 to 84 being treated for some kind of skin problem . In this group , 539 had skin problems on their faces and 321 had skin problems elsewhere on their bodies . <p> The researchers also studied people who had healthy skin , and they found that essentially 100% of the population has at least a few Demodex mites in their skin . Only newborns are completely free of the mites , and they acquire them almost as soon as they are picked up by their mothers and other family members . However , the research team found that having fewer than 5 mites per square centimeter of skin ( 30 mites per square inch of skin ) was not associated with any risk of skin disease . <p> Of the entire group , 43% were infected with high concentrations of Demodex mites , more than 5 mites per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Demodex ? <p> People over 30 were more likely to have high concentrations of Demodex than people under 30 . <p> High concentrations of Demodex grew on either dry or oily skin , but not on normal skin . People who had dry skin were 60% more likely to have high concentrations of Demodex than people who had normal skin . People who had oily skin were 140% more likely to have high concentrations of Demodex than people who had normal skin . And people who had combination skin ( dry skin on the sides of the face but oily skin in the T-zone in the middle of the face ) were 160% more likely to have high concentrations of Demodex than people who had normal skin . <p> Rosacea was not the only skin condition associated with high concentrations of Demodex , although it was the skin condition most strongly associated with high concentrations of Demodex . People who had eczema were twice as likely to have high concentrations of Demodex in their skins as people who did not have eczema . People who had seborrhea were 2-1/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who did not . And people who had rosacea were 8 times as likely to have high concentrations of Demodex as people who did not . <p> Demodex do n't  like to live on normal skin . They prefer dry skin , or , even better , oily skin . So could moisturizing dry skin and reducing the oiliness of oily skin reduce the risk of rosacea ? <p> The Chinese scientists think so , but they think that its more important to deal with oily skin issues than it is with dry skin issues . They note that rosacea usually begins when the oil glands in the skin fully mature , at about age 30 , and tends to clear up on its own when the oil glands begin to stop making as much oil , at about age 60 . <p> They point out that the movement of the mites inside the pores of the skin irritates the skin , and the skin responds to irritation by producing still more oil .

Its especially important to blot oil along the creases of skin that can harbor the most mites . <p> Its also important to avoid drying out the skin .

New information from scientific researchers at Konkuk School of Medicine in Korea even suggests that trying to get rid of all the germs on your skin is not a good thing . <h> The Real Relationship Between Acne Bacteria and Acne <p> The microorganism most clearly identified with acne is a species of bacteria known as Propionibacterium acnes . Most inflamed blemishes ( pimples , papules , nodules , and cysts ) are infected with Propionibacterium acnes . The bacteria themselves , however , do n't  cause the inflammation and irritation we associated with acne . Redness , swelling , itching , and pain are actually caused by the immune systems reaction to these bacteria . The germs are capable of releasing " decoy " chemicals known as chemotaxins that can redirect inflammation away from bacteria and to healthy skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different species of bacteria that ordinarily live on the skin . Its only a problem when it gets trapped in pores . Bacterial infection is not the first step on acne . Before there is infection , there is hyperkeratinization . That means , the skin cells lining the walls of a pore grow too rapidly , and trap skin oils and bacteria inside . If there is no hyperkeratinization , there is no infection . <p> Fighting infection just reduces the need of the immune system to respond to it , at least in the case of Propionibacterium acnes . Its a different matter when the microorganism growing unchecked in a pore is a yeast of the genus Malassezia . <h> Yeast and Acne <p> Malassezia is group of yeasts that can grow on the skin . Usually , microorganisms in this group do n't  cause skin problems unless they grow in large numbers deep inside pores , and they usually do n't  penetrate pores at all .

And yeast may be the reason . <p> The Korean researchers mentioned earlier in this post discovered that yeast and acne bacteria usually do n't  coexist in the same pore . Malassezia seem to displace Propionibacterium acnes so that pimples do not form . Killing all the microorganisms on your face may kill some of the microbes that keep acne bacteria from taking over a pore . <p> Malassezia can also cause skin problems , usually a condition called folliculitis .

Blemishes caused by yeast infections are most common in middle-aged adults and in small children .

Sometimes skin blemishes that do n't  respond to acne treatment may actually be caused by yeast . <p> This means that getting rid of persistent acne may sometimes require anti-fungal treatment instead of antibiotic treatment . The clindamycin , tetracycline , minocycline , doxycycline and other antibiotic medications that are used to treat acne wont work when the problem is a yeast infection . In fact , by killing the natural competitors of yeast infections , they leave more food and oxygen for the yeasts to grow and may even make skin problems worse . <p> If you are an adult 30 years of age or older and you have not had success in treating acne that just wont go away , ask your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Malassezia infections of the skin typically are itchy .

However , the whey in milk stimulates the release of insulin and and substance called insulin-like growth factor-1 . The growth factor reaches the skin and locks on the to part of DNA that encodes a regulator gene so that it can not release the compounds that limit the skins production of sebum . The skin produces more sebum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackheads . If these pores are infected , they may also form pimples . <p> The same kind of result can occur after using large amounts of whey powder to make smoothies or eating protein bars after working out . The insulin-stimulating effects of whey are helpful after a workout , because the insulin that is released after eating the bar helps the muscles absorb the nutrients they need to remodel , enlarge , and strengthen themselves after they are stretched to their maximum capacity . But the effects on the skin are mostly detrimental . <h> Is It a Good Idea to Cut Out Milk from the Diet to Prevent Acne ? <p> All dairy products do n't  have the same effects on the skin . The whey fraction of milk stimulates about 50% more insulin production than cheese , and cheese stimulates about 12% more insulin production than milk . Whole milk , 2% milk , 1% milk , and skim milk , however , all have the same effect on insulin production and the skin . The fat in a dairy product has no bearing on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered , has no effect on acne at all " although margarine makes acne worse . <p> This means that teens who have acne need to avoid products that contain whey , such as : <p> Sports drinks , <p> Ricotta , and <p> Brown cheeses ( the kinds of brown cheeses that are especially popular in Scandinavia ) . <p> If there 's still a problem , then cut back on other kinds of cheese and finally on milk , ice cream , and yogurt . <p> There is , however , to have your whey and eat it , too . Work for it . The very best time to consume any kind of product containing whey is right after you work out doing resistance exercise , lifting weights or or doing any other activity that causes a " burn " in your muscles . For about two hours after this kind of workout , the muscles are about 50 times more sensitive than usual to insulin . They need insulin to help them absorb the glucose , amino acids , and water they need to repair damaged fibers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a workout helps your muscles and does n't  hurt your skin , but they need to be consumed during the first hour after your workout , not during or before . Its still OK to take other foods and beverages that do n't  contain dairy . <p> i have a dry skin , non of my family member have acne nor in there teen age time .. but i 'm the only sister whose havin acne from back almost 01 02 yrs .. yes i drink milk in morning on empty stomach and before going to sleep .. does this really cause my acne .. i mean sometyms .. my skin looks clearer bt .. sometyms i dnt even lyk to c my face in the mirror .. please advice me your best tips .. i fed up of my breakouts .. i 'm not at all having oily skin .. to wash my face in the morning i use demoviva soap for clearing my marks .. in night before sleep i use milk + n yellow daal .. n wash my face with it .. advice me with best tips plz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the soap you are using .

@@98778819 @2978819/ <h> Nanoparticles in Acne Care Products 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Nanoparticles of zinc oxide can aggregate under the skin and form permanent white spots in the skin . <p> Nanoparticles are the latest rage in acne care products . They are a hot selling point for cosmetics , too . <p> A nanoparticle is not just a tiny particle . Lots of acne care products contain " micronized " particles of their active ingredients , such as benzoyl peroxide for fighting acne bacteria or titanium dioxide for sun protection . A micronized ingredient is just an ingredient that has been milled , or ground , more than once . The particles are still large enough to see with the naked eye if you look closely enough . <p> A nanoparticle , however , is a particle that is too small to be seen with the naked eye . The " nano- " epithet in the name refers to its size in nanometers , or billionths of a meter . Most nanoparticles have a diameter of 1 to 100 nanometers , or from about 4 hundred-millionths of an inch wide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nanoparticle is so small that that it does n't  pick up a static charge , and it ca n't be removed by white blood cells if it gets inside the body . Many acne products that claim to use nanoparticle technology are actually just micronized , and they do n't  pose a danger if inhaled or swallowed or absorbed into the bloodstream . But acne products that use real nanoparticles pose a real risk of unintended side effects . <h> What Kinds of Skin Care Products Contain Nanoparticles ? <p> Makers of sunscreens are poised to use zinc oxide and titanium dioxide nanoparticles in nearly all mineral formulas for sun protection . <p> If you have acne , chances are you need sun block . As pimples heal , the skin uses a brown pigment called melanin as an antioxidant to stop inflammation . Once the pimple is gone , the brown pigment remains . Since melanin also protects against sunburn and sun damage to the skin , sun block keeps the skin from spotting after acne heals . <p> Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are great ingredients for sun block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are cheap . As they are traditionally used , they are non-toxic . They block UV-A , UV-B , and UV-C rays of the sun , offering much better skin protection than non-mineral sunscreen ingredients . <p> The problem with zinc oxide and titanium oxide is , as you may have noticed from observing lifeguards who use these products on their noses , is that they are white . Particles of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide cling to the skin . That 's fine if you have fair skin , but its really noticeable if you have dark brown or black skin . The net effect of white sun block on black skin is usually purple . And even though people who have dark skin do n't  sunburn as easily as people who have fair skin , they tend to have worse problems with skin discoloration after they have acne . <p> Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide in nanoparticle do n't  leave a white shadow or a purple tint on dark skin . And its well known that they are n't  poisonous . So what 's the downside of nanoparticles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Effects Gone Wrong <p> The major issue with zinc oxide nanoparticles is that they are too potently antimicrobial . The ability to fight bacteria would seem like a good thing . After all , zinc fights acne bacteria . The problem is that zinc oxide nanoparticles also kill useful bacteria on the face , and when they are rinsed off during swimming or in the shower , they get into the water supply and kill the plankton and algae that feed fish . The problem is serious enough that one country in the European Union , Sweden , has banned sun screens that contain these ingredients . No US government body restricts the use of nanoparticles in sun screens or other skin products , but manufacturers in the United States are voluntarily not using them until environmental studies have been completed . <p> But nanoparticles may also have adverse effects on the human body . Nanoparticles smaller than 13 nanometers in diameter are absorbed through the skin . They do n't  get very far , just to the lower layers of the skin . <p> Once nanoparticles are absorbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zinc oxide and titanium oxide can aggregate under the skin and form permanent white spots in the skin , particularly noticeable in darker skin . The innovation in skin care that prevents temporary changes in the color of dark skin may have the side effect of permanent changes in the color of dark skin . <h> A Safe Way to Use Nanoparticles in Skin Care ? <p> Nanoparticle technology is just too promising for skin care product manufacturers to abandon it without a fight . The next generation of nanoparticle technology may combine nanoparticles with liposomes to make them skin-safe and environmentally friendly . <p> A liposome is a hollow sphere , far too small to be seen without a microscope , made of a natural material called phosphatidylcholine . This is the substance that makes up most of the membrane surrounding a cell . Many vitamin and herb products use liposome technology so their active ingredients are more quickly and more completely absorbed . <p> Phosphatidylcholine liposomes are resistant to water and stick to the surface of the skin . They hold nanoparticles tight inside them so they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't  dissolve in water and are not likely to pose a threat to the environment . Cosmetics experts believe that nanoparticles in liposomes could make safe sunscreens for all skin types , but nanoparticle technology alone is not enough . <h> What to Do In the Meantime <p> If you live in Canada , Australia , or most of Europe , you may find sun blocks and acne care products that are labeled with the term " nano " on the package . If you have brown , Asian , or African skin , do n't  use them . They may cause permanent changes in the pigmentation of your skin . Wait for the next generation of skin care products made with nanoparticles in phosphatidylcholine liposomes before you use any kind of zinc oxide or titanium dioxide on your skin . <p> And if you see a product advertising that it contains " nanoparticles " of benzoyl peroxide for treating acne , do n't  believe it . All of these products are actually just finely ground , but not to nanoparticle size . Extended-release benzoyl peroxide , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that works for a much longer time with far less irritation to your skin . 19923 @qwx879923

Some products promise just that , but as the advertising usually says , " your results may vary . " Let 's take a look at some of the most popular acne pills and how they work . <h> Summary : <p> Vitamin B5 , also known as pantothenic acid , often makes a real difference in treating acne . But you can get it for less than US $10 for a 30-day supply . <p> There are several botanicals that help resolve acne , but you use them on your skin , you do n't  take them in the form of a pill . <p> Any product that fights " toxins " is probably a rip-off . Acne is not caused by toxins . <p> You will get better results from treating your skin from the outside with a collection of skin care products such as Exposed Skin Care . <h> Acnepril <p> The Acnepril acne pill promises a comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pill say it eliminates toxins . It provides essential vitamins and nutrients . And it provides a powerful antioxidant blend plus witch hazel to firm up your skin , all without benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid and for as little as $79.99 a bottle . <p> Wow ! That 's a lot of healing in a single product ! It seems almost too good to be true ! <p> And it is . For starters , the " toxins " that cause acne are inflammatory chemicals generated by the immune system itself , and they are generated in the skin . If you want to neutralize the toxins on your skin , you need to apply the product directly to your skin . You do n't  need to take a pill . <p> As for skin nutrients , there is a B-vitamin ( niacin ) deficiency disease called pellagra that can cause skin problems that are like acne but much , much worse . However , if you eat any kind of processed food in the USA , you get far more of this B-vitamin than you need . Niacin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to have both exposure to a fungus and the niacin deficiency to get this condition that nobody would confuse with acne . <p> What about antioxidants , then ? Green tea is a great antioxidant for the skin . It helps shrink the glands that make sebum so pores never get clogged in the first place . But to get this benefit , you apply green tea extracts to your skin , you do n't  take them as a pill . <p> Acnepril does not seem like a good value for US $79.99 . But its not the only acne pill on the market . <h> The Orovo Acne Pill <p> For just US $59.99 , the Orovo Acne Pill promises to fight acne both inside and out . You do n't  have rub the acne pills on your face . Orovo also sends you an exfoliating cleanser you can use in your daily skin care routine . But does it work ? <p> The main ingredient in the Orovo Acne Pill is " pantothen , " which is their nickname for pantothenic acid , also known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B5 in skin care . This B vitamin helps the skin form fibers that make it stronger with fewer layers . The fewer layers there are in the skin , the easier it is for pores to drain . ( The manufacturers explanation that pantothenic acid is essential to the formation of coenzyme A and that coenzyme A is essential for the metabolism of fat really does n't  explain any actual benefit for the skin . ) <p> The Orovo Acne pill also contains L-carnitine , which does not do anything that harms or helps the skin . <p> So why not plunk down your $59.99 for Orovo Acne Pills ? The main reason is that you can get vitamin B5 for about $55 a bottle less and it will work just as well . And there are also better skin cleansers . <h> Acneticin <p> With a name that sounds like an antibiotic , Acneticin promises to treat blotching , itchiness , and infected pimples . It promises to treat blackheads , zits , and persistent pimples , all from the " cellular level " of your skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( RDI ) of vitamin B5 , the same ingredient found in Orovo , plus about 333% of the RDI of another B vitamin , biotin .

( Most companies add botanical ingredients in various amounts to their formulas so that they can not be sued for patent infringement by the makers of competing brands . Buyers for retail chains may also insist that certain ingredients by listed on the side of the bottle . ) <p> The main botanical ingredient in Acneticin is dandelion . The makers of Acneticin correctly claim that dandelion greens contain more calcium than spinach . Still , since there is only 225 mg of dandelion in the recommended four capsules per day , even if dandelion were 100% calcium you could only get 225 mg of calcium per day , about 20% of what your body needs " and calcium has no special role in fighting acne . <p> The makers of Acneticin also claim that dandelion is a diuretic , which it is , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level , which it does n't  . All a diuretic does is to increase urination . Cells do n't  urinate . A diuretic does not magically draw toxins out of cells . <p> This product wont hurt your skin , and the vitamin B5 might even help your skin . You could get an equivalent dosage of the active ingredient at any health products store for about US $3 for 30 capsules . <h> Acnezine <p> Many acne products websites list Acnezine among their pills for acne . Actually , it is not a pill . It is a 5% benzoyl peroxide gel you can put on your skin to kill acne bacteria . It definitely will kill acne bacteria , but the overwhelming majority of users of this strength of benzoyl peroxide find skin irritation unacceptable and stop using the product . <h> The Bottom Line on Acne Pills <p> There are no nutritional supplements that are especially helpful treating acne .

@@98778823 @2978823/ <h> Does My Ethnic Skin Require Special Acne Care ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Different skin tones need different acne products to take care of the same skin condition . <p> I 've spent some time as a formulator of cosmetic products for American and Canadian companies that sell their formulas around the world . From time to time simply not knowing about ethnic skin and acne differences has created some very significant problems for the companies I serve . <p> One of my clients had a product that was very successful for removing lingering brown spots caused by acne for customers in China . The product got rave reviews . That is , until one day we got a hysterical phone call from our distributor . Women using the product were coming into her shop with even bigger brown spots on their faces . One woman had big purple blotches . And several reported shades of pink and green . <p> We were at a loss to imagine what had gone wrong . We could imagine that somebody put the wrong chemical into the vat on the assembly line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had released a massive load of toxic chemicals into the air while all of these customers were riding the bus to work . The chemical release combined with an otherwise safe ingredient in the skin lightening cream , but the combination only affected Han Chinese women , not any other women who used the product who were exposed to the toxic cloud . <h> Summary : <p> Skin tone makes a difference in choosing effective acne products . Darker skin is much more easily damaged by inflammation and irritation . <p> Women of Asian , African , Hispanic , and European descent sometimes need completely different products to take care of the same skin condition . <p> Folk wisdom about acne care can be very , very right or very , very wrong . Usually the skin care practices of one group do not translate very well to another . <p> Ethnic differences are important in successful skin care , especially for acne . This article will give you five examples of the most important ethnic and genetic skin care considerations . <h> 1 . Brown spots on the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A dermatologist in Phoenix , Arizona scheduled two patients the same afternoon for consultations about treating brown spots on the skin . Her first patient , Barbara , was an African-American woman who developed dark , brown spots on her skin where she had had pimples . Her second patient , Hilde , was a visitor to Arizona from Iceland who had broken out in freckles . <p> All kinds of skin use the pigment melanin to fight inflammation , but since most persons of African descent are endowed with a great deal of melanin in their skins , they tend to develop especially dark spots after acne . Any treatment that traumatizes the skin to get rid of brown spots actually makes the spots darker , or triggers a condition called vitiligo , which destroys all of the pigment in the skin . The dermatologist prescribed Barbara a very mild antioxidant cream that promised to lighten her brown spots very slowly , but without danger of creating even worse skin problems . <p> Brown spots on fair skin are a lot easier to treat . Because fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pigment melanin , irritation of the skin is very unlikely to cause permanent pigmentation . The doctor offered Hilde a laser treatment that would make her freckles a thing of the past in just a few days . <h> 2 . Detergent cleansers are hard on all skin types , but they are especially damaging to Japanese skin . <p> Many Asians , and especially many Japanese people , prefer to cleanse with oil-based bath and beauty products . They have to steer clear of any kind of shampoo , soap , or acne treatment that foams , and they should wear rubber gloves when using household cleaners to avoid acne-like bumps that are actually a form of hand eczema . <p> Most people of Japanese descent also have to avoid foaming benzoyl peroxide . A few may be able to tolerate foaming benzoyl peroxide applied to the back , but traditional herbal treatments , available anywhere in Japan and from the Tsumura company elsewhere in the world , are much more effective . <p> Many people from all over Asia and Africa suffer a hereditary enzyme deficiency that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discoloration of the skin , especially around the eyes and on the ears . The underlying problem is the lack of an enzyme that the body needs to use the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine , and a far more devastating ( but unnoticed ) symptom is cumulative damage to bones and joints . Surface ochronosis , causing bluing or blackening of the skin , however , is the symptom most likely to bring people to the doctors office . <p> The blue and black coloration of the skin occurs after exposure to benzene , certain industrial solvents , and hydroquinone , a compound often used to lighten the skin . Many African-American and Asian-American users of hydroquinone skin lighteners , trying to get rid of brown spots left behind after acne , are horrified the next morning to see black and blue spots where light brown spots were once the problem . There is an experimental medication for treating the enzyme deficiency , but there is no medical treatment for spots caused by inappropriate skin care treatment . <h> 4 . Gorgeous skin is not limited to any ethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " have the same dry , inflammation-resistant , tight skin of different shades and tones . The African-American film star Halle Berry , the Spanish actress Penelope Cruz , Kate Middleton who recently became the Duchess of York , Sophia Loren , and Lucy Liu all have the gorgeous skin that seems never to present any skin care problems . People of all races and ethnic groups can have this carefree skin , although it is relatively rare in northern Europe . <p> So what 's not to love about this kind of skin ? When people who have dry , tight , inflammation-resistant skin actually do get acne , its usually an especially severe case . Women who have this skin type may develop the dark black spots caused by acanthosis nigricans . There are no over-the-counter treatments that relieve the condition . Both men and women who have " gorgeous skin " are especially vulnerable to acne when their hormone levels fluctuate , whether its contraceptive use in women or testosterone use in- men . <h> 5 . Skin color does not make as big a difference in acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin are more likely to have dry skin , and people who have dark skin are more likely to have oily skin , but its possible for a person with fair skin to have a problem with shiny face and its possible for a person with dark brown to nearly black skin to have a dry skin problem in the desert . The distinction between dry and oily skin " referring to the oil on the skin , lying in the pores , not the oil in the skin " makes a big difference in choosing effective acne products . <p> People who have dry skin should use alpha-hydroxy acids to exfoliate the skin and open clogged pores . People who have oily skin should use beta-hydroxy acids to exfoliate the skin and open pores . <p> People who have dry skin are more likely to suffer skin irritation and less likely to have long-term discoloration of the skin as a result of it . People who have oily skin are less likely to suffer skin irritation and more likely to suffer long-term discoloration as a result of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foaming products .

@@98778824 @2978824/ <h> A New Frontier in Acne Medication 19922 @qwx879922 <p> The benefits of a new acne medication Zileuton , may not be worth the risks . <p> Dermatological researchers are investigating a new class of medications for treating acne . These drugs are know as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists , or PPAR agonists ( stimulants ) for short . This class of new acne treatments contains both great promise and great peril . Before you use them , you need to know about their potential benefits and side effects . Were sorry that this is a little technical , but if your doctor is prescribing you a drug called Zileuton , or if you take medication for type 2 diabetes and you have acne , this is information you need to know . <h> What Is a PPAR-Agonist ? <p> A PPAR-agonist really is not a medication that causes pain and suffering to PPAR . An agonist is the opposite of an antagonist . A PPAR-agonist makes PPAR more active . But what is PPAR ? <p> A peroxisome is an organelle ( or miniature organ ) in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form that the cell can use for fuel . It also creates enzymes that enable the cell to use many of the essential amino acids . Many biologists believe that peroxisomes are " permanent symbiotes " that perform some of the functions of symbiotic bacteria but that are purely human tissue . <p> A peroxisome proliferator is a chemical factor that causes another part of the cell know as the endoplasmic reticulum to create new peroxisomes . These peroxisome proliferators can activate receptors that switch on metabolic processes that use fats and amino acids . <p> Different kinds of tissues have different kinds of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors . The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-alpha are found in liver , kidney , heart , and fat cells . -Beta and -delta receptors are found in the brain and skin . -Gamma1 receptors are found all over the body . -Gamma2 receptors are found in fat tissue . -Gamma3 receptors are found in fat and in the large intestine . <p> The nomenclature gets a little hard to follow . What is important to remember that these compounds " flip a switch " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good thing . Sometimes its not . <h> Early PPAR-Agonists in Medicine <p> Medications in this class became standard treatment for diabetics about 1997 . One of the early PPAR-alpha agonists was a drug called Rezulin . It activated cells in the liver to store sugar taken out of the bloodstream . At first it appeared that the drug made control of diabetes effortless . All you had to do was to take the pill and your liver stored all that sugar you otherwise would have to cut out of your diet . <p> It turned out that there were limits to how much sugar the liver could store , and thousands of diabetics taking the drug developed liver failure . Hundreds died . But that did n't  stop the pharmaceutical industry from coming out with two more PPAR-alpha agonists called Actos and Avandia . <p> You may have heard the story about these medications . At first it seemed like they too would be miracle drugs for diabetes . What doctors did not realize until their patients started gaining 30 to 100 pounds without changing their diets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells store sugar taken out of the bloodstream , but that changed stem cells into fat cells . The adult stem cells the body generates to renew blood and bone were being transformed into fat . The stem cells it uses to repair the heart were also being transformed into fat . <p> Diabetics became morbidly obese without eating huge amounts of food . Many developed osteoporosis or anemia or congestive heart failure . Many suffered the indignity of being blamed for their health problems , and some self-righteous doctors stopped treating their patients altogether . <p> Actos and Avandia now have " black box " warnings . Rezulin has been banned . So the pharmaceutical industry is now looking to reinvent this class of medications in skin care . <h> Antagonists for Acne <p> PPAR-agonists , which stimulate gene activity , have mostly turned out to be disasters . The pharmaceutical industry now is experimenting with PPAR-antagonists , which turn genes off . <p> One of these PPAR-antagonists is a drug called Zileuton . It switches off the genes that are involved in the creation of a class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leukotriene called LBT4 . <p> This is the substance that causes inflammation in acne . If you do n't  have inflammation , pimples begin to heal , cysts and nodules begin to shrink , and blackheads and whiteheads never get started . You might still have a problem with your pores closing because the skin in the lining of the pores grows too fast , and you still might have a problem with excessive sebum production , but one of the most important phases of the formation of acne just might be brought under control if acne patients were given Zileuton . And scientists have recently discovered that Zileuton seems to slow down skin oil production , too . <h> What could possibly go wrong ? <p> When Zileuton is used to treat asthma , the most common side effect is headache . About 1 in 4 users of Zileuton develops cluster headaches . There are also people who develop nausea , vomiting , heartburn , or mild liver damage , as well as some who become depressed . The drug is not recommended for people who are heavy drinkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not known to be safe for women who are breastfeeding or pregnant . <p> The pharmaceutical industry did not know about the potential of Rezulin to cause deaths from liver failure before it was released and the pharmaceutical industry did not about the potential of Actos and Avandia to cause deaths from congestive heart failure before they were released . It seems like an awful risk to take Zileuton for acne . <p> And there are much simpler and safer ( not to mention cheaper ) treatments that do a better job of treating acne inflammation . One of them is salicylic acid , which is chemically related to aspirin . Salicylic acid is the only beta-hydroxy acid used in skin care . It relieves redness and inflammation , but that is not all . <p> Salicylic acid lifts dead skin off the surface of pores . It makes the natural color of the skin more visible . It helps pores drain . It stimulates the production of collagen underneath scars to help heal them from the inside out . <p> You can spend $20 for a beta-hydroxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might not . The time for Zileuton in acne treatment just has not yet arrived . Wait another 10 years to make sure that it does not cause horrible side effects . 19923 @qwx879923

If you are of native African heritage , you probably do not want to try any kind of laser treatment except the cool laser therapies available for at-home use , and even then you will need to be careful to avoid overheating the skin . <h> Cool Lasers vs . Hot Lasers <p> The unique advantage of laser therapies for acne is that the operator of the laser can choose the intensity of the treatment , targeting exactly the layer of the skin that is most important to changing the texture and contours of the skin . Low-power laser therapies are usually referred to as " cool , " while higher-power laser therapies are known as " hot . " Cool lasers act by heating water in blood plasma , while hot lasers activate hemoglobin in red blood cells . Cool Lasers for At-Home Use <p> When people see advertisements for at-home laser treatments for acne , they usually have a mental image of pointing a laser at a pimple and zapping it with energy to make it fall right off the face . This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , any healing after use of an at-home laser therapy device will be accomplished by the skin itself . <p> At-home laser kits generate just enough power to stimulate the circulation of fluids beneath the skin. - The water in blood plasma warms up slightly so blood flows faster through the skin . This allows the skin to circulate more inflammatory substances out and more oxygen and nutrients in . <p> Acne-affected skin is pushed to the surface and dies , gradually replaced by skin beneath it. - Sometimes this is all that is needed to clear up blemishes , although the process is not very helpful for scars . Many users of home acne laser treatment kits find the initial $100 to $300 expense to be a very worthwhile investment . <h> The Medical Office Version of Cool Laser Acne Therapy <p> There is also a more powerful " cool " laser used in dermatologist offices . This laser also works by heating water in the blood circulating in the skin . The doctors office version of the cool laser is designed to bring water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the boiling point . Just 30 millionths of an inch ( about 0.00012 mm ) of skin is affected , but that is enough to kill blood cells and interrupt circulation of fluids beneath the skin . Acne-affected skin on the surface dies and falls off , and almost always grows back smooth . <p> Home acne laser treatment is essentially painless . There is no need for time off from work , and the procedure can be repeated several times a week as directed by the manufacturer . ( More is not always better , especially if you have dark skin tones . ) <p> Cool laser treatment at the dermatologists- clinic is not as painful as other treatment alternatives , but a lot more painful than home treatment with cool laser . When treated with cool laser at the dermatologist office , the skin may be raw , red , and painful for 2 or 3 days , but people who have a procedure on Thursday usually can go back to work on Monday . Your skin may be especially sensitive to the sun for several months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment to keep your skin smooth . <h> Hot Lasers in the Doctors Office <p> Dermatologists use " hot " lasers to direct higher levels of energy to precise layers of skin . The idea is to heat a very thin layer of tissue so quickly that the heat does not have time to spread to surrounding tissues before the laser is turned off . That is why lasers used in acne skin care are typically of the " pulsing " variety . <p> The earliest lasers were designed to stop the production of collagen beneath skin with protruding acne scars . The scar sank back down to the level of the surrounding skin and then could be masked with makeup . Doctors at first used what was called a continuous wave **33;281;TOOLONG or YAG laser , but the scars treated with YAG laser therapy tended to come back in a few months . The YAG laser was replaced with a carbon dioxide laser , but scars universally returned in about a year . <p> In the 1990s , dermatologists began using a pulsed dye laser that could be fine-tuned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in millionths of an inch . With the pulsed dye laser , scar treatments tend to last for several years . Refinements of the technique now allow scar treatment to be essentially permanent , with minimal risk of damage to surrounding tissues . <p> Hot lasers heat hemoglobin rather than water . They zero in on the first blood vessel underneath an acne scar , cauterizing it , and stopping the regrowth of the scar . The darker the skin above the blood vessel , however , the more heat is absorbed in the surface of the skin rather than in the blood vessel below it , so that the skin itself can be severely damaged by the laser . <h> What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Laser Treatment <p> What your doctor may not remember to tell you about hot laser treatment is that certain foods and medications can increase the photosensitivity of your skin so that heating spreads to tissues where it is not supposed to go . The high blood pressure medications known as ACE-inhibitors ( usually drugs that end in -il , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the skin to light . St. Johns wort , psoralea , dong quai , angelica , and vegetables in the carrot family also increase the sensitivity of the skin to light . Light-sensitive skin is more likely to be burned during the procedure and more likely to produce a " sloppy " result from the acne laser treatment . <p> If you have an inflammatory skin condition , such as cystic acne , psoriasis , or eczema , laser treatment may make it worse ( where the laser is used ) . And if you have a viral skin infection , such as herpes or cold sores , exposure to laser light may activate the virus and cause inflammation that is far worse than acne . It is important that your doctor starts work at the bottom of your face , to maintain the greatest possible flexibility of your facial skin . <p> It is extremely important to follow the doctors orders exactly after the procedure . It is never a good idea to use a detergent cleanser on skin recently treated with laser . It is always essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks after the procedure . ( These precautions are not necessary with at-home acne laser treatment . ) <p> Even when nothing goes wrong , acne laser treatments are almost never 100% effective . They do not result in perfect skin . Compared to competing methods , however , acne laser treatments are faster and much more nearly pain-free , producing lasting results . 19923 @qwx879923

After a few months or maybe a year , they accumulate a huge set of skin care products that do n't  work , and for which they can not get their money back . <p> There is a better way to buy acne care products that will actually get results : Buy your skin care products in the form of an acne care kit , and buy them from the same source , so you can easily get your money back when something does not work and so you can know all the products you use on your face are compatible . Whichever acne care system you choose , there are ten basic products that help you get rid of acne for good . <h> Summary : <p> Getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same source saves time and money . <p> Every acne care kit needs to include a cleanser you can use once or twice a day without irritating your skin . <p> Every acne care kit needs to include an alpha-hydroxy acid or beta-hydroxy acid tonic that you can use several times a week to remove dead skin and to stimulate activity of the basal layers of your skin to keep pores open . <p> Every acne care kit needs to include a skin clearing complex that reduces redness and inflammation of the skin . <p> People who have acne also benefit from microdermabrasion cloths and crystals , clarifying masks , probiotics , and sunscreen . <p> Exposed Skin Care offers great quality at a great price . <h> 1 . Every acne kit needs to include a good cleanser . <p> No amount of cleansing gets rid of acne once you 've got it . That requires some other products that will be mentioned in a moment . But gently cleansing your skin once or twice a day , removing excess oil and makeup , will help keep acne from getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleansers can actually make acne-prone skin worse . Big bubbles can dry out your skin . Chemical ingredients can make your skin break out . You need a cleanser that makes a foamy lather of small bubbles you can place on your skin to get grease and grime off without having to rub or scrub . Let your cleanser do all the work . <h> 2 . Every acne kit needs to include a good clearing tonic . <p> Acne is n't caused just by the production of oily sebum in your pores . Acne is caused by the accumulation of oily sebum and acne bacteria underneath clumps of dead skin in pores . Cleansers do n't  break up the " glue " holding dead skin cells together in pores . For that you need a good clearing tonic that contains alpha- and/or beta-hydroxy acids . <p> The most commonly used alpha-hydroxy acid is glycolic acid . Glycolic acid breaks up clumps of dead skin on the surface of your skin and in pores . It helps pores drain freely and also makes room for younger skin cells to emerge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture and deeper natural color . <h> 3 . Every acne kit needs to include a skin clearing serum . <p> Serums offer a third kind of acne treatment for your skin . Azelaic acid , for example , can both reduce redness and help break up the hardened oils the clog pores and make whiteheads and blackheads . If you a tendency to redness when your skin is warmed , either by coming in from the cold or by drinking a hot beverage , acne serums that contain azelaic acid and gotu kola can be very useful for " calming " the skin . <h> 4 . Every acne kit needs to include a moisture complex . <p> Moisturizers keep the skin soft and flexible . They do n't  add oil to the skin . In fact , they help pores drain oil off the skin by relaxing the skin around the pore . But many products that are labeled as moisturizers actually make the skin dryer . <p> Its important that your moisturizer does not contain isopropyl alcohol . Many products contain enough isopropyl alcohol to make your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top layer of cells has been killed and will dry out " but not enough alcohol actually to kill acne bacteria . They offer the worst possible acne treatment . <p> Instead , moisturize your skin with products that contain ingredients such as dimethicone and siloxane . These ingredients lock moisture in your skin so it is more resistant to dry air and sun . The best moisturizers also contain herbal ingredients like green tea ( Camelia sinensis ) extract , which reduces the production of oil in pores while dimethicone keeps moisture in surrounding skin . <h> 5 . Nearly everyone also can benefit from benzoyl peroxide . <p> Benzoyl peroxide kills acne bacteria . Its offered in both over-the-counter and prescription strengths . Over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide ( most commonly 2-4% strength ) kills bacteria fast but does not irritate the skin . Prescription benzoyl peroxide ( most commonly 5% or stronger ) kills massive numbers of bacteria but nearly always also causes peeling , flaking , itching , and redness " so much that very few people can use prescription-strength benzoyl peroxide for more than a day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benzoyl peroxide gel is enough to kill the bacteria in pimples but not so much that it gives you a different set of skin care problems . An acne treatment serum with 2.5% benzoyl peroxide is a great thing to keep on hand to treat pimples at the first sign of infection to keep them from getting out of control . Just be careful not to bleach your clothes or your hair by contact with the product . <p> These first five products are acne care essentials . But there are five more products that can help you clear up lingering skin care issues even after acne is gone . <p> Microdermabrasion is a process of removing dead skin and maybe the first one or two of the top 25 layers of cells at the surface of your skin . It reduces pigmentation that may be left when acne heals , and it softens the edges of scars . <p> The safest , easiest , and least expensive way to do microdermabrasion is to use a microdermabrasion cloth . You rub the polyethylene cloth over your skin for 30 seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a big difference the first time you use the cloth , but over a few weeks you will notice discoloration fading and the surface of your skin becoming more matte . You may also notice fewer whiteheads and blackheads even if you do not use other skin treatments . <h> 7 . A clarifying mask lifts dead skin and excess oil off the surface of your face . <p> The most common ingredient in clarifying masks is , ironically , sterile medicinal clay , also known as mud . Clarifying masks are also made with a variety of plant ingredients . You paint a mask over your face , allow it to dry , and then peel off the mask with dead skin and excess skin oils . Then you rinse your face with warm water and pat your skin dry with a clean towel . Your skins natural colors should be deeper , and there should be a reduced shine on your skin . <h> 8 . A microderm scrub can complement a microdermabrasion cloth . <p> Microderm scrubs use aluminum oxide crystals to remove old and dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your skin vigorously . It only takes a very gentle action for a few seconds for the crystals to do their work . Be sure to rinse your skin thoroughly after using the crystals to avoid redness and irritation . <h> 9 . Probiotics help heal acne from the inside out . <p> Probiotics are friendly bacteria , like those found in yogurt . Building up the number of friendly bacteria in your lower digestive tract trains your immune system to respond to " infection " with a minimum of irritation , and the trained immune cells later circulate to your skin . If you take probiotic supplements , your skin wont get as red when pimples break out . Capsules are preferable to eating yogurt because more bacteria survive passage through the stomach . <h> 10 .

@@98778828 @2978828/ <h> Can a Supplement Help Cure Your Acne ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> You can spend a small fortune on just one acne supplement . Some products cost as much as $99.99 a month . But understanding how supplement makers market their wares can help you recognize both rip offs and bargains . <h> Summary : <p> Most of the time an " acne supplement " is a rip off . <p> Any product that contains more than three ingredients has probably been formulated to defeat claims of patent infringement , rather than to help clear your skin . <p> Three acne supplements really do help your skin , zinc , probiotics , and vitamin B5 , but you do n't  need to take all three . <p> Do n't  pay more than $19.99 for a months supply of any supplement . <p> For fastest and longest lasting results in fighting acne , spend your money on an acne treatment system like Exposed Skin Care . <h> Supplement Makers Usually Are n't  in the Business to Help You Get Well <p> There are actually some supplement makers who are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they believe they are the missing link in healthcare . Ethical Formulas , for example , really is ethical . The Life Extension Institute , really does care about providing high-quality supplements that can help you live longer and live better . <p> The creepy infomercial gurus , however , really do n't  care about whether you get better or not , as long as your credit care information works . <p> Let 's look at a not-so-hypothetical acne supplement for which you might be asked to pay as much as $99.99 a month . The formulator at Get Rich Fast , Inc. , knows that vitamin B5 ( which is also known as pantothenic ) really can sometimes help the growth of skin . Those times are when skin cells are cultured in test tubes , but the company can say that that it helps heal acne because adding B5 to cultures of skin cells increased the rate at which they released collagen , and collagen helps support healing of skin underneath acne scars . Whether B5 really helps support healing of acne scars there 's no way of knowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USA ) would tell your spokesman that he has a First Amendment Right to express an opinion that it does . <p> But potential customers can get their daily recommended intake of supplemental vitamin B5 for just $3 a month , and there is not a lot of profit in that . So the next thing the formulator does is to start adding other ingredients . <p> Everybody knows vitamin C is vital , and its even cheaper than vitamin B5 , so add dose of that . People more or less know that dandelion greens are good for you , so add a tiny amount of dried dandelions . You can even say , truthfully , that a pound of dandelion greens contains more calcium than a pound of cheese . Of course , because you are only putting 50 milligrams of dried dandelion greens in a capsule , the herb would have be 2000% calcium to provide the daily requirements of calcium , but you are counting on customers not paying attention to that fact . <p> Then formulators need to protect their bosses from all the get-rich-quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their formulas . To protect your company from claims of patent infringement , you add teeny , tiny bits of dozens of herbs to a formula without disclosing the exact amounts . That way , no matter what some other company claims about your formula in court , you can show that you are really making a different product . <p> There are supplement makers who make more money suing their competitors than they earn from the sales of their products . <p> Next you recruit a TV producer who can help your company spokesman develop a compelling story for your product . One famous late-night commercial featured a spokesman sporting a mullet ( he s actually bald , its a toupee ) , telling an interviewer about the beauty of his four-year-old daughters bowel movements . Exactly what type of viewer keeps listening to that story is hard to imagine , but it is apparently also the kind that will spend $39.99 or $59.99 or $99.99 a month on supplements without knowing what they are for or how they work . Then you get the callers credit card number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle to make , including the bottle " until the credit card number does not work any more . <p> Does it sound like there are potential pitfalls in choosing the right acne supplement ? There are ! However , even though some supplements are total rip offs , there really are some supplements that work for most cases of acne . <h> Zinc for Reducing Inflammation <p> Zinc helps the body make enzymes that put the breaks on acne inflammation . And although it is rare for anyone to suffer a vitamin deficiency , certain minerals like zinc sometimes are deficient in modern diets . <p> The solution to zinc deficiency is simple . Take a zinc supplement . Zinc gluconate and zinc monomethionine are better absorbed from the digestive tract ( and more expensive as supplements ) , but your body can absorb the zinc in much less expensive forms of zinc such as zinc acetate and zinc carbonate . <p> Copper does interfere with the absorption of zinc , and vice versa .

Do n't  take more than 50 mg of zinc per day " taking more can deplete zinc and cause a different set of health problems . You should not pay more than $5 a month for any zinc supplement . <h> Probiotics for Reducing Inflammation <p> For about a century , the recommended treatment for acne was bakers yeast . Grey , slimy , crumbly squares of bakers yeast were eaten whole by millions of acne sufferers to reduce acne inflammation " and they worked . Nowadays most people would prefer to consume the healthy , probiotic bacteria found in yogurt and probiotic supplements . They work by training the immune system to respond to bacterial infection ( the probiotic bacteria in your digestive tract form a harmless infection ) with less force . Acne bacteria then trigger less inflammation in your skin . <p> You can get all the probiotics you need by eating small servings of yogurt several times a day , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  eat yogurt , you can take capsules of probiotic bacteria 2 or 3 times a day . But you should not pay more than $20 a month for either product . <h> Other Acne Supplements <p> Antioxidants are frequently recommended for acne " but your skin responds to them much more completely if they applied directly to the skin . Alpha-lipoic acid , ascorbyl palmitate , and retinol all help the skin " but they break down very quickly in any product in a clear container or a jar . You may get some benefit from alpha-lipoic acid supplements if you have sagging skin that tends to form outward-facing acne scars , but products you apply to your skin will always get you faster results than products you take by mouth . <p> Acne supplements form only a small role in clearing up blemish-prone skin .

But does Dermagist really do the job ? <h> Summary : <p> Dermagist markets a two-part acne treatment system . <p> Both of the Dermagist products contain the antioxidant resveratrol . <p> There is credible evidence that resveratrol can be a potent remedy for pimples and blemished skin . <p> The problem with Dermagist is that it contains other ingredients that can irritate the skin . <p> If you have rosacea or if you have sensitive skin , you really should use another acne treatment system , such as Exposed Skin Care . <p> If you never get redness from skin care products , give Dermagist a try . <h> What Is In Dermagist ? <p> The first step of the Dermagist two-step acne treatment system consists of its Clarifying Cleanser and Detoxifying Cream , both formulated with resveratrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better environment " for treating acne than " a common used ingredient , " making reference to a study supposedly conducted at Oxford University in England .

The Detoxifying Cream contains resveratrol with chamomile , aloe vera gel , and shea butter . The two products are available for US $79.99 , with a discounted price of $119.99 if you buy a two-month supply with your order . <h> Does Resveratrol Really Clear Up Acne ? <p> It takes a little effort to decipher the labels of the Dermagist Clarifying Cleanser and Detoxifying Cream . The first listed ingredient in both product is " aqua , " or water . Its actually a good thing to use water-based products rather than alcohol-based products on your skin . Water rehydrates your skin without irritating your skin , while alcohol can increase production of sebum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferment " extract . Resveratrol is an antioxidant made by red grapes when they are attacked by fungi or bacteria . There are only tiny amounts of resveratrol in grapes , grape juice , or red wine , only about 1 mg in a standard 187-ml glass of wine . Most of the resveratrol used in supplements and skin care products is extracted from a plant known as Japanese knotweed . <p> The treatment of acne is one of the new applications of resveratrol that has actually been clinically tested . Dermatological researchers at the University of Naples in Italy recruited 20 volunteers to receive treatment with resveratrol and a hydrating gel . A resveratrol cream was applied to one side of the face for 30 days , and a moisturizer to the other . Usually these kinds of tests count the number of pimples eliminated by a product , but since the two products were used side by side on the faces of each volunteer , the researchers measured reduction of the area of skin covered by acne blemishes . <p> Using a moisturizer for 30 days reduced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using resveratrol cream for 30 days reduced the average area of skin covered by blemishes by 57.3% . Resveratrol does not get rid of all blemishes , but it makes existing blemishes much less noticeable , or at least this is the early indication of research . Ideally , other laboratories studying larger numbers of volunteers are needed to confirm the results of this first study . <h> What About the Other Ingredients in the Dermagist Cleanser ? <p> The Dermagist cleansers second-named ingredient is sodium coco sulphate . This is another term for sodium lauryl sulfate , better known as SLS . Sodium coco sulphate is derived from coconut oil , but it acts in exactly the same way as SLS , which is used to keep all the ingredients in the product mixed together . <p> Most tweens and teens do n't  have a negative reaction to SLS . Most adult women do . One study even found that 80% of adult women who had acne could clear up blemishes just by avoiding all products that contain this ingredient . SLS is especially likely to cause chin acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which causes allergic reactions in about 47% of people who use it , and chamomile oil , which relieves redness of the face and stops allergic reactions . Dermagist cleanser clearly is not a product for acne sufferers who have sensitive skin , but what about the ingredients in the clarifying cream ? <h> What About the Other Ingredients in Dermagist Acne Clarifying Cream ? <p> The main ingredients in Dermagists clarifying cream are water and cetearyl olivate . Water , as mentioned earlier , hydrates and soothes the skin . You can get some shrinkage of the blemishes on your face just by using a water-based moisturizer . <p> " Cetaryl olivate " is a olive-oil based form of a chemical known as cetostearyl alcohol . It is used as a stabilizing agent . Most people do not have any kind of adverse reaction to this ingredient , but it can cause contact dermatitis , with itching , redness , oozing , and peeling of the skin . <p> The third-named ingredient in the clarifying cream is isopropyl palmitate . A moisturizer and a thickening agent , isopropyl palmitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The clarifying cream also contains the B vitamin niacin in the form of niacinamide , and vitamin E in the form of tocopheryl acetate . Niacinamide reduces both general inflammation and sensitivity to the sun . Tocopheryl acetate can amplify the effects of benzoyl peroxide , making it more effective on the skin , but also protect the skin from excessive pigmentation forming as acne heals . <h> Does the Dermagist System Work ? <p> Dermagist contains one great skin care ingredient " resveratrol " with a number of potentially harmful skin care ingredients , such as sodium lauryl sulfate and cetostearyl alcohol ( although under misleading names ) , along with isopropyl palmitate . The question is whether the benefits of resveratrol outweigh the side effects of many of the other ingredients in the acne care system . <p> If you have sensitive skin , they probably do not .

Its important that the cleanser does not dry out the skin , since acne begins when dead skin begins to accumulate and clump on top of oil inside pores .

The Clearing Tonic also contains a small amount of witch hazel extract . Its not a good idea to use witch hazel extract before you cleanse your skin because it seals the skin . But if you have already removed excess oils from your skin with a cleanser , then its OK to keep oil locked deep inside the pore where it does not come in contact with dead skin that can form clogs . <p> Its also important to fight inflammation in the skin . Exposed Skin Cares Treatment Serum calms irritation-prone skin with azelaic acid . If you have sensitive skin , azelaic acid will help stop redness and inflammation , especially on the nose and across the cheeks .

@@98778832 @2978832/ <h> ShopSmart on Acne Products 19922 @qwx879922 <p> In order to get the best results when fighting acne , its best to use a multifaceted treatment . <p> For over 75 years , American shoppers have relied on the monthly reports of consumer product values published in Consumer Reports . Printed by the American Consumers Union , Consumer Reports buys and tests products in its own laboratories and publishes the results in its magazine , which is read by 7.3 million people . In 2006 , Consumer Reports launched it ShopSmart guide , which recently reviewed a few of the top acne skin care products . Heres what ShopSmart had to say for American readers . <p> Since ProActiv markets a benzoyl peroxide product with endorsements from Justin Bieber and Katy Perry , and AcneFree claims to be the top brand , ShopSmart compared the more expensive ProActiv and AcneFree products against a much cheaper brand called OxyMaximum . There is considerable difference in cost : <p> ProActiv charges $20 for a kit that lasts about a month . The kit includes a face wash containing 2.5% benzoyl peroxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toner . ProActiv is available online and at kiosks in shopping malls . AcneFree charges $20 for a kit that lasts about two months . The kit includes a wash containing 2.5% benzoyl peroxide and a repair lotion containing 3.7% benzoyl peroxide , plus a toner . AcneFree is available at drugstores and discount stores . OxyMaximum charges $10 for a bottle of face wash that lasts about three months . There is an explicit warning that the face wash might cause some irritation on sensitive skin . OxyMaximum is available online and at drug stores and discount retailers . <p> The ShopSmart review informed readers that none of the products got rid of all pimples for anyone who tested it , and that all of the products got rid of at least 40% of pimples for anyone who tested it . The parent publication also ran a story about a columnist whose son asked his acne dermatologist three questions : <p> Does benzoyl peroxide stop pimples ? The doctor answered " Probably . " <p> Does popping pimples cause scars ? The doctor answered " Probably . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Absolutely not . " <p> But there 's a lot to the story that got left out . Consumers Union did n't  run a controlled test . They just gave samples of the products to people who had acne and told them to see how they worked out . Its possible that none of the products had any effect at all , and all the changes were due to better basic skin care and avoiding chocolate . <p> The story does n't  mention whether any of the products caused side effects . A 10% benzoyl peroxide gel , or , for that matter , a 5% benzoyl peroxide gel , usually causes itching , inflammation , drying , and peeling skin . A 10% benzoyl peroxide wash does not because it is off the skin almost as soon as it is put on . A 2.5% gel usually does kill acne bacteria without damaging the skin , although the 2.5% face washes offered by ProActiv and AcneFree are also of questionable value . <p> ShopSmart just did n't  run a scientific test . And they know it . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only type of acne product tested . <p> The ShopSmart testers also looked into the effectiveness of a set of products known as " zit zappers . " They tested two of the most heavily advertised skin heating devices , asking 26 volunteers to use the test device to treat pimples on one side of their faces for two days . ShopSmart tested : <p> The Zeno Spot , which costs $40 for 80 uses . The Hot Spot is advertised as suitable for treating a few pimples at a time with the advice " if you do n't  have a lot of pimples , you do n't  need anything else . " Hot Spot is sold online and in drugstores and discount stores . No ! No ! Skin , which costs $180 . Advertised as the right device for people who have lots of outbreaks , its selling point is that it can be cheaper over the long run because its rechargeable . No ! No ! Skin is available online and in drugstores and discount stores . <p> ShopSmart reports that the devices erased blemishes about 13% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , were a little surprised that these devices worked even that well . But we would consider them just about the worst possible way to spend your acne treatment dollars . <p> The kind of acne treatment that works is always multifaceted . If you go to a dermatologist , chances are you wont be given just an antibiotic or just a retinoid treatment like Accutane . You are far more likely to be prescribed one or two antibiotics plus benzoyl peroxide to get rid of any acne bacteria that may have survived the first two treatments . You wo n't just get a retinoid cream to open up your pores , you 'll also be prescribed an antibiotic to prevent infection from spreading when your cysts open up plus a sunscreen to prevent discoloration of your skin . <p> And that 's the approach the best over-the-counter acne treatment systems take , too . That 's why so many pages on this site link to Exposed Skin Care . Its also better to fight acne every way you can . <p> You do n't  just need to kill acne bacteria , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! No ! Skin zit zappers can do . You need to keep oil from accumulating in your pores and on your skin . That requires a cleanser . You need to keep flakes of dead skin from clogging your pores . That requires an exfoliant or a peel . You need to erase existing damage with microdermabrasion and to you need to prevent inflammation with probiotics . <p> All of these techniques together are what gets rid of acne for good . <p> One good thing the Consumer Reports/ShopSmart article points out is that single methods usually do n't  get great results . The benzoyl peroxide products got about 40% of pimples . The zit zappers got less than 20% of pimples , and neither product gets rid of blackheads or whiteheads . <p> On the other hand , a multi-faceted approach like Exposed Skin Care gets rid of 96% or more of blemishes for 98% of customers " not overnight , but over a period of about 30 days .

It is something that I used to think about all the time . Acne , why it exists , and how I could get rid of it preyed on my mind throughout my teenage years .

It was a vicious circle . <p> I tried EVERYTHING ! <p> Before I surrendered myself to a dermatologist and acne medication I wanted to make sure I had exhausted all other options . I really did not feel comfortable putting chemicals into my body , especially Accutane considering some of the potential side-effects I had read about . <p> I tried washing my face with regular soap , I tried several acne creams , I tried exfoliators , I tried tonics , I tried various home-made remedies , and I tried astringents .

My broken skin was healing fast and it felt like my acne was being shot down like ducks in a shooting gallery . <p> When I hit 30 days my skin was 95% acne-free and it looked smooth and healthy .

@@98778834 @2978834/ <h> When Acne and Weight Gain Go Hand in Hand 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Hormones can be the main cause of acne and weight gain in teenage girls . <p> Its bad enough when you gain weight . But gaining weight and breaking out with acne too seems just plain unfair , especially when you are a teenaged girl . And its teenaged girls who are most at risk for acne when they gain weight , because of the interrelationship of weight gain and hormones . <p> In January of this year the Archives of Dermatology published a paper entitled " A Population-Based Study of Acne and Body Mass Index in Adolescents . " Researchers in Denmark , Norway , the USA , and China looked at the relationship between weight gain and acne in over 3500 teens aged 18 or 19 who lived in Oslo . Not too surprisingly , the epidemiologists concluded that with higher weight , the frequency of acne increased , too . But what is the real relationship between acne and weight gain . <p> It is n't that young women get acne and decide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't that women gain weight and somehow the extra fat starts oozing out of their pores causing nasty zits . <p> The real relationship " which the mainstream media has missed in its coverage of the article " is that both weight gain and acne are related to the function of the ovaries , and that metabolism in the ovaries is related to another phenomenon called insulin resistance . <p> Let 's start at the end and work back to the beginning to understand the problem . <p> There are lots of factors that contribute to acne , but acne does not occur when pores are not clogged . And the first step in closing a pore so that it traps the skin oil known as sebum inside is the excessive growth of skin cells up and down along the opening of the pore . <p> As skin grows , it pushes outward . The very outermost layer of skin cells dissolves in keratin protein and ceramide " glue " to form an impermeable layer against water ( so that the body does n't  dissolve ) and- that dirt , toxins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin cells mature and die , the outer flakes off and for the most part is easily removed by the flow of air over the skin and simple washing of the skin . <p> Inside a pore , however , the natural direction for a dead skin cell in the lining of the pore is to move in rather than out . Microscopic , invisible flakes of skin accumulate in the bottom of the pore and are pushed out as the pore releases sebaceous oils . <p> When testosterone levels are high , the pores make more oil . It can flow in such a volume that it pushes against the bottom of the pore . This makes the neck of the pore narrower . The flakes of skin that the oil would ordinarily deliver to the surface of the pore get stuck , and the pore fills with oil . The opening of the pore gets still narrower , and skin grows over the pore , trapping the dead skin cells and sebum inside . At first this forms a whitehead . If there is just enough oxygen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can turn into a blackhead . And if acne bacteria trapped inside the pores grow to sufficient numbers that the immune system attacks them with inflammatory compounds , the result can be a pimple or even a nodule or cyst . <p> But testosterone is a male hormone . Why should high testosterone levels explain acne in teenage girls ? <p> Testosterone is not exclusively a product of the male body . Womens bodies make testosterone , too . In small amounts testosterone fuels the female libido . In larger amounts it can have the same effects as it does in males , such as the growth of hair and the increased production of oil in the sebaceous glands of the skin . More oil , larger and darker blemishes . <p> A womans body makes testosterone along with other hormones in the ovaries . And that 's where there is a connection to the effects of insulin . <p> Insulin carries glucose into cells all over the body , including the ovaries . In most of the rest of the body , however , cells can shut down their glucose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from an influx of glucose sugar that has to be metabolized to produce energy . Limiting the entry of glucose protects the cell from the free radicals that are released when it " burns " excess sugar . <p> The ovaries do n't  have a mechanism to shut down their glucose receptors and become insulin resistant . When the rest of the body rejects sugar , the ovaries are flooded with sugar . They make large amounts of all of their hormones , including testosterone . This is what causes acne . <p> But its more than just eating too much that causes weight gain . The problem is that insulin resistance primes fat cells to store every possible extra calorie . <p> Insulin stores not just sugar but also fat . Cells turn off their glucose receptors when they become insulin resistant , but they do n't  turn off their fat receptors . <p> At the same time , the pancreas senses that blood sugar levels have gone up and responds by releasing still more insulin . Most of the body becomes still more insulin resistant , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks fat inside fat cells about 300 times more efficiently than it stores fat . Teens ( and people of all ages ) do n't  get fat unless they eat too much , but insulin resistance ensures that fat is stored quickly and efficiently , before its possible to work it off . <p> Acne and weight gain occur at the same time , but one does n't  cause the other . The real problem is too much sugar . <p> Reducing the amount of sugar in the diet " its not enough just to work out more , its also necessary to diet " enough to lose just 3% of body weight , about 4 pounds ( 2 kilos ) in most women , is enough to stop the process that raises testosterone levels and causes acne . You do n't  have to master weight control to regain control over acne . But you do have to diet just a little bit to get rid of acne for good . <p> I have a teenage daughter who has been an athlete all her life and now has been plagued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although she works out all the time , she was getting really frusterated with the weight gain . At her age it can be devastating as kids can be cruel . Thank you for the helpful informationI do n't  think we even thought of the sugar intake and we will have to change her eating habits at this point and see what happens from here.thanks again <p> I recently got married and started to gain weight . The sugar in take is also , and now that i think of it , it all makes sense . I 'm working out nowadays , at the same time I 'll reduce my sugar in take , Hopefully it will work out for me .

New scientific facts are being uncovered and new treatments are being developed all the time . Here are some recent highlights . <h> Summary : <p> There are developments in acne skin care nearly every day . <p> Increasing numbers of doctors report that using Juvederm to fill acne scars can trigger flare-ups of autoimmune diseases . <p> Doctors are being encouraged to recommend hydroquinone products for lightening brown spots left by acne . On certain skin types , however , hydroquinone can create worse disfigurement than it is used to treat . <p> Doctors are recognizing more and more cases of childhood acne , usually linked to stress . <p> Croatian scientists have found that just using a moisturizer can reduce the number of blemishes on womens skin by up to 70% in just 60 days . <h> Juvederm Can Aggravate Autoimmune Disease <p> Juvederm is a filler used to erase ice pick scars and other indented areas of skin where pimples have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin in the doctors office , Juvederm is primarily hyalouronic acid , a naturally occurring compound that absorbs water and expands the contour of the skin . The hyalouronic acid used in Juvederm is collected from human cadavers . The product also contains albumin collected from human blood . <p> There are increasing numbers of reports of autoimmune reactions after people receive Juvederm for acne scars or wrinkles . Some people develop sinusitis , and others develop joint pain . Doctors do not believe that Juvederm causes the autoimmune disease itself , but it may trigger flareups of previously undiagnosed autoimmune disease ( thus making the symptoms a " preexisting condition " for which insurance will not always pay ) . <p> Juvederm is expensive . A single injection into a single scar may cost as much as US $500 . The effects are temporary . Some users of Juvederm report that acne scars became visible again in as little as 3 weeks . <p> There are no at-home methods for treating acne scars that will give you immediate results . Microdermabrasion cloths and crystals from companies like Exposed Skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , but the best you can do with ice pick scars is to gradually stimulate production of collagen under the skin by exfoliating the skin with alpha-hydroxy ( glycolic ) and beta-hydroxy ( salicylic ) acids . <h> Medical Journals Encourage Doctors to Prescribe Hydroquinone <p> Hydroquinone is a whitening and lightening agent used to remove brown pigmentation that accumulates in the skin as pimples heal . For many people , its a safe and effective way to lighten the skin . For some people , it can leave permanent black or blue mottling of the skin or remove so much pigment from the skin that blemished skin comes to resemble vitiligo . <p> Medical journals are telling doctors that they do n't  have to be dermatologists to prescribe hydroquinone " and they do n't  . The same articles , however , are not warning of permanent problems that hydroquinone can cause on non-white skin types . <p> You have Chinese , Japanese , or Korean heritage .

Hydroquinone can remove so much pigment from your skin that you develop permanent white spots . <p> Many Murad cosmetics contain hydroquinone and should be used with extreme caution by people who have Asian or African skin types . Safe alternatives to hydroquinone include products that contain arbutin or kojic acid , such as Exuviance by Neo-Strata or Mela-D Dark Spots by La Roche-Posay . <h> Doctors are Increasingly Recognizing Acne in Children <p> Most people associate acne with adolescence . The fact is , however , that acne can occur in newborns and in children who have not reached puberty . Acne in newborns is most commonly associated with testosterone accumulated while still in the womb , and resolves itself even without treatment by the fourth month of life . Acne in children is most commonly associated with stress . Injuries to the skin by pimples are much more likely to form scars on young , rapidly growing skin . <p> Just because the patient is a child does not mean the problem is not acne , but just because the problem is acne does not mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No irritating treatment should ever be used on a babys or childs skin , because of the high risk of transference to eyes , nose , and mouth . Gentle cleansing with warm water and baby shampoo are mainstays of childhood skin care . Make sure a physician evaluates acne to rule out glandular problems . <h> Recent Research Finds that Moisturizers Reduce Adult Acne <p> Dermatologists in Croatia recently reported the results of a study of using moisturizers as the only treatment for mild to moderate adult acne " no benzoyl peroxide , no antibiotics , no botanicals , no light therapy or laser therapy or skin peels . They found that women aged 18 to 35 using a moisturizer for 60 days : <p> Reduced the number of pimples on the forehead by an average of 41% . <p> Reduced the number of pimples on the cheeks by an average of 25% . <p> Reduced the number of pimples on the chin by an average of 25% . <p> Reduced the number of blackheads and whiteheads on the forehead by an average of 68% . <p> Reduced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of 71% . <p> Reduced the number of blackheads and whiteheads on the chin by an average of 73% . <p> A few participants in the study actually had more pimples during the first month of treatment , as pores opened , but all participants in the study had better skin by the end of 60 days . Most of the women in the study reported that they were so pleased with the results of the moisturizer on the color and texture of their faces that they would use moisturizer even if they did not have acne . <p> An even better way to use moisturizer , however , is as part of a complete acne skin care program such as Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778836 @2978836/ <h> Accutane for Rosacea 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Since 1984 , oral isotretinoin , the medication that is still known as Accutane but that has been labeled as Roaccutane since 2009 , has been one of the most commonly prescribed medications for severe acne that forms nodules and cysts . Basically a super-charged version of vitamin A , Accutane causes the skin to grow so rapidly that it opens up naturally over cysts and nodules , allowing them to drain without lancing or surgery . Its only in the last few years , however , that doctors have started prescribing Accutane for rosacea . <p> Researchers actually recognized the value of Accutane for treating rosacea before the drug was ever released to the public . Accutane is usually prescribed for common acne because it opens up pores and shrinks oil-producing sebaceous glands , but it also can fight the inflammation that causes rosacea . <h> Different Kinds of Rosacea <p> There are four subtypes of rosacea , erythematotelangiectatic rosacea ( ETR ) , papulopustular rosacea ( PPR ) , phymatous rosacea , and ocular rosacea . Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blush easily . Papulopustular rosacea is a condition with permanent redness with papules ( bumps ) and pustules ( bumps filled with pus ) that is easily confused with acne . Phymatous rosacea is a condition of rough skin and bumpiness on the nose . Ocular rosacea is a condition of dry and red eyelids that can cause a feeling of grit in the eyes . <p> One kind of rosacea does not lead to another , but its possible to have more than one kind of rosacea at the same time . Different kinds of acne treatments have different effects in rosacea . The US Food and Drug Administration approves some medications to treat " temporary effects " of rosacea but does not approve medications to treat " permanent effects " of rosacea . <h> Treating Temporary Effects of Rosacea <p> The feature of rosacea that tends to come and go is the accumulation of papules and pustules . They may break out and they may clear up . Sometimes they are worse than others . The US Food and Drug Administration approves metronidazole 0.75% and 1% formulations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their approved use is limited to treating PPR . <h> Treating Permanent Effects of Rosacea <p> Other features of ETR , phymatous rosacea , and ocular rosacea are more or less permanent . Redness of the skin caused by ETR usually does not come and go . Bumpiness on the nose and irritation of the eyes are more or less permanent features of phymatous rosacea and ocular rosacea respectively . <p> Since rosacea is not caused by bacterial infection , the US Food and Drug Administration only approves one antibiotic for rosacea , doxycycline , in doses that are too small to kill bacteria but large enough to relieve inflammation in the skin . Sometimes doctors use combinations of benzoyl peroxide and the antibiotic clindamycin or combinations of the antibiotics erythromycin and clindamycin " off label " to treat rosacea . <p> Retin-A , which is sold under the generic name tretinoin , is used to open pores , shrink oil-producing sebaceous glands , and reduce inflammation in severe common acne . Since rosacea is not caused by excessive oil production , the US Food and Drug Administration does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosacea , although some doctors prescribe both products " off label . " <p> Antibiotics , benzoyl peroxide , and Retin-A are used to treat " permanent " features of rosacea , such as papules , pustules , and broken blood vessels . Face washes are used to treat " temporary " features of rosacea , such as inflammation . <p> If there are effective medications that are n't  approved for your form of rosacea and your doctor will prescribe them for you , then what 's the problem ?

And there 's growing evidence that it may be helpful in dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A multi-center study found that taking Accutane ( in pill form ) was very helpful in severe PPR ( the kind of rosacea for which FDA-approved products are currently available ) . A study treatment-resistant PPR found that taking Accutane for nine weeks reduced not just pustules and papules , which are generally considered treatable , but also reduced redness , after about 18 weeks of treatment . Five studies have found that Accutane shrinks rhinophyma , the swelling of the nose that can be caused by phymatous rosacea , for which there are currently no FDA-approved treatments . Accutane has to be used before the lesions in the nose develop fibrous casings , however . One young woman experience remission from perioral granulomatous rosacea ( lumpy and bumpy redness around the mouth not caused by infection in pores of the skin ) after 20 weeks of Accutane treatment . A study of 573 rosacea patients found that taking antibiotics led to remission of symptoms in 13% of patients but that taking Accutane led to remission of symptoms in 24% of patients . <p> And researchers have also investigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 0.03 mg of Accutane per day ( about 1/16 of the regular dose ) . This tiny amount of Accutane did not cause side effects but did lead to significant improvement in quality of life for most of the patients in a preliminary small-scale study . <h> Can Accutane Help You ? <p> The simple fact is that only you and your doctor can determine whether Accutane is likely to help your rosacea symptoms . Ask your doctor about low-dose Accutane treatment , and make sure you inquire about reducing medication costs by the very simple method of pill-splitting ( which should be done by the pharmacist at the pharmacy following the orders of the prescription , not at home ) . Even if the FDA does not approve Accutane for your form of rosacea , you and your doctor may be able to work out effective and affordable off-label use of the medication if the doctor believes it may work for you . 19923 @qwx879923

Sometimes merged with a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa , SAPHO syndrome is characterized by a combination of synovitis ( inflammation of the linings of the joints ) , acne , pustulosis ( formation of cysts without infection ) , hyperostosis ( knotty growths on the bones ) , and osteitis ( bone irritation ) . Its symptoms show up most commonly in humid climates . <h> A Most Unusual Form of Acne <p> SAPHO syndrome can appear at any time between childhood and middle age and usually follows a relapsing and remitting course . Symptoms get worse and they get better and they get worse again , with or without treatment . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and medications that do n't  help the condition appear as if they do . <p> At the level of the skin , SAPHOs most recognizable symptom is a kind of acne known as palmoplantar pustullosis , acne breaking out on the palms of the hands and the palms of the feet . There can also be acne conglobata , a kind of acne that causes pimples to burrow tunnels to each other and merge into large sores , or hidranenitis suppurativa , which is a form of acne caused by the skin growing over pores rather than infection in pores , and acne fulminans , in which the skin is free of acne bacteria but they are found growing in joints . <p> SAPHO syndrome can cause unremitting bone pain that is worse at night . It can cause joints and bones to become tender , so that just touching the skin causes pain . The pain caused by SAPHO syndrome can last for years , and cause disruption of the entire family of the person who suffers from the condition . <h> Who Gets SAPHO Syndrome ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same autoimmune processes that cause ulcerative colitis , a severe inflammatory disease of the bowel . There is a specific blood marker for SAPHO syndrome called HLA-B27 , which appears in the bloodstream in people who get SAPHO syndrome , ulcerative colitis , ankylosing spondylitis , and another condition that causes problems in both the skin and joints , psoriatic arthritis . <p> People of certain ethnic groups are far more likely to carry this bloodstream marker than others . Surveys find that members of the native Alaskan Yupik clan , Tarahumara Indians in Mexico and their Pima cousins in Arizona , Danes , Finns , Belgians , and Irish people are especially likely to have the bloodstream marker . Everyone who carries the marker in their bloodstream does not get a disease , but symptoms of the disease plus the marker are used to make the diagnosis . <p> It is very rare for SAPHO syndrome to appear before the age of 10 or after the age of 50 . It is much more common in women than in men , by a ratio of somewhere between two and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndrome tend to have acne break out on their hands , feet , and under their arms . Women who get SAPHO syndrome tend to have acne break out on their hands , feet , and genitals . Men who get SAPHO syndrome tend to have acne break out on their hands , feet , and perianal region . <h> What Is Done for SAPHO Syndrome ? <p> The first priority in treating SAPHO syndrome is pain relief . In most of the world , this means taking massive amounts of non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents ( NSAIDs ) , such as aspirin , Ibuprofen , and Tylenol . Managing the pain of SAPHO syndrome with NSAIDs is tricky , because the quantities of pain relievers required usually cause digestive upset . The kinds of medications that are used with other kinds of bone and joint pain , such as Vicodin and Oxycontin , usually do n't  work especially well for the pain of SAPHO syndrome . <p> Doctors sometimes try to treat the destruction of bones and joints caused by SAPHO syndrome with the same drugs used for rheumatoid arthritis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Trexall ) , and infliximab ( Remicade ) . The best results usually come from the use or infliximab , but the cost of treatment can be quite high without health insurance . <h> What Can Be Done About Pimples Caused by SAPHO Syndrome ? <p> Some people who get SAPHO are so bothered by their bone pain that they do n't  worry about acne , but as patients recover from pain and immobility they then want to improve their appearance . For the pustules that appear on the hands and palms , the best self-care is remembering to wash both hands and feet at least once a day and keeping the palms of the feet dry . Wearing socks that wick moisture out and away from the skin helps . Doctors may offer radiofrequency treatments for pustules on the palms . <p> For the acne that breaks out below the belt and under the arms , it is especially helpful to wear loose , dry clothing , and to avoid the accumulation of perspiration on the skin . This allows the skin to exfoliate itself so the pimples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acid peel or an acid exfoliant , or an exfoliant cloth , on delicate skin . When acne lesions become especially swollen and painful , the doctor can inject them with a corticosteroid such as prednisolone ( Prelone ) or triamcinolone ( Amcort , Aristospan Intra-Articular ) . Repeated use of injected steroids at the same spot can cause the skin to thin and loose coloration . <p> It also helps to : <p> Stop smoking .

This article will tell you everything you need to know about getting rid of back acne for good . <h> Summary : <p> Back acne is a problem for active people who perspire a lot , and for people who can reach to wash their backs . <p> The most common kind of back acne is friction acne , which causes blemishes to accumulate where tight clothing or uniforms accumulate sweat . <p> There are also a number of relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by health treatments . <p> Benzoyl peroxide gel gets rid of back acne , but it has to stay in contact with the skin for at least 5 minutes to do any good . <p> Exposed Skin Cares Clearing Tonic also helps treat back acne when oily skin is a problem . <h> What Causes Back Acne ? <p> The most common cause of the kind of back acne that pops up as blackheads and solitary pimples is a condition known as acne mechanica . This kind of acne is also sometimes referred to as friction acne . Tight-fitting blouses , shirts , jerseys , brassieres , or shoulder pads trap sweat and dirt on the skin . Over a period of a few hours , they grind dirt and oily films into pores , and the constant exposure to sweat causes the skin to shrivel and , at least in the top layer , die . Dead skin cells get stuck in pores that form blackheads and pimples . This form of back acne most commonly occurs in younger , active people . <p> Another cause of back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  able to shower and bathe as often as they like , and they cant reach around to cleanse the back . Stubborn blackheads are more likely than pimples in senile acne . <p> Other , rarer forms of back acne result from : <p> Acne conglobata . This form of acne causes pimples to " burrow " connections to each other on the face , back , and chest . Most common in men with hereditary hormone imbalances , it always requires medical treatment . <p> Acne fulminans . Excessive use of testosterone replacement in men can cause a combination of joint damage and severe acne on the back and trunk . This form of acne also always requires medical treatment . <p> Acupuncture . Sometimes pimples form in pores next to the sites where acupuncture needles are used repeatedly . This problem presupposes that your acupuncturist is sufficiently skilled to place the same needle in the same site over and over again " which is needed for the acupuncture to work . If you notice pimples on your back after acupuncture , speak with your acupuncturist about treating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older tricyclic antidepressants can cause profuse breakouts of pimples and blackheads primarily on the back , but also on the chest , neck , ears , and face . These antidepressants are most commonly used in North America , Europe , and Australia to treat the complications of diabetes rather than depression . Do n't  stop taking your medication without speaking with your physician , but know that discontinuing the medication will probably allow your skin to heal . <p> Hair care products . Pomades , mousse , volumizers , conditioners , and shampoo can cause acne both on the forehead and on the back of the neck and the back if the hair and surrounding skin are not thoroughly rinsed after application . Ponytails and braids can transfer oil to the skin of the back that can clog pores and cause back acne . Always be sure to rinse your skin thoroughly . <h> Preventing Back Acne <p> The way to prevent the most common form of back acne is simple : Always take a shower when you get sweaty . Scientists have tracked shower habits and rates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanse the skin immediately after a high-perspiration activity . Up to four hours later is OK . When you do shower , be sure to use warm water , not hot , to keep from drying out your skin , and try to use a shower mitt to exfoliate your skin while you are in the shower . Limit showers to 5 minutes to prevent additional wrinkling of your skin . <p> It also helps to avoid constrictive clothing . The less time you spend " strapped in , " the fewer problems you will have with back acne . <p> What about back acne in the elderly ? An old-timey back brush is an easy way for older persons to take care of this problem on their own . It is not necessary to " scrub acne away . " Just make sure all of your back gets some attention when you shower . When you wash your hair , make sure both back and forehead get a good rinse . <h> Treating Back Acne <p> Treating back acne is a little trickier . If you have pimples on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stronger benzoyl peroxide gel <p> Made with " finely milled " particles of benzoyl peroxide that <p> Stays in contact with your skin for at least 5 minutes . <p> A 5% benzoyl peroxide gel may be too irritating for your face , but it may be just right for your back . Products that are made with tiny particles of benzoyl peroxide actually get inside pores , killing bacteria and loosening dead skin . But you need to plan ahead so that the product can stay on your skin for at least 5 minutes and preferably longer . <p> Benzoyl peroxide gel should be applied across your back after your shower and towel off but before your skin gets completely dry . You should not just slap the gel on your back and put on your clothes , because the gel releases hydrogen peroxide . This both kills bacteria and bleaches hair and clothing . It only takes 5 minutes to kill up 98% of acne bacteria on your back , although keeping the gel on your back up to 15 minutes will kill even more . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , rinse your back again to make sure you get all of the product off . <p> What can you do if you cant reach your back ? If there is no one in your life who can apply the product for you , try an easy-reach lotion applicator . Several brands should be available on Amazon or at your local drugstore . And if oily skin is a problem on your back , try Exposed Skin Cares Clearing Tonic ( also applied with a stretch-over lotion applicator if necessary ) to break up matted skin that clog pores and cause blackheads and pimples . <p> Does this apply for benzoyl peroxide creams as well as gels ? I am just about to begin using a 5% cream and am worried about dressing and sleeping with it on as I do n't  want to ruin my clothes and bedding due to bleaching .

@@98778840 @2978840/ <h> The Role of Essential Oils In Treating Acne 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Essential oils are natural . They are usually organic . And while essential oils are great for aromatherapy , they usually are not good for treating acne-prone or blemished skin . <h> Summary : <p> Essential oils are natural . They are often produced without the use of chemicals . But most essential oils are poor choices for treating acne . <p> Camphor , which appears in skin care products such as calamine lotion and Noxzema , stops itching by causing irritation of the skin , canceling out the sensation of itching . The irritation can make acne worse . <p> Menthol , which appears in countless acne care products , makes the skin " jumpy , " more likely to become inflamed when it is stressed or when you experience stress . <p> Some plant oils are helpful in cleansing and disinfecting the skin . Olive oil and coconut oil can be used to cleanse the skin . In small amounts , they can even be used on oily skin . <p> The essential oil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less sensitive to chemicals , including benzoyl peroxide . <p> The most useful essential oil in acne care is tea tree oil , but most products do n't  contain enough to do any good . Apply pure tea tree oil with a clean cotton ball directly on pimples . <h> What Is An Essential Oil ? <p> An essential oil is a water-insoluble liquid containing the aromatic compounds of a plant that give it its distinctive odor . These liquids are also known as ethereal oils , aetherolea , and volatile oils . Most essential oils evaporate below the boiling point of water , so they are not present in herbal teas . <p> Most kinds of essential oils are distilled from finely ground plant matter . Some essential oils are refined by treatment with hexane or alcohol , the chemical solvent boiling off the essential oil at low temperature leaving the pure essential oil behind . Many of the essential oils used in mass production of skin treatments are not " organic " because they are manufactured with the use of hexane or acetone solvents . Essential oils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are almost always organic because they are cold-pressed from enormous volumes of citrus peels . <h> Do Essential Oils Heal Acne ? <p> There is good evidence that specific essential oils have specific effects on the brain . Essential oils of bergamot and sweet orange , for instance , help you relax after you work out at the gym . Essential oil of cypress , on the other hand , is a pick-me-up after physical exercise . <p> Common mint increases vigilance and tend to make you jumpy , as does essential oil of juniper . Peppermint , orange , lime , and geranium help you unwind after doing mental work , while basil and juniper help you continue to focus after long hours at a mental task . <p> There is also good evidence that certain essential oils have specific healing effects elsewhere in the body . Menthol is a counterirritant . It relieves itching by causing stinging . Camphor irritates the skin , but because it is also an anesthetic , it relieves itching . Lavender can stop a headache , and it can anesthetize burned skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of burned cells quickly . Capsaicin is distilled from chile peppers . It burns the skin enough that other kinds of pain sensations from deeper in the body are ignored . <p> Menthol , camphor , lavender , and capsaicin are used in countless skin care products , but they are not helpful in treating acne , because they cause irritation of the skin . When the skin senses irritation , it releases its own stress hormones . These hormones trigger allergies in the skin to destroy potentially infected skin cells . The pores make extra skin oil to carry these potentially infected or toxic skin cells to the surface . <h> If The Most Common Essential Oils Do n't  Heal Acne , What Does ? <p> Even though essential oils are never a good idea in acne care , there are many other plant oils that are beneficial . Jojoba oil , for example , is often beneficial for treating acne on oily skin . It contains a wax that is chemically almost identical to the oil produced by the sebaceous glands under the skin . Like dissolves like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jojoba oil beads ) to whiteheads and blackheads helps unclog pores without causing any kind of irritation ; there are compounds in jojoba oil that actually stimulate the growth of collagen in the skin . <p> Rose hip oil is a good moisturizer for dry skin . Fresh rose hip oil contains large amounts of vitamin C in a form that the skin can absorb and use . If you opened the vial of rose hip oil more than 3 months ago , however , the vitamin C has been destroyed by oxygen from the atmosphere . The oil is still a good emollient for dry skin . It helps open pores so they can drain , without provoking irritation that can cause pimples to break out . <p> Coriander oil kills staph infections of the skin . Staphylococcus aureus can cause a skin infection that starts out like a pimple , but that grows redder and larger . It may be sensitive to the touch or hurt all the time , and it fills with yellow pus in a circle in the center . Do n't  squeeze this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere you touch before you wash your hand . A dot of coriander oil applied to the infected area with a clean cotton swab used just once , however , will help fight the infection . Coriander oil has even been used to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , also known as MRSA . <p> Peperina oil , extracted from a shrub belonging to the Mint Family that grows in the Andes , makes the skin less sensitive to inflammation . It reduces redness of pimples , and also lowers the sensitivity of the skin to cleansers and chemicals . It can make sensitive skin " calm " enough for treatment with benzoyl peroxide . <p> Coconut oil can be either helpful or harmful for blemish-prone skin . Refined coconut oil is never good for the skin . Virgin coconut oil , on the other hand , contains lauric acid that can kill acne bacteria as well as staph bacteria on the skin . A dab of virgin coconut oil is a good way to treat dry skin around the eyes or on the temples , although you should never slather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oils in their virgin form can be used to cleanse the skin . Virgin olive oil , for instance , was used for centuries for skin treatment with soap made with wood ash and lye would be too harsh . Olive oil can be used even on oily skin to remove stubborn makeup that you do n't  want to try to scrub away . Be sure to pour a tiny amount of olive oil into a dish you use to hold the oil you use in cleansing ; you do n't  want to dip your fingers in the whole bottle of oil . <p> The one essential oil that is almost always helpful in controlling blemishes , however , is tea tree oil . This Australian herbal product kills acne bacteria . Unlike benzoyl peroxide , it reduces inflammation and relieves redness at the same time . Tea tree oil can also fight staph infections . <p> The problem with using tea tree oil is that it takes at least 10% strength to kill acne bacteria on contact , and almost none of the products that advertise tea tree oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best way to use this essential oil in the fight against acne is to buy 100% tea tree oil , which you apply directly to pimples with a clean cotton ball , just after you cleanse the skin .

You only have to ask for the drug that will really work for you and finally help you get clear . <h> Summary : <p> Acne medications almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One approach to acne medication is to use low doses of two of the most important acne treatments , Differen and benzoyl peroxide , neither of them in a strong enough concentration to cause skin irritation . <p> Another approach to acne in men is to use Korean herbal formulas manufactured under high quality standards along with acupuncture . The results are better than antibiotics and less expensive than Retin-A . <p> An alternative approach to acne in women is to use bath products made with cherry bark extract ( not the bark itself ) . A compound in the bark makes the skin less sensitive to estrogen . <p> Once you get acne under control , keep it under control with a complete acne care system . <p> Adapalene , also known by its trade names Differin , Teva , Gallet , Pimpal , and Adelene , is a gentler alternative to the better known Accutane and Retin-A . Unlike most acne treatments , it is both anti-inflammatory and exfoliating . That is , it reduces redness and irritation while it opens up the skin to drain pimples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not work as fast as Accutane and Retin-A , but it has far fewer side effects than Accutane and Retin-A . <p> Benzoyl peroxide is a familiar antibacterial treatment used to kill acne bacteria . The problem with benzoyl peroxide is that most people are only comfortable using a 2.5% solution . Stronger solutions of benzoyl peroxide cause redness , inflammation , itching , and peeling of the skin in most people who use it . But it usualy takes a 5% to 10% of benzoyl peroxide to kill the majority of acne germs in the skin . <p> Doctors have been experimenting with the combination of these two relatively mild acne drugs . In one clinical study , 517 acne patients were asked to use various combinations of 0.1% adapalene and 2.5% benzoyl peroxide ( adapalene and benzoyl peroxide , adapalene without benzoyl peroxide , benzoyl peroxide without adapalene , and placebo ) . <p> Researchers found that adapalene by itself reduced the number of pimples by an average of 46% and the number of whiteheads and blackheads by an average of 33% .

Using both medications together reduced the number of pimples by an average of 63% and the number of whiteheads and blackheads by an average of 51% . Nearly twice as many pimples disappeared when test participants were treated with a combination of both medications , along with nearly 50% more whiteheads and blackheads . <p> Neither of these drugs is a complete and total cure for acne . Over the short term , they improve acne . They do n't  eliminate it . But acne patients get much better results when they use low doses of both drugs instead of high doses of either one . Only 2% of the volunteers in the study discontinued the combination medication due to side effects . About 75% of users of higher-dose benzoyl peroxide and 50% of users of higher-dose Adapalene ca n't continue their treatment because of drug-induced inflammation of the skin . <h> Keigai-rengyo-to and Acupuncture <p> Some herbal medicines from China are made up on the spot for each patient from sources of herbs that are not carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , are made to the same standards as pharmaceutical drugs . Exact amounts of herbs from sources monitored for purity are mixed under exact pharmaceutical standards into pills of known botanical content that are stable in storage for up to three years .

This formula is a fixed combination of 13 herbs , most of which contain chemicals that regulate the immune system .

And since you are getting all your products from the same vendor , you avoid buying duplicate products and you pay a little " or a whole lot " less for each unit of product . Different acne systems , however , offer differing levels of skin care results . Let 's look at the most popular acne treatment systems in terms of pros and cons . <h> Summary : <p> Acne systems provide a collection of products to fight acne in multiple ways . <p> The NuSkin Galvanic Skin Treatment System offers two products ( neither of them in any way " galvanic " in the sense of being related to electricity ) that foam on your skin and warm your skin . It may feel good , but it will make pimples redder . <p> The Olay Regenerist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blemished skin , but it wo n't do anything you could not do with baking soda and apple cider vinegar or baking soda and buttermilk . <p> The Patricia Wexler acne treatment systems work " and cost about three times as much per bottle as Exposed Skin Care . <p> The Proactiv Medicated Pore Cleansing System is cheap but relies on alcohol to cleanse your skin .

But making pimples redder really is not a good idea . <h> Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion and Peel System ( retails for $27.99 in the USA ) <p> This treatment for blemished skin consists of a skin rub and a skin peel . The skin rub is baking soda that has been dyed orange . The skin peel is lactic acid , the alpha-hydroxy acid found in milk . You rub you skin with the baking soda , and then cover it with the lactic acid gel . The baking soda and lactic acid fizz and foam over your skin the same way baking soda and apple cider vinegar fizz and foam . Once the fizzing and foaming stops , you rinse the mixture off your skin . <p> You could easily get the same results from baking soda from the box and apple cider vinegar from your cupboard for about US $0.25 a treatment .

There is enough glycolic acid in the pads actually to peel the skin , but its at such a high pH ( apple cider vinegar is 100 times more acidic than these pads ) that it wont peel the skin very much . Since there is no risk of burning the skin , there 's no need for the neutralizing pads . The moisturizer is OK if you have dry skin , but if you have skin that is both dry and sensitive , the cypress oil in the moisturizer could make you break out in an allergy . There are much less expensive acne treatment systems that work a lot better for keeping your skin blemish-free . <p> To use Dr. Patricia Wexlers Resurfacing Microbrasion System , first you apply Skin Resurfacing Cream with MMPi .

This is not a bad treatment for your skin . But you can find equally effetive treatments for about $40 less ( more about them at the end of this article ) . <p> This Proactiv product consists of two parts . One is a medicated pore strip that you stick to your skin like a Bandaid , and the other is a pore cleansing solution that finishes the work the first part of the system does , at least in theory .

The relationship of acne and steroids is something everyone who uses illicit or prescription steroids needs to know to protect both appearance and basic health . <h> Summary : <p> Acne and steroids just do n't  mix . <p> Steroid abuse can trigger a systemic illness called acne fulminans . This form of acne creates gaping holes in the skin and also attack the muscles and joints . <p> Dermatologists sometimes offer steroid injections to make pimples less noticeable . These injections can cause lightening and thinning of the skin . <p> Steroids are sometimes used to lighten melasma , or brown spots , left after acne heals . Usually the brown spots come back just as soon as the steroid medication is stopped , and continuous use weakens the skin . <p> Its always better to prevent acne than to treat it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can prevent the immune system reaction that causes acne fulminans . <p> Prevent acne with a complete acne treatment system such as Exposed Skin Care . <h> What Is Acne Fulminans ? <p> Sometimes acne suddenly becomes aggressive . Infections that are normally limited to the surface of the skin suddenly penetrate the lower levels of the skin . The infection breaks down muscle tissue , causing pain and stressing the kidneys as they strain to clear proteins from broken-down tissues from the bloodstream . There can be fever , and weight loss , and destruction of the joints . Sores on the skin can grow large enough to stick two fingers inside . Antibiotics do nothing to stop the progress of this form of acne known as acne fulminans . <p> Sometimes acne fulminans seems to be induced by hyperactivity of the immune system . This kind of acne fulminans can be treated with steroids . Other times acne fulminans is actually triggered by excessive use of the steroid testosterone , and is treated by withdrawing steroids . In either case , the condition is manifestation of what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This form of acne comes on suddenly , literally overnight , causes severe and ulcerating acne , damages muscles and joints , and usually resolves itself in 4 to 6 weeks . Sometimes the condition causes recurring inflammation in the joints . <h> What Causes Acne Fulminans ? <p> The precipitating event in acne fulminans is a systemic reaction triggered by the acne bacterium Propionibacterium acnes . The immune system starts generating massive amounts of inflammation even affecting tissues and organs where the bacterium is not present , such as the lower levels of the skin , the muscles , and the joints . <p> Just prior to this change in the immune system , there is usually a fluctuation in testosterone levels . In teenaged boys , this can the naturally high production of testosterone that occurs during adolescence . In adult men , it is almost always the use of inject testosterone to enhance muscle building . Sometimes acne fulminans occurs after measles , and in at least one case it was triggered by adrenal overactivity . <p> Acne fulminans is a condition that only occurs in males @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this severity , and the small doses of supplemental testosterone some women take to treat loss of interest in sex are not enough to cause acne that is this severe . <h> How Is Acne Fulminans Treated ? <p> Ironically , the treatment for steroid-induced acne is still more steroids , but steroids such as dexamethasone , prednisolone , and prednisone . These steroids counteract the inflammation caused by the bodys over-reaction to acne bacteria trapped under sebum after sebum production was stimulated by testosterone . Weight lifters who continue to use injected testosterone , however , will continue to suffer cycles of the disease until they stop injecting testosterone . <h> But Are Steroids Always Bad for Acne ? <p> The same steroids used to treat acne fulminans are sometimes offered by dermatologists as an " emergency treatment " for pimples . Both men and women who need to attend a wedding , an anniversary celebration , a graduation , or other event requiring them to look their best often can persuade a dermatologist to inject prednisone or dexamethasone directly into a pimple to reduce redness and irritation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not covered by health insurance . Results are immediate and last about a week . <p> The drawback to this procedure is that repeated injections of steroids into pimples can cause permanent thinning and lightening of the skin . The patch of skin that was prone to blemishes becomes bluish as blood vessels show through the surface . It is more prone to injury , and needs different cosmetic treatment to match the color and matte of the rest of the skin on the face . <h> Steroids Also Used to Treat Pigmentation Left When Acne Heals <p> Steroids are also used to treat pigmentation of the skin left when pimples heal . The most popular prescription for melasma , or brown spots , usually affecting women , is a combination of medications known as Kligmans formula . This treatment combines 2% hydroquinone ( a skin-whitening or -lightening agent ) , 0.025% tretinoin ( the non-prescription form of Retin-A used as a lotion ) , and 1% mometasone ( a steroid that is less likely than most to cause thinning of the skin ) . <p> The idea behind this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only give short-term results in lightening pigmented skin .

The advantage of the combination is that it does not cause irritation that can make pigmentation worse . The disadvantage of this combination is that brown spots tend to come back almost as soon as the medication is stopped , and most patients find a way to get more of the formula to clear up the skin . Using this product for more than 8 to 10 weeks at a time causes all the side effects of any other steroid treatment .

@@98778847 @2978847/ <h> Is There a Link Between Zinc and Acne ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Taking zinc orally can help fight acne , by reducing the immune system 's release of inflammatory chemicals . <p> Zinc supplements can be extraordinarily useful in fighting acne " by making the immune system weaker . If that seems a little strange , please read on . The way zinc works for clearing up your skin is an example of how many other products work to fight acne . <h> Summary : <p> Acne bacteria do not damage the skin . The immune systems reaction to acne bacteria damages the skin . <p> Zinc reduces the immune systems release of inflammatory chemicals at the very earliest stages of acne , especially when the skin is stressed . <p> Zinc is more useful for preventing whiteheads and blackheads than for treating pimples . <p> Zinc oxide in sunscreen is a great way to get zinc exactly where it is needed in the skin , but these products can leave brown or black skin tinged white . <p> The best way to take zinc is as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bacteria and Acne <p> Acne is associated with excessive growth of the " acne bacteria " Propionibacterium acnes . Like most bacteria that live in or on the human body , these bacteria are actually beneficial in small numbers . The skin makes an oil known as sebum to keep itself lubricated . Sebum keeps the skin from wrinkling and cracking when we talk , eat , smile , or frown . <p> Propionibacterium acnes consumes fatty acids in this sebum that make it sticky . This leaves essential fatty acids that nourish the skin , and keeps too much oil from building up on the skin . The relationship between the skin and acne bacteria is mutually beneficial until they get trapped in a pore . <p> The problem is not that bacteria grow to massive numbers and destroy the skin with a pimple . The problem is that bacteria are programmed to survive , too , and they need to keep moving to other pores to reproduce and flourish . Acne bacteria do not attack the skin directly . Instead , they release some chemicals that attract white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitize the skin around the clogged pore to inflammatory chemicals made by these protective immune cells . <p> The inflammation that causes a pimple to pop up does one of two things . It eventually opens a path for the bacteria to escape , or it destroys so much tissue the bacteria go deeper into the body , protected inside a cyst or nodule covered by healthy , although pink and scarred , above them . <h> How Zinc Interrupts the Process of Inflammation <p> The human body uses zinc to make over 300 different enzymes . These enzymes can speed up chemical reactions , or they can slow them down . Zinc is an important ingredient in enzymes , and in enzymes that regulate other enzymes all over the body . In the skin , zinc regulates the production of corticotrophin releasing hormone , or CRH . <p> CRH is better known as the hormone that the brain sends to the adrenal glands as a signal to release the " stress hormone " cortisol . It turns out , scientists have found , that the skin has a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sunburn , chemical irritation , or the sensation of a clogged pore , nerves in the skin send messages to specialized skin cells called keratinocytes to release CRH . <p> There are n't  any adrenal glands in the skin . This CRH does not make cortisol . Instead , it activates mast cells . These are cells that release histamine , which dissolves contaminated tissues . ( Histamine also causes the symptoms of allergic reactions . ) <p> CRH also increases a process called differentiation , which builds up the lining of pores . When the pore is clogged with sebum and acne bacteria , however , increasing the production of new skin cells is not a good thing . This only makes the pore tighter and the bacteria even more trapped . <p> And CRH increases sebum production . Oily sebum , after all , protects the skin . In this case , however , the additional sebum only adds to the stress on the pore , which is growing tighter because of the stimulation of skin cell growth . <p> Zinc interrupts the release of CRH . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth signals that tighten the pore . It stops the production of extra sebum . <p> All of these actions occur early in the process of acne , before the bacteria start sending out signals of their own . Zinc helps stop the formation of whiteheads and blackheads before they become pimples . It also helps prevent the skin from growing over a pimple and creating a cyst . Zinc wont take the red out of a pimple or stop inflammation triggered by acne bacteria , but it will stop the earliest stages of redness and irritation caused by mast cells . <h> How to Take Zinc <p> All of this means that zinc is better for prevention than for cure . It is better to take a zinc supplement than it is to try to use a zinc ointment for treating pimples . However , if you simply want to get your zinc directly where it is needed on your skin , a zinc oxide sunblock will serve a dual purpose , nourishing the skin in ways that reduce its reactions to stress , and also protecting the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know will reduce acne inflammation is zinc gluconate . Probably zinc carbonate , zinc sulfate , and zinc picolinate would also work , but that has not been proven in the lab as yet . Zinc gluconate is a little more expensive than zinc sulfate , but it is also better absorbed through the digestive tract . <p> It is important not to overdose zinc , that is , not to take more than 50 mg a day on a regular basis . The reason to avoid taking too much zinc is that it competes with copper for absorption into the body . Some people who have taken extremely high doses of zinc for several weeks , for example , 750 mg of zinc every day for a month , have developed serious copper deficiencies that cause muscle fatigue and weakness along with psychological symptoms . One sure way to prevent copper deficiency is to take a product that contains both zinc and copper , at least 1 mg of copper every day . <h> What About Zinc in Gels and Lotions for Acne ? <p> Zinc oxide in sunscreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you have brown or black skin , it will probably leave a noticeable white tint on your skin everywhere you apply it . Since zinc is best used to prevent acne , it is better to take a zinc supplement on a regular basis than to try to find a lotion or gel that has zinc in it . However , there are lotions and gels containing zinc that are good for oily , allergy-prone , easily wrinkled , and spotted skin " a specialized skin type for which acne is usually the least of problems . 19923 @qwx879923

Hand held devices that actually remove pimples a safe , portable laser treatment in just seconds may be on the way soon . <p> University of Michigan professor Dr. Mohammed Islam , who teaches both electrical engineering and internal medicine and who was a well-known high-tech entrepreneur in Texas before joining the Michigan faculty , has announced the develop of a device about the size of a DVD that generates laser light with components that already available " off the shelf . " Dr. Islams objective was to create a device that is compact and economical and that could actually enter the marketplace for everyday use with minimum manufacturing time . <h> How the Hand-Held Laser Device Works <p> Dr. Islams invention emits laser light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer and " milder " wavelength of light than is used in blue light treatments for killing bacteria , red light treatments for shrinking oil glands , or most of the ablative lasers that literally burn away acne-prone tissue . <p> As Islam and his colleagues reported in the August 2011 edition of Lasers in Surgery and Medicine , the advantage of using this wavelength is that it is absorbed by fat , rather than by hemoglobin or water . It can reach deeper under the skin to cut off circulation to blemishes , without destroying the protective layer of skin on top of them . The topmost layer of skin acts as a natural bandage while tissue is rejuvenated beneath it . <p> What is the advantage of this new approach ? <p> Dr. Islams invention is a totally different approach than is used by the " zit zappers " you can buy on Amazon and in some department stores . The older devices that build up heat or that release a sudden burst of electricity may , or may not , leave the topmost layer of skin intact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rather than from the inside out . <p> The products on the market now may kill acne bacteria in seconds , but that 's only a small part of the healing process . The inflammation that makes bulging pimples red and tender is generated by the immune system in the skin , not by the acne bacteria themselves . Acne bacteria no longer send out chemical trigger for new inflammation , but within a few hours to a few days of treatment with other heat or electrical devices , the immune system generates still more inflammation to clear out dead skin . <p> Dr. Islams device relies on fiber optics to deliver a pinpoint of light to treat the skin . Using fiber optics allows eight times greater intensity of laser light than a traditional laser lamp , without the need for elaborate precautions to protect the eyes and adjacent skin . <h> Getting to the Bottom of Acne <p> Dr. Islam also experimented with lasers tuned to emit light at 1320 nanometers , 1450 nanometers , and 1540 nanometers . These wavelengths of invisible infrared light also reached down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sebum in the sebaceous glands at the base of acne-prone pores . The longer wavelength of light , Islam and colleagues determined , reaches the deepest oil-producing glands that are involved in the most treatment-resistant acne . <p> The longer wavelengths of light used in this new device also have longer-lasting effects than earlier versions of portable laser treatment . They do not , however , reach more than 1.65 mm ( about 1/20 of an inch ) into the skin and will not themselves cause scarring or deep tissue injury . And because the laser light does not destroy the surface of the skin , treatment does not leave clear dividing lines between treated and untreated skin . <h> Licensed for Production <p> Dr. Islams team has licensed their laser treatment device to a Michigan start-up company , Omni Sciences . Islam is its new president , and the company receives support from the University of Michigan .

All this does is to shrink the pimple to the contour of the skin , but that is enough to enable you to conceal it with makeup . Steroid shots into pimples are not usually covered by insurance and they are not cheap . <p> Moreover , injecting the same location in the skin multiple times can cause permanent fading of skin pigment . You may have a permanent light or white spot where you once had pimples . It is usually best to leave this treatment for major " pimple emergencies " such as weddings and proms . <p> Another approach to " pimple emergencies " requires 24 to 48 hours advance preparation . You can treat your pimple with any product that contains at least 10% tea tree oil .

If you are 50 or older , it might take as long as a month . <p> The hand held laser treatment device is only for mild to moderate acne vulgaris .

These products are inexpensive . They are effective . One of the Clean &amp; Clear products offers the strongest non-prescription strength benzoyl peroxide cleanser available in North America . <p> The problem with most of the Clean &amp; Clear line is that most products contain fragrances and perfumes that can irritate sensitive skin . This article will tell you which ( if any ) Clear &amp; Clean products are safe for your skin , and which are not , starting with the best of the product line and working down to the worse . <h> Summary : <p> Clean &amp; Clear products are among the least effective products available for fighting acne . <h> Clean &amp; Clear Soft Purifying Cleanser <p> Unlike most other Clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clean &amp; Clear Soft Purifying Cleanser at " not all that bad . " It contains alpha-hydroxy acids that can exfoliate dry skin , opening tight pores , and salicylic acid acid that can open clogged pores on oily skin , although not in very high amounts , and in not in a formulation that will keep them on your face long enough to do you much good . However , there is nothing harmful in this cleanser , and it is equally safe for adults and teens . <h> Clean &amp; Clear Soft Oil-Free Night Moisturizer <p> Clean &amp; Clear Soft Oil-Free Night Moisturizer actually is oil-free , and suitable for normal to oily skin . It contains 3% glycolic acid , which helps remove dead skin , open pores , and even out the texture of the skin . It works well enough you should not have to take unused product back to the store to demand a refund . <h> Clean &amp; Clear Soft Oil-Free Day Moisturizer SPF 15 <p> Clean &amp; Clear Soft Oil-Free Day Moisturizer SPF-15 is a light lotion that does not feel oily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face looking shiny . It uses avobenzone to protect the skin from harmful UV-A rays , and contains antioxidants . <p> Because the antioxidants are listed in alphabetical order , it is not possible to ascertain just by looking at the label which antioxidants may be available in higher amounts and which are present only in trace amounts . The SPF 15 sun protection is perfect for a summer day on the beach in Scotland , but not strong enough even for winter sun protection in much of Australia and the southwestern United States . <h> Clean &amp; Clear Soft-In Shower Facial <p> Clean &amp; Clear Soft-In Shower Facial is a slightly creamy soap containing plastic beads that are supposed to do the work of microdermabrasion in a one-minute application used in the shower . The product also contains a tiny amount of alpha-hydroxy acids that are supposed to exfoliate the skin , but the soap in the product changes the pH so the alpha-hydroxy acids wo n't work , and they just get rinsed off the skin in a few seconds , anyway . <h> Clean &amp; Clear Morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oil Absorbing Sheets are squares of polyethylene plastic used to mop up excess oil from the face . Most users find that the face is still shiny even after use of the sheets . <h> Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Detoxifying Cleanser and related products <p> Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Detoxifying Cleanser promises to oxygenate the skin . It really cant , and that 's a good thing , because free radicals of oxygen are highly toxic to the skin . What Clean &amp; Clears Morning Burst Detoxifying Cleanser , Morning Burst Facial Cleanser , Morning Burst Shine Control Facial Cleanser , Morning Burst Detoxifying Facial Scrub , and Morning Burst Facial Scrub can do is to leave your face feeling tingly with the power of menthol . That tingle is an allergic reaction that reddens the skin and increases irritation inside pores , trapping bacteria inside even when oil is not present in excess . <h> Clean &amp; Clear Deep Action and Deep-Cleaning Products <p> This is a group of products that includes : <p> Deep Action Cream Cleanser , Oil-Free , <p> Deep Action Cream Cleanser , Sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <p> Deep Cleaning Astringent , <p> Deep Cleaning Astringent , Sensitive Skin , and <p> Deep Action Exfoliating Scrub <p> Let 's start with the product that is almost usable . Deep Action Exfoliating Scrub might be OK for non-sensitive skin if it did not contain menthol , but the menthol can cause redness and irritation in most skin types . <p> Deep Cleaning Astringent for Sensitive Skin also might not be all that bad except for the fact that the alkali in the soap cancels out the exfoliant ability of the salicylic acid added to the product . The product is at least not harmful to the skin . Deep Cleaning Astringent also has salicylic acid in a high-pH product that- neutralizes it , along with alcohol that can dry out the skin . <p> The remaining products in this group all contain so much menthol ( or menthol derivatives ) that they can inflame the skin . If you use them , you will certainly notice a difference , but it wont be good . <h> Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Invisible Acne Patch <p> At first glance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great way to zap a zit , especially on oily skin . The tiny patch contains just a dab of salicylic acid , enough to stop inflammation and remove redness overnight . The problem is that the patch not only contains salicylic acid that removes redness , it also contains cinnamon oil that can cause redness . But the cinnamon oil smells nice . You can take comfort in smelling like apple pie while your pimples grow redder . <h> Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Acne Cleanser <p> The Advantage Acne Cleanser contains the important skin care ingredient salicylic acid , in a mixture of ingredients that neutralize it . Even if the product had been formulated to maintain salicylic acid at the pH that helps it break up hardened oils in clogged pores , this important skin care ingredient would only stay on the face a few seconds before it was washed away . Plus , this product uses sodium olefin sulfonate for its main cleansing ingredient . Sodium olefin sulfonate dries out even oily skin , making it wrinkle , but usually leaving oil in pores . <h> Clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advantage Acne Spot Treatment is gel used to zap zits individually . The problem with the treatment is that it is mostly made of alcohol , which dries out the skin . The alcohol can kill acne bacteria on the surface of the skin , but the drying action of the alcohol may trap other acne bacteria inside pores . <h> Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Acne Control Kit <p> Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Acne Control Kit looks like a bargain with its US $20 price tag . The problem with the Acne Control Kit is that it contains all of the skin-irritant ingredients mentioned above , and a few more . Like many , many kit products , it is designed to give you just enough improvement in your skin to keep you using it . It wo n't " get the red out , " and the harsh , irritant chemicals will cause new whiteheads to break out just as soon as pimples heal . <p> Its a lot better to start your acne care program with a kit of supplies from a reliable vendor , like Exposed Skin Care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knows what is healthy for your skin . 19923 @qwx879923 
@@98778852 @2978852/ <h> Green Tea Extracts Are Extraordinarily Effective for Fighting Acne <p> If you treat your skin with tretinoin topical lotion , blue light therapy , red light therapy , or benzoyl peroxide , you will probably get some visible results right away . If you have multiple pimples , blackheads , and whiteheads , however , chances are that about 2/3 of them will still be on your skin a month later . Even three to six months later , you will probably still have some signs of acne , about 1/3 of the original blemishes , and it is almost unheard of for a single treatment to eliminate acne on anyones skin . <p> Green tea wont eliminate 100% of acne overnight , either . But scientists at the University of Miami in Florida found that a lotion containing 2% green tea extract got rid of , on average , 58.3% of lesions in just six weeks . Volunteers in the study had an average of 24 blemishes at the beginning of the study and an average of just 10 after 42 days . <p> The way green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sebum .

Using a device called a Sebumeter , the Pakistani researchers confirmed that using green tea lotions " significantly " reduced production of skin oils in this oiliest region of the face . <h> Green Tea Also Protects the Skin Against Sun Damage <p> Green tea extracts also protect the skin against damage by the sun . Dermatologists at several universities in the United States have studied the phenols in green tea for protecting the sun against the harmful effects of UV radiation . They have focused on finding natural products that protect the skin against the effects of UV-A rays , wavelengths of sunlight that do about 95% of solar damage to the DNA of the skin , but which are n't  stopped by many sunscreens sold in the USA .

Scientists have found that even when the skin is pre-treated with green tea extract , UV rays from sunlight cause immediate damage to the skin . When researchers studied skin samples 48 hours later , however , skin cells that were treated with green extracts began to repair their DNA so it would function normally . Cells that do n't  get any sun protection become inflamed . Cells that get green tea do not . <p> What does sun damage have to do with acne ? If you happen to have Asian or light brown skin , the answer is , a lot . Many people whose predominant skin tones are gold or light brown say that the worst thing about acne is not the whiteheads , blackheads , and pimples . It is the brown spots on the skin left behind when acne heals .

But have you heard about gold nanoparticles for acne or Compound 71 ? This article discusses medicine on the horizon for acne treatment . <h> Summary : <p> Scientists are constantly developing new treatments for acne . <p> Gold nanoparticles are being developed to deliver potent acne medications directly to pores without causing inflammation over the rest of the skin . <p> A synthetic form of the antioxidant curcumin is in the final stage of clinical trials for approval as an acne treatment . <p> A new form of lauric acid , found in virgin coconut oil , may make an effective acne treatment . <p> A " trash tree , " the Eastern red cedar , has been discovered to contain 17 different compounds that may fight both acne and staph bacteria . <p> Potent medications for treating the severe form of acne known as acne conglobata may also be useful for treating milder forms of the disease . <h> Gold Nanoparticles for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ailments for hundreds of years , but it is only in the last 20 years that scientists have understood how gold works as a skin treatment . <p> The problem with most skin treatments is that the medication is water-soluble but the skin is water-resistant . Gold nanoparticles are useful as liposomes for carrying water-soluble medications into the skin because they are " tunable . " Gold does not bond with water-soluble medications when the surrounding environment has a pH of 7 or higher . It wo n't deliver a medication to most of your skin . If your skin is not medicated , it wont be irritated by the medication . <p> The pH of the fluids inside skin pores , however , is 5 or lower . At this pH , gold bonds to water-soluble medications , helping them flow deep into pores , where they are needed . Research scientists at the University of California at San Diego are developing gold nanoparticles to deliver potent acne medications directly into pores without causing irritation or inflammation on healthy skin . <h> Compound 71 <p> Compound 71 is a synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curry spice turmeric . Turmeric has been used in Ayurvedic medicine as a treatment for acne for thousands of years . Nothing that occurs naturally in turmeric can be patented ( and subsequently sold at a higher price ) . A chemical very similar to curcumin dubbed both ACJ-9 and Compound 71 , however , is being tested as a treatment for acne by Androscience Labs in San Diego , California . <p> Compound 71 works by stimulating the degradation of testosterone receptors in the skin . When testosterone levels in the body increase , they activate receptors in the skin that instruct sebaceous glands to make more oil to release into pores . Reducing the production of skin oil reduces the number and size of whiteheads and blackheads . Compound 71 has passed the first rounds of clinical testing and is scheduled for final clinical trials in 2012 . <h> Water-Soluble Lauric Acid <p> Lauric acid is found in virgin coconut oil . It has some really remarkable curative powers . It can kill Listeria bacteria and the bacteria that spoil food , and it also kills acne bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it kills acne bacteria without irritating skin the way benzoyl peroxide can irritate skin . The problem with using lauric acid or coconut oil as a skin treatment for acne is that the lauric acid is not soluble in water so its very difficult to spread across the skin . <p> Scientists at the University of California at La Jolla are developing liposomes that will help lauric acid dissolve in the somewhat watery contents of skin pores . As a liposome , lauric acid fuses with the lining of the pore and offers continuous protection against acne infection without causing irritation or flaking of the skin . <h> Compound in Eastern Red Cedar May Yield Acne Treatment <p> From the Midwest to the Atlantic coast , farmers in the United States are plagued by Eastern red cedar , a " trash tree " that grows like a weed and that can not be used for lumber or firewood . A scientist at the University of Missouri at Columbia , however , has found an antibacterial chemical in this variety of cedar that may control antibiotic-resistant staph infections and acne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this species of cedar that can kill bacteria .

It may be as long as 10 years , however , before any of the 500,000,000 Eastern red cedar trees infesting American farms will be harvested to make acne treatments . <h> Cholesterol-Lowering Medications Unsuccessful in Treating PCOS Acne <p> Women who have polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) often develop acne , due to overproduction of testosterone . Since the basic building block of testosterone is cholesterol , scientists at the Shrimati Kaumudiniben Health Outcome Research Group in India have been testing the use of statin drugs to treat PCOS acne . <p> A clinical trial involving 244 women who had acne caused by PCOS who were given the statin drugs simvastatin ( Zocor ) or atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) .

Almost the only medication that treats this form of acne is dapsone , an intense antibacterial drug that is also used to treat leprosy . <p> Doctors have discovered that smaller doses of dapsone along with the pore-opening drug Differin can treat mild to moderate common acne when other treatments fail .

Here are some acne product ingredients that you may want to avoid . <h> 1,4 Dioxane <p> The Environmental Working Group estimates that 22% of cosmetics contain 1,4-dioxane , a chemical used to help other ingredients dissolve in solution . Although the US FDA treats 1,4-dioxane as " relatively nontoxic , " the US EPA has spent tens of billions of dollars removing it from contaminated soil . Exposure to large amounts of 1,4-dioxane in the environment causes damage the kidneys and central nervous system .

The manufacturing of BPA requires mixing phenol ( which in turn is made from benzene ) and acetone ( the same chemical in nail polish remover ) in the presence of hydrochloric acid . The resulting chemical becomes the polymer that is used to make plastic containers for your acne products . <p> The problem with BPA is that it interacts with animal tissues in much the same way as estrogen .

Its better both for the environment and for your own health . If your acne treatment comes in a clear bottle , chances are that the bottle contains BPA . If your acne treatment comes in an opaque bottle , chances are that it does not . <h> Oxybenzone <p> Until very recently , most sunscreens and sun blocks only offered protection against the suns milder , UV-B rays . Sunscreens and sun blocks did not , for the most part , protect the skin against the more dangerous UV-A rays .

@@98778860 @2978860/ <h> When Acne Puts You on the Spot 19922 @qwx879922 <p> One of the least frequently considered complications of acne is hyperpigmentation , the formation of small , or not so small , brown spots on the skin after pimples heal . Hyperpigmentation can occur on all skin types and all skin shades , but it tends to be more prominent with darker skin . <h> Why Acne Causes Hyperpigmentation <p> The pigment making melanocytes in the skin are cells that fill at least two different needs . They produce the black and red pigments that blend with the natural tones of the skin and the coloration caused by the flow of blood to give the skin a recognizable overall tone . Your melanocytes are an important part of what makes you recognizable as you by helping create your skin tone . <p> The melanocytes also perform another very significant function . The pigments they release serve double duty as antioxidants . They stop the oxidative reactions that generate inflammation in the skin . When a pimple pops out on your face , the skin is inflamed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fades and shrinks . <p> In fair skin , there are not as many melanocytes to make the pigments that quench inflammation . When the pimple heals , there is not as much leftover pigment available to form brown spots . <p> In Asian , Hispanic , and African skin types , there are more melanocytes in the skin to make the pigments that serve as the antioxidants to stop acne inflammation . There is more melanin pigment left in the skin at the end of the healing process . People who have darker skin have more pigmentation after acne heals . Since the pigments that quench inflammation are brown and the predominant tones in Asian skin are golden , hyperpigmentation is especially noticeable on Asian skin . These spots are known as melasma . <h> To A Certain Extent , Acne Is All In Your Head <p> The formation of pigments in your skin actually begins in your brain . The melanocytes , which make up about 3% of all the cells in your skin , a little higher percentage in dark skin , a little lower percentage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because a related chemical process makes the sleep chemical melatonin , not getting enough sleep or not getting enough uninterrupted sleep has a direct and immediate , although subtle , effect on your skin tone . <p> A part of the brain known as the pituitary gland coordinates the skins release of antioxidant pigments with the adrenal glands production of stress hormones . Both the cortisol produced by the adrenal glands and the melanin produced by the skin reduce inflammation . The pituitary gland increases the production of both substances to deal with inflammation caused by acne or sunburn . That 's why sunburn or excessive sun exposure during the healing process makes brown spotting after acne so much worse . <p> Your brain also protects you from the emotional distress of acne by producing a feel-good chemical called dopamine . When the brain senses inflammation in your skin , the pituitary releases a compound called tyrosinase that breaks down certain tyrosine-containing proteins ( tyrosine is an amino acid ) into dopamine . That 's mostly a beneficial process , except for some people who have Asian skin types . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Good Idea to Blast Away Skin Spots <p> Dermatologists used to think that melasma after acne was a good reason to use their high-powered , high intensity carbon dioxide lasers to blast the spots right off your face . Of course , the treatment got immediate results . On darker skin types , however , the results were less than desirable . The blast of laser light removed the brown spot but inflamed the skin around it , and the skin repaired itself by making a still larger brown spot . <p> Many dermatologists then turned to a kind of chemical " skin blaster " known as hydroquinone . On many skin types , hydroquinone works quite well . But some people used it developed visible , banana-shaped fibers in the skin . They might also develop a rough texture on the skin that some dermatologists compare to caviar ( which must really be irksome if you paid for the procedure on your credit card ) . And in time the skin that is treated with hydroquinone sometimes develops black and blue spots . The treatment in effect replaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sensitivity to hydroquinone is tied to a condition called ochronosis . People who have ochronosis have a hereditary deficiency of the enzymes that recycle the amino acid tyrosine . That means when the brain senses the irritation in the skin caused by hydroquinone and triggers the release the processes requiring the above-mentioned tyrosine to be broken down , the enzymes needed to complete the process are not available . Black and blue pigment accumulates in the skin . Anyone can have ochronosis , but it is most common in people who have Asian skin types . <h> Getting Rid of Brown Spots the Slow and Easy Way <p> If you have skin discoloration after acne , especially if you have dark skin , it is very important to avoid inflaming your skin to cure it . Chances are that your dermatologist will not even offer carbon dioxide laser treatment , but some dermatologists are willing to take risks by offering hydroquinone treatments to patients who have Asian skin types . ( This is OK if your dermatologist has run a urine test for a compound called homogenistic acid and ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You also need to avoid the over-the-counter skin lightening products made by Murad . <p> The most effective ways to get rid of brown spots on all types of skin are skin peels with salicylic acid or glycolic acid , administered by an aesthetician , and treatments with a form of vitamin A known as retinol and a form of vitamin B known as niacinamide . <p> Skin peels do exactly what the name suggests . They remove upper layers of the skin so that the basal layer of the skin can replace them with unpigmented skin . This process takes at least a month . <p> Retinol and niacinamide keep the melanoctyes from transferring pigments to the rest of the skin . Retinol accelerates growth of the skin , and niacinamide does double duty as an anti-inflammatory agent . <p> These agents are applied to the skin , but that 's not all you can do to prevent and reverse brown spots on the skin . <h> Treating Brown Spots from the Inside Out <p> Since the process that forms brown spots begins in the brain , brain health is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow a complicated routine of maintaining your brain to fight acne-related changes in your skin . Simply getting enough sleep , with the help of melatonin or GABA if necessary , is reflected in your complexion . <p> It also helps to take a B vitamin supplement that provides all eight essential B vitamins , biotin ( B7 ) , cyanocobalamin ( B12 ) , folic acid ( B9 ) , pantothenic acid ( B5 ) , niacin ( B3 ) , pyridoxine ( B6 ) , riboflavin ( B2 ) , and thiamine ( B1 ) .

It consists of an herbal supplement that " flushes out toxins , " a daily skin wash for opening clogged pores , and a protection cream that " draws moisture into " your newly rejuvenated skin . <h> Summary : <p> Healthy Pores is a company that is also known as ClearPores in the USA and Canada . <p> Healthy Pores makes honest claims for its products , that they reduce breakouts , not that they cure acne . <p> Healthy Pores offers a three-step system for treating acne , a daily supplement , a pore cleansing facial wash , and a skin protection cream . <p> The problem with all three of these products is that they contain ingredients that can irritate your skin . If you have oily skin acne and you do n't  break out when you are exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a try . <p> If you have acne on dry or sensitive skin , you may get better results from Exposed Skin Care . <p> The makers of Healthy Pores make a statement that very few manufacturers of acne treatment systems dare to share with the public . They state that their system is not a cure for acne . As they correctly point out , no product cures acne . All products can do is to reduce the frequency and severity of acne breakouts . Some acne care products , however , are much more effective than others . Let 's look at what Healthy Pores can do for you . <h> Healthy Pores Daily Supplement <p> The first step in fighting acne in the Healthy Pores system is a daily nutritional supplement . It contains aloe vera , Atlantic kelp , burdock root , cayenne , echinacea , licorice root , red clover , sarsaparilla , and partially dehydrogenated cottonseed oil . There is nothing in this list of ingredients that helps fight acne from the inside out , and there are some ingredients that can actually make acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in iodine . Our bodies need iodine , but too much iodine can cause the skin to break out . People who consume too much kelp are also at risk for hyperthyroidism ( excessively high thyroid function ) , which can cause a wide range of health problems . <p> Echinacea relieves inflammation , but it can also interfere with the action of birth control pills , making pregnancy more likely . Licorice root in excess can cause water retention and high blood pressure . And partially dehydrogenated cottonseed oil is anything but a health food . Its high in the omega-6 essential fatty acids that are turned into inflammatory hormones , and most cotton is harvested after application of defoliant chemicals . <p> Its just not possible to recommend this supplement , but let 's take a look at the rest of the system . <h> Healthy Pores Deep Facial Wash <p> The second step in fighting acne in the Healthy Pores system is twice-daily use of the Deep Facial Wash . This product promises to remove the bacteria that cause acne . It claims to encourage dead skin cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its basal layer . It promises to remove excessive sebum so there is no more shiny skin , and to stop the formation of whiteheads , blackheads , and pimples . <p> The manufacturers promise that Healthy Pores Deep Facial Wash will prevent future breakouts and restore the natural pH of the skin . The cleanser also contains , they say , nutrients that will speed healing . <p> The ingredients in the Deep Facial Wash include water , bisabolol , cetaryl alcohol , flaxseed extract , glycerin , glyceryl stearate , parabens , salicylic acid , and vitamins A and E. Salicylic acid is a great product for breaking up the protein glue that holds dead skin cells to the surface of the skin and for stimulating the production of collagen beneath the skin . The problem with this product is that the salicylic acid is at the wrong pH " and even if were at the right pH , it is rinsed away before it has a chance to act . <p> Vitamin A helps rejuvenate skin with minimal risk of irritation , although vitamin E stimulates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  need to worry about any unwanted side effects of either vitamin in this product , however , because both antioxidant vitamins break down about as soon as you open the bottle . <p> Glycerin and glyceryl stearate help draw water to the skin , but they are rinsed off before they can trap moisture in the skin . And both bisabolol and parabens can cause skin inflammation and irritation . <p> If you have oily skin but you do n't  tend to get pimples , and you do n't  have eczema , atopic dermatitis , contact dermatitis , or skin allergies , this product would be OK . But its no better than many other products that cost a lot less . Now let 's look at the third step in the system . <h> Healthy Pores Skin Protection Cream <p> The third step in the Healthy Pores acne treatment system is the Skin Protection Cream . Its advertised as fighting inflammation and leaving the skin feeling smoother . Its supposed to keep pores from clogging , limit the growth of acne bacteria , and moisturize the skin to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains water , isopropyl palmitate ( a form of vitamin A ) , propylene glycol , salicylic acid ( or beta-hydroxy acid/BHA ) , soy extract , paraffin , parabens , and potassium hydroxide ( a chemical similar to lye ) . Like many other acne products , it contains a great skin protection ingredient , salicylic acid , in a form that cant do any good . In this mixture , the addition of potassium hydroxide leaves the pH too high for the salicylic acid to loosen dead skin cells or lighten brown spots . And the potassium hydroxide also neutralizes the isopropyl palmitate " but it ensures no one will have any stinging or burning from the use of the cream . It wont hurt your skin . It just wont work for your skin . <p> Healthy Pores advertising says that no scientific studies have found a clear link between diet and acne ( although there is strong evidence of a link between consumption of dark chocolate and breakouts of pimples ) . The company does not claim Healthy Pores is a miracle cures . Its advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 7 to 14 days , but that complete results usually take 90 days . And the company does not claim that their system cures acne , only that it controls it . <h> Should You Try Healthy Pores ? <p> Healthy Pores states that " your skin must be clear in 90 days or we insist that you let us return your money . " That 's a higher ethical standard than most purveyors of acne treatments follow . You do n't  have any financial risk in trying Healthy Pores . And you do n't  have substantial risk of side effects unless you have dry , sensitive skin that tends to break out in small pimples or if you have rosacea . You just might get a good result if you have oily skin and you do n't  tend to break out when you are exposed to fragrances or perfumes . <p> If you do have sensitive skin , however , you might want to try another system that comes with a one-year money-back guarantee , Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923

There are acne treatment systems with five to nine products that may get rid of up to 95% of pimples , blackheads , and other blemishes in 30 days . <h> What About the My Zeno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earlier version of the Heat Treat system that only provided a heat treatment for the skin .

According to dermatologists , using My Zeno heat treatment got rid of 96% of blemishes in 48 hours and 100% of blemishes in 72 hours . <p> The clinical trial also tested a placebo . The placebo ( the same as doing nothing ) got rid of 63% of blemishes in 48 hours and 75% of blemishes in 72 hours . In other words , My Zenos own clinical trials found that the device was only 21% better than doing nothing at all . And one can only imagine that the clinical trial carefully excluded anyone who had serious acne issues . <p> However , there is at least a little evidence that heat treatments can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School of Cornell University in New York City found that heat treatment resolved about 50% of blemishes in 4 days , compared to 36% for no treatment at all . In other words , heat treatment helps but it is not a cure-all . <h> To Get Really Clear Skin , You Need a Systematic Approach <p> Most people with acne who achieve really clear skin use a combination of approaches . One method might get rid of 50% of blemishes , a second method might get rid of 50% of the blemishes that are left , and so on . At the very least , you will need a good cleanser , some treatment to kill bacteria ( it does n't  have to be heat-based ) , salicylic acid or glycolic acid in the right concentration and at the right pH to break up gunk in clogged pores , some treatment that can correct small pores and small areas of brown skin left behind when acne heals . <p> There are a couple of good acne treatment systems . A great product to get started with is Neutrogena Acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available at cosmetics counters , in supermarkets , and online , and contains both moisturizer to keep your skin soft and 2% salicylic acid to get your pores open .

Compare that to US $37.99 for the My Zeno Heat Treat system that probably wo n't do you any good . <p> Once you begin to see good results from the Neutrogena , you can start correcting long-term acne issues with a complete acne system like Exposed Skin Care .

@@98778863 @2978863/ <h> Plasma Portrait for Acne Scars 19922 @qwx879922 <p> A Plasma Portrait device works by heating the topmost layer of skin where the cells are dead , and stimulating the production of collagen . <p> The Rhytec Plasma Portrait device is a recent addition to the kinds of treatments you can get only from a licensed dermatologist for the revision of scars caused by acne . Neither a chemical peel nor a laser treatment , it modifies the skin with the energy generated by a plasma . <h> What Is a Plasma ? <p> We often think of materials as being solid , liquid , or gas . There is also a fourth state of matter known as a plasma . In a plasma , the atoms or molecules of the substance are so energized that they become " excited . " The plasma generates an ultra-high frequency energy that can be directed at the skin without making physical contact with the skin . Because plasma generates energy vibrating at a frequency higher than laser light , it does not interact with individual components of the skin , blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laser therapy does . <p> Many dermatologists describe the new Plasma Portrait as a " non-aggressive " therapy for acne-scarred skin . It replaces a long line of treatment devices that doctors learned were too " aggressive " to be used safely for treating all acne scar patients . <p> About 1995 , doctors had started using carbon dioxide lasers to treat scars . Carbon dioxide laser treatments required long recovery times . They replaced scars with redness , and there was usually progressive loss of pigmentation of the skin . A light or white area was usually visible where the scar had been . <p> The carbon dioxide laser literally burned off the skin . Most people cant tolerate that . It was also unsafe for people of color . <p> Many dermatologists gave up on laser scar revision altogether and started using chemical peels . The problem with chemical peels was that they produce only superficial changes in the skin unless the doctor used something aggressive like phenol , and phenol treatment of the skin ran the risk of the same kinds of complications that came with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scar revision or chemical peels before the Rhytec Plasma Portrait became available in 2008 . <h> How Does the Plasma Portrait Work ? <p> The Plasma Portrait is a non-contact device . It does not touch the skin . It has faster healing times than either carbon dioxide laser therapy or the heavy-duty phenol peels that used to be used for scar treatment . <p> The Plasma Portrait is what dermatologists call a " non-chromaphore dependent procedure . " It does not interact with pigments in the skin . It is safe for all kinds of skin . <p> The plasma gas emitted by this device superheats the topmost layer of skin , where the skin cells are already dead . Destroying these cells with heat produces immediate improvement in a scar . There is also a " thermal remodeling " zone below the layer of dead skin that stimulates the production of collagen by the skin . <p> It takes four to six months for the production of collagen in the thermal remodeling zone of the skin to produce further , visible changes in the contour of the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collagen as long as year after treatment . <p> That 's what is different about plasma therapy of the skin . Superficial skin treatments like microdermabrasion and intermediate-depth treatments like ruby laser therapies do n't  stimulate the production of collagen deep in the skin . They have short-term effects that make limited improvements in the appearance of scars , while Plasma Portrait makes dramatic changes in the scar that unfold as the skin renews itself over a period of six to twelve months . <h> Not a " Zapper " <p> One of the advantages of plasma therapy of acne scars is that the outermost layer of skin stays intact . At lower settings , the outermost layer of skin never comes off at all . At higher settings , the outermost layer of skin comes off after about 3 or 4 days . The most appreciated reason that is such an advantage is that patients do n't  have the burning pain that they feel with laser treatments and skin peels , but the most important reason this is such an advantage is that intact skin protects against infection better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healing . Within 7 days , a new layer of skin has formed , and it is close to being healed . If there is an open wound , it is only open for a couple of days . <p> There is minimal discomfort compared to CO2 laser therapy . Other methods can require carefully changing bandages over the skin over a period of 3 to 6 weeks , but Plasma Portrait may only require meticulous skin care for 3 to 6 days . <h> What You Can Expect at a Plasma Portrait Appointment <p> Having your scars treated with Plasma Portrait does not require anesthesia or sedation . Your dermatologist will probably only rub your skin with a topical pain reliever before doing the treatment . <p> The darker your skin , the lower the setting the dermatologist will choose for your treatment . If you have African , Asian , or Middle Eastern skin tones , the doctor will avoid the risk of discoloring your skin by using only the lowest setting for the plasma treatment , which does not cause any breaking of the skin . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large skin , the doctor may use a higher setting that causes the skin to slough off in 3 or 4 days . This difference in technique is due to the degree of pigmentation in the skin . The more pigment you have in your skin , the more likely you are to develop brown spots if your skin is excessively inflamed or irritated . <p> If you have darker skin , you may need several appointments over a period of months to stimulate the rebuilding of your skin . If you have fair skin , the doctor may give you a single treatment at a high setting . There is no " in between " setting for Portrait Plasma , because researchers have found that moderate power plasma causes all the sloughing of skin that occurs at a high-energy setting with none of the healing benefits . <p> Most doctors still recommend carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) laser for the most effective acne scar treatment . But the easy recovery from Portrait Plasma makes it a more appealing option in medical scar correction . <p> Dry Tattoos to Eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can find articles about skin peels for eliminating acne scars , dermabrasion and microdermabrasion for eliminating acne ... 19923 @qwx879923

It gently removes excess oil and makeup and loosens skin debris so they can be rinsed off the skin with warm water . <p> The second Sensiclear product is a balancing toner . Applied with a cotton ball , this treatment reaches into pores to remove mats of dead skin that can keep oil and acne bacteria from flowing to the surface . <p> The third Sensiclear product is a " blemish-free acne lotion . " It is used not just on the face but also on the neck and back and other blemish-prone skin . Its meant to be left on the skin for at least several hours , and may be applied up to three times a day . <p> How well does Sensiclear work ? The makers of Sensiclear claim that their tests show that the product : <p> Removed 50% more whiteheads , blackheads , and pimples than Proactiv during the first three days of use , <p> Reduced the number of acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightness by 92% in 28 days , and <p> Reduced skin redness by 200% " just 28 days , " which seems to imply that Sensiclear can eliminate more redness than is even on the skin . <p> Maybe it relieves redness from the skin of your friends and family members . Its hard to interpret that last claim . And the company also claims in its FAQ that users have 200% fewer blackheads ( presumably a negative number of blackheads ) when they use Sensiclear . But let 's take a look at the other advertising claims made for Sensiclear . <h> Removing Acne Fast <p> One of the key claims for Sensiclear is that it removes 50% more acne in the " critical first three days " than the competing product Proactiv . However , the makers of Sensiclear also warn that their product can " purge " the skin of impurities and cause even worse breakouts after 7 to 10 days of use . <p> " Anytime you begin a new acne regimen , you may experience a purging of your pores . This is a natural process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface and are released from your pores causing an increase in breakouts . This process can take 7-10 days and should not be painful or accompanied by cystic flare ups . Once the purging process is complete , you will be on your way to a healthy , radiant , acne-free complexion with continued use of SensiClear . " <p> So which is it , fewer blemishes in 3 days or more in 7 to 10 ? There are n't  any scientific studies of Sensiclear so there is no way to know for sure , but there is a great deal of information about one of its main ingredients , salicylic acid . <p> Salicylic acid , if its used in the right concentration and at the right pH , breaks up the " glue " that holds dead skin cells together . An overabundance of skin cell production in the lining of pores is what causes acne in the first place . As these cells eventually die , they stick together and clog skin pores . Salicylic acid breaks up the proteins that cause them to adhere to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . <p> There 's nothing about salicylic acid that causes breakouts of acne . If you use too much , however , you can have an allergic reaction ( which will cause general redness but not pimples ) or your skin might try to repair itself by making additional sebum ( which will cause new whiteheads but not blackheads or pimples ) . If you really do break out in new pimples within two weeks of starting an acne treatment , its not working for you ! <h> The Secret Ingredient in Sensiclear <p> Sensiclear says that its treatment is better than the dozens of other less expensive products that use salicylic acid because of the addition of Retextra , which it identifies as " Hydroxyanasatil Retinoate " and for which it claims to have a patent pending . There is not any chemical by that name , although this name would be an out-of-date way of identifying a real chemical called butylated hydroxyanisole . This chemical is added to vitamin creams and retinol to keep them from oxidizing when the container is opened . It really ca n't preserve vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the application of butylated hydroxyanisole is n't unique to Sensiclear , it is possible that the company uses it in a unique amount in the product . Perhaps the company is seeking to patent the use of a vitamin A stabilizer in a product that does n't  contain any vitamin A. But is n't it odd that the important active ingredient in an " all-natural " skin care product is a synthetic chemical ? And this is n't the only chemical in Sensiclear . <h> Taking a Closer Look at the Lists of Ingredients <p> Sensiclears cleanser , the list of ingredients on the label tells us , is made with sodium lauryl sulfate , also known as SLS . While many people do not react to SLS , up to 80% of adult women who have acne around the mouth or on the skin can clear up their blemishes just by avoiding all products that contain the chemical . For many people who have acne , the Sensiclear cleanser is as likely to cause acne ( in the form of small red pimples ) as it is to stop it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The problem with using salicylic acid in a toner is that you rinse it off your skin almost as fast as you put it on your skin . Salicylic acid needs several hours to work well . Youd do a lot better with a $5 product like Johnson &amp; Johnson Clean &amp; Clear Acne Mark Remover than with this product . <p> The spot treatment for Sensiclear consists primarily of yet more salicylic acid . The company proudly advertises that its products do not contain benzoyl peroxide " which actually can irritate the skin " but neither does it contain any other ingredient that can fight acne bacteria . There 's nothing in Sensiclear that does more for fighting acne bacteria than treating your skin with nothing at all . <p> And if your choices for acne treatment are Sensiclear and nothing at all , you are probably better off going with nothing at all . For a systematic acne treatment system that makes sense , however , you are better off with Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923

Add to this the reality that many good dermatologists are lousy photographers , which in this situation is a good thing , and expectations are lowered so that patients start looking for smaller changes . But dishonest doctors sometimes try to talk patients into paying for a procedure with deceptive photography that leads to upset later . <h> Improvement in a Flash <p> The most obvious way to alter appearance is to change the lighting .

Oily Skin <p> Back in the Clearasil era , in the 1950s and 1960s , just about every mass-marketed acne product was designed to treat pimples on oily skin . Nearly every product had a peach colored tint that did a pretty good job of masking pimples if you had peach-colored skin ( and made them a lot more noticeable if you did n't  ) , and nearly every product had antiseptic foaming action . For some people , these products worked . For some , they actually made acne worse . <p> Then in the 1970s and 1980s , the makers of acne care formulas began to realize that the problem that creates acne is oil on your skin , not oil in your skin .

The problem is always the oil on your skin . <h> Pigmented Skin vs . Non-Pigmented Skin <p> Some people get freckles , sun spots , and age spots , and also developing browning or blackening of the skin after acne , cuts and scrapes , or other forms of skin irritation . Some people have skin with even pigmentation and no spots of any kind . If you have highly pigmented skin , that is , skin that produces spots , you need to avoid any kind of irritation or inflammation to keep your skin tone smooth .

It works by killing Propionibacteria acnes ( P. acnes ) , the bacteria that is responsible for acne when it grows out of control in sebum-clogged pores .

@@98778871 @2978871/ <h> Bonbons for Acne ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Frutels is a brand of edible cosmetics that claims it helps fight acne . <p> If your concept of the ideal way to fight acne is lying on the sofa eating bonbons , then Frutels sounds like the product for you . Frutels has launched a line of edible cosmetics including a chocolate bonbon that is designed to fight acne . <p> The makers of Frutels tell us that their chocolate bonbons stop acne before it starts with a vitamin-rich formula designed to fight hormones , stress , and dietary excess . Unlike vitamin capsules and vitamin pills that are hard for the body to digest and that deliver nutrients hit-or-miss in the lower digestive tract , the nutrients in Frutels are carefully mixed with antioxidant-rich dark chocolate . They are sugar-free , 100% vegetarian , suitable for people who keep kosher or hallal , and contain no artificial ingredients . <p> A " majority " of people who use the product , the Frutels people tell us , see their acne clear up when they start eating the bonbons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1 or 2 Frutels a day if you have mild acne , 3 or 4 Frutels a day if you have moderate acne , and 5 Frutels a day or more if you have severe acne . <p> But do the claims for Frutels really hold up ? <p> First of all , dark chocolate really does cause acne in some people . Its not the fat in dark chocolate that 's the culprit , its the theobromine , the chemical that makes you say " ahhhhh " when you eat chocolate . Its more than a little surprising that even a sugar-free version of dark chocolate would not have this side effects . <p> And then there is the matter of those vitamins and minerals that are in Frutels . Each Frutels contains calcium , iron , and magnesium , but less than 1/10 of 1% of your RDA . <p> Each Frutels also contains a little fiber , about 6/10 of a gram , and a lot of vitamins C , E , B1 ( thiamin ) , B2 ( riboflavin ) , B3 ( niacin ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B9 ( biotin ) , and B12 ( cyanocobalamin ) . Just a single bonbon provides 80% of a days supply of vitamin C , 90% of days supply of vitamin E , and up to 440% of some of the B vitamins . <p> The problem is , that 's not necessarily a good thing . Getting more than 100 IU of vitamin E a day ( the equivalent of four Frutels ) can actually increase sebum production . Eating two bonbons at the same time would give you what the US Food and Drug Administration considers to be an unsafe , excessively large dose of potassium . And that " natural " sweetener is n't stevia . Its a synthetic sugar alcohol that can give you gas and also play havoc with your blood sugar levels , but only the day after you eat the product , so its harder to track down the cause of high blood sugars . <p> The makers of Frutels also claim that their bonbons wo n't bleach or burn your skin . That 's most certainly true . <p> Frutels , however , are just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Times recently ran- a story on a $38 edible cosmetic called Beauty Booster . <p> Currently available on QVC , Beauty Booster is the creation of Australian makeup maven Sue Devitt and nutrition expert Tanya Zuckerbrot .

Instead , you add drops of Beauty Booster into other healthy foods . <p> What 's in Beauty Booster ?

The side effects of the top acne treatments range from sunburn to suicide . This article will give you a honest overview of the top acne treatments , explaining who benefits most and who may not benefit at all . <h> Summary : <p> For mild to moderate acne , the least expensive treatments typically work best . <p> Pharmaceutical intervention for acne usually carries risk of serious side effects . <p> Medical procedures for acne usually give quick results , but with significant pain and expense . <h> Soap and Water <p> Taking a used washcloth , dunking in steaming hot water , wrapping it around a bar of Lava soap , and using to rub your face red is a perfect example of how soap and water can make acne worse . For the mildest cases of acne , however , simple soap and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There are three basic rules for the successful use of soap and water for treating acne-affected skin . <p> Let the soap do the work . Apply a lather of soap to your skin and leave it there for 30 seconds , without rubbing , scrubbing , and massaging it in . <p> Use warm water , not hot , and not cold . Warm water hydrates your skin " in fact , you get 5 times more moisture into your skin by splashing it water than by applying moisturizer , at least for about half an hour . Hot water dries out the skin , and cold water shocks the skin and slows down any healing process . <p> Once you get your face clean , do n't  put grease , grime , and oil right back on it . Always dry your face with a clean towel , blotting rather rubbing your skin dry . <p> Many teens who have mild to moderate acne respond to an intervention as simple as soap and water . Most adults who have mild to moderate acne , whose skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were younger , need a whole lot more . <h> Cleansers , Moisturizers , and Exfoliants <p> Most people who have acne spend enormous amounts of money finding the right cleanser for their skin type , and the right moisturizer for their skin type , and then the right exfoliant ( dead skin remover ) for their skin type . Its a lot easier and a lot less expensive to start with a product that provides all three in the same package , such as Exposed Skin Care . Instead of trying and possibly returning dozens of daily acne care products , you can try one product from one source with a money-back guarantee . Sometimes keeping skin clean , moist , and exfoliated , however , is not enough either . <p> If you just have to try an exfoliant product on your own , remember that : <p> Salicyclic acid , which is a beta-hydroxy acid , helps break up plugs of sebum stuck in pores . <p> But if you have trouble remembering which is which , it may be a better idea just to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors treat acne with antibiotic ointments or antibiotics taken by mouth . There are several serious drawbacks to antibiotic treatment . <p> The most significant problem with antibiotic treatment is that is only has an effect on inflammatory acne , pimples , and it has no effect at all on non-inflammatory acne that causes whiteheads and blackheads . Acne bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotic ointments , so they simply do n't  work . And oral antibiotics can wipe out the helpful , symbiotic bacteria in the colon that keep other kinds of pathogenic microorganisms " as well as inflammation throughout the body " in check . <p> If you use an antibiotic ointment , its usually a good idea also to use benzoyl peroxide . The chemical wipes out the bacteria that may be resistant to the ointment . And if you take an oral antibiotic , it is usually a good idea to take a probiotic supplement to maintain and restore the useful microbes that normally live in the colon . <h> Blue Light <p> A blue light wand is a much simpler way to treat bacteria infecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer DNA damage that " knocks out " their ability to reproduce in the skin when exposed to certain wavelengths of visible blue light . This light does not penetrate the skin beyond the depth of the pores , and leaves the underlying structure of the skin unaffected . Blue light is safe for home use , and treatment kits are available for as little as US $150 . <h> Retinoic Acid and Retinoids <p> Vitamin A is the nutrient that gives the skin the power to grow new cells . Retinoic acid is a form of vitamin A the body can use more immediately . Retinoids are essentially vitamin A on steroids . A class of drugs including Accutane , Retin-A , Adapalene , and Tazorac , retinoids cause the skin to grow so quickly that it literally opens up over deep-down acne infections , making lancing or surgery unnecessary . <p> If you have sensitive , oily skin with acne , you may find that a retinoic acid cream helps keep pores open with very few side effects . If you have nodular or cystic acne , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get any other way . Just be forewarned that one of the side effects of retinoid treatment for severe acne is something the doctor usually does n't  warn you about , a new case of mild to moderate acne . Opening up cysts and nodules is only the beginning of acne treatment . <h> Chemical Peels <p> If retinoids such as Accutane and Retin-A are fairly described as " vitamin A on steroids , " then it would be fair to compare chemical peels to " exfoliants on steroids . " Aestheticians and cosmetologists , usually working under the supervision of a dermatologist , apply strong chemicals such as chloracetic acid directly to the face . When skin is removed down to the level of the bloodstream , it grows back without infection " at least for a time . <h> Laser Therapy <p> Lasers treat acne from the inside out . Choosing a wavelength of light that coagulates blood but not skin , the physician cuts off the skins blood supply . In a few days to a few weeks , acne blemishes simply die and fall off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin remains smooth . Laser therapy is a lot less painful that having the skin burned off with acid or " sanded " off with dermabrasion , but it is also a lot more expensive . <p> These are the most commonly used successful acne treatments . These top acne treatments are generally safe and usually affordable , although some of them are not cheap . Always start with the simplest and least expensive interventions before you avail yourself of medical care for mild to moderate acne . And if you simply do n't  know where to start , try an acne treatment kit , like Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923

The honest answer is that the best daily routine for keeping acne under control depends on your skin type and the type of acne you have . Different types of skin require different daily skin care regimens for common acne , and different kinds of acne may require entirely different approaches for keeping skin clear . <p> Here are the highlights of daily acne care regimens that work for common acne on oily , dry , and sensitive skin , and for special concerns with Asian skin tones , black skin tones , womens acne , - rosacea , and back acne , also known as bacne . <h> Summary : <p> The right acne regimen depends on your skin type and skin issues .

They can have a side effect that women in particular would find objectionable . <p> The best treatment for back acne is salicylic acid , delivered as a spray . <h> Mild to Moderate Acne on Oily Skin <p> Oily skin tends to shine a few hours after it is washed , and it is usually oilier across the brow and on the nose . People who have oily skin can get any kind of blemish , but they tend to get more blackheads and whiteheads than pimples . <p> The most important thing to remember in your daily acne care regimen for oily skin is to keep pores open . It is not just oil that clogs pores . Blemishes form when pores get clogged with clumps of dead skin trapping acne bacteria .

People who have dry skin also can get any kind of blemish on acne-prone skin , but they are more likely to break out in pimples than to get whiteheads and blackheads . <p> The most important thing to remember in your daily acne care regimen for dry skin is to keep skin moisturized . That does not mean you need to put oil on your skin . Instead seal the moisture that is already in your skin with moisturizers that contain ingredients like dimethicone , which keeps your skin smoother and softer with deeper natural colors . <h> Mild to Moderate Acne on Sensitive Skin <p> Sensitive skin is " tense " skin that gets red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing alcohol , or botanical extracts . People who have sensitive skin tend to get more pimples than blackheads and whiteheads , and they can get acne even when they do not have excess oil on the skin . <p> The most important thing to remember in your daily acne care regiment for sensitive skin is to avoid anything that stings or burns your skin . Do n't  use products that contain perfumes , essential oils , botanicals ( other than green tea and gotu kola ) , menthol , or alcohol . If you use moisturizer , try a spritz of a mineral water such as Avene Thermal Spring Water before you put on the moisture complex , and treat your skin with a product that contains azelaic acid ( such as MyChelle Clear Skin Serum ) as directed . <h> Treating Acne on Asian Skin <p> Many people who have rich golden skin tones find that the brown pigmentation left when acne heals is a bigger cosmetic concern than the acne itself . Asian skin tends to be very sensitive to the combination of sunlight and acne medication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , you need to be sure to use sunscreen on your face whenever you are using antibiotics , tretinoin topical , benzoyl peroxide , or even tea tree oil . Using the acne treatment in the morning and moisturizing your skin with a product that contains natural vitamin E after your nighttime skin cleansing will help reduce the formation of brown spots . <h> Treating Acne on Black Skin <p> The worst acne problems on black skin are usually caused by shaving or hair removal . Plucking , tweezing , or shaving hair sometimes leaves part of the hair in the follicle . Black skin is often fast-growing skin , and it grows over the ingrown hair . Then the immune system tries to attack the hair trapped in the follicle and turns the skin over it into pink scar tissue . <p> Women can prevent this problem by using electrolysis to get rid of unwanted facial hairs . Do n't  try to do electrolysis at home . See a cosmetologist who is very familiar with the issues of black skin care . Do n't  use chemical hair removers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin . <p> Men can prevent this problem by never shaving the face or scalp with a dull razor . Always dispose of safety razors after 2 or 3 uses . Apply shaving cream to the skin very liberally to soften hairs and make them easier to cut off at the skin line . Consider using clippers instead of a razor . If the hair is left as long as a grain of rice ( about 2 mm ) , it will not grow inward . <h> Treating Womens Acne <p> Millions of women have acne breakouts just before they have their periods . The skin thickens as progesterone levels rise during the second half of a womans menstrual period , and pores open and drain as estrogen levels rise during the first half of a womans menstrual period . <p> Premenstrual acne is never inevitable . Even if nothing is done to change hormone levels , a daily regimen of skin cleansing along with regular use of glycolic or salicylic acid peels will do a lot to help keep the skin smooth and evenly colored . Taking the contraceptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acne . The 1/3 to 1/2 of blemishes that are not affected by use of the Pill require the same kinds of skin care techniques used to treat ordinary acne on dry , oily , sensitive , Asian , or black skin . <h> Treating Rosacea <p> Rosacea breaks out in tiny red pimples across the cheeks , around the eyes , and on the nose . This form of acne is not caused by clogged pores . Instead , it is due to tiny leaks in the capillaries underneath the skin . These blood vessels leak when blood is forced into the skin by reflex action of nerves in the face or by vasodilation to cool the temperature of the face or inner body . <p> Eating buckwheat or blueberries 3 to 5 times a week provides anthocyanidin plant compounds that may strength capillary walls and make them less prone to leakage .

The easiest way to treat back acne is to use a salicylic acid spray , such as Paulas Choice 2% Beta Hydroxy Acid Liquid for All Skin Types .

The latest treatment for the worlds most common skin condition involves blasting away acne with ultrasound . <h> There Isnt Just One Cause of Acne <p> Ultrasound , which well consider in more detail in a moment , is not a miracle cure for acne . It brings acne care to a new level , but it is not a stand-alone cure or even a stand-alone treatment for any kind of acne . <p> The treatment of acne is always multifactorial because the causes of acne are always multifactorial . While there are literally hundreds of contributing factors that determine the severity of acne , there are primarily four processes that create acne-related blemishes : <p> Follicles become plugged with accumulations of dead skin from the lining of the pore . <p> Sebaceous glands at the base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Acne bacteria , primarily a species known as Propionibacterium acnes ( P. acnes ) accumulates underneath the plug of dead skin cells from the lining for the pore and accumulated sebum . <p> Inflammation generated by the immune system causes redness , irritation , and swelling . <p> There are more pores on the face , neck , back , and chest than anywhere else on the body , so we get more acne on those locations . We do n't  have many skin pores , say , on our feet , so essentially no one ever gets acne between their toes . <p> The standard treatment for acne consists of a retinoid , benzoyl peroxide , and an antibiotic . Throughout this site you 'll find many suggestions about better combinations of treatments that will give you faster and more complete results , but this typical trio of prescription meds has a sound scientific basis . <p> Retinoids are derivatives of vitamin A that stimulate the growth of the skin . The skin pulls away from the sides of the pores and the contents can simply fall out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as whiteheads and blackheads , and inflammatory blemishes , such as pimples and cysts . <p> Benzoyl peroxide is antibacterial . Killing acne bacteria is just about all that benzoyl peroxide does , although in some skin types it also strips away dead skin over pores and helps them drain faster . The nearly universal problem with benzoyl peroxide treatment is that a formula that is strong enough to kill acne bacteria is also strong enough to dry out and irritate the skin . If the only treatment you use for acne is benzoyl peroxide , there will be a point at which the drying and irritation of your skin closes as many pores and forms as many new blemishes as the antibacterial action of benzoyl peroxide heals . <p> Antibiotics are a second line of attack against acne bacteria . Most prescription antibiotics also kill other kinds of infectious bacteria on the skin . Benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together reduce the risk of leaving " stray " bacteria that can come back with a vengeance when treatment is stopped . <p> Its easier to write an advertisement about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound bite explaining why blemishes start with the accumulation of dead skin . If the pore is never blocked by the accumulation of dry , dead skin cells then acne bacteria and sebum production are a minimal problem or no problem at all . <h> Ultrasound for Stopping Acne Before It Starts <p> Pacific Biosciences in Seattle has created an ultrasound deep cleaner for removing dead skin cells from pores before sebum and bacteria can accumulate and form a blemish . The device is known as the Clarisonic . It has a rotating head that generates 300 vibrations per second to jostle dead skin loose from the lining of pores with the help of nonabrasive cleansers . <p> Its probably stretching the meaning of the term to refer to the Clarisonic cleaner as operating with " ultrasound . " The kind of ultrasound used in medical diagnostic imaging operates at about 3 million vibrations per second . A " sonic knife " operates at about 5 million vibrations per second . The home therapy kits you can get for applying skin treatments run at about 1 million vibrations per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rearrange the cells in the skin . They force a tiny opening in the skin that is large enough to admit molecules of certain skin treatments in to the skin but not large enough to admit viruses , bacteria , or other microorganisms , good or bad . Tiny tunnels in the skin stay open for about 100 vibrations , or 1/10,000th of a second . That 's long enough to for a treatment that ordinarily stays on the skin to get into the skin . <p> Of course , you want to be very careful what you use on your skin with you follow up with true ultrasound treatment . <p> The Clarisonic does not have this kind of power .

Murad produces treatments for acne , aging skin , and cellulite for both teens as well as for adult women and men . Dr. Murads treatments focus on hydrating the skin to keep it healthy . <h> Summary : <p> Murad was founded by Dr. Howard Murad , a board-certified dermatologist who also teaches medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles . <p> Most Murad products are expensive . You usually can find a much less product that works just as well . <p> Some Murad products can be described as " would be great except . " Alcohol and herbal ingredients added to some of the products make them irritating for all skin types . <p> For a much less expensive approach to acne-prone skin care , look into Exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee . <p> The strengths of the Murad skin care line for acne treatment are its excellent cleansers and exfoliants made with glycolic acid . Many Murad products are fortified with additional antioxidants for added skin protection . The downside of the Murad skin care line is that some products that otherwise would be excellent for treating acne contain ingredients that can irritate the skin . Let 's take a look at the top sellers . <p> Murads Refreshing Cleanser blends a standard skin cleanser , sodium laureth sulfate , with a variety of botanical ingredients that could be best described as , well , refreshing . The cleanser includes cucumber , kiwi , algae , and witch hazel extracts . It also has a small amount of glycolic acid , an alpha-hydroxy acid , but not really enough to break up stubborn blackheads or to stimulate growth of new skin . If you are sensitive to sodium lauryl sulfate ( SLS ) , this product may not be for you , but for most people its a pleasant , although expensive , skin cleanser suitable for everyday use . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exfoliate and peel away dead skin around pores : glycolic acid ( an AHA ) , salicylic acid ( BHA ) , and jojoba wax beads . While the salicylic acid in this formula is enough to take the red out of pimples and sensitive skin , neither the AHA content nor the BHA content of the product really is enough to exfoliate your skin . The real exfoliating ingredient is the jojoba wax beads . This cleanser will , as advertised , help your skin look brighter , although its not potent enough to get rid of blemishes . <p> Murads Perfecting Night Cream contains a number of plant oils that are idea for relieving irritating in the skin , such as evening primrose oil and grapeseed oil . It also includes green tea extract , which will reduce sebum production in pores . The retinyl palmitate in the formula is a synthetic variation of vitamin A that will penetrate pores and help encourage release of tired skin cells , and the hyalouronic acid in the formula may help strengthen tiny blood vessels on rosacea-prone skin . The product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can easily enough find ascorbyl palmitate , tocopheryl acetate , and alpha-lipoic acid in a second skin care product . <p> Murads Oil Free Sunblock is a good choice for oily skin . It contains avobenzone , which helps block UV-A rays that do the most damage to skin . It also contains other ingredients like octisalate that can reduce redness and irritation in a base that is mostly water plus some botanical ingredients without the titanium dioxide and zinc oxide that can give brown or black skin a purple cast . If you have sensitive skin , you might want to avoid this product , especially if you have a problem with citrus , lemon , or geranium extracts , but most people with oily skin will find it to be a very good choice . Just be aware that you can find better products for a lot less money in any drugstore . <p> Murads Intensive Resurfacing Peel is advertised as a less expensive at-home alternative to expensive skin peels at the spa or aestheticians office . The advertising for this product reads " The benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical micro-exfoliants doubles the resurfacing for twice the benefits . Reveal radiant youthful looking skin that is hiding underneath dull , dead skin cells . Use in the weeks leading up to a special occasion to get that perfect complexion or use every week for serious anti-aging benefits . " <p> There really is enough glycolic acid and salicylic acid , between 3% and 4% , at the right pH , 2.8 , to strip away dead skin around clogged pores and open blackheads and pimples . Whether this concentration should be described as " intensive " is a another matter . Most aestheticians would use up to 40% glycolic acid during an office visit , although this concentration is definitely too strong for you to use on your own face . The microdermabrasion element of the product is bamboo fiber , which , as beauty expert Paula Begoun says in her review , " offers the same microdermabrasive strength as using a washcloth .

Murads T-Zone Pore Refining Gel would be nearly the perfect formula for treating whiteheads and blackheads in this area of the face except that it contains a large amount of rubbing alcohol " not enough to kill acne bacteria on contact , but enough to irritate all skin types . If you have extremely oily skin it might be a disaster , but when the skin is dried out with alcohol it often repairs itself by producing even more oil . <p> Murads Acne Body Wash contains 1% salicylic acid , a proven skin treatment for opening blocked pores and rejuvenating the skin , in the right amount and at the right pH . Unfortunately , you wash the salicylic acid off your skin before it has a chance to work . Also , this product contains menthol .

Acnexus is advertised as a one-step acne solution for teens and adults that will annihilate red , oily , itchy skin and get rid of blackheads once and for all " but does it really work ? <h> Summary : <p> The makers of Acnexus claim that it can get rid of 99.7% of blemishes in just 4 weeks , but most of the ingredients in the product can make sensitive skin acne worse . <p> Acnexus does not contain any chemical ingredients , only botanicals . <p> Most of the botanical ingredients in Acnexus can irritate the skin or trigger allergies . <p> Using Acnexus will probably make rosacea worse . <p> Acnexus offers the most generous return policy in the industry " but you are likely to need to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> A Combination of Natural Ingredients <p> Acnexus is made with a combination of natural ingredients . The makers of Acnexus point out that it does not contain mineral oils ( which usually are n't  included in acne products ) , alcohols of any kind , parabens preservatives , sodium lauryl sulfate ( SLS ) , or benzoyl peroxide . They note that leaving too much benzoyl peroxide on the skin can " burn a hole right through it , " although this is only true when benzoyl peroxide is used in a concentration 10 times stronger than appears in acne treatments . <p> According to them , Acnexus can heal existing blemishes while preventing new breakouts , get rid of blackheads and reduce the size of pores , decrease redness and reduce oil production . <p> What goes into Acnexus ? This one-step formula , which comes in a 9 oz bottle , includes : <p> Aloe vera gel , which the makers of Acnexus say to be key to healing the skin . The kind of healing involved in acne , however , is stopping the overproduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vera helps restore collagen production in broken skin . <p> White willow bark , which the makers of Acnexus claim releases salicylic acid which reduces inflammation and breaks up blackheads . Salicylic acid does in fact reduce inflammation and break up blackheads , but only when it is available in a concentration of 0.5% to 3% and at a pH of 2.9 to 3.9 , which it is not in this formula . <p> Chaparral , which the company identifies as " a very expensive aqueous extract . " Chaparral was the original source of creosote , used to weatherproof railroad ties . The creosote in chaparral is carcinogenic , although there is not enough creosote in Acnexus to cause skin cancer . <p> Gotu kola , which the company identifies as " food for the brain . " ( Do n't  rub their product on your brain . ) Gotu kola and caffeine in creams that help them adhere to the skin are actually valuable in treating cellulite , but they have no effect on any kind of acne . <p> Alfalfa , which the company claims contains an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin actually makes it more hospitable to acne bacteria , and acne is not caused by a fungus . <p> Valerian which has " stimulant properties.which soothe the skin . " Stimulating the skin does not soothe it . Valerian is a mild sleep aid but the compounds in valerian are not absorbed through the skin . <p> Green tea , which the company claims stimulates the immune system . Since it is the immune systems overreaction to the presence of acne bacteria that causes inflammation in pimples , stimulating the immune system is not necessarily a good thing . Green tea does , however , reduce sebum production in the skin , but it needs to be applied to the skin in a cream ( that stays on the skin ) in a concentration of at least 3% . <p> Redmond clay , about which Adnexus notes " Generations of people have used the clay for an all natural facial with no additives , chemicals or preservatives . " This product , however , adds 26 other additives to the clay . There is no reason to suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the company says is produced by a complicated , " sophisticated " chemical reaction , hydrolysis . Hydrolysis is nothing more than breaking down a chemical by the addition of water .

The avocado in the formula increases the likelihood of an allergic reaction to these botanicals . <p> Chamomile , which is also advertised as an especially expensive essential oil ( its one of the cheaper essential oils used in cosmetics ) and as an anti-inflammatory , which it is , except for people who are allergic to ragweed . <p> Vitamin E , which is said to repair acne and stretch marks . It does repair stretch marks , but its primary use in treating acne is preventing discoloration of the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any vitamin E in a product packaged in a jar breaks down as soon as the jar as opened . The vitamin E in Acnexus is more stable because it is in a pump bottle , but it is important not to leave the product exposed to the air . <p> Could Acnexus actually do any acne sufferer any good ? If you do n't  have sensitive skin , that is , you do n't  have any allergies to botanical ingredients , putting the clay on your face might be a good way to soak up excess oil . There is no reason to suppose the product would counteract inflammation and it would actually be better if it did not deeply penetrate the skin , but some people will do better if they use the product every day . <p> If you have sensitive skin or allergies you should not use Acnexus .

But there are 27 separate ingredients that can cause skin problems in Acnexus . If you have sensitive skin or rosacea , please leave it alone . <p> The only way using Acnexus is likely to help you is by the manual rubbing and scrubbing you do to apply it to your skin , and that 's just not how the best acne products work . A good skin scrub does all the work . You just put it on your skin and it cleans your pores .

@@98778881 @2978881/ <h> Can Honey Truly Stop Acne ? 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Honey can help reduce inflammation , as well as kill the bacteria on the skin . <p> Honey has been used as a skin treatment for thousands of years , especially in the Middle East . Honey has such potent antiseptic powers that it is even used as a surgical dressing by plastic surgeons in the United States , and it can also play an important role in your fight against acne . The best kind of honey for treating acne and other skin infections , however , is Manuka honey , imported from New Zealand . <h> Summary : <p> Honey is a natural acne treatment that can help cure acne in two different ways . Eating honey reduces sensitivity of the skin . Using honey masks and honey bandages kills bacteria on the skin . <p> The best kind of honey for treating acne is manuka honey , collecting from bees that feed on tea tree bushes on the east coasts of Australia and New Zealand . <p> Manuka honey contains a compound called methylglyoxal that fights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid if it stirred . A manuka honey mask is more likely to drip if you talk while you are wearing it . <p> Manuka honey only comes from Australia and New Zealand . <p> Greek and Turkish honey are also great for reducing inflammation of the skin . <p> Any locally produced honey may help reduce inflammatory reactions of the skin . <p> Honey is a great way to complement daily skin care with a complete acne fighting system like Exposed Skin Care . <h> What Is Special About Manuka Honey ? <p> Manuka honey is collected from bees that gather pollen from manuka bushes , also known as tea tree plants , growing on the drier , eastern coast of New Zealand . Most manuka honey is made by bees that gather pollen and nectar exclusively from this plant . The manuka flower makes a chemical called methylglyoxal , which provides infection-fighting potency to the honey whether you eat it or you use it as a skin treatment . You can apply manuka honey directly to your skin , or use manuka-soaked sterile bandages , or even take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unusual consistency . It is a thixotropic liquid . If you shake a thixotropic liquid , it gets thinner . If you let it stand in a jar , it thickens , even if the temperature rises . The advantage of thixotropy in skin treatments is the more you move , the more the honey is spread evenly over your skin . Manuka honey wont dissolve in perspiration , and it wont leak out of bandages . <h> So Do You Eat Manuka Honey Or Do You Put It On Your Skin ? <p> Eating about a tablespoon ( 15-20 grams ) of manuka honey every day is a great way to get your daily dose of natural antioxidants in a tasty treat . The quercetin in the honey will reduce your sensitivity to allergens , and slow down the reactions of acne-prone skin to stress . <p> Specially made manuka honey dressings ( sterilized to make sure the honey is not contaminated ) applied to broken skin help it heal . And manuka honey nose sprays help treat sinusitis . One of the strains of bacteria that causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow pus . <h> How to Recognize the Best Brands of Manuka Honey <p> There is so much demand for manuka honey that it is sometimes counterfeited . Manuka honey never comes from China . Real manuka honey only comes from the east coasts of Australia and New Zealand . <p> The medicinal potency of Manuka honey is measured in units called UMF . A UMF rating of 10 or lower tells you that you should use the product internally . It contains quercetin and other antioxidants that may " calm " acne-prone skin , and it may help you develop resistance to all kinds of allergies , but it does not contain enough methylglyoxal to kill bacteria on contact . <p> If your Manuka honey has a UMF between 10 and 20 , its optimal for treating uncomplicated skin infections . A UMF over 20 is used in making surgical dressings . Its OK to use Manuka honey that has a UMF of 20 or more , but you do n't  need to pay a premium price to get it , because lower strengths of honey will work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " total activity . " It is better to buy brands of Manuka honey that are labeled in terms of UMF . " Total activity " is a measure of antioxidant activity that begins to degrade just as soon as you open the jar . UMF actually increases when you open the jar . <p> Legitimate providers of Manuka honey are registered with the Active Manuka Foundation , and their products carry the Active Manuka trademark . <h> How to Use Manuka to Fight Acne <p> The simplest skin treatment with manuka honey is a manuka mask . Use your regular skin cleanser , rinse , and pat your skin dry with a clean towel . Pour about 2 tablespoons ( 30 grams ) of manuka honey into a bowl . With clean fingers , gently spread the honey over your entire face , including your forehead ( but not your eyebrows ) and over your jawline . <p> Its not a good idea to try to carry on a conversation when you have manuka honey on your face , because muscle movement will make the honey run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rinse off with warm water 15 to 30 minutes later . If you step outside and bees start following you down the sidewalk , then you did n't  get all the honey off . Be sure to rinse off the honey mask thoroughly , because you will be rinsing off dead bacteria with it . <p> If you have an especially nasty skin infection , you can treat it by loosely covering it with a prepackaged manuka bandage . Do n't  try to use manuka with Bandaids . The combination of the honey under the cotton swab and adhesive of the bandage clogs healthy pores while you are treating infection under the bandage . <h> Will Other Kinds of Honey Also Work ? <p> Almost any kind of honey will help fight redness and inflammation . Greek and Turkish honey products are usually very high in the plant chemicals that take the red out of acne . Any locally produced honey is likely also to be rich in quercetin that fights allergies . <p> You fight allergies by taking honey internally , that is , by eating it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactions in your nose and throat , and digestion of the honey releases plant compounds that circulate to the skin . It is best to consume honey between meals . Heating the honey , for example , stirring it into tea , does not affect its anti-inflammatory power . Eating honey once a day is ideal . <p> Fighting skin infection , however , is best done with Manuka honey . If you get good results from tea tree oil , you will get great results from Manuka honey , but you have to apply it directly to your skin and leave it there for at least 15 minutes . You can apply honey to your skin every day if you like " but the very first time you use a new brand of honey , be sure to test a dot of the product on the inside of your forearm to make sure you do n't  have an unexpected reaction . <p> Okay , so I just got off proactiv and my face has basically exploded with breakouts ! On a different website , it said to use apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple weeks , its gotten rid of scars , but the acne comes in waves where I 'll have a few breakouts and the scars look irritated Basically , I 'm asking if there 's anything better to use for that , thanks <p> Its been my experience that acne is an inside out " problem . Please pay attention to your diet . Drink mineral water and anti-oxidant teas ( you can use the tea bags on your skin too ) . Please avoid processed foods ( fast foods , packaged cheese , anything with complicated ingredient lists ) . I have used a product called Arbonne RE9 Skin Toner . It works very well . Its about $40 ( yikes , I know ) , but it is gentle and contains seaweed . It made my skin look and feel EXCELLENT so I recommend it . But try the natural remedies first and see if you can save money . Good Luck . Ill be praying for you . 19923 @qwx879923

And now nineteen years old , she is . But as the ABC Good Morning America host Robin Roberts pointed out , Cassandra has been dealing with acne almost as long as she can remember , or at least since the age of eight . <p> " I got my first pimple when I was in third grade . And as I had my ninth birthday and then ten , eleven , and twelve , it just kept getting progressively worse . " When Cassandra posted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would even look at them herself . <p> At first Bankson thought that she would be getting the same hate for her acne online that she got at school .

She was amazed by the comments she got . <h> " Its Been Overwhelming " <p> Cassandra need not have feared ostracism over the Internet . As it turned out , she said , peoples outpouring of sympathy has been " overwhelming . " She received comments from teens and adults , men and women .

@@98778883 @2978883/ <h> Hair Today , Gone Tomorrow 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Red light therapy which helps treat acne , can also be used to stimulate the growth of hair on the scalp in women who have been affected by hair loss . <p> Millions of women who suffer polycystic ovarian disease , a condition also known as PCOS , display acne as one of their most prominent symptoms . But for about 30 million women in the United States who have polycystic ovarian disease ( PCOS ) or other hormonal imbalances , an even more disturbing symptom is the loss of hair in a pattern resembling male-pattern baldness . Some treatments that work for acne overlap with treatments that work for baldness in women . <h> Hair Loss in PCOS <p> In women who have PCOS , hair loss is a result of elevated levels of testosterone . The kind of hair loss triggered by PCOS is essentially male pattern baldness in a woman . Testosterone circulates through the bloodstream to the skin where an enzyme converts it into an active form of the hormone that switches off growth from hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in this condition testosterone levels run very high . <p> Why do women who have PCOS have elevated testosterone levels ? There is no definitive explanation for elevated testosterone in each and every woman who has PCOS . Some women who have the condition actually have low testosterone levels . In other women who have the condition , the problem is how the body recycles testosterone . But in other women who have the condition , the problem is that insulin , the hormone that transports glucose sugar inside cells , does not " stick " to its target cells properly . <p> When insulin ca n't do its job , blood sugar levels increase . Most of the tissues in the body have to receive glucose with the help of insulin ( except at extremely high blood sugar levels ) , but the ovaries are an exception to the rule . The ovaries have to house all the eggs a womans body will ever produce . The ovaries have to have a constant supply of glucose to fuel their activities . They can absorb sugar from the bloodstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ovaries use the inflowing flood of glucose to make more hormones . They make both estrogen and testosterone . The extra estrogen interferes with the hormonal signals that restart the menstrual period and women may fail to ovulate and also fail to have periods . The excess testosterone causes both acne and hair loss . Interestingly , there is one treatment that works for both conditions . <h> Light Therapy for Hair Loss and Acne in Women <p> For hundreds of years , folk healers have recognized that sunlight has a beneficial effect on both acne and hair loss . The old advice used to be to " dry out " the skin to treat both conditions , but it is not actually drying that causes improvements . It turns out that specific wavelengths of visible light have specific effects in the skin . <p> Visible blue light ( either from sun exposure or from a blue light lamp ) kills the bacteria that trigger inflammation in acne . Visible red light reduces sebum production in the oil glands at the base of pores , so blemishes do not grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also stimulates circulation of blood through the skin , and have begun using laser light therapy using a red light-emitting diode ( LED ) to stimulate the growth of hair on the scalp in women who have been affected by hair loss . <p> Could you get the same effect from using an acne treatment lamp ? <p> Makers of acne treatment lamps cautiously guarantee they will work for treating acne , although government regulators take a very close look at these kinds of claims . No maker of a red light lamp or blue-red combination light lamp typically used for acne treatment is going to guarantee it will restore womens hair . Dermatologists usually prefer to use a much stronger light source for a much shorter time . <p> But if you are a woman who has both acne and hormone-related hair loss , red light treatment may be worth a try . A red light or combination light lamp wont cost more than $200 " while a custom-designed wig can cost as much as $2000 . Do n't  neglect other possibilities for taking care of hair loss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But try red light and see if hair regrowth is not accelerated . <p> Frequently asked questions about womens hair loss : <p> Q. What does female hair loss look like ? A. Hormone-related hair loss in women follows the same pattern as in men . Hair begins to fall out as the sides of the forehead , causing a " widows peak , " and hair loss continues on the scalp at the top of the head . The process is usually gradual and not total . Sudden , total hair loss is usually due to toxic exposure or an autoimmune disease . <p> Q. Are women ever treated with hair plug transplants ? A. The old procedure of transplanting hair in " plugs " created a number of cosmetic disasters for men in the 1960s and 1970s . Some well-known news anchors in the United States can no longer appear in close-ups on television because of the scarring left by failed hair plug transplants . Nowadays , especially for women , dermatologists typically transplant single hair follicles , one at a time , to give the resulting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transplants leave scars ? A. Usually the dermatologist removes a strip of skin from the back of the scalp , which still has hair . The individual follicles are then dissected out of the donor skin and individually transplanted into the bare scalp that needs correction . The strip of skin used to harvest hair follicles leaves only a fine scar that is concealed by healthy hair . <p> Q. Are there any drugs for womens hair loss ? A. The only approved drug for womens hair loss is Minoxidil . Its also available over the counter without a prescription . Minidoxil is more effective when treatment is begun as soon as hair loss is noticed , not after the scalp has been bare for a period of years . <p> Q.

Here is a quick review of the best and worst acne patch products . <h> Summary : <p> Acne patches work like Bandaids for pimples and blackheads . <p> Most acne patches do n't  deliver what they promise . <p> Acne-Free 1 Hour Pimple Patches do n't  do anything you cant do with a squirt of benzoyl peroxide gel " which kills acne bacteria but does not reduce redness or inflammation . <p> Andrea Face Qs Acne Treatment Patches are a good treatment for small areas of rosacea , but you need to be careful to remove all the adhesive off your face the next morning . <p> Claudia Stevens Hydro-Gel Over Night Patches is not marketed as an acne treatment , but it is the best product on the market for getting the redness out of pimples . <p> Clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you cover up with two more layers of makeup to conceal a pimple . Its supposed to heal pimples " but it can cause " makeup malfunctions " on your face . <p> Dr. Blaines ScarCare Gel Pad really is not designed for acne scars . <p> Ponds Clear Solutions will help loosen blackheads . They may not fall off your skin the first time you use the pads , but they will usually fall of your skin the second time you use the pads . <p> Skin Benefits Blemish Acne Pimple Spot Reducer is not a bad product . Its just not an especially useful product . Its primary benefit is helping you avoid bleaching hair and fabric . <p> Do n't  treat blemishes . Prevent them with a complete treatment system such as Exposed Skin Care . <p> Acne patches have been in use for over 10 years , mainly in Asia and Korea but they are starting to become more popular in the US . There are basically two types of patches : medicated and unmedicated . They are usually packaged as thin , vinyl-like sheets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and- applied on the affected area . They usually have an active ingredient that is meant to get rid of pimples or acne on your face . The most common medications applied on the sheets include tea tree oil , benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid . These patches work by keeping the medication on your skin long enough for the ingredients to work on the pimple . They also prevent you from touching the affected area , keeping the extra dirt and grime from your fingers- out of your skin and preventing bacteria from multiplying on the area . <p> The downside to these patches is that if you have sensitive skin , you can get skin irritation if the products are left for too long on your face . Also , the adhesive used on the patches can cause skin irritation or cause acne breakouts on the areas where they have been applied . The major advantage of this spot treatment is that you only use the patches on the affected area , sparing the rest of your skin from being treated since treating healthy skin can result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as hydrocolloid patches work by sucking out water from pimples . The hydrocolloid material they are made of consists of a material that is meant to attract water to a thin plastic film . This material is made out of carboxymethyl cellulose , pectin and gelatin , while the outer layer of the patch is made out of polyurethane material . This helps to lock in the moisture in the patch and prevent water from evaporating , so the wound does n't  become dry , enabling it to heal faster . <p> One often overlooked benefit is a patch will prevent you from picking or touching , which can add more germs and problems to your acne . <p> When you remove the patch from the pimple after some time and look at the patch , the patch should- be- swelled up with- some whitish stuff on it. - This is supposed to be evidence that the patch has worked . The pimple may- become much flatter and less inflamed . These patches also help to keep you from constantly touching the pimple , which helps to keep germs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been done on the use of 3M dressings on pimples for a week , it has been found that the severity of the pimple reduces in addition to the oiliness , redness and hyper pigmentation . This is as contrasted to the use of tapes . <p> The advantages of using these patches include the fact that they can help- your pimples heal faster since they provide a moist environment . They make it possible for active ingredients to penetrate the skin and act on the pimple . You do n't  need to reapply them after washing your face with water , since they are waterproof . They also protect the blemishes from UV light , which can help you maintain an even skin tone by preventing pigmentation . <p> Whether you choose to use medicated or unmedicated patches , you need to realize that they will not make your pimples disappear overnight . Yes , the affected area will likely- look better than before but the acne will not be cleared , especially if you have severe acne , like cystic acne . Also , even though these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform differently , so it is worth checking out reviews about how each patch works before buying it . Unmedicated patches are best used if your pimple is raised and has pus that needs to be sucked out . If the pimple does n't have pus , but it is inflamed , then a medicated patch is the best option . The medicated patches have the advantage of being thin that means that if your pimple is flat , the patch will not be very visible when you wear it on your skin . <p> When purchasing the patches , you need to be careful to ensure that you buy the right one , since you can easily confuse unmedicated patches with medicated patches as they look very similar . Just keep in mind that unmedicated patches tend to be slightly more expensive than the medicated patches . They normally- have the term hydrocolloid written on the packaging- and- medicated patches usually list the active ingredients . Some of the places where you can buy these patches include online on Amazon and EBay . You can also get them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock the patches , so you will find them in shops like RoseRose Shop , Sasa and Tester Korea . <p> If you are looking for round unmedicated patches , there are many options to consider . You can find Spot Medic patches at Priceline , MEDca at Amazon and 3M Nexare , COSRX and skinfood can be bought on Amazon and EBay . You can find these non medicated patches , which you can cut to a suitable size on both Amazon and EBay . This includes Duoderm , Coloplast , Comfeel and Johnson and Johnson Tough Pads . You can find medicated A'pieu and Innisfree treatment patches on Amazon and EBay , while you can find Formula 10.0.6 on Priceline and EBay . You can buy Peter Thomas Roth on EBay and Sephora . <h> AcneFree 1 Hour Pimple Patches ( US $6.45 ) <p> To use the Acne Free 1 Hour Pimple Patch , first you peel out a plastic strip with a little bulls on it . You put benzoyl peroxide on the bulls eye , and then place the bulls eye on your pimple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benzoyl peroxide penetrate your skin and start healing the pimple right away . <p> There is just one problem with this system . Even if the triethanolamine , ethylparaben , methylparaben , and phenoxyethanol in the activating gel do help benzoyl peroxide get into your skin fast , the benzoyl peroxide does not make the pimple less noticeable right away . It just kills bacteria . Clearing up redness and swelling can take another 1 to 2 weeks . Since all you get out of this product is benzoyl peroxide , its just as beneficial and a lot less expensive just to keep a tube of benzoyl peroxide around for spot treatment . If you need to cover up a zit , it is better to use concealer than it is to use this product . <h> Andrea Face Qs Acne Treatment Patch , Box of 10 Patches ( US $6.99 ) <p> These convenient acne patches deliver a combination of azelaic acid and salicylic acid that really can reduce redness and break up the sticky skin that holds blackheads in place . They may be a good treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only problem with the product is that the adhesive around the edges of the patch can cause new acne blemishes ! <h> Claudia Stevens Hydro-Gel Over Night Patches ( US $6.99 ) <p> Not really marketed as an acne product , Claudia Stevens Hydro-Gel Over Night Patches are actually one of the few patch products that can really clear up pimples . Unlike the products that are marketed specifically for acne treatment , all of which contain benzoyl peroxide , this skin patch is made with tea tree oil . Benzoyl peroxide kills acne bacteria but does not reduce redness or inflammation . Tea tree oil both kills acne bacteria and reduces redness and inflammation . You will get much better results from this " over night patch " than you will from any other " acne patch " for pimples . <p> This medicated " foundation " might be ok for oily skin , but will probably make dry skin look worse . <p> Clean &amp; Clear Advantages Invisible Acne Patch is n't a coverup for pimples . Its a kind of foundation that you can use to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of makeup . The selling point of this Clean &amp; Clear product is that it provides a medication for the pimple so it can be healed while its concealed . <p> That 's not a bad thing , but the benzoyl peroxide used to heal the pimple does n't  just kill bacteria . It also dries out your skin . You can wind up having flaky makeup over acne that looks , well , strange , not really a pimple , but not smooth skin , either . If you have oily skin this product may work for you , but if you have dry skin , it is better just to use concealer during the day and regular benzoyl peroxide at night . <h> Dr. Blaines ScarCare Gel Pad , 1-Count Boxes ( US $18.99 ) <p> This " pad " is sometimes used as an overnight treatment patch for raised , pink scars caused by the form of acne known as acne keloidalis nuchae .

Also , the adhesive on the patch can cause clogged pores and minor blemishes that can call attention tot the scars you are trying to treat . It may be worth a try if you have acne scars in a convenient location , but Dr. Blaines ScarCare Gel Pad is not the first choice for treating acne scars . Microdermabrasion will give you better results . <p> Here is a product that contains the right ingredient for blackheads . Each Ponds Clear Solutions clear dot contains 2% salicylic acid , a toning and exfoliating beta-hydroxy acid that loosens clumps of dead skin in and around pores so that blackheads can simply fall off your skin the next time you cleanse it . Salicylic acid will also reduce the redness and swelling of pimples , but it wo n't make them disappear overnight .

You might get clear skin in a month , but you are n't  going to get clear skin , especially if you have pimples , in three days or less . <p> Everyones acne solution includes a cleanser . The best cleaners are gentle on the skin . <p> Everyones acne solution includes an exfoliant . Peeling away dead cells from the surface of the skin makes it looser and more flexible and stimulates collagen production that can fill in indented acne scars from the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " nighttime " acne treatment . It is important , however , to protect skin from darkening during the day and to keep pores from being clogged with makeup at night . <p> Moisturizers are a must for dry skin . Even if you have oily skin , you may need a little moisturizer around your eyes . <h> Your Acne Solution Should Make Realistic Promises <p> Even the best acne medications only get rid of about 2/3 of blemishes , over a period of several months . The best acne treatment systems may get rid of about 90% of blemishes over a month or two , although there are certain kinds of acne you just ca n't treat at home ( such as cysts , nodules , and the black and blue spots caused by the hereditary disease onchrosis on Asian skin ) . <p> With the very best home acne treatment products , you may see some whiteheads and blackheads disappear in 48 hours or less , and some pimples disappear in less than a week , but any acne treatment system that promises to make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in a week is just marketing hype . If the promise is that over 95% of users have clear skin in 30 days , that is possible . But it is more believable if the system comes with a one-year money-back guarantee . <p> Whether you buy an acne treatment system , or you buy products on your own , there are certain kinds of products you will definitely need . Here is how you recognize them . <h> Your Acne Solution Should Provide a Cleanser that Works on Your Skin <p> The purpose of cleansers is to let them do the work of keeping your skin free of dirt , grime , soap film , and excess oil . No cleanser is supposed to dry out your skin , because drying out your skin actually makes acne worse . No cleanser is supposed to kill all the bacteria on your skin , because small numbers of bacteria are actually beneficial . They eat excess sebum . <p> And no cleanser is supposed to remove all the oil from your skin . You need some oil to keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritate the skin . It repairs itself by " you guessed it " making even more oil . <p> Your acne care treatment system should provide a cleanser that works for your skin . The cleaners that work best for all types acne-prone skin : <p> Make lathers of tiny bubbles , not big bubbles . <p> Never leave the red . <p> Never make the skin sting or feel tingly ( this is a sign they have destroyed cells in the outer layer of skin ) . <p> Do n't  contain fragrances ( these can dry out the skin ) . <p> Do n't  contain abrasive fibers ( polyethylene beads are OK ) . <p> Get makeup off , if you wear it , with very gentle cleansing . You might need to wipe but you should n't need to rub . <p> The most important thing to remember about your cleanser is that it has to be gentle enough that you do n't  feel it working on your skin , but strong enough to cleanser your skin without your having to do any of the work by rubbing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You just want to avoid cleansers that list alcohol , menthol , or herbal ingredients such as cinnamon , since these can irritate your face . Witch hazel is usually not a good addition to a cleanser , but it is a good addition to a mild skin peel or skin tonic . <h> Your Acne Solution Should Contain a Mild Skin Peel <p> Chemical peels loosen dead cells from the surface of the skin . Skin cells are constantly being created in the lower , basal layers of the skin . They are pushed toward the surface by newer skin cells beneath them , and usually die in about 21 days . Dead skin cells flake and fall off the skin , but sometimes they get stuck on the skin , or worse , they get stuck in the bottom of pores . When dead skin gets mixed with excess sebum , pores get clogged . <p> Skin peels and skin tonics contain small amounts of acids that loosen the " glue " that holds dead skin together . This breaks up clumps of dead skin in pores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkles . The action of the acid also stimulates the growth of collagen in the skin . This supports the skin , fills in pitted acne scars , and increases the rate at which the skin grows , giving it a healthy glow . <p> Unlike cleansers , exfoliants may give you a useful , temporary reddening of the skin . This is not irritation . Its exfoliation . The process is not supposed to burn , but it may sting or tingle . If the stinging or tingling goes on for more than 5 minutes , stop it by rinsing the skin tonic off your skin . <p> If you have oily skin you have trouble cleansing , you should use a skin tonic that is made with salicylic acid . If you have dry skin or oily skin that you keep from getting shiny , then you should use a skin tonic that is made with an alpha-hydroxy acid such as glycolic acid . Do n't  apply the products to broken or inflamed skin , and use them only as often for as long as directed . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> There is nothing your skin needs during the day that it does n't  also need at night , and vice versa . Labeling two different product for daytime and nighttime use , however , can be an easy way to remember to use both of them every day . <p> Sometimes a " daytime " skin care product will contain azelaic acid . This ingredient is a safe skin lightener for all types of skin . It helps prevent brown spots after acne heals . While you could use it anytime of day or night , including it in your daytime skin care is important if you need to make sure it has a chance to protect your skin from darkening by the sun . <p> Sometimes a " nighttime " skin care product will emphasize clean pores . While keeping pores clean is important anytime of day or night , it is especially important to remove makeup at night before going to bed . <h> What About Moisturizer ? <p> If you have skin that looks fresher and more deeply colored right after you wash your face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon , you definitely need a moisturizer . If you have naturally oily skin , however , you may not need a moisturizer unless your skin is exposed to heat and sun , and even then you may only need a little moisturizer at the sides of your face near your eyes . <p> Other acne treatment products are also optional . Not everyone needs a microdermabrasion cloth , although it can help with whiteheads and blackheads . Not everyone needs probiotics " and they are best taken as an oral supplement rather than applied directly to your skin . <p> Buying all the products for your personal acne solution in a single treatment system saves you money " and the best acne care solutions come with a money-back guarantee , Exposed Skin Care . 19923 @qwx879923

Oxy acne products are certainly among the most affordable you can find , but do they really work ? <h> Summary : <p> Oxy acne products are among the most affordably priced skin care products in the world . <p> Oxy acne products that contain benzoyl peroxide , and just benzoyl peroxide , usually work well . <p> Oxy acne products that contain ingredients chosen to appeal to teenage users , such as the herb dragons blood , usually not only do n't  work , they can harm the skin . <p> Some Oxy acne products contain so much alcohol they can dry out the skin . <p> Canadian versions of Oxy products are milder than their US counterparts , but can still be problematic . <p> Always test a small dot of Oxy or another skin care product on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> What Oxy Does Well That Other Acne Products Do n't  <p> Many users who have lots of pimples report that Oxy stops the formation of new pimples almost as soon as you start using it , in just days . And for as little as US $3 a bottle in much of Asia and as little as US $5 a bottle from Amazon , it is almost impossible to find a product that works as well for so little money . <h> What Other Acne Products Do Well That Oxy Does n't  <p> The best known Oxy products work with the power of benzoyl peroxide . If you have skin that is , as one customer puts it " tough as a tank , " benzoyl peroxide is probably nearly the perfect ingredient for fighting acne bacteria . If you have sensitive skin , or if the weather turns unusually hot or unusually cold , or if some of the skin on your face is resistant and some of the skin on your face easily breaks out , Oxy may be too strong for you and other acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creams and gels , or even antibiotics may be better . And if you have issues with allergies , you need to be careful even with Oxy products that do n't  contain benzoyl peroxide . <p> What 's in Oxy that makes it work ? Let 's take a look at the best selling Oxy acne products one by one , examining their pros and cons . <h> Oxy Clinical Clearing Treatment <p> Oxy Clinical Clearing Treatment , with a suggested retail price in the USA of just $8.49 for a 1.25 oz/35 g tube , is advertised as providing clinical results without prescription . Many users find that it really does . The key difference in this Oxy product is that it contains benzoyl peroxide in a microencapsulated form for slow release . <p> Benzoyl peroxide has minimal effectiveness for removing redness and inflammation from the skin . All it really does is to kill acne bacteria . When the bacteria are gone , however , they stop sending out signals that make nearby skin especially sensitive to inflammation , and the skin heals on its own in about two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops . <p> Oxy Clinical Clearing Treatment kills acne faster than other benzoyl peroxide products because it releases this ingredient continuously , instead of just when you place it on your skin . The 5% concentration of benzoyl peroxide in the product is definitely strong enough to make a difference on infected skin , but not so concentrated that most people will not experience stinging , redness , or peeling after using it . It is always a good idea to test a tiny dot of Oxy Clinical Clearing Treatment or any other acne product on the skin of your inner forearm before putting it on your face , just to make sure there are no unexpected irritant effects . <p> This Oxy product also contains shea butter and other antioxidants . The shea butter is a good moisturizer , and offsets any irritation that may be caused by the benzoyl peroxide . The antioxidants sound like a good idea , but since benzoyl peroxide is a pro-oxidant , it is hard to see how they could survive on the skin long enough to do it any good . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as this one . Just use caution if you have extra dry or allergy-prone skin . <h> Oxy Chill Factor Products <p> Oxy Chill Factor products , on the other hand , suffer serious shortcomings . The Oxy Chill Factor Daily Wash , for example , contains 10% benzoyl peroxide . This is the strongest concentration of benzoyl peroxide permitted without a prescription in most countries . It does the skin absolutely no good , unfortunately , because it is rinsed away just seconds after it is placed on the skin . <p> Oxy Chill Factor Daily Cleansing Pads are 46% alcohol . This is enough alcohol to kill some acne bacteria . It is also enough alcohol to kill the linings of the pores in which the acne bacteria live , trapping the surviving bacteria inside the skin , where they can cause nasty nodules and cysts . The tingling action on the skin you feel is the evaporation of alcohol and menthol , both of which can cause the skin to flake and peel . <p> Menthol is the main problem ingredient in Oxy Chill Factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder , which causes lasting irritation to the skin , and sodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate , which can dry it out . Menthol also makes Oxy Clinical Hydrating Therapy Acne Treatment a bad choice for treating acne on dry or any other kind of skin . <h> Oxy Daily Cleansing Pads , Focus : Blackheads <p> Here is a product that contains the right ingredient for removing blackheads , especially from oily skin , salicylic acid , which is a beta-hydroxy acid . The problem with the product is that it contains just 0.2% salicylic acid when 0.5 to 3.0% is probably needed . The Daily Cleansing Pads , Maximum product contains 2% salicylic acid , an amount that would work , except the product is at the wrong pH . The " Maximum " product has the acid at a pH so high it is just a salt after it is placed on the skin . The " Maximum " product also contains 50% alcohol , enough to dry out and irritate the skin . <h> Oxy Face Wash Acne-Fighting Formula <p> Oxys acne-fighting formula contains an herbal extract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dragons blood . While this probably sounds " awesome " to some teenaged users , the herb really does not have anything to offer for fighting acne . In fact , it can make acne a lot worse . <p> A pure extract of this herb acts something like an instant bandage when it is placed on the skin . That 's great if you have a cut or a scrape . That 's the exact opposite of what you want when you are treating acne . After all , you want clogged pores to empty . This herb just traps oil and acne bacteria inside them . And even worse , the face wash contains a strong detergent that would irritate the skin before the dragon blood extract sealed bacteria in it . <h> Oxy Face Wash Acne Treatment , Sensitive <p> Here is an Oxy face wash that really is a great product for sensitive , inflammation- or allergy-prone skin . The only significant active ingredient in the formula is 5% benzoyl peroxide . This might be a little too much benzoyl peroxide for extremely sensitive skin , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential side effects of benzoyl peroxide worse . Always test a dot of this or any other product on the skin of your inner forearm , leaving it there for at least 8 hours , to make sure it is safe for your face . <h> Other Oxy Acne Products <p> Oxys after-shaves for men who have acne make the skin tingle , but that tingling is just a signal that they are irritating the skin . Oxy shaving cream contains enough benzoyl peroxide to kill some acne bacteria , but it also contains a combination of coconut oil and emollients that sticks on the skin and can clog pores . <p> If you live in Canada , you can buy Spot Treatment Acne Fighting Gel Formula . This formula contains dragon blood ( the herb ) and alcohol , like Oxy Face Wash Acne-Fighting Formula . Even though this product only contains half as much alcohol as the American version , it still only traps inflammation in the skin . <p> I do n't  use Oxy any more because the chemicals were too harsh for my skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried them . I 've used Citrus Clear and instead of acne lasting for DAYS , they go away very quickly . I had one that was gone the next morning . Very surprised at how well this works .

@@98778894 @2978894/ <h> Acne Remedies Throughout History 19922 @qwx879922 <p> Have you ever seen a classic portrait of someone with acne ? Why is it that paintings from 300 plus years ago exclude those troublesome bumps ? Did our ancestors know something about skin care that we do n't know ? Did painters look past these blemishes and use the first form of picture editing ? Here are some acne home remedies that have been known throughout history . <p> Sulfur and The Egyptians <p> The Egyptians were among the many other cultures that treated acne with sulfur . These early dermatologists were on to something . Sulfur is a natural mineral that dries out existing pimples . Sulfur exfoliates the skin , as well as reducing the oily sheen that your face can sometimes get . Of course the Egyptians were not right about everything . They also believed that if you were breaking out , it was because you were telling lies . <p> Urea " Surprisingly Helpful for Acne <p> A less appealing home remedy that has been used throughout a lot of human history is urine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it or not , it some people still use it as an acne treatment today . It goes without saying that you should keep it away from your eyes and mouth , but putting a Q-tip in urine and dabbing it on your face can help prevent breakouts . Urine has urea , which helps exfoliate and break down the keratin in your skin . Many people also find that using urine as a cosmetic product brings out a natural glow in their skin . <p> Spot Treating with Honey <p> Honey is another product that has been used for hundreds of years as a natural acne remedy . The Egyptians used honey as a spot treatment . Honey works as a natural cleanser , and gets rid of the bacteria built up in the pores . Honey is packed with antioxidants , which can help reduce the inflammation that is associated with acne . Masks today stay on from about ten to fifteen minutes , and pullout all the dead skin and bacteria . Honey works much quicker because it is already sticky , so it pulls out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oil vs Benzoyl Peroxide <p> The Australians have used tea tree oil for years . Tea tree oil has antifungal , antiviral and antibacterial properties that help it fight stubborn acne . In 1990 there was a study that showed a solution of 5% tea tree oil was just as effective at reducing acne as a solution of 5% benzoyl peroxide .
